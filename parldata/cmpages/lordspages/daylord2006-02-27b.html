<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spopq0"></a></font><b> Lord Ahmed </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether any United Kingdom officials were involved in the treatment of 28 Pakistani terrorist suspects in Greece following the 7 July London bombings.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, as my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary said on 13 December 2005, there is no truth in the reports that UK officials have taken part in or been present at any alleged maltreatment of terror suspects in Greece.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Ahmed: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his reply. Did he read the reports in British newspapers that suggested that 5,400 Muslims were questioned by the Greek authorities as a result of a wrong telephone number supplied by the British intelligence services? Were the Greek authorities right to name the 45 year-old British agent who was supposed to have been present when 28 Pakistanis were allegedly tortured by the Greek authorities?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I told the House that we had no involvement whatever and that it was completely untrue to suggest that we did. I regard it as unfortunate, to put it at its mildest, that anybody should name officials of the United Kingdom in an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_2"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

allied country; that is deplorable. I have read newspaper stories on the matter and think them fanciful and fiction.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Falkner of Margravine: </b>   My Lords, given that the Foreign Secretary indeed called the reports utter nonsense on 13 December but that since the beginning of the new year there have been persistent reports in British newspapers, apparently corroborated by British officials, that British intelligence agents were present at the interrogations in Greece, is the Intelligence and Security Committee inclined to look at these matters, so that we can carry out our own investigations? The Greek authorities have now embarked on full and formal investigations. I understand that the chairman of the committee in the other place, Paul Murphy, has indicated that he will look into the allegations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, it is the right of committees to look at matters at which they choose to look and to address any questions that they wish to address to the Government; I would be the last person to try to dissuade them from doing so. However, I repeat&#151;I cannot say it in any more unambiguous terms&#151;that there has been fanciful, inaccurate and seriously damaging reporting that bears no relation to the truth.

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="60227-01_time0"></a><h5>2.39 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Goodlad </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What proportion of the profits from the privatisation of QinetiQ will be reinvested in defence.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  My Lords, the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence have agreed that the MoD will be able to retain &#163;250 million of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_3"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

receipts from the QinetiQ IPO, which represents 72 per cent of the total net receipt for reinvestment in the defence programme.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Goodlad: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Is he aware that the defence industrial strategy acknowledges that we are living off past Ministry of Defence research investment, which has almost halved in the past few years, and says that in the coming decades the United Kingdom could fall behind our key allies and emerging economies in our ability to support sophisticated and competitive technology-based industries? Will the Minister assure the House that the current underinvestment in defence research will now be reversed?
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is correct in that the defence industrial strategy highlighted some important new research, showing the direct correlation between defence capability and research going back over 30 years. In carrying out that strategy, we have further highlighted the importance of investment in research. This year, the department is looking at the whole gamut of research undertakings that we fund and intends to publish the technology strategy for research this year, addressing the very point that the noble Lord raises.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Garden: </b>   My Lords, the Armed Forces Pay Review Body report was slipped out as usual just before the recess under a Written Statement. It gives a great description of the problems in military manning and so on. Will the Minister undertake to use the QinetiQ windfall to address the urgent problem that the Secretary of State, Dr Reid, has recognised? He is quoted in the report as saying that the living accommodation for the services is worse than anything else in the services&#039; welfare package. Will the Minister use the funds to address that problem?
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, I shall resist the temptation to move off the subject of QinetiQ into wider matters of defence and simply answer that the funds from the proceeds of the QinetiQ IPO, which will be reinvested in defence, have not been earmarked. They will go into the defence budgeting process to be used in the normal way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Robertson of Port Ellen: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend the Minister on getting a pretty good deal from the Treasury over the IPO for QinetiQ. Not everybody gets a good deal from the Treasury. As the Defence Secretary who made the decision in principle to put part of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency into the private sector, my decision has been well and truly vindicated by events since then. The expertise and knowledge base that was invested in DERA is now coming to the fore and can be exploited not only for the benefit of this year&#039;s defence budget but for the country as a whole.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his comments and for allowing me to raise the general point that the process that the Government have undertaken with this reform has been vindicated in the success of the recent IPO of QinetiQ. This is a long-term process going back a number of years, but it has shown that an underinvested government research institution has been turned into a world-class business. It has been done in a way that has leveraged expertise from the private sector, and in doing so, has created something that can really deliver the research and equipment that our Armed Forces need. In the process, it has created more than &#163;1 billion in value for the British taxpayer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Astor of Hever: </b>   My Lords, what veto or influence will the MoD have over QinetiQ providing research and evaluation for foreign governments or companies?
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, we retain a golden share in QinetiQ, which gives us the opportunity to veto any transactions that we do not regard as being consistent with the British interest.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, it is true that the Treasury has been very kind to the MoD in this regard, but will my noble friend concede that in future it should have no bearing on any other privatisation proceeds, which must necessarily go to the department concerned?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, I do not wish to comment on further privatisations. Suffice it to say that the process used here is the staged process of privatisations, which has learnt lessons from the past. The costs of the QinetiQ IPO are the lowest of any privatisation that has taken place in the past 10 years, which is a good model for the approach in future privatisations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister give an absolute assurance that the Government&#039;s golden share will not be disposed of at some future date, as has been done in so many other privatised industries?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60227-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, it is not possible to give an absolute assurance, but we have absolutely no intention of relinquishing our golden share in QinetiQ.
</p>

<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Attlee: </b>   My Lords, how do we avoid duplicating research that is already being done by our other defence partners?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, that is exactly why we have set out the defence industrial strategy, to ensure that we have real transparency in our defence priorities for both our industrial and international partners. We are going to build on that this year with our defence technology strategy, giving further clarity to avoid the problems to which the noble Lord alludes.

<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="60227-02_time0"></a><h5>2.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What steps they are taking to prevent transport trade unions taking industrial action during the London 2012 Olympic Games.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Government, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and the Olympic Delivery Authority are committed to working co-operatively with the trade unions, Transport for London and transport operators. Our shared goal is to ensure that new infrastructure is delivered on time and on budget and that networks operate smoothly and effectively.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that reply. I wonder whether it has come to his attention that the leader of the RMT trade union has already asked for a special payment for staff not to disrupt the Olympics. Will he comment on the fact that, as the London Underground is a public service, it should be placed under the same restrictions as the police and be bound to go to binding arbitration by ACAS rather than call its members out on strike? Does he believe that they should not go on strike unless 50 per cent of the workforce vote for it, rather than the small proportion of them who are trade union members, in a vote which no doubt will be subject to intimidation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the House will have noticed the noble Lord&#039;s illiberal contribution to industrial relations. I disagree with almost everything he said except for the necessity of ensuring that good industrial relations obtain over that period. As for the noble Lord&#039;s reference to the opening shot of the general secretary of the RMT, the obvious point is that it was merely a reflection of the fact that at the Sydney Olympics a deal had been reached where there was some extra consideration during the games. I have no doubt that the unions will set out their store of behalf of their members as best they can.
</p>

<a name="60227-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>We are six years away from the Olympic Games, and there will be major negotiations with the trade unions well before that time. It is not adding to the common weal in which we all share with regard to the Olympic Games to discuss such issues now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may follow the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. It is not just in six years&#039; time that the people of London will face an Underground strike; they face one this Wednesday. To follow that up&#151;perhaps one could temper it a bit&#151;in the recent RMT ballot regarding this week, 884 members were in favour of a strike, 470 were against, and 1,080 favoured action short of a strike. That is out of a total membership of 5,000. So, 884 out of 5,000 members were dictating that there should be a strike this Wednesday. Surely that does not augur well for what might happen in six <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_6"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

years&#039; time. Should we do not something about that and ensure that there is a real majority for any strike action, even if the Government still want to allow it? Will the Minister give a further answer to amplify what he has just said?
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, of course I am going to accept advice from the party opposite on how to conduct industrial relations, given the contrast between our figure of only 215,000 days lost in the past year and the number of days lost under previous administrations, which were never less than double that. Our present industrial relations record in days lost is the best since records began. So I do not think that we need lectures on the point. Even if we did and I accepted that the noble Lord was trying to help in the long run, does the House think that it would be valuable to receive such contributions when negotiations are being conducted this very day?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the many thousands of volunteers who took part in Sydney by helping to direct people to transport and so on? In negotiations regarding the Olympics there was never any question of treading on the unions&#039; toes or vice versa. The whole thing created enormous good will, which will be very important in the success of our Olympics here.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the first constructive voice this afternoon with regard to the games in 2012. The Olympic Games in Sydney involved a huge amount of volunteer work and enjoyed very good industrial relations. All workers contributed to the success of those games. We want to learn from that experience and emulate it where it is good, but we also think that we can effect improvements. However, where the noble Baroness recommends that we examine the record on the contribution of volunteers, I am with her wholeheartedly and so are the Government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Hamilton of Epsom: </b>   My Lords, I am another unconstructive voice. Does the noble Lord have a massive contingency fund to meet what will obviously be enormously increased costs above those originally envisaged?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, we have devoted very substantial resources to the Olympic Games, as the noble Lord will recognise. We have absolutely no reason to expect that those resources will be insufficient to put on the best games that have been enjoyed in recent times.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that one cannot amend trade union law on the hoof and that it can be done only by primary legislation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the noble Lord&#039;s contribution, which has reminded us all that these are delicate, difficult and long-term <br>&nbsp;<br>

issues. I merely want to emphasise that it is best at present to leave the negotiators to deal with local difficulties while reaching agreements in due course that guarantee the security of the games.

<a name="time_2"></a>
<a name="60227-02_time1"></a><h5>2.53 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_3"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Ezra </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_3"></a>What short-term measures they are taking to secure energy supplies pending the completion of the energy review.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Government have been working intensively with Ofgem, the National Grid, industry and key stakeholders over many months on short-term security of supply issues. It remains the case that the National Grid has forecast that under all credible scenarios the market will be able to maintain energy supplies to domestic consumers and to most small businesses and public sector organisations during this winter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Ezra: </b>   My Lords, I note what the Minister has just told us, but, although the Government have launched their consultation document into longer-term energy policy, is it not a fact that the short-term situation is rapidly deteriorating, with soaring prices, consequential increases in fuel poverty, depletion of North Sea oil reserves faster than was expected and numerous market distortions both here and abroad? In those circumstances, should the Government not issue a document that indicates clearly what short-term measures they are taking to secure supplies, to deal with increased fuel poverty, to deal with the problem of market distortions and, in general, to allay public fears, which are very keenly felt during this short-term period?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60227-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is right to identify that there are short-term problems that will last through the remainder of this winter and into next winter. He will also recognise that the Government have pursued a range of strategies to guarantee that we get through these two difficult winters effectively and that in the longer term we guarantee security and generosity of supply. He has identified a number of issues, varying from those with which the Government can deal immediately&#151;such as communication to consumers on how to get the best deal for the energy that they secure&#151;to changes in the operation of the European market, which have necessitated a direct approach from the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. A wide range of issues is involved but, as I have said to the House on previous occasions, the Government are active in every respect.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60227-03.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Tomlinson: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that we have been promised the outcome of the energy review during 2006 but that that could be one <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 8</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

month away or 10 months away? Will he help the House by giving us with greater precision some idea of when we might expect it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the important thing is that the review considers all the issues in full and effectively and gets the long-term energy supplies of this country right. We are talking about decades. It is not a question of rushing out a review. It is important that we have recognised that we have had difficulties this winter that will obtain next winter too and that we are attending to those issues immediately. The long-term issues to which my noble friend refers are the subject of the review, and that is not an issue to be rushed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </b>   My Lords, are the Government hoping for lower gas prices arising from the intervention of the European Union Competition Commissioner, according to her report of the 16th of this month? Do the Government recognise that there are formidable institutional obstacles to the liberalisation of the gas markets on the Continent and that the process is likely to take years rather than months? Are the difficulties that the Minister is facing, which the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, so graphically described, due far more to inadequate government planning and incentives than to any continental obstruction?
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I do not accept that. Whenever the noble Lord identifies what the Government could do constructively, it generally relates to issues that will bear fruit only in years to come. The problem that we have is the rapid rundown of North Sea supplies, which will occasion difficulties over the next 18 months. In those areas, the Government have been exceedingly active. I accept entirely his point that reforming the European energy market is a long haul. However, I indicated clearly that as soon as we had identified the key imperfection with regard to that market the Government&#039;s action was forthright and immediate and triggered immediate responses from the European Commission.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend confirm that the Government are seriously considering resuscitating the deep mine coal industry in this country, together with methods of gaining better clean coal technology?
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I hate to say it but the Question is about the short-term. The noble Lord&#039;s point involves the long-term and fits into the review to which I have alluded. We will look at what coal can contribute to the long-term energy needs of this country, although the noble Lord will recognise that the recovery of pits that have been lost is in almost every case an uneconomic proposition. The Question <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_9"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 9</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is about the short-term, which I have defined as this winter and next. That strategy is rather longer-term than that addressed by the Question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   My Lords, as the Minister said, the Question is about the short term. What is the Government&#039;s planning figure for deaths from hypothermia this winter?
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Government do not plan deaths. What we do is guard against fuel poverty which, especially for pensioners, makes a significant contribution to deaths in harsh winters. That is why we have the fuel allowance of &#163;200, which has been paid this winter. That is why we pay an extra allowance to the over-80s; and why we are concerned to circulate the maximum amount of information to all members of the public about how they can constrain energy costs at this difficult time by responding to market opportunities. We all know that transferring from a high-cost provider to a lower-cost one can save families money. However, I hasten to add that we all worry about hypothermia and its contribution to deaths in this country. Ever since we came to power, the Government have regarded fuel poverty as a major issue to be tackled.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   My Lords, on the review, does the Minister agree that the Government&#039;s decision to engage in a refurbishment of every secondary school and half of all primary schools during the next decade provides a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate the best standards of fuel economy and efficiency?
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, in all government investment programmes, such as that for schools, which involve investment in new energy provision, we look to the costs in the market. There is no doubt&#151;we all recognise this&#151;that the period of cheap energy for this country based on our indigenous supplies, especially North Sea oil and gas, is largely over. The remaining reserves under our control are extremely expensive to exploit. So I entirely accept the Government&#039;s obligation to look at energy costs as a critical figure in investment programmes such as the one identified by the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Marsh: </b>   My Lords, further to that, does the Minister recognise that the days of deep-mined coal have long since gone because of competition from countries with massive open-cast mines with which we cannot conceivably compete?
</p>

<a name="60227-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, we have for a long time seen foreign coal imported because it has been advantageous compared to British indigenous supplies, even with drift mines and surface mining. Of course, we have some coal reserves, which will play their part in energy supplies.

<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that it is important in both the short and long term that issues involving the efficient use of energy receive attention at least equal to that given to the source and supply of energy? Will he assure the House that that will indeed be a major feature of the energy review?
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, it certainly will. There is no doubt that we must concern ourselves with the carbon imprint of our energy industries. We cannot hit our targets for the necessary reduction in carbon dioxide production without revision of how our energy is used. My noble friend also emphasised that we must look at ways of using energy efficiently and even, in certain areas, reducing the amount of energy consumed. That is an important part of the review.

<a name="60227-03_spnew14"></a><b> Viscount Montgomery of Alamein: </b>   My Lords, on the question of the longer term, will the Minister ensure that sufficient weight is given to nuclear fusion, on which a great deal of basic research is still needed?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, nuclear power will be part of the energy review. That is why I was somewhat reluctant earlier to suggest that the review could be rushed. We need to consider all options, some of which involve the analysis of long-term research provision, which can lead to new technologies, not only in the field of nuclear power, which the noble Viscount identified. These are big issues. The review will consider energy supply over decades, and it should be recognised that we need to consider those issues fully.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Ezra: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, although coal is generally a long-term issue, as he said, there are nevertheless certain short-term problems? First, surface mining in this country is being held up by the presumption against it in MPG3, which has been issued to local authorities. Secondly, three mines&#151;Harworth, Rossington and Hatfield&#151;are threatened with being mothballed and taken out of production unless there is urgent intervention. Would the Minister care to comment?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the three mines are in danger because it is costly to produce the coal that they are producing now, even at a time of very high energy costs and when coal prices have also risen, although not as rapidly as gas prices have. Of course I recognise the point about the short term. We envisage a growth in surface mining in this country, but noble Lords will recognise that the surface mining of coal has a significant impact on the local environment and that we must have due regard to the future of our environment.

<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="60227-03_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Strathclyde: </b>   My Lords, I wish to draw to the attention of the House the fact that this morning I notified the Leader of the House that I wanted to ask the following Private Notice Question:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;To ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government if, in view of recent statements to the media by government Ministers, they will indicate to the House what are their future plans with regard to police on the House of Lords&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="60227-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Imagine my surprise when I discovered that this Question had been turned down on the basis that it was not an urgent matter. Will the Leader of the House say what, on Saturday afternoon, made the Government brief the BBC and newspapers on the future of the House of Lords? Will she also say what made the Lord Chancellor break his engagements on Sunday and urgently go to the BBC studios to give an interview on the future of your Lordships&#039; House when it is not sufficiently urgent to give a statement in this very House this afternoon? I am asking the Leader of the House not to reverse her decision now, although that would be a perfectly fair thing for her to do, but to consider very carefully whether she took the right decision and whether she believes that this House should be told before the media what the Government have in mind on the future of this House&#151;an issue that is extremely important to every Member of your Lordships&#039; House.

<a name="60227-04_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, it is normal if the Member in question does not like the answer that he or she was given. This House may recall that when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and his committee looked at the speakership of this House, I was clear that this area should be transferred to an independently elected Speaker of this House. In my view, I have handled every Private Notice Question put to me, bearing in mind the needs of the House rather than the needs of the Government. I can see that this issue is of interest to the House, but I cannot see why this issue urgently requires an answer this afternoon. This House has just taken three years to make a decision on whether it wants an independent Speaker. I hate to say it, but it has taken many more years than that to move to the first stage of House of Lords reform. What is of sufficient urgency today? I fail to see it.

<a name="60227-04_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I have no idea of the answer to that. I have not looked at the number of Private Notice Questions historically which have been asked on House of Lords reform and the extent to which those Questions were answered. I do not see that as my role. My role, on behalf of the House, is to consider whether a Question is of sufficient urgency. I make a distinction between that and the interest which this House may have in an issue such as the House of Lords and the issue of urgency. My job is to look at the <i>Companion</i> and to consider the Question.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_14"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>Clause 41 refers to the Secretary of State drawing up lists of organisms and types of habitat, which is a good idea. However, the clause refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;organisms and types of habitat . . . of principal importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>I would argue that when we consider biodiversity or ecosystems, it is hard to see that any one part is unnecessary and therefore not of principal importance. For example, the small organism at the bottom of the food chain, which may not in the opinion of the Secretary of State be of principal importance, still plays its part. Meanwhile the animal at the top of the food chain, sometimes ourselves or perhaps the big raptors or cats and similar types of creature, depends on the chain holding all the way through. So where this clause refers to &quot;principal importance&quot;, I believe it is simply wrong. It is wrong because everything must be considered to be of equal importance in creating both the food chain and contributing to the ecosystem.
</p>

<a name="60227-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>I take by way of example what it takes to create a fertile soil in woodland. The soil is created by the action of small insects such as ants breaking down leaf matter. Does the Secretary of State consider ants in woodland to be of principal importance? So the word &quot;principal&quot; as it is used in this clause demonstrates that the Government are not thinking correctly about the lists they intend to draw up. On habitats, surely we have lists of principal importance in the SSSIs and in all the European designations of habitats that are already in place. I wonder whether the energy and expense put into drawing up further lists is energy and expense well used.

</p>

<a name="60227-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>In conclusion, I return to a matter that we have discussed previously in Committee. The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology is to suffer a drastic across-the-board cut for exactly this type of work&#151;maintaining lists and building databases. As I understand it, that is exactly the sort of record keeping that the Government are now proposing to introduce in Clause 41, except that, in the past, the work recognised the wholeness of the ecosystem and the wholeness of biodiversity. Work was done to build very broad databases and in-depth studies were carried out on particular species. This clause, as drafted, takes away that ability and makes us concentrate solely on points that the Secretary of State regards as of &quot;principal importance&quot;. I believe that that is entirely the wrong way of thinking. I shall be interested to hear the Minister explain why there is such wording in the Bill. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="60227-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I have much sympathy with this amendment. The clause as drafted is a typical example of the Government over-gilding their legislation. As a young, novice farmer I well remember the introduction of hormone weedkillers. They were introduced to kill extremely common, pernicious weeds which grew then in all cereal crops. Those weeds were also hosts to many insects which were the main food for a variety of wild animals. The English partridge, in particular, comes to mind. Effectively, within five years of the introduction of hormone weedkillers, it disappeared in this country.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_15"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 15</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>We cannot foretell the future, but what is sure is that none of the weeds killed by those hormone weedkillers would ever have appeared on a list of &quot;principal importance&quot; as put forward in this clause. They were just extremely common, pernicious weeds. The fact is that technology moved on and we found a way of ridding our fields of a particularly difficult problem in relation to agricultural production, a side effect of which was that a bird that had previously been common across most of the countryside effectively disappeared. The use of the word &quot;principal&quot; is, in my view, completely superfluous. The noble Baroness is right to table the amendment and I believe the Government need to consider the position very carefully.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="60227-05_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I have a couple of questions for the Minister. I am not sure that I fully support the principle of the amendment. If the word &quot;principal&quot; is removed, there is then the question of what is or is not included and so lists will be never ending. I realise that the Government have a problem here.
</p>

<a name="60227-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>Clause 41 states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;the Secretary of State must consult Natural England&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Will the research work mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, at Monks Wood and at other centres be included in the contribution that is made before the Secretary of State makes a decision? If the Secretary of State does not like the recommendations that come from those two places, will they be totally ignored?
</p>

<a name="60227-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Another question concerns these wonderful centres that the Government are no longer willing to fund. My honourable friend Peter Ainsworth and another colleague visited Monks Wood recently and were shown the valuable work that is undertaken there. When Natural England is set up as an independent body, will it be possible for it to give money to Monks Wood and the other centres that Defra is proposing to close?
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="60227-05_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   Clause 41 replaces and reflects what is in subsections (2) to (5) of Section 75 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act and places a duty on the Secretary of State to publish, review and revise lists of living organisms and types of habitat in England that in her opinion are of principal importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity. The amendment seeks to extend those lists to include all living organisms and habitats that are of importance to the conservation of biodiversity. If we are to conserve and protect our biodiversity effectively, it is vital that we direct action to the habitats and species that need help most. The Government are committed to having regard to all biodiversity as outlined in Clause 40 of the Bill, and we will continue to take that commitment seriously. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, recognised, we also need to be able to target total action, including the issues of the food chain for endangered species, specifically on those species and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_16"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 16</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

habitats that are a particular priority for conservation of biodiversity. We are also committed to halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010.
</p>

<a name="60227-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>We must target action. For that reason we published a list of species and habitats that are of principal importance under Section 74 of the CROW Act and focused attention on those species and habitats as a result. As I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, will recognise, that has contributed to the successes of many species and habitats such as those for the bittern, the field cricket, otters and cereal field Martians&#151;sorry, cereal field margins, and the English partridge. I apologise; I do not think we are protecting Martians at the moment. We continue to take action to benefit those widespread species and habitats for which targeted action is not sufficient. A new planning policy statement on biodiversity and geological conservation, a new policy on ancient and native woodland and a substantial increase in investment in water and wetland management for wildlife are part of the third annual stock take of progress. We will continue to build on that.
</p>

<a name="60227-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>I do not wish to enter the debate on the future of CEH, which has been brought up before. I should like to write to noble Lords on that matter at this stage. The priority species and habitats are those identified as of principal importance in the list whose publication is required by the Bill. The amendment would still require lists of important living organisms and habitats to be published, so I am not quite clear what the noble Baroness is seeking to achieve with her amendment. We prefer to specify that they comprise those organisms and habitats that are of principal importance to the conservation of biodiversity, but take fully into account the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and both noble Baronesses, that, with regard to some species, that may include the whole food chain, because it is obviously impossible to protect a particular creature if you are going to kill off all its natural food. The Secretary of State must have regard to the advice she is given about this. I hope I have covered all the points. On the CEH, I shall to write to the noble Baroness.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="60227-05_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   The Minister has given a very good explanation of the reasons for government action to try to improve biodiversity. What we are arguing about here is the use of a particular word in a particular clause in a particular way. The truth is that we really do not know, in intimate detail, enough about what makes biodiversity work. There are a whole host of relationships wrapped up in it, which could be argued to be competitive or symbiotic. The truth is that it is a combination of such relationships. The use here of the word &quot;principal&quot; implies that one can be selective within that. Of course there are things that can be done to improve biodiversity; essentially, this is a programme of restoring areas of uncultivated bits of ground, which have not been interfered with.
</p>

<a name="60227-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The difficulty with this whole area is the interference introduced by man. We are not doing specific things with specific species; we are providing opportunities for nature to take over again, in a limited way, in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_17"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 17</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

particular areas. This may take the form of field margins, or what I would call &quot;bug strips&quot; across the middle of very large fields. These are areas where we are permitting nature to take over again. What happens in those areas will be nothing to do with the Secretary of State or indeed any official of Defra. It will be a matter of good fortune as nature claws its way back into the countryside. You can do that without this sort of wording. That is the problem I have with the clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="60227-05_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I listened with great interest to what my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith said, and I have a great deal of sympathy with it. However, I think the idea that nature itself is simply going to come good, without man&#039;s interference, is perhaps a little optimistic. I speak in my capacity as president of the Game Conservancy Trust, which has probably done more than any other organisation to restore habitats, not just for game birds, but for a whole range of other species. Indeed, the beetle banks and conservation headlands derive from the work of the Game Conservancy Trust. I acknowledge that nature plays a big part, but it is the interface between man and nature, and prescribed management systems, that have led to the success we are having at the moment with the restoration of wild flowers, weeds and insects generating the sort of biodiversity response we want. I am simply saying that it is not down to nature alone: it is the interface between man and nature.
</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="60227-05_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I agree with almost everything that every noble Lord has said in this short debate. I think we are into a question of semantics, in the context of focusing attention on a particular area, and whether we have the right wording to achieve the end.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="60227-05_spnew6"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   Will the Minister say in writing&#151;which I think she suggested that she would do&#151;whether there is a methodology for measuring biodiversity used by Defra, if so what it is, and whether we can have a look at it? As my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith said, biodiversity operates at many different levels&#151;at a national level, in a piece of ground of 1.5 hectares or even in a garden. Without some methodology for measuring what is happening, I am not sure that we shall get very far with biodiversity.

However, that is not mentioned in the clause, which includes the words, &quot;principal importance&quot;.

<a name="60227-06_spnew2"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose </b>   moved Amendment No. 282:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>Page 16, line 22, at beginning insert &quot;Having obtained a search warrant from a court,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>The noble Duke said: In moving Amendment No. 282 I wish to speak also to Amendment No. 288.
</p>

<a name="60227-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Clause 43 makes it crystal clear that pesticides declared by the Secretary of State to be harmful to wildlife will not necessarily be illegal in any other context. Hence an inspector entering premises in search of those pesticides will, in effect, be saying, &quot;I believe these prescribed substances are within these premises and I believe they are being used against wildlife&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60227-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Under the terms of Clause 43 it will not be legal for an inspector to enter premises in search of these prescribed substances unless he believes they are being used illegally. There is a world of difference between an inspector entering, say, a farm and demanding to search a barn because he is seeking illegal pesticides, for instance, alfa chlorose&#151;and a barn would be quite a good place to find some if any were present in the area&#151;and that same inspector entering the farm and demanding access to all the land and buildings because he believes that certain pesticides are present and are or have been used against wildlife. In effect the burden of proof will not be possession, it will be usage. The purpose of the search is necessarily linked to the usage charge. We believe that in those circumstances possession of a search warrant is a minimum requirement.
</p>

<a name="60227-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>In another place my honourable friend James Paice raised the question of a six month delay in implementation to deal with publicity. How do the Government propose to publicise the changes that this clause will make to the keeping of particular pesticides, not just by gamekeepers but also by members of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

general public? As this Bill stands, under Amendment No. 288 the Secretary of State may list pesticides which are harmful to wildlife, and that no one may have in their possession until he can prove that he has it in connection with one or more specified purposes. Any person authorised by the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales is to be classed as an inspector and will have the right to enter any premises, which means the same as all premises, to seek out listed pesticides.

</p>

<a name="60227-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>We have seen many Defra Bills, but I cannot recall one where the definition of &quot;premises&quot; did not exclude private dwellings. In fact, Schedule 5 to this very Bill&#151;on page 58, which deals with group 1 offences, and on page 59, which deals with group 2 offences&#151;contains the words:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;Nothing in this section confers power to enter a dwelling&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>and,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;paragraph (c) does not confer any power to enter a dwelling&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>This exclusion should extend on the face of the Bill to the definition of premises for the purposes of Clause 44.
</p>

<a name="60227-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>At the sixth sitting in Committee in another place, the Minister, Jim Knight, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;If it is a door to a dwelling, they must have a warrant from a justice of the peace, but if it is a gate to premises, such as to land or to a shed, they can go in and inspect&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee A, 28/6/05; col. 187.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>As the Minister stated that in Committee, I am surprised that the Bill as it stands does not clarify the situation for private dwellings.
</p>

<a name="60227-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>When opening the debate on Clause 48 in another place, my honourable friend Jim Paice said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;I make it absolutely clear that the Opposition condemn anybody who uses poison to kill birds of any species . . . It is already an offence to set poison for a bird and has been for 24 years&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee A, 28/6/05; col. 162.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The Minister will not be surprised when I express our concerns that Clause 43 as it stands reverses the burden of proof. In this instance, a person is guilty of an offence if he has in his possession a pesticide containing an ingredient that is prescribed for the purposes of this section. The onus is clearly on the individual to prove that he had just cause to have this particular pesticide and to justify its intended use.
</p>

<a name="60227-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>We are grateful to the Minister for the other government amendments in this group, Amendments Nos. 283 to 285. They are a welcome response to some of the concerns expressed in another place and by outside organisations. However, we still feel that, at the very least, a search warrant should be sought before entering premises is undertaken. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60227-06_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   Before speaking to Amendment No. 285A, which is in this group, I should like to say to the Minister that I have withdrawn Amendments Nos. 281, 286, 287 and 289.

I entirely endorse what my noble friend has just said about this clause. There are real difficulties here that the Government will have to address.
</p>

<a name="60227-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>My Amendment No. 285A deals with the very wide-ranging new powers that the Bill gives to pesticide inspectors. It is important&#151;indeed, essential&#151;that the inspectors carry out their duties with great diligence and proper consideration. The National Farmers Union&#151;and I declare an interest as a member of that body&#151;rightly pointed out in its brief:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;We are concerned that the person who legitimately has a prescribed pesticide may be treated unfairly and penalised.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Therefore, it is essential that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;the interests of legitimate users of pesticides are respected.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>That point is extremely well made. Amendment No. 285A would ensure that such an inspector must have regard to any relevant code of practice. I welcome government Amendment No. 283 and the subsequent amendments, but they do not go far enough; it would be extremely helpful if the code of practice could be adhered to in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60227-06_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I shall raise one other issue. Given that the Government have stated in the Explanatory Notes that they intend to publicise the pesticides that are to be included on the precluded list, could that list be circulated to the relevant representative organisations and notices placed in the appropriate press in addition to it being made available on the Defra website? I ask the noble Lord to consider that request, as it would be extremely helpful.

<a name="60227-06_spnew5"></a><b> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </b>   I am not sure whether this is the right moment to raise this, but when I was listening to the noble Duke moving the amendment I glanced at Clause 43(1), and I think that I have found a misspelling:

<a name="60227-06_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Up until a moment ago I thought that I had the answer to this group of amendments, but the last contribution by the noble Lady has slightly shaken me. Perhaps I will come back to that in due course, but I have a nasty feeling that she is right.
</p>

<a name="60227-06_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>I shall first deal with this important group of amendments. Clause 44, which deals with the powers available to inspectors when investigating the possession offence in Clause 43&#151;which is important&#151;appears to have caused a fair amount of concern throughout its passage through Parliament, as the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_21"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

noble Duke mentioned, much of which we believe to be based on comparisons between this offence under Clause 43 and welfare offences under Defra&#039;s Animal Welfare Bill. Such comparisons are flawed and are not comparing like with like. However, the Government have recognised the overall strength of feeling on this matter, and we have tabled three amendments in an endeavour to go as far as we believe sensible to enshrine safeguards. I will speak to those amendments in a moment, but I will first address the three related non-government amendments to this clause, Amendments Nos. 282, 285A and 288.
</p>

<a name="60227-06_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Amendment No. 282 seeks to restrict the powers of entry available to inspectors when they are investigating the offence of possessing a proscribed pesticide&#151;the Clause 43 offence&#151;by requiring them to have obtained a warrant from a justice of the peace. Let me make it absolutely clear that inspectors acting under this clause do not have powers of entry into private dwellings without first having obtained a warrant from a justice of the peace. By virtue of Clause 44(4), paragraph 7 of Schedule 2 to the Food and Environment Protection Act&#151;I admit that is not the easiest reference in the world&#151;that applies to inspectors enforcing this offence as it does to inspectors operating under Part 3 of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. Paragraph 7 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;An officer may only enter a dwelling for the purpose of performing his functions . . . if a justice has issued a warrant authorising him to enter and search that dwelling.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-06_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>It goes on to list the circumstances in which a justice may issue such a warrant; namely, where an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that there is present in the dwelling anything to which his functions relate and either it is not practicable to communicate with any person entitled to grant entry to the dwelling, or such a person has unreasonably refused entry, or such a person is unlikely to grant it unless a warrant is produced, or the purpose of entry may be frustrated or seriously prejudiced unless an officer arriving at the dwelling cannot obtain immediate access to it.
</p>

<a name="60227-06_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>It would in our view be inappropriate to seek to restrict inspectors&#039; powers of inspection to an even greater degree by requiring them to obtain a warrant before they can enter any premises. &quot;Dwelling houses&quot;, yes of course; but we think that &quot;any premises&quot; goes too far. Pesticide inspectors carrying out enforcement activities under their existing powers under the FEPA are already allowed entry to land&#151;other than private dwellings&#151;without the need for a warrant. The purpose of the current power is to check that storage and use of pesticides are in compliance with Defra&#039;s Pesticides Safety Directorate approvals. Therefore, we fail to see why this offence should be treated any differently from other pesticides offences in this regard.
</p>

<a name="60227-06_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Amendment No. 285A seeks to introduce a provision for inspectors to have regard to any relevant codes of practice issued by the Secretary of State when exercising their powers. I have thought long and hard about what could possibly justify the power that we were going to take upon ourselves in regard to that. The noble Earl is, in my view, absolutely right. As the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_22"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

wording of his amendment may not be perfect, I invite him to withdraw his amendment today and we will come back at Report with, we hope, agreed wording. He seems to have a good point when he says that, if there is a code of practice, which there is, inspectors should have regard to it. I hope he will accept that we agree with his commonsensical attitude to that.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60227-07.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="60227-07_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   Of course I will do exactly as the Minister suggests.
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="60227-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   We will meet this point again a little later on. I will take the same attitude to it then as I do now.
</p>

<a name="60227-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Amendment No. 288 would amend the entry powers available to inspectors via a different route from that taken by Amendment No. 282. It does so by amending the definition of &quot;premises&quot; in Clause 45. At present, the definition reads:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;&#039;Premises&#039; include land (including buildings), movable structures, vehicles, vessels, aircraft and other means of transport.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>The amendment would add the caveat that &quot;premises&quot; excludes private dwellings. The legal effect would be to exclude the power to enter dwellings altogether, even under warrant. Noble Lords will appreciate that I have already made it clear that, in relation to this offence, an inspector should not be able to enter a person&#039;s home without having obtained a warrant from a court, and there are quite extensive constraints on the circumstances in which an inspector can obtain such a warrant. I think that the Committee will agree that that is right and proper.
</p>

<a name="60227-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>The intention behind Amendment No. 288 might, however, be to go further than I have already stated. Its legal effect would be to exclude the right to enter private dwellings altogether&#151;that is, with or without a warrant. I am sure that that is not what is intended, as a wrongdoer would only have to keep pesticides in his house in order to escape detection. No one wants that to be the case for a moment, but we believe that that would be the effect of Amendment No. 288.
</p>

<a name="60227-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Clause 44 as it stands contains sufficient safeguards to make this amendment unnecessary. I appreciate the positive motive behind the amendment, but its actual effect would go further than it would be appropriate to accept. However, we are sympathetic to the concerns expressed by noble Lords about the rights of the individual who might face investigation for a pesticide possession offence. As we said in another place, inspectors&#039; powers would be looked at carefully over the Recess. That further consideration has now resulted in the introduction of the three government amendments referred to. These amendments clarify the powers available to inspectors who are investigating pesticide possession offences under Clause 43. They introduce a condition of reasonable suspicion, remove a power to require a statement of truth, and clarify the rights of the person in the event that a substance is seized from the premises. The amendments ensure an appropriate balance between the powers of the inspectors and an individual&#039;s civil rights.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_23"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 23</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Amendment No. 283 seeks to rule out from the Bill the possibility of speculative visits. A great deal of effort has been expended in finding a form of words which achieves the right balance between protecting the individual&#039;s rights and not constraining inspectors to such a degree that they could not enter unless they believed that a prescribed pesticide would be found on a particular premises. For example, we do not want to prevent inspectors entering where a poisoned bait has been found at or near several properties where pesticides are likely to be used, and it was not certain on which of those properties the pesticide would be found.
</p>

<a name="60227-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>With the amendment, subsection (1) would read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;An inspector may . . . enter any premises if he has reasonable grounds to suspect that he may find there evidence that an offence is being committed under section 43&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>An inspector could therefore be challenged to justify his grounds for suspicion. It should also be borne in mind that any inspectors who investigate a suspected pesticide offence will be operating according to a publicly available code of practice, setting out how inspectors should conduct themselves, and giving details of how to complain should anyone be unhappy with the inspection. I hope that Amendment No. 283, together with a code of practice along the lines of the draft which I am told has recently been lodged in the Library, will go some way towards reassuring Members of the Committee who are anxious about the possibility that landowners may be subject to harassment or unwarranted random visits.
</p>

<a name="60227-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>We have looked closely at the powers available to an inspector once he is on the premises. All the powers in Schedule 2 to FEPA have been scrutinised carefully to see whether any parts could be disapplied with respect to the Clause 43 pesticides offence. As a result of that further scrutiny, Amendment No. 284 removes the ability to require a statement of truth when questioning people about substances found on their premises. I accept that this power is not required, bearing in mind the power to require information already in Clause 44(1)(b). In addition, our existing pesticide inspectors, who act under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, have commented that in practice the power to require &quot;statements of truth&quot; is not commonly used. It was therefore decided that this power could usefully be removed.
</p>

<a name="60227-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>Amendment No. 285 introduces three new subsections which clarify the rights of the person in the event that a substance is seized from his premises as evidence of an offence under Clause 43, by setting out the procedure relating to its retention. This will ensure that property rights are not eroded by the investigation process. A person may make a claim to have the seized substance returned by, for example, providing evidence that he has a defence under Clause 43(3).
</p>

<a name="60227-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The time frame set out in these subsections would allow for a substance to be tested to ascertain whether it contains a prescribed pesticide. If prosecution proceedings are subsequently pursued, the substance may be retained for up to 28 days after the court has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_24"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 24</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

determined the outcome. If proceedings are not pursued and a claim for the substances&#039; return is not received, they may be retained for up to 28 days after the time for bringing such proceedings has expired, and then destroyed or otherwise disposed of. Of course we appreciate the concerns over individual rights that lie behind all the non-government amendments in the group but, as a result of the further changes that we are endeavouring to introduce today, these concerns should by and large be allayed. I am grateful to the noble Earl for his thanks. In due course, I shall move the government amendments.
</p>

<a name="60227-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>I was asked about the time scale generally by the noble Duke, in terms of the list of pesticides to be prescribed. I am advised that &quot;prescribed&quot; is the right expression. The noble Viscount, who sits in his place on the Cross Benches with much experience, nods his head; I am delighted to have to tell the noble Lady that, on this occasion, she is wrong. I thought that she was right for a moment, I have to say.
</p>

<a name="60227-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>The Secretary of State may prescribe pesticides only if she is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient to do so in the interests of protecting wild birds or wild animals from harm. However, no pesticides will be banned by the Bill itself. When it is enacted, a power will be provided for the Secretary of State to make an order when the prescribed pesticide ingredients will be listed. A full consultation will be carried out before any pesticide ingredient is listed on any order, and it is likely to be nine to 12 months before it comes into place. I think the noble Duke was particularly interested in that.
</p>

<a name="60227-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>It is not considered appropriate to ban the possession of all pesticides for obvious reasons. Given the wide-reaching penalties available for that offence, it would be disproportionate to widen the offence in that way. It is important that there is evidence to support the prescription of any pesticide ingredient. I think that that answers the question posed by the noble Duke.

<a name="60227-07_spnew2"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   I thank the Minister for his efforts to answer so many of our wide-ranging questions. So much happens today that many of the issues are grouped together in amendments. We are all particularly grateful that the Minister has agreed to accept the general sense of the amendment of my noble friend Lord Peel on a code of practice. We are also grateful for the government amendments moved by the Minister.
</p>

<a name="60227-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I wonder whether a few words on the face of the Bill would make the question of entry to a private dwelling clearer. I suppose one could say that the public should be aware that if anybody knocks on their door demanding entrance, they could ask to be shown a warrant. I do not know whether people are necessarily geared up on that, or whether the inspector might say, &quot;I am not here under the National Environment and Rural Communities Act; I am quoting from the schedule of the Food or Environmental Protection Act&quot;. It gets a bit complicated.

<a name="60227-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Another thing that interested me from what the Minister said is that the inspector could turn up and say, &quot;I am checking up on the storage and use of pesticides in your premises&quot;, not on whether anybody has poisoned anything locally. There is a government guideline on the storage and use of pesticides that is open to inspection. I should declare an interest as a farmer; I store herbicides. It is possible that my wife might store pesticides for the garden. I suppose I should take the blame for that, but it is always difficult to know whether every little pot and jar has been cleared.

<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="60227-08_spnew1"></a><b> Earl Peel </b>   moved Amendment No. 290:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>Page 17, line 15, at end insert &quot;if there is evidence that the nest was constructed or used within the preceding five years&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>The noble Earl said: The amendment attempts to define the meaning of the word &quot;nest&quot; in this part of the Bill, which refers to the 1981 Act. The birds included in the Bill that reuse their nests are the golden and white-tailed eagle and osprey. The Government have the power to extend the list, and could cover such ground nesting birds as hen harriers or merlins. Such birds tend to return to the same area to nest, but do not necessarily use the same specific nest site. The same applies to the golden eagle. I know of one golden eagle nest in Scotland, where the birds nested for three or four years. Sometimes there is a build-up of parasites in the nest and the birds might move to another site, but it may possibly come back to the original nest site.
</p>

<a name="60227-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>I can see a situation possibly arising where relatively large tracts of heather moorland&#151;I declare an interest as somebody who owns and manages heather moorland in the north of England&#151;could become permanently protected under the Bill, thus prohibiting large areas of heather from being burned because of the protection of nests in that area. In reality, however, if a previous nest has been burnt out or ceased to exist for whatever reason, birds such as merlins and hen harriers will, like most other ground-nesting species, happily readjust and find a nest site nearby. It is important not to be over-restrictive, given the importance of heather burning as a key ingredient of good moor management. The amendment simply tries to bring a reasonable time limit to the restriction. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="60227-08_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I speak to Amendment No. 291, which is grouped with this amendment. It simply adds the swallow to the list of birds which may well reuse their nests&#151;or sites, in which category the swallow would be regarded under this legislation.
</p>

<a name="60227-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I have chosen the swallow in particular because, in Forts Orchard in Chilthorne Domer where I used to live, there was a pair of newly constructed houses. Both houses had swallows&#039; nests constructed on them within a year of being built, which I thought a tremendous triumph&#151;not least for the swallows, which were quite brave. The people in the right-hand house were delighted with the swallows moving in and, despite the swallow droppings all down the front, continued to be delighted to have such a wonderful species choosing to live on their house. The people in the left-hand house, however, felt quite differently about the swallow droppings. Despite the swallows making every effort to lay eggs and hatch their young, the occupants continued to knock down the nests as fast as they were built.
</p>

<a name="60227-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>The swallow is in severe decline, for whatever reason. Perhaps the Minister will have some more information on this from her officials, as my amendment refers particularly about swallows. Going back to what we were saying about biodiversity, any bird&#151;particularly a bird in decline&#151;which reuses its nest in the UK should be worthy of protection. My <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_27"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 27</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendment simply aims to probe the Government as to which birds are protected, which are not and why that is.
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="60227-08_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, it is important to have some guidance from the Government on the point at which a nest becomes an &quot;ex-nest&quot;, as it were. The briefing we received, as the noble Earl, Lord Peel, pointed out, says that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;The amendment seeks to address the issue of the length of time a nest can be unoccupied and still remain a nest&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The briefing goes on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;There is no clear point at which the distinction between a nest and an ex-nest can readily be made&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>When I read this, I was irresistibly reminded of the &quot;dead parrot&quot; sketch in &quot;Monty Python&quot;. One can hear the occupier saying, &quot;This nest is dead, it is kaput, it is finished, it is no longer with us&quot;. The inspector would turn around and say, &quot;The nest is not dead; it is just unused and might be resurrected&quot;. It is extremely important, if the &quot;five years&quot; is correct, that the Minister spells out exactly when a nest becomes an ex-nest.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="60227-08_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I support my noble friend&#039;s amendment. In another place there was some discussion about whether a nest was being used as a nest or whether it was no longer used as a nest and could be used again. I believe that my honourable friend Jim Paice originally suggested three years for that. We have had, as I am sure have other noble Lords, briefings from various organisations on this. The RSPB suggested that a five-year limit would be appropriate. It is not as simple as one might think on the face of it, because it is clearly an offence already for anybody to disturb a prescribed nest and take the eggs or the young ones from it. That provision exists, but it is possible for birds to move to another nest within the close vicinity and maybe vacate that nest for a time and to return to it afterwards.
</p>

<a name="60227-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>I have two other points that I would like to contribute to the debate. The first is on the question of safety. Nests are built in trees. Trees grow old, fall down or need their branches lopping. I am sure the noble Lord would not wish trees to remain unsafe and, as the Bill stands, I understand that it would not be possible for what I call &quot;normal&quot; health and safety precautions to be taken; the same would apply if somebody wanted to re-site a nest so that the general public could view it, which has been done already in one part of the country. It seems a nonsense for the Bill to restrict that being done.
</p>

<a name="60227-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>My third point is on the question of land management, particularly for land managers. I highlight the difficulty with bracken clearance. The noble Baroness will remember very well&#151;she has responded to me&#151;our debates on the difficulty of controlling bracken, particularly in the light of the fact that nowadays we are more worried about under-grazing than we were in the past, and that there will be more bracken which will get stronger and older and become a much more serious problem.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_28"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 28</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I recently received a letter from John Thorley from the National Sheep Association, who followed our discussions on 5 December. He says in his letter that the issue which concerns him is that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;there appears to be uncertainty about whether bracken is carcinogenic and yet my understanding is that it is carcinogenic in three parts . . . the fronds, the spores and the roots.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;There is then the issue of animals eating it and again it is known that it is poisonous to cattle and sheep and whereas, as I understand it, very young shoots do little damage, the mature plant is quite toxic&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>The question was discussed in another place, although I have opened it slightly further. It is a point we would like the Baroness to clarify when she responds. Those on these Benches do not want to condone anybody wrecking nests. There is no question of that, but we want greater clarification. I support my noble friend.

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="60227-09_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I will deal first with the last points of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. I can work only on the basis of somebody who is not personally able to establish whether it is true that bracken causes cancer or has damaging properties in relation to people or animals. I would be grateful if any correspondence could be directed to me so that I can get the department to look at it; I wrote to those who took part in the debate at Starred Questions on that subject. I would very happily look at any further evidence.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>These two amendments relate to Clause 46, which seeks to extend the protection afforded to nests of birds which reuse their nests. Amendment No. 291 seeks to add four species to the new Schedule ZA1, which lists those birds whose nests may not be taken, damaged or destroyed at any time during the year. Amendment No. 290 seeks to limit this protection to a maximum of five years.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>If I can take the second amendment first, the additional species proposed for inclusion are the red-billed chough, peregrine falcon, barn owl, and swallow. All of these species are amber listed, according to the list of birds of conservation concern produced by statutory conservation agencies and the RSPB. I too would like to place on the record thanks for the information provided by the RSPB and others with a close interest. Amber listing means that the birds have unfavourable conservation status within Europe. However, there are signs that their populations within the UK are slowly increasing. Three of the species were proposed for addition to the schedule during Commons Committee and Report stages, with a further two that have now been dropped, I presume because they did not meet the basic criteria; that is, they do not reuse the same nest site each year.

</p>

<a name="60227-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The new amendment proposes the addition of the swallow species, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, referred, among others. While it is true that the chough, peregrine falcon and barn owl return to the same nest, and will use it if available, the fact of the matter is that if it has been damaged or destroyed, they will build a new nest nearby just as readily.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_29"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 29</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>As colleagues explained during the Commons stages, these are important species and deserve to be protected, which is why it is an offence to disturb them during the breeding season. However, we do not feel that it appropriate to protect their nests all year round. That would lead to thousands of sites needing to be monitored, which is unrealistic. The swallow, on the other hand&#151;as the noble Baroness pointed out&#151;is slightly different. It returns to the same site each year but these sites may become less suitable if the old nests are not cleared. Old nests may be reused, if they can be rebuilt and used again; however, most are built anew each year. If the old nests cannot be cleared to make room for the new, it will become increasingly difficult for the birds to construct new nests, particularly when faced with an adjoining property where the people living there are not so happy to have the swallows as external tenants.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Clause 46 seeks to protect those very rare species that reuse their nests, and whose populations would be severely threatened if even one of the nests were destroyed outside the breeding season. That is why their nests are being readily monitored by conservation organisations. The same cannot be said of the species proposed in this amendment for addition.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>Amendment No. 290 is identical to an amendment tabled in the Commons, which was withdrawn. We have no new arguments against it. We still believe it is misguided and will serve no useful purpose. As the 1981 Act stands, nests are protected only while they are in use or are being built. That means that as soon as the young chicks fledge and fly off, anyone can destroy the nest, for any reason or purpose. When the birds return the following year, the nest has gone, and their breeding success may be put at risk. Amendment No. 290 seeks to limit the protection to a period of five years from when the nest was reconstructed or last used.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Some birds&#151;for example, eagles&#151;can use several nests and may return to a nest even though it looks as if it has been abandoned for some time.It is important to remember that it is possible to apply for a licence under Section 16 of the 1981 Act, if there are good reasons for removing a nest which appears to be abandoned. Each application can thus be considered on its merits, balancing the likelihood of the birds&#039; return and the impact of removing the nest with the benefits of doing so. It may prove possible to obtain a licence even before five years have passed. I do not consider the necessity of applying for a licence in such cases overly bureaucratic, because the listed birds are rare within England and Wales. Their rarity, their ecological importance, and their habit of reusing nests, are precisely why they are listed on the schedule.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>There is also a practical difficulty in accepting the amendment&#151;or, indeed, any amendment that seeks to restrict the protection to a particular period. How is it possible for an enforcement authority to know for how long a nest has been abandoned? How do we know when to start counting&#151;not all nests of birds listed by the new offence are observed all year round in order to obtain that information?

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 30</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>The Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 has avoided that problem by using the term, &quot;habitually used&quot;, but what may be habit for one species may be different for another. As I said, eagles may appear to have abandoned a nest for several years. The decision must rest on the balance between the purpose&#151;for example, public health&#151;and the likely impact on the breeding success of the protected species. The abandonment or otherwise of the nest is an important but not the only factor.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>The noble Earl asked whether only birds listed in Schedule 1 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 can be listed in Schedule ZA1. Any species of bird that reuses its nest year after year can be so listed. The provision has been worded to apply to specific species that use their nests year after year and it is not envisaged that it would apply to species that return to a specific area but build new nests each year. I hope that the noble Earl is satisfied by that distinction. There are licensing grounds for public health and safety to remove a nest. The licensing provisions in Section 16 will apply to that new offence, as they apply to other offences in Section 1. Nests protected under those provisions will be protected in perpetuity. However, the licensing provisions of Section 16 will apply, so that licences can be sought for listed purposes for nests, once abandoned. Where Natural England or the Countryside Council for Wales is of the opinion that an area that is important for rare birds is of special interest, it will notify the area as a SSSI, bringing with it all the protection that follows.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>As long as normal operation on the land surrounding a nest does not cause damage or destruction to a nest, it will not constitute an offence. However, an offence could arise from the disturbance of birds. If it can be proved that bracken is killing cattle and sheep, the owners of the animals can seek a licence to remove it.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>I have given a long, detailed answer because I know that many Members of the Committee have a detailed interest in the matter. I hope that my range of reassurances will satisfy them and that the noble Earl will withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="60227-09_spnew1"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I am extremely grateful to the noble Baroness for giving such a comprehensive reply. I am bound to say that I still think that there is a degree of muddled thinking in all this, but I take some heart from the fact that she said that the restrictions would not apply to birds that returned to the same area if they do not occupy precisely the same nest sites. However, possible difficulties may arise on those lines in future, depending on whether the Government are of a mind to extend the restrictions. I realise that, at the moment, we are talking about only three specific species of birds but, as I said in moving the amendment, the list may be extended to include ground-nesting birds, where there really could be difficulties.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para12"></a>

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;PROHIBITION OF IMPORT OF WILD BIRDS

<br>
(1)   Amend the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (c. 69) as follows.


<br>
(2)   In section 1 (protection of wild birds, their nests and eggs), in subsection (2)(a), after &quot;any live or dead wild bird&quot; insert &quot;from any country of the world&quot;.


<br>
(3)   In section 16 (power to grant licences), in subsection (1), paragraphs (d) to (g) are repealed.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_99"></a>The noble Baroness said: I hope that our debate on this amendment will give us the opportunity to consider a much wider biodiversity than that of our own country. The intention behind my amendment is primarily to address the appalling situation faced by many countries that are the natural homes of such species as macaws and parrots. My amendment would ban the import of wild birds, by which I mean birds that are caught in the wild. It does not address the issue of birds that are bred in captivity and then imported, as that is a completely separate question. Perhaps I feel more strongly about this amendment than I do about any other amendment to the entire Bill. Throughout our debates on the Bill, we have talked about the importance of biodiversity and the Government creating Natural England to strengthen biodiversity in this country. Yet we continue to allow the import of wild birds, thereby devastating the biodiversity of other countries.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>On the scale of devastation, about 1 million birds are legally imported into the EU every six months. Of that million, 28,500 exotic birds were imported into the UK in 2001&#151;a year for which I have figures. By 2003, that number had grown to 83,000. These are really big figures. The temporary ban on the import of exotic birds since October 2005&#151;a ban that was imposed because of avian flu and that is intended at the moment to last until this May on an EU-wide basis&#151;has saved a vast number of birds from being imported. Not only are those birds caught in the wild in countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Costa Rica, but they are imported here and die in vast numbers on the way.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>I am sure that the Minister will remember saying in our discussions on the Statements on avian flu and the investigation of the Pegasus Birds quarantine centre that the mortality rate in the black-headed caique population was notably high. In fact, it is 100 per cent, so it is not rare for birds caught in the wild to die. One in 10 might arrive alive, so not only are the jungles being devastated for the sake of this import trade, but most of the birds are dead when they arrive.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>I shall not talk at all today about the illegal trade, as that is a different subject, except to say that continuing to allow the legal trade is providing a cover for the illegal trade. I remind the Minister that in the countries that have had a long-term ban on the import of caught wild birds&#151;the United States has banned it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_32"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for 14 years and Australia has banned it for 40 years&#151;the illegal trade in wild birds has also dropped dramatically. I am sure that if the Minister took evidence from organisations in these countries such as BirdLife, which have experience of the effect of a total import ban, he would agree with me.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>I felt strongly about the amendment when I tabled it, but feel even more strongly about it since last week, which I spent in Costa Rica talking to the people who are trying to protect these species. Less than 36 hours ago, I was watching the scarlet macaws flying back from their forest reserve into the mangrove swamps in the evening and saw the benefits that eco-tourism can bring to a country such as Costa Rica, which appreciates that benefit immensely. It is illegal there, as it is here, to catch any wild species at all. They appreciate that eco-tourism can bring vast benefits. Yet, everywhere, they still have posters and inspectors addressing the poaching of eggs and chicks from their nests and adult birds being caught. Why is that? It is because the EU still provides a ready market for these birds.

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>The Minister may say that the CITES convention addresses that issue. But an analysis, for example, of trade in grey parrots in Guinea conducted for CITES and IUCN found the species to be highly threatened by trade. The report recommended the suspension of all exports from Guinea, but the export quota remained unchanged. In many countries where CITES species are implicated, research has not been done into what is happening. We may comfort ourselves that CITES is providing control, but it is not.

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>The situation is severe for the most exotic birds, but it is also severe for less exotic birds&#151;small, green parakeets and so on&#151;in the way that we discussed during the debate on the first amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>It is of enormous regret to me that Lord Stratford is not here to take part in this debate. That is not only because I never had the opportunity to get to know him well, but also because he would have put the case far more eloquently than I am able to do. In November, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;I believe that the current temporary ban on the import of wild birds should be made permanent. I do not see any reason why we should allow this trade to go on. It is unnecessary, abhorrent and entirely destructive. When you look at the statistics you realise how appalling they are. The European Union is the largest importer of wild caught birds in the world, responsible for 93 per cent of imports of threatened and endangered species&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 17/11/05; col. 1284.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-09_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>Lord Stratford put that strongly and eloquently.

</p>

<a name="60227-09_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity that avian flu has given us to stop this abhorrent trade. I have not talked about the threat of importing wild birds in introducing disease, but I am of course very concerned about it. It is a primary threat to us, which is completely unnecessary when we can simply stop importing such birds. When we have debated the avian flu Statements, the Minister has said that migratory birds pose a greater threat. As we see at the moment, migratory birds often die en route or are too sick to migrate. Continuing to import wild birds is inexcusable in exposing our domestic poultry flocks to a threat.
</p>

<a name="60227-09_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a> Finally, I remind the Government that in their publication, <i>New Life for Animals</i>, published under Labour Britain, there is an excellent piece entitled, &quot;Trapping Exotic Birds&quot;. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;Between eight and 20 million exotic birds are trapped in the wild each year. Up to four out of five die before they even reach the pet shop. Labour is against their import into Britain, and supports calls for a European-wide ban on the import of wild-caught birds&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-09_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I believe that there is a precedent in taking a lead on this, whether in veterinary terms or those of biosecurity. Whatever terms are used, the Government should seek a way of making the temporary ban permanent in Britain not only because we are concerned about the health of our own poultry flocks, but also because if we can use an entire Bill to consider and debate the importance of biodiversity for our country, we should recognise its importance for other countries&#151;many of which are doing an enormous amount to try to protect their own wildlife, only to be undermined by the EU and countries such as ours as we effectively buy out their biodiversity and their children&#039;s inheritance. I beg to move.

<a name="60227-10_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </b>   I declare an interest as vice president of Birdlife International and of the RSPB. I commend the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, on her passionate words against the wild bird trade and I share many of her views on the conservation arguments. The trade threatens many species, while welfare standards for the birds concerned are appalling. Indeed, it has been assessed that something in excess of 60 per cent die somewhere along the very long chain from being captured in the forests where they should be flying and being transported across the land and sea and through the air before they even reach our shores and are quarantined. A large number then die in quarantine itself. It is a wasteful trade.
</p>

<a name="60227-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>For many years in my previous work with the RSPB and Birdlife International I tried hard to find a way to make this trade sustainable. I worked closely with many of the countries whose birds are taken for the European and global trade to find a means by which it could be made into a business that was both humane and could provide a living for the often poor populations living in the forests of the world. However, I have to say that we pretty much failed to find any way of establishing a sustainable trade. Many of the birds covered by the CITES regulation and about which information is available demonstrate that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_34"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 34</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the taking of such birds is far from sustainable. The situation for those species not covered by the CITES regulation is completely unknown. We simply do not know what the taking of large numbers of such birds is doing to the populations within their own countries. Little evidence can be provided to support the notion that local populations should be able to make a living out of the taking of birds. Often the local trapper gets only a pittance. The money goes to the middle man and to those outside the country of origin of the bird.
</p>

<a name="60227-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>This is a wasteful and inhumane trade. While for 15 years we have tried hard to make it sustainable, we have been unable to do so. The opportunity now provided by the temporary ban imposed in Europe is one that I urge the Government to grasp with both hands. They should look in the face of the wild bird traders and see the practice as unnecessary. It is true that the European market drives the trade and that if there were no market for these birds, they would not be traded. Although there would be some illegal importation, it is far easier to catch illegal imports if no cover is provided by the legal trade.
</p>

<a name="60227-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>Evidence from elsewhere in the world makes this clear. In an uncharacteristically brave move, in 1992 the United States Government virtually banned the trade in wild birds by placing strong sustainability criteria on any imports. The belief at the time was that that would simply drive the trade underground and there would be much more illegal importation, particularly across the Mexican and other borders with South America. However, that simply has not been the case. The market has dried up, and while there is a limited amount of illegal trading, it is very small by comparison with what there was previously. So for once we have a model from across the pond that we would do well to consider. I hope that we can persuade the Minister, if not with this amendment but certainly with the argument, to use this opportunity to ensure that both here and in Europe the need simply to bring a halt to this trade is accepted. It feels a little like the slave trade in the past. It is inhumane, wasteful and demeaning in the modern world.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="60227-10_spnew1"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   We on these Benches have great sympathy with the amendment. We shall return to it in a similar vein when we come to my noble friend&#039;s Amendment No. 293A. We also received the very good briefing from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and we thank it for that. While outlining the great damage that is done to wild birds by the import trade, the society said how it did not oppose the keeping of birds in captivity or limited imports for conservation and research purposes. In the course of today&#039;s discussion, my noble friend Lady Byford has mentioned the visit of Peter Ainsworth to Monks Wood research centre. I draw to the Government&#039;s attention the comments he made that the failure to act would pose the question of whether wildlife is safe in Labour&#039;s hands. We are very grateful that the Minister proposes to return to some of these issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="60227-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   No one can fail to be impressed by the passion with which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_35"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 35</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

moved her amendment or the way in which the noble Baroness, Lady Young, spoke in support of it. The strength of feeling on this issue was demonstrated also by the noble Duke in his few remarks. We understand the strength of feeling on this issue in Committee and beyond. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, referred to my noble friend Lord Stratford, whom we all miss. I remember well the way in which he spoke on this issue some months ago in this House. The noble Baroness and I can both imagine how he would have put his case today&#151;with great passion, strength and with much wit. I have no doubt on which side of the argument he would have stood if he had been here.
</p>

<a name="60227-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>I should try to explain how we see Amendment No. 292. To some extent, it is linked to Amendment No. 293A which will be moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, in due course. The amendment increases protection for wild birds in trade and amends Section 1(2) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act to ban the possession of live or dead wild birds from any country of the world. It has two parts: the first is to tighten up the circumstances under which it is permissible to possess wild birds and the second is to tighten up the circumstances under which wild birds may be killed, taken or possessed under the terms of a licence.
</p>

<a name="60227-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I shall take each part in turn. The current measure contained in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it an offence to possess any wild bird which has not been lawfully taken from the wild in Europe. The amendment attempts to extend that offence so that it applies to birds from any country in the world. The amendment is, however, a little confusing to us, as it depends on the word &quot;lawfully&quot; which is defined in the defence found in Section 1(3) and which relates to member state legislation implementing the Birds Directive. As it would not be an offence under this legislation to take a bird from the wild in, for example, Africa, the defence in Section 1(3) would apply and such a bird could be lawfully possessed in England and Wales. That is a detail. It is quite clear what the noble Baroness is arguing. Indeed, she said so clearly and explicitly that the intention behind her amendment is the importation of wild birds.
</p>

<a name="60227-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>I should remind the Committee that powers are already available under existing EU legislation to enable the Secretary of State to protect exotic species from the consequences of unsustainable trade. It is neither practicable nor desirable for the Government to attempt to regulate the capture and transportation of animals within territories that fall outside their jurisdiction. We believe that it is inappropriate to use domestic legislation, which is designed to protect European and native wildlife, to protect populations of wild birds in non-EU countries.
</p>

<a name="60227-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>A general prohibition on trade would raise serious practical and legal difficulties for us given our obligations under the EU treaty and as members of the World Trade Organisation. And, of course, not all birds are threatened by trade. It could be argued that it is more appropriate to protect those species that are vulnerable than to introduce a measure that is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_36"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 36</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

applicable to all species. The international trade in some 1,700 bird species is already strictly regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, CITES, which has been referred to.
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="60227-10_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </b>   May I press the Minister on that last statement? If I remember correctly, of the 1,700 species of birds in trade under the CITES regulations, only a very small number have had studies done of the impact of the trade on their populations in their own countries. I cannot remember the exact technical term for such a study. There is very little information about what the trade is doing for the viability of the populations of the remainder of those species.
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="60227-10_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her intervention. I will try to find the answer for her&#151;if not today, then shortly. CITES is implemented within the EU and, we believe, provides a necessary mechanism for protecting species against over-exploitation through unsustainable trade. There is a general view that it is one of the most important and successful international instruments for protecting global biodiversity. We do not want to adopt measures that would seek to undermine its effectiveness. It provides the mechanism through the significant trade process for ensuring that the trade in wild-taken species is sustainable, and we heard what my noble friend Lady Young said about the sustainability or otherwise of this trade. Action has been taken in the past against those countries that fail to trade sustainably by imposing trade bans or quotas, and we will continue to support such action in the future. The European Commission also uses its powers to make regulations to prohibit the import of species for which trade is considered unsustainable, and those are updated on a regular basis.
</p>

<a name="60227-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>Subsection (3) of the noble Baroness&#039;s new clause repeals four of the permitted purposes for which licences can be issued on a selective basis to control or possess wild birds, provided that there is no alternative solution and that the number of birds covered by the licence is small. Without such licences it would be impossible to control pest species such as Canada geese, which threaten collections of rare wild birds; falconers could no longer practise their ancient art; and public exhibitions or competitions involving avicultural birds would no longer be held. All those activities are allowed by the EU legislation, the EC Wild Birds Directive, implemented by the 1981 Act. The annual reporting process, required under Article 9 of the directive, allows the Commission to keep a close eye on the scale of permitted activities.

<a name="60227-11_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   The Minister&#039;s reply is very much predicated on what happens on an EU-wide basis, but here in Britain it is a criminal offence to try to catch and cage any bird, whether a robin, a kingfisher, a sparrow or a starling. I e-mailed Defra to test this theory out. I cannot catch a bird at all to put it in a cage. Is that the case in every EU <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60227-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I do not know the answer to the noble Baroness&#039;s perfectly proper question. If I may, I will write to her in the same letter that I will write to my noble friend Lady Young when I have found out what the answer is regarding other EU member states. The arguments that have been employed so powerfully today need to be answered in written form, and I will ensure that is done before the next stage of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60227-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>I was going on to say that I am satisfied that our licensing activities are set at an appropriate level&#151;and by &quot;our&quot; I mean the UK&#151;and that they are necessary to allow traditional practices to continue in a sustainable fashion. Seriously to curtail these pastimes would be inappropriate, especially as there has been no prior consultation until this stage. Let me remind the Committee, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, already has, that there is a ban on importing all wild birds until 31 May, as a precautionary measure. The question of whether this temporary ban should be established on a more permanent basis was raised at the Environment Council on 2 December 2005 and the Commission was asked to report back on it at its next meeting in March.

</p>

<a name="60227-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>In the meantime, we are arranging a meeting with key stakeholders to gauge the likely impact of such a ban. I hope the noble Baroness will take some comfort from that. We therefore feel that it would be premature to introduce any stricter measures in relation to importing wild birds, pending the development of a wider EU position on this matter. I have done my best to answer, as sympathetically as I can, the points raised by the noble Baroness. There is obviously some movement in relation to the EU meeting I have just referred to. As the noble Baroness states, this is as much an EU issue as a UK issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="60227-11_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I am always concerned when I am congratulated on my passion, because that usually precedes an unfavourable reply. The Minister has talked about the Secretary of State being able to do something when there is an unsustainable trade. I believe the Minister needs to take away the message that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, very powerfully pointed out&#151;I thank the noble Baroness for her contribution&#151;this trade is, in essence, unsustainable: there is no such thing as a sustainable trade in wild birds. The noble Baroness spoke of the fact that Bird Life International had spent some time trying to make the trade sustainable, but could not find a way of doing so.
</p>

<a name="60227-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>The Minister further talked about developing countries&#039; traditional practices, but before the EU and this country were such a burgeoning market for this trade, there was no such tradition. That is why these countries have seen the populations of their most exotic and colourful birds plummet, in some cases to zero. If the Minister had been with me to hear the case <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60227-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>I fully accept that my amendment is wrong in detail. It was merely meant to start the debate. I hope that those involved, such as the RSPB, will now help me to draft something far more appropriate. I would at this point like to pay tribute to the Wild Parrot Trust, which has been unstinting and energetic in drawing to everybody&#039;s attention the appalling situation that exists. I shall of course withdraw the amendment because I recognise its shortcomings.

</p>

<p>
<a name="stpa_124"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment deals with the need for regulation of species reintroductions. I am sure we all agree that reintroduction can be a valuable conservation tool where the possibility of a species recolonising part of its natural or historic range is otherwise low, and can bring considerable benefits for conservation, community involvement and rural economies.
</p>

<a name="60227-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Clause 47 gives legal protection to birds bred in captivity and released as part of a lawful reintroduction programme. That should close a loophole in the law. Currently it seems that almost any release is lawful. The purpose of the amendment is to provide a better definition of what constitutes a lawful reintroduction programme.
</p>

<a name="60227-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>If the amendment or something like it were accepted, we would expect licences to reintroduce species to be granted in only a relatively few cases where there is an obvious and significant conservation benefit such as achieving the objectives of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan and facilitating movement of organisms undergoing range change indirectly caused by human activity; for example, climate change.
</p>

<a name="60227-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>The object of the amendment is straightforward. Having tabled it, I was approached with some urgency by the National Gamekeepers&#039; Organisation, the CLA and the Game Conservancy Trust which pointed out that, as drafted, the amendment is unintentionally much too wide. I say that to save the Minister telling me that when she replies. As was pointed out by the National Gamekeepers&#039; Organisation, the amendment appears to prohibit the release of all native and non-native animals, including birds and fish, unless such release is specifically licensed. As part of their job, thousands of gamekeepers release pheasants, partridges and duck to replenish wild stocks for shooting. They also release non-target animals and birds from live capture traps set to control other species.
</p>

<a name="60227-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>It is clear that the amendment as drafted is unintentionally much too wide. However, it would be helpful if the Minister commented on its purpose rather than its drafting. As I say, its purpose is to provide a better definition of what constitutes the lawful reintroduction of species into the UK. At present it appears that almost any release can be classified as lawful, but that does not mean that all releases are beneficial to other native wildlife or represent the best use of conservation, time and resources. I beg to move.

<a name="60227-12_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Carter, for having spelt out the inadequacies of the amendment. Clearly, as drafted, it would have a serious impact not just on game birds but also on coarse fishing. Like the noble Lord I made inquiries in connection with the amendment. One of its by-products would be that one might require a licence to release sheep on to a hill. That would cause considerable difficulties and would not be a particularly attractive proposal, but I like the idea of <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="60227-12_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I too thank the noble Lord, Lord Carter, for introducing the amendment. I do not want to go over the ground that he covered but I wish to ask the Minister some questions. Will the lawful reintroduction of species into this country cover, for example, wild boars which have unfortunately been let loose and are likely to become a problem in the part of the country where they have been released? What about wild mink that were reintroduced? I believe that consideration is being given to reintroducing wolves into parts of Scotland. I do not know whether the noble Lord&#039;s amendment covers those species but we need to consider the effect of introduced species on native species and the problems that they might cause.
</p>

<a name="60227-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>If I remember correctly, the noble Lord&#039;s amendment also covers plant and plantlife. I have perhaps moved to another amendment&#151;if I have to I will wait. If it is to do with plants and reintroducing species, what will happen to the garden centres and the bulb growers who obviously trade internationally and use non-native species? At the moment, however, I should like to concentrate primarily on the animal side.
</p>

<a name="60227-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, is nodding his head and I am sure that he did not mean plantlife to be involved in that way. Those of us who have come across the problems of Japanese knotweed and of the crabs crawling up the Thames Estuary just recently will know that there are indeed problems around that need to be addressed. But if the amendment is going to include plants then the noble Lord or the Government need to give consideration to what happens to the proper, lawful trade that goes on in the horticultural world because I am sure that he does not want in any way to make life more difficult for them, provided those plants are approved for entry into this country.

<a name="60227-12_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I have the strangest sensation. It is said that when one is drowning, past life emerges in front of one&#039;s eyes. My past life at the Dispatch Box has included European beaver, boar, Japanese knotweed, mink, and the problems of what to do in Scotland if things are introduced over the border. One of my senior right honourable friends got into great trouble on this question of likening a colleague to a mitten crab, so I am not going down that route.

<a name="60227-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>What I can say&#151;I hope it will come as good news to all noble Lords and to many Members of the other place&#151;is that in response to the wide interest that has been shown as this Bill has gone through the other place and has been debated in your Lordships&#039; House, we have decided to bring forward a consultation on detailed provisions on the control of non-native species. It is quite clearly an extremely important area and it is our intention to go out to wide consultation in the next 12 to 15 months.
</p>

<a name="60227-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>In our view, a comprehensive package of legislation and policy is necessary. We have already committed ourselves to considering and developing the proposals contained within the consultation on Part 1 of the 1981 Act over the coming months. There have been a number of attempts&#151;this is one of them and there are further amendments today&#151;to introduce new clauses to deal with a variety of issues relating to the control of non-native species. We believe that the measures that have been proposed in amendments have raised a number of difficult issues, responsibility for which crosses between a number of government departments, and that these have to be resolved in a proportionate way.
</p>

<a name="60227-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Peel, made clear that it is possible inadvertently to interfere with one normal, natural part of country life in attempting to solve a different problem. I am confident that the noble Earl will be pleased to take part in a consultation on how to get that right. The development of effective policy depends on securing full stakeholder engagement and support, and it would be wrong to rush into legislation because this apparently convenient opportunity has arisen. We need to take all the implications and concerns into account.
</p>

<a name="60227-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>We understand the concerns that Amendment No. 293 seeks to address, and we recognise the need for legislation. One of the issues discussed in the consultation paper that I referred to on Part 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 was the definition of native and non-native. Although the amendment seems to provide an answer to that question, there is a difficulty. It proposes that the existing Section 14(1) of that Act is substituted with a new subsection that would make it an offence for anyone to release or allow to escape into the wild any animal that is native; non-native; included in Part 1 of Schedule 9; or is a hybrid <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_42"></a>

of any animal included in that schedule. That list includes almost every species on the planet. We are into that sort of difficulty.
</p>

<a name="60227-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>We are most sympathetic to the concerns that have been raised, and I am pleased to say that we will conduct the fullest possible proper consultation on this issue. We share the concerns that noble Lords have referred to, and I have no doubt that they will refer to them again in further amendments covering this area. I hope that noble Lords, on calm reflection, will consider that the approach that we have decided to take will be the most effective and is one that they can fully support.

<a name="60227-12_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   I would not have thought that a simple probing amendment would introduce wolves and Japanese knotweed to the debate. I am extremely grateful to the Minister. She said that there would be a consultation that would take between 12 and 15 months and then the Government would decide on an approach. I am sure that noble Lords have seen the correspondence in the press about the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, which is in the other place at the moment. This is an example of where that Bill could be used, as it would be non-contentious, it is amending an existing Bill, and it has general agreement. Perhaps if that Bill becomes law it would be the best way to proceed, rather than seeking a new Bill. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_117"></a>The noble Baroness said: I apologise that the groupings on the next couple of amendments were not quite correct. I am grateful to the Minister, because we have notified him of the changes. On this occasion, I am dealing specifically with Amendment No. 293A, on the import of exotic birds. We have a series of six or seven amendments on this very important topic. I am encouraged by the Government&#039;s response to the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Carter. However, could we not have the consultation a bit quicker rather than have to wait 15 months for it? If it were possible to have it sooner, that would be better.
</p>

<a name="60227-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>The aim of the amendment is threefold. First, that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;the trade in that species does not constitute a threat to the conservation of that species or of any other listed species&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>secondly,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;that the method of capture used for obtaining specimens from the wild did not involve undue suffering&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>and thirdly,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;that the means of transport from the place of capture into the United Kingdom shall meet criteria for welfare as may be specified by the Secretary of State&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>I suspect that we shall cover quite a lot of the ground from the previous amendment, moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. So I shall slightly pr&#233;cis my comments.

</p>

<a name="60227-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Amendment No.293A looks in particular at the question of the import of exotic birds. It is tabled to address two major problems: the control of the wild bird trade and the consequential treatment of traded birds. The trade in wild exotic bird species is beset by problems. The wild bird trade is huge and CITES is unable to monitor effectively the numbers of birds taken for trade from the wild. We need only to look at the present figures. The mortality rate of caught birds is estimated to be as high as 60 per cent. Far from contributing to conservation, we believe that the trade is detrimental to it. The trade is a major conservation threat to globally threatened species&#151;a subject on which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, spoke earlier.
</p>

<a name="60227-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>As UK practice stands, the CITES lists of protected birds are appendices to the EC regulations. Those appendices then become annexes to UK regulations. Annexe A is a list of the species most threatened by the world bird trade, and Annexe D is a list of the least threatened. In order to trade within the UK, traders need only to apply for a permit&#151;an Article 10 certificate&#151;to trade in birds listed under Annexe A. Birds listed in Schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 are also protected. Traders in those birds have a burden of proof to show documentary evidence that they are legally acquired. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_44"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 44</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Yet birds not covered under Annexe A or Schedule 4 can be traded without restriction. The World Parrot Society states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;Existing regulations are only partially enforceable and consequently fail to protect the species they target. CITES&#039; track record suggests that the regulations are not based on current scientific data, they are easily by-passed, they are only partially enforced, non-compliance is generally tolerated and sanctions are rarely implemented&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>Our amendment addresses these problems of laxity in legislation. It is drafted along similar lines to the US Wild Bird Conservation Act 1992 and it would prohibit the importation of any bird under Annexe A. Subject to appropriate parliamentary procedure, it would also give the Secretary of State powers to add Annexe C, and any other species of birds not indigenous to the UK, to the list of birds prohibited to be imported. Since 1992, wild bird imports into the United States have dropped by 88 per cent. The US legislation, as we mentioned earlier, has been a real success. Far from driving that trade underground, as some might argue, both trade and the welfare of the birds have improved. The Act has been shown to benefit legitimate bird dealers by stemming the flood of wild caught birds into the American pet market. The importation of those wild birds dropped from 700,000 in the 1980s to a mere&#151;though still far too many&#151;80,000 in 1994.
</p>

<a name="60227-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I am grateful to three organisations: Birds First refers in its briefing to the level of mortality in the caught wild live bird trade; the RSPB also quotes 60 per cent; and figures up to 75 per cent are quoted by the Environmental Protection Agency. Parrot-like birds tend to progress from Annexe B to Annexe A-listing on CITES, since there are no effective controls on the trade in the countries in which they are trafficked. Similarly, various Amazon parrots and cockatoos have recently been transferred from B to A-listing, as they have become rarer. I would also like to thank the Bio Veterinary Group, whose members are professional investigators, biologists and consultants, for its full support of this amendment. It also highlights the drop of 88 per cent of wild birds imported into America and raises the continuing problems of the importation of wild birds.
</p>

<a name="60227-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>The pet trade&#039;s creating opportunities for the release of non-native species into the environment poses a subsequent ongoing threat to indigenous wildlife, something that we did not talk about much earlier but know has been a problem. Wild bird trade carries an unnecessary animal and public health risk, something that we did touch on. Serious zoonotic infections such as avian flu should not be underestimated. Again, queries have been raised by the Animal Protection Agency; it has grave views on the Government&#039;s proposals for legalising pet markets, which will obviously contain many exotic animals. I beg to move.

<a name="60227-13_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I need not go on at length about the issue again, because I probably said almost everything that I need to say under my previous amendment. Clearly I support the sentiment <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_45"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 45</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of this amendment, but would like to add something on a subject on which the noble Baroness touched&#151;the seemingly illogical position that the Government are taking by issuing a general licence for all bird markets. I think that that is their proposal under the Animal Welfare Bill, and it seems a backwards step. The Animal Protection Agency has briefed extensively on that.
</p>

<a name="60227-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The proposition seems to be for a far wider general licence to be issued. In the light of all that we have heard, in terms not only of welfare but of avian flu as well, that seems a particularly bizarre move at a time when the Government, through introducing such a Bill, are trying to improve the life of companion animals. Pet fairs and so on are one of the places where welfare becomes much more of an issue, and&#151;as we learnt to our cost from foot and mouth&#151;when animals are transported to and fro and kept in what are for them very stressful conditions, disease can be spread. I want to raise my concerns under the amendment about the licensing of pet fairs.
</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="60227-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I look forward to debating the issue that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, mentioned with her when the Animal Welfare Bill is debated in this House, which&#151;who knows?&#151;may not be that far away. It is a joy that we look forward to with eager anticipation.
</p>

<a name="60227-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, for moving the amendment in the way that she did. It seeks to introduce a new clause after Clause 48&#151;that is, between the sections of the Bill relating to protection of birds and invasive non-native species. In response to Amendment No. 292, which was tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, I did my best to explain the existing controls on imports in the CITES regulations, and I shall not repeat them. In addition to seeking to ban trade in exotic birds, the amendment also contains welfare provisions relating to their capture and transportation. Everyone knows that the capture and transportation of live birds in some countries can and does lead to undue suffering, but it is not easy to regulate this by imposing conditions on importation. Ultimately, it is for the government of the exporting country to take the necessary corrective measures to regulate those activities, but I accept at once that there is a lot more that we can do to encourage such action. Her amendment would insert a series of additional measures that at best overlap, and sometimes contradict, existing measures to regulate the trade in exotic species. We believe that that would insert an additional level of complexity that would confuse both traders and administrators alike, thereby undermining the effectiveness of existing control on the trade in exotic birds.
</p>




<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="60227-13_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I was mulling over the Minister&#039;s comment that it is for the exporting country to exert control, and I am trying to draw a parallel between the growing and export of, say, coca leaves and drugs and their import into this country. In <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_46"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 46</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

drawing such a parallel, one might think it perfectly legitimate to make the import of such items entirely illegal.
</p>




<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="60227-13_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   As I said, there was much more that we could do. It is only stating the reality that, while the trade is allowed to continue, it is ultimately for the exporting country to take the measures to regulate those activities. That is what I hope I said earlier. That does not, of course, take away from our obligations to make it easier for the exporting country to export humanely and sensibly. But in the end it is for the exporting country to regulate if the trade continues. I remind the noble Baroness what I said to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, in our earlier debate about the meeting that the UK is arranging with key stakeholders in Europe to try to gauge the likely impact of such a ban.
</p>

<a name="60227-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>There are a number of detailed points on which we think the amendment, as drafted, is defective. I shall not go into them now as it would not be a valuable use of our precious time. I rely heavily on what I said on the earlier amendment.

<a name="60227-13_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I thank the Minister for his response, and am grateful for the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, who shares our concerns about the legalisation of exotic birds and pet markets which the Government are considering.

<a name="60227-13_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   In the last analysis I accept, but I feel that it is also the responsibility of the country where the birds arrive. The answer can come in writing, but I want to know what sort of catches or precautions the Government have to stop people bringing in exotic birds that are not looked after in the accepted manner. We need some evidence on what is currently happening. That would help enormously before we returned to the Bill on Report, when we shall consider this section of amendments in greater detail. I understand that the exporting country has to get its own house in order first, but a country cannot export unless someone is receiving. We as a receiving country must have some clarification about what is happening now, and how to make better strides. I am grateful to others who spoke, and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(a)   is present in the wild, and


<br>
(b)   is an actual or potential threat to the conservation of flora or fauna, or


<br>
(c)   is an actual or potential threat to social or economic well-being,


<br>
he must add it to Part III of Schedule 9.


<br>
(2)   Within three months of a species being added to Part III of Schedule 9, the Secretary of State must nominate an appropriate body that within one year will produce an action plan that identifies how the species should be eradicated, controlled or contained in order to protect threatened flora, fauna, social or economic well-being.


<br>
(3)   Within three months of the action plan being presented to the Secretary of State, he shall inform to Parliament of the provisions of the action plan.


<br>
(4)   Pursuant to subsection (3) and in the circumstances set out in subsection (5), any person authorised in writing by the Secretary of State may, at any reasonable time and (if required to do so) upon producing evidence that he is authorised, enter any land for the purpose of controlling, containing or eradicating a species listed in Part III of Schedule 9; but nothing in this subsection shall authorise any person to enter a dwelling.


<br>
(5)   The circumstances are&#151;


<br>
(a)   that the Secretary of State is satisfied that the body nominated to implement an action plan to control or eradicate a species is unable to conclude, on reasonable terms, an agreement to access land in order for the control, containment or eradication to be effective,


<br>
(b)   that the nominated body did enter into such an agreement as referred to in subsection (5)(a), but that the Secretary of State is satisfied that it has been breached in such a way that operations to control, contain or eradicate the invasive non-native species are rendered ineffective.


<br>
(6)   A dispute about whether or not there has been a breach of the agreement for the purposes of subsection (5)(b) shall be referred to an arbitrator appointed by the Lord Chancellor.


<br>
(7)   More than one person may be authorised for the time being under subsection (4) to enter any land.


<br>
(8)   A person acting in the exercise of a power conferred by subsection (4) may&#151;


<br>
(a)   use a vehicle or a boat to enter the land;


<br>
(b)   take a constable with him if he reasonably believes he is likely to be obstructed;


<br>
(c)   take with him equipment or materials needed for the purpose for which he is exercising the power of entry.


<br>
(9)   If in the exercise of a power conferred by subsection (4) a person enters land which is unoccupied or from which the occupier is temporarily absent, he must on his departure leave it as effectively secured against unauthorised entry as he found it.

(a)   the exercise of a power conferred by subsection (4) by a person authorised to do so by that relevant authority, or

<p><a name="st_126"></a>The noble Baroness said: With the leave&#151;and for the ease&#151;of the House, in moving Amendment No. 293B I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 293E and 293F at the same time because they all deal with the same topic. I apologise for the error; they should have been in the same group. I am particularly grateful for the support, help and briefing that I have received from many organisations. These amendments do one and the same thing&#151;they are two possible solutions to the same problem. The fact that we have two is an indication of how important we think the problem of harmful, invasive non-native species is.
</p>

<a name="60227-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>In the first instance, I will refer mainly to the grey squirrel. The American grey squirrel was introduced to the British Isles at the end of the 19th century. It has no natural predators or diseases in Europe, and has now spread throughout Europe&#151;across Italy and towards Switzerland and the French borders. The grey squirrel is a significant environmental pest. It attacks forests, orchard trees, shrubs and woodland birds&#039; eggs and young. We are all aware of the drastic effect it has had on our beloved red squirrel. The red squirrel has been driven out of much of the British Isles by the competition for food and habitat and the spread of the grey squirrel-carried squirrel pox virus.
</p>

<a name="60227-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>There is a complex cluster of international law and conventions that goes some way to addressing the problems of the grey squirrel, but on closer inspection there are huge gaps between the rulings, conventions and directives. The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species&#151;CITES&#151;established in 1963 to protect endangered species through the control of trade, does not offer the red squirrel protection against international trade. But the UK could apply for the red squirrel to be listed under the CITES rules, giving it greater status. Why has this not been done as a matter of course? The demise of the red squirrel has been with us for some time.
</p>

<a name="60227-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The red squirrel is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, but that only offers protection to listed species from direct harm by man. The animal&#039;s habitat is not protected in UK law. Yet, from the consultation with the European squirrel initiative&#151;I thank Mr Roger Cook for his great help on this matter&#151;I have learned that, in the past, EU and UK officials have frequently said that it is not possible to add the red squirrel to the necessary annexe in EU law. <br>&nbsp;<br>

In 2003, however, the Berne convention committed to improving the control of non-native species, and lists red squirrels as a protected species.
</p>

<a name="60227-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>However, there is another dead-end in the protection of red squirrels. The habitat directive, which purports to turn the Berne convention into law, does not list the red squirrel as a protected species. Therefore, an EU-protected species would take precedence over a species protected only by the Wildlife and Countryside Act. I am sure that that is not what is intended. The refusal to add the red squirrel to the annexe seems extraordinary given that the preamble to the EU Berne convention habitats directive states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;technical and scientific progress mean that it must be possible to adapt the Annexes; whereas a procedure should be established whereby the Council can amend the Annexes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>The lack of consistency in the protection of the red squirrel is a serious problem.
</p>

<a name="60227-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>An even greater problem is the Government&#039;s failure to take the opportunity in this Bill to address not only this issue but other issues and the failure to listen to some of the recent international consultations. Following a meeting of the Berne group of experts on alien invasive species in Majorca in December 2005, the standing committee of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats recommended that the contracting parties,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;encourage European and national institutions to support and further fund studies into the impacts on forests, Red squirrels and other biological diversity caused by the Grey squirrel and into efficient control measures&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>Amendment No. 293B is a more exhaustive amendment that makes practical suggestions on the control of the harmful non-native species. It would insert an extra part into Schedule 9, which would specifically raise the issue of harmful non-native species.
</p>

<a name="60227-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Our Amendment No. 293E would afford greater protection for the red squirrel by making provision for the control of the grey squirrel. It would add a schedule to the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act, which would impose a duty to control harmful non-native species. It is an alternative way of achieving the same ends as Amendment No. 293B.
</p>

<a name="60227-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Recently the Government made an announcement about their desire to control grey squirrels. I understand that they are considering some action. A pre-announcement&#151;and I hope that they will be able to confirm that it will happen&#151;in the <i>Daily Mail</i> on 21 January 2006 indicated that they will call for humane culling of grey squirrels in areas where red squirrels are threatened. Grey squirrels not only threaten red squirrels, which are estimated to be down by some 140,000 compared with 6 million grey squirrels; they also carry the squirrel-pox virus, are a threat to songbirds, dormice and woodland birds&#151;their eggs and young&#151;and I gather they take the cobs <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60227-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>I referred earlier to the exotic Chinese mitten crab, which the Minister also referred to. A study by researchers at Newcastle University compared their invasion to that of grey squirrels. The crabs prey on native species, such as the white-clawed crayfish and salmon eggs, and can destabilise river banks by burrowing into them with their own 50 centimetre-long boreholes. It is not just me who is concerned about that. Researchers in Newcastle University has done some important work highlighting the difficulty that grey squirrels cause to the conservation of red squirrels.
</p>

<a name="60227-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>I realise that red squirrels are very rare and sadly only exist in certain parts of England. I believe that that makes it all the more important that we address the issue. These amendments give me an opportunity to raise it. I beg to move.

<a name="60227-14_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I very much support the remarks made by my noble friend Lady Byford and I support her amendment. We had a passionate speech a while ago from the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, about exotic birds. I sympathise with a lot of what she said. I do not suggest for one moment that I can make such a passionate speech about the red squirrel, but I would like to because I feel just as passionately about it. I should declare an interest as having been closely involved with the European Squirrel Initiative and as a patron of a wildlife park trust, which seeks to maintain, among other species, the red squirrel in our lands.
</p>

<a name="60227-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>As my noble friend has suggested, the situation in the United Kingdom with regard to the grey squirrel and its relationship with the red squirrel&#151;indeed, with trees and with woodland birds&#151;is worthy of a Second Reading speech, but I will try and keep my remarks as short as possible. The fact is that the Government really have done virtually nothing to try and stem the ever-expanding grey squirrel population. Frankly, unless something is done fast, the situation will result in the extermination of the red squirrel from this country.
</p>

<a name="60227-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>I am aware of the policy and action document which has just been published by the Government. Perhaps it at least sheds a small degree of light at the end of a pretty dismal tunnel. We will just have to see how that manifests itself in due course.
</p>

<a name="60227-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>In supporting the amendment, I would like to stress the seriousness of the situation. On the dreaded parapox virus, which is transmitted by the greys&#151;my noble friend has already referred to it&#151;there seems to be very little research going into trying to stem its effects. It has only recently been announced&#151;and I think that it is a tragic indictment of the situation&#151;that the parapox virus has now infiltrated Kielder Forest in Northumberland and Whinfell Forest in Cumbria, two of the last bastions of the red squirrel in this country. It now looks as though those two populations face the serious threat of total decline.

</p>

<a name="60227-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>I simply fail to understand why the Government, English Nature or the Forestry Commission have not commissioned research on the impact of the grey squirrel in the demise of woodland bird populations. Most people whom I know associate themselves with that correlation, but research needs to be done so that we know for sure that this is indeed the problem we think it is. Most importantly, I simply do not understand why sufficient funding has not been made available to try and develop an effective immuno-contraception method. It is something which I know has been looked at in this country, and I believe that research is being done abroad. But the Government seem to have lost interest in the subject. Will the Minister confirm that they are at least keeping in touch with what is going on and perhaps helping with the development through government investment?
</p>

<a name="60227-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>My noble friend mentioned that Britain is a signatory to a variety of international treaties, including the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, the 2004 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and the Burn convention. All these call on signatories to tackle the problem of invasive alien species, but as yet the Government seem to have been ducking and weaving and the grey squirrel remains at large without any serious attempts to try and control its further levels of invasion.
</p>

<a name="60227-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, and I have tabled many Written Questions on the subject. I am bound to say that it is becoming increasingly clear that the Government and the various agencies have been deliberately prevaricating over the question of grey squirrel control. Unless this nettle is really grasped and urgent and drastic action is taken to reduce severely the grey squirrel population in this country, we will lose the red population completely, which I believe is totally unacceptable. So I am looking to the Minister to give a really positive response to my noble friend&#039;s amendment so that we can get a real commitment from the Government that they will finally do something to reduce seriously the impact of the grey squirrel and save the red squirrel in this country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="60227-14_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I simply want to say that I know my noble friend Lord Livsey would have liked to be here this afternoon to speak but he is suffering from a particularly nasty attack of bronchitis. I fear that he will not be with us tomorrow either, but he would have wanted to associate himself with the words of the noble Earl, Lord Peel. I do not propose to say anything on squirrels as I think noble Lords have done great justice to them.
</p>

<a name="60227-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>I would like, however, to raise briefly the issue of ballast water. The Chinese mitten crab was cited by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, in her introduction. Ships can release hundreds of thousands of tonnes of ballast water a year on to our shores. I believe that there are treatments available that do not affect the water because they are not chemical treatments but light treatments, which can kill any organism within that water. They work fairly quickly. Are the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 52</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government going to consider introducing a requirement that ships releasing ballast water into UK waters shall be fitted with such a device that can treat the ballast water, thereby rendering it entirely harmless to any UK wildlife?
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="60227-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I want to pick up the point by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, about ballast water. It is perfectly true that there are light treatments that will kill all microbial problems in water, but no light treatment that I have heard of would kill a mitten crab. Some other means of preventing such an invasion would therefore be required, although we know now that in this instance we would be closing the stable door after the horse had bolted and so we have a problem.
</p>

<a name="60227-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a> There is also the other oversized crab marching down or along the north coast of Russia which has already come around the corner into Norway. I have some hope on that one; I found myself slightly amused by the fact that although it was originally a Stalinist programme its control may become a capitalist success because there is a good market for that crab. The real reason I rise to speak is to support my noble friends on red squirrels. There were red squirrels in Essex when I was a boy. I was wild enough to climb up and explore squirrel drays when I was nine or 10 years old. I never had the good fortune to tip a red squirrel out of a dray, so I cannot claim that I am the reason that they left, but they were there and a part of my childhood.
</p>

<a name="60227-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>That is no longer the case. Now we have grey squirrels; I daresay that we trap them and kill them humanely whenever we can, because they are a nuisance in more ways than one and not just to red squirrels. They are the prime cause for the retreat of the red squirrels into the vastnesses in the north where even now, as we have heard from my noble friend Lord Peel, they are becoming endangered by the spread of the virus that the grey squirrels carry with them. There is no doubt that the reason for the spread of the grey squirrel is that as a society we have neglected to deal with them as the invasive issue that they are. If one goes out into the London parks and watches people treating the greys almost as pets, one realises that there is a huge psychological problem in dealing with the issue because most people regard that pernicious animal as rather a sweet little thing that is rather pretty and nice and think, &quot;Why should we worry about it?&quot;. So there is a political problem, with a small &quot;p&quot;, over the issue because the public&#039;s approach is based on sentiment rather than on reality. The reality is that because of sentiment we are losing one of our favourite animals in the country.
</p>

<a name="60227-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>While I am on my feet I should mention another invasive species that warrants merit in this context: the muntjac deer. We do not see many of them because they are on the whole secretive. They live discreetly; they tend to live singly or in pairs. They do not show themselves in the open much unless they are disturbed. But the fact is that the population of the muntjac deer is rising and one comes across them across all of southern England at the present time, up into the Midlands&#151;it may be that they go all the way up to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_53"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 53</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

north. That is another invasive species. The danger that they pose is not to another animal species but particularly to bluebell woods. We happen to have a particularly fine bluebell wood on our land and so far we have been fortunate; but the muntjac are around and we all know that they are there. Deer are becoming an increasing problem. In this case they are not invasive species: the fellow deer and the roe deer in East Anglia are now said to number somewhere towards the 300,000 mark. In my part of Essex one can go out on almost any evening in the summer and find a herd of 70, 80 or even 90 to look at&#151;that is ordinary deer. But hidden in those ordinary deer numbers is a subversive group of muntjac deer that cause a great deal of harm to plant life in woodland and in open fields.
</p>

<a name="60227-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>There is a strong case for saying that we should deal with muntjac deer as well. There is less inclination to say that they are sweet, cuddly little creatures than there is with grey squirrels. The muntjac is not exactly handsome; it is rather an ugly little beast, but it is also a pernicious pest that does a great deal of damage to plant life.

<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="60227-15_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   I rise to support my noble friends Lady Byford and Lord Peel and all those who have argued against that environmental pest, the grey squirrel. It seems extraordinary that we are creating a body, Natural England, to look after the wildlife of the UK. We talk about pesticides that are harmful to wildlife, the protection of birds and all the rest, yet we have done virtually nothing about that character, which has such a blackened name that he is known as an environmental pest&#151;the grey squirrel. I have the privilege of being a caretaker of SSSIs. The one thing on which English Nature and the Forestry Commission will agree, when we talk about it, is that the grey squirrel is very damaging to the environment. In fact, it is questionable whether we could continue to have a high canopy in the SSSIs if we were not to control the grey squirrel. We control the grey squirrel by all the accepted control methods. We kill thousands of grey squirrels per year, year on year. If we were to stop for one year we would be back to square one. It is so brilliant a survivor that any control over it has to be maintained year on year.
</p>

<a name="60227-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>I am glad to hear that the Government have leaked through the media that they are intending to control the grey squirrel because of songbirds, but I hope they will also consider controlling it because of the rest of the damage that it causes to our natural environment. What worries me is whether when they come forward with the controls they will say how many years they will control it for, because there seems to me no point in spending a great deal of money to control the grey squirrels one year when the next year the grey squirrel will carry on doing the damage as normal.

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>I also mention briefly the songbird trust: a new trust that has been set up recently that is looking into the damage grey squirrels do to songbirds. It will be particularly enlightening when its research comes forth in a year or so. I would also like to say to my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith that, while I agree with his statements, the muntjac is perhaps one of the best eating deer. I strongly suggest that the more aggressive shooting management of it might be to the enjoyment of all.

I suggest that when it reaches a point we can have it caught by Scots, perhaps he and I can have a lobster dinner together&#151;it sounds very appealing.
</p>

<a name="60227-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>The noble Baroness asked why the red squirrel is not added to CITES. That would not give it any protection. CITES is about trade. No one is trading in red squirrels, so that does not concern it. The red squirrel is protected by being listed in Schedule 5 to the 1981 Act and it is illegal to sell any without a licence. Obviously, that is important.
</p>

<a name="60227-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>The Forestry Commission will support local owners with grants where woodland owners want to take action. The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, demonstrated that the species of the grey squirrel is not protected under the 1981 Act, so anyone can undertake control measures. It is listed in Schedule 9, making it an offence for it to be released into the wild. It has been subject to the provisions of the Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932 by the Grey Squirrels (Prohibition of Importation and Keeping) Order 1937/478.
</p>

<a name="60227-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>Recent developments in other countries, especially the United States, offer the prospect of the practical application of immuno-contraceptives, which has justified new research. Scientists from the Central Science Laboratory, Defra and the Forestry Commission will carry out research work for squirrels. They started that process in January and it will test a range of agents.
</p>




<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="60227-15_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   Can the noble Baroness be more specific about that? What particular research is she talking about?

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The amendments would not add anything to the work that the Forestry Commission has launched, setting out a future framework for control. As I said, the Forestry Commission supports partnerships and co-operative action in areas of critical threat. This subject has been raised before in your Lordships&#039; House. There was a spate of Questions on the fate of the grey squirrel, which it was my pleasure to be able to answer. The last Question was asked about five <br>&nbsp;<br>

years ago. Following that, I received a letter from a woman who was researching the history of grey and red squirrels who lived in Sheffield to ask whether I was aware that Scottish landowners launched an organisation at the beginning of the previous century whose sole aim was completely to exterminate red squirrels from Scotland and that it exterminated 60,000 of them. I introduce that just to show that I read letters sent by members of the public.
</p>

<a name="60227-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>The Forestry Commission will support action. The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships&#039; Ballast Water and Sediments was signed on 13 February 2004 and I will write to the noble Baroness giving the details of that convention. Great effort is made in specific areas, such as Kielder, in the north-east, to trap and kill grey squirrels using poisoned bait. Grey squirrels are not protected and may be killed by landowners.
</p>

<a name="60227-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>It is not that we are not taking the issue seriously. Many grey squirrels are present on land that is not owned by the Government. The Government have no power to invade people&#039;s property to exterminate grey squirrels. They are not protected if landowners wish to do so.
</p>




<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="60227-15_spnew6"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   To clarify a point that the noble Baroness made, she said that the Forestry Commission would support action. I was rather hoping that the Forestry Commission might lead from the front and encourage people&#151;landowners and farmers&#151;actively to get involved in comprehensive schemes to try to eradicate the grey squirrel. Unless there is firm action by the Government and their agencies, it simply will not happen.
</p>




<p><a name="st_137"></a>

The Forestry Commission gives information about how that may be done.

I have written to the chairman of the Forestry Commission asking him whether, in the magazine that it publishes so frequently, in telling people where they can go for recreation, it could also inform them of the pests in the forest, such as the grey squirrel, so that the general public would have a better understanding of the damage that it does. If the public perceive it as a friend, they may not have the trees and great high canopy forests that they go to see on their recreational days out.

<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="60227-15_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   The fact that many people try to control grey squirrels illustrates the scale of the problem. My noble friend Lord Rotherwick said that on his estates, many thousands of grey squirrels are killed every year but the fact is that, as with the rabbit, there are so many grey squirrels around that when you kill one, one immediately comes in from next door. We need a really concerted programme across a very wide <br>&nbsp;<br>

area&#151;especially in areas where one is attempting to defend red squirrels. There will not be a successful preservation scheme without a comprehensive slaughter scheme. The two must go together; otherwise, grey squirrels will continue their march northwards. It is not a simple subject.

I must say that I am slightly disappointed by the Minister&#039;s response. I shall deal with that specifically. My noble friend Lord Peel is quite right: the Government have launched action, but that is for the future. At this stage, I do not think that they quite understand the seriousness of the situation. The Minister says, &quot;It is up to landowners; they can do it&quot;. As my noble friend rightly pointed out, unless there is a concerted effort, it will not address the problem.
</p>

<a name="60227-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>Over the past few months, at least 16 or 17 articles in the press have debated the question of the control of grey squirrels and the demise of red squirrels. We have not fully debated this afternoon the question of how one controls grey squirrels. There are legal methods of controlling them: the Minister mentioned contraception in food, which is one way. You can trap them; you can shoot them; you can kill them in many ways.
</p>

<a name="60227-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I must tell the Minister that the general public is hesitant to mass culling. It is looking for more action from the Government to ensure that research is carried on and that development of some sort of contraception is the main aim. Most of us would agree with that. It is a serious matter about which I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, would have spoken at great length.
</p>

<a name="60227-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Although the Minister says that the Government do not own many properties, the Forestry Commission owns a lot of land. The Government may say that it is at arm&#039;s length from them, but someone owns the Forestry Commission. Some of my noble friends own land that has forest or woodland on it and they will try to do what they can, but the big area where the grey squirrel is obviously an increasing threat is that of the Forestry Commission . I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Rotherwick for clearly defining the enormity of the problem that he faces in trying to control and land-manage his tree plantations and his difficult struggle to control grey squirrels.
</p>

<a name="60227-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>As I said, I listened to the Minister with great care. I am disappointed. Before I move on, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith for raising the question of muntjac.  I do not live in a very wooded area, but we have two regular visitors of muntjac to our garden and the trees around. Frankly, they are a pest. I know that research will be done, but the Government&#039;s lack of initiative, drive and action forces me to beg leave to test the opinion of the House.

</p>


<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="60227-16_spnew0"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose </b>   moved Amendment No. 293C:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>Page 19, line 20, at end insert&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_142"></a>The noble Duke said: In speaking to Amendment No. 293C, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 293D. This amendment would ensure that the code of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_59"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

practice inserted at Clause 50 is not confined merely to known non-native species. We fully support the code of practice on known non-native species, but consider that it could be extended to ensure that the effects of hybrid species and their cultivars are kept well under check. This amendment focuses on what should be included in a code of practice and not on the specific control of non-native species. For the code to cover just known non-native species effectively shuts the stable door after the horse has bolted. Non-native species should be tackled at the point of invasion.
</p>

<a name="60227-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Flora locale, an organisation which advises on the use and supply of native flora, has alerted us to a widespread problem in the seed trade. It stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;For the people who buy or use native plants for large-scale landscaping, forestry or ecological restoration projects, the lack of information on the native origin of plants they buy has been a significant problem. Currently, the majority of plants and seed on sale do not say where they originate from. There is also a different interpretation of terms, such as &#039;origin&#039; and &#039;provenance&#039; used in horticulture. This creates confusion, and makes selection of plants of appropriate origin almost impossible&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>Clause 50 would not improve that situation. I understand that this may have implications for the Trade Descriptions Act and would remind noble Lords that this is a probing amendment. The amendment stands to suggest to the Minister that the code of practice, while promising, is not wide enough. The sale of non-native seed species could be detrimental to biodiversity. The code of practice should encourage the planting and establishment of indigenous species and discourage the use of non-native species, particularly in ecologically sensitive areas. To widen the code of practice along the lines of our amendment would ensure that the code is proactive and would assist the trade and the consumer to practice in the best interests of the environment.
</p>

<a name="60227-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>On a lighter note, as we consider invasive species, when the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington of Ribbleton, raised slightly unintentionally the question of Martians, I had visions that we had better get this issue of non-invasive species right in case someone started quoting to us the fact that Martians would contribute to biodiversity. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="60227-16_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   Clause 50 provides a power for the Secretary of State to issue codes of practice relating to non-native species or to approve such codes issued by others. Amendment No. 293D seeks to remove one of the categories for which such codes may be issued. Amendment No. 293C adds an alternative.
</p>

<a name="60227-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The new category for which the Secretary of State may issue or approve a code of practice is for,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;the marketing, sale and introduction of wild bird species, hybrids and cultivars derived from hybrids, including those considered indigenous or naturalised to the British Isles as well as those considered not ordinarily resident&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The category removed by Amendment No. 293D is the species of animals and plants listed in Schedule 9. These are those species, such as the ruddy duck, or Japanese knotweed, which have become established in Great Britain and are considered to be ordinarily <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_60"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

resident. They are listed on the schedule because of the problems that they cause in the wider environment and because we want to prevent further human introduction. These are the very species which are most likely to form the subject of a code of practice, and it would make no sense at all to prevent such codes being issued in relation to them.
</p>

<a name="60227-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Amendment No. 293C seeks to widen the scope of creatures to which the codes may relate: it specifically includes wild bird species, which already come within the term &quot;animal&quot; in Clause 49(3)(c), hybrids, which we already take to come within the scope of &quot;not ordinarily resident in&quot;, and cultivars of hybrids. I assume that this is to ensure that cultivated varieties of hybrid plants are covered.
</p>

<a name="60227-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The noble Duke explained that these are probing amendments. I hope that he is reassured by my answer. There is currently no prohibition under Section 14 of the 1981 Act on planting hybrids in the wild or from causing them to grow there. That is because no hybrid plant species are currently listed in Schedule 9. We believe that our legislation is adequate for the reason that any plant, including hybrids, can be listed in Schedule 9, and Section 14 will therefore apply.
</p>

<a name="60227-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>The amendment also widens the scope of Clause 50 to include those species which are considered indigenous or naturalised. Presumably, these are included so that codes may be issued in relation to species which are considered to be ordinarily resident but are not listed in Schedule 9&#151;for example, rabbits. This really widens out the list of species for which a code may be issued, if we so wished.
</p>

<a name="60227-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>Paradoxically, this amendment, while being unnecessarily detailed and wide in scope on the one hand, is too restrictive on the other. It stipulates that codes issued under the new subsection may be drawn up only in relation to the &quot;marketing, sale and introduction&quot; of such species; that is, by implication they may not apply to their keeping or breeding. This is far too restrictive as we would want for example to issue guidance on how to prevent accidental escapes unrelated to commercial activity.
</p>

<a name="60227-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>A further restriction is that, in relation to plants, codes would be issued or approved in relation only to plant hybrids and cultivars of hybrids. It would no longer be possible to issue codes relating to pure plant species, such as Japanese knotweed, giant hogweed, and so on. The current drafting of the clause is considered perfectly adequate. It has the potential to cover all non-native species which are considered to pose a threat to our native wildlife. The horticultural code of practice, published last March and launched by the Minister, Ben Bradshaw, encouraged people to buy and plant native species in preference to non-native species. The power in Clause 49 will ban the sale of certain non-native species. It is envisaged that the species to be banned will include plants known to be invasive. I note that the noble Duke said that this is a probing amendment. I have tried in my answer to cover all the points that could be raised in this context.

put into effect in the United Kingdom, how does that work within the single European market? Do the same rules apply across the whole of Europe or do they apply simply to the UK? If so, how has the UK managed to opt out of applying the single market rules to plants?

</p>




<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="60227-17_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I do not know, and unless wisdom strikes me from on high in a very few seconds, I shall not have the answer. Therefore I will write to the noble Baroness. However, it would be my understanding that we would act legally and within EU rules, so in those circumstances we must have the power to do so. I am not quite sure whether we are doing that unilaterally; it is possible that we are not. However, I shall write to her.
</p>




<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="60227-17_spnew2"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for going into suitable detail on many of these issues in her response. It is interesting to note that the Government reckon that the powers are already in place even if at times they are not necessarily being implemented.
</p>

<a name="60227-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>I come to the debate at a slight disadvantage. Periodically we discuss matters relating to Scotland during proceedings on the Bill. I know about the hybridity problem there but I could not say whether it exists in England. In Scotland the Deer Commission has decided that sika deer are polluting the native stocks of red deer and attempts are being made to remove hybrids. I am not sure whether the hybrid problem is known in the English context and whether the Government should be addressing it. However, it may be something for the Government to think about. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="60227-17_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Peel </b>   moved Amendment No. 294:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>Page 57, line 30, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

&quot;(   )   When exercising powers in relation to any Group 1 or Group 2 offence, an inspector must have regard to any relevant code of practice issued by the Secretary of State.&quot;

<p><a name="st_148"></a>The noble Earl said: We now move into the realm of the wildlife inspectors. My amendment seeks to ensure that such inspectors would be subjected to a code of practice. When it comes to pesticides inspectors the Minister has already implied that a similar arrangement will be made, so I assume that he will carry out his commitment as far as concerns this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="60227-17_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I hope that I made that clear earlier, but I am happy to do so again now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="60227-17_spnew5"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, but I shall expand my remarks just a little because this point is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_62"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 62</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

worthy of discussion. For example, I think I am right in saying that there is nothing to ensure that these wildlife inspectors will be subjected to the same level of training as, say, trading standards or environmental health officers. That being the case, it enhances the argument for having a legally binding code of practice.
</p>

<a name="60227-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>I want to illustrate by way of a piece of information that has come to my attention why I think this amendment is even more important. Perhaps I may draw to the Minister&#039;s attention a Scottish police wildlife crime conference which took place earlier this month. At that conference, the new head of investigations at a well-known NGO&#151;I put it no stronger than that&#151;put forward recommendations for future investigation into wildlife crime. Among those recommendations was included the proposal that the police should,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;utilise the expertise available from partner organisations to assist in the preparation of case files for the prosecutor&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>I suggest that this is pretty sinister stuff and I know that the implications of such a proposal will not be lost on the Minister. The idea that a senior representative of an NGO should be involved in the preparation of individual case files is, to my way of thinking, alarming.
</p>

<a name="60227-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>My information suggests that there is considerable suspicion that this sort of thing has happened quite a lot in the past, so it is essential that the police and all wildlife inspectors are wholly independent and impartial in their operations. I urge the Minister to accept not only that at all times they should have a statutory duty to abide by a code&#151;I think he has agreed to that&#151;but also to recognise that it is important that the contents of the code should cover the illustration I have just outlined for the Committee.
</p>

<a name="60227-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 295 and 296 grouped with Amendment No. 294. They would introduce a requirement for a wildlife inspector to &quot;reasonably believe&quot; that an offence has been committed before entering premises. With these amendments I am attempting to mirror the Government&#039;s own amendment in respect of pesticide inspectors, which I think I am right in saying was government Amendment No. 283, stating,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;if he has reasonable grounds to suspect that he may find there evidence that&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>The wording in my amendment is different because it was tabled after the Government&#039;s amendment. So I hope that the Minister will respond by saying, &quot;If we will do this for pesticide inspectors, we will do the same for wildlife inspectors&quot;. That is my hope. Reference is made in the information notes to the Bill that so-called &quot;fishing trips&quot; are not part of an inspector&#039;s role. Clearly they should not be, and this amendment would help to ensure that such forays do not take place.
</p>

<a name="60227-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>I should point out that I have tabled two separate amendments because the Bill divides the offences into two groups: new offences under this Bill and old offences already covered in legislation. It is also important to note that none of these amendments has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_63"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 63</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

any implication regarding the ability of wildlife inspectors to check compliance with licence conditions. They refer only to offences. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="60227-17_spnew6"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   I support my noble friend Lord Peel in his amendment. We are grateful to the Minister for the introduction of the code of practice which, in many ways, forms his response to the arguments put forward on 5 June in Standing Committee in another place by my honourable friend Jim Paice. It has been suggested that government Amendment No. 283 recognises the concern expressed at the time. We are also interested in the way the Government have followed up the other issue raised at that sitting. In his response to the debate, the Minister, Jim Knight, said:

I must say that I am quite deeply sceptical about the value of such people. This is not something that ought to be increased or proliferated in any way. I apologise for not having given prior notice of these questions. If the Minister cannot reply now, perhaps he would be kind enough to write to me.

<a name="60227-17_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I should like to address a couple of the interesting points raised by the noble Earl, Lord Peel, and pay tribute to the work of the police in investigating wildlife crime. Every time they have a successful prosecution, it strikes me how hard it is for them to gather evidence and take it through to a successful prosecution. I recognise that a couple of years ago the Government upped the penalties, which has been helpful. Nevertheless, with all the pulls that crime has on society, it will always be the underfunded part of the work that will be carried out. Although there is underfunding, at the same time there is the willingness of the public to contribute. The noble Earl, Lord Peel, referred to large NGOs which may be willing to carry out the work. It may be easier to foresee a situation in which the NGOs are in a better position to take the sort of action to which the noble Earl referred, rather than public bodies. At the moment, I am not saying whether that is right or <br>&nbsp;<br>

wrong; I am simply saying that it is a matter of funding, and before decisions are made, I think we need to think about the funding of them.

<a name="60227-18_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I fully appreciate the points made by the noble Baroness, but surely she would agree with me that it would be quite unacceptable for any NGO to be involved in the preparation of individual case files.
</p>




<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="60227-18_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   We have eminent legal opinion on these Benches, but it is not here at the moment, so off the top of my head I would have to say yes, I think it probably would be unacceptable. I am simply trying to point out that if we want wildlife crime and crime against animals in general addressed, we have to recognise that some of the work is carried out by organisations that command considerable public support through the purses of the public.  I agree with the noble Earl that one has to draw a line at some point and the line needs to be drawn once one is into criminal proceedings. I am pleased that the Government have to date supported the work of the police in investigating wildlife crime and I hope that funding will continue for that. My fear is that it might not and the kind of world envisaged by the noble Earl would then become a reality. We need to be aware of that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="60227-18_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   We have to be very sure that wildlife crime is found out and punished. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, rightly said, sometimes in this area we have not been as good as we are in other areas. These are important matters and the powers of wildlife inspectors are fairly significant and important. Of course, they have to be kept in check, which is why training is important. I say to the noble Earl that all wildlife inspectors receive appropriate training to ensure that they can carry out their duties in a professional and an effective manner. They also have continued professional development, during which all wildlife inspectors will attend appropriate training inside and outside Defra. There is also a code of practice for wildlife inspectors, which sets out how they should conduct inspections. The Secretary of State can give full assurance that officials have the appropriate expertise before they are authorised to carry out those inspections.
</p>

<a name="60227-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>On Amendment No. 294, the noble Earl knows that I have conceded that wildlife inspectors should have regard to the code of conduct that will be set up. Indeed, wildlife inspectors who currently exercise powers under the 1981 Act have operated under a similar non-statutory code for a number of years and we believe that that has worked well. There is no reason to believe that wildlife inspectors, operating under the enhanced powers set out in the Bill, will behave any differently. On Report, I hope we shall find a form of words on Amendment No. 294 to satisfy the noble Earl, as we did earlier on.
</p>

<a name="60227-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>On Amendments Nos. 295 and 296, it is worth pointing out that for certain offences&#151;for example, relating to sale registration&#151;wildlife inspectors have been able to go in without reasonable suspicion since <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_65"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 65</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The enhanced powers for authorised wildlife inspectors are available for a number of necessary purposes, including in particular the purpose of ensuring that license conditions are being complied with and verifying statements that are made in the context of licence applications. The circumstances of these inspections differ from those where an offence, such as one under Clause 43 of this Bill, is suspected. Such compliance visits ensure the integrity and enhance the credibility of the licensing system. There is no requirement for inspectors to have reasonable belief in an offence to enter premises. They will not go in looking for an offence, but they will look to see whether there has been compliance with the terms of the licence. That is entirely consistent with the current wording in the 1981 Act. We do not believe that there is any justification in changing that.
</p>

<a name="60227-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>I need to tell the noble Earl that the breach of a licence condition is not in itself an offence under the 1981 Act; rather the breach may mean that the person concerned cannot rely on the licence that he has obtained because he is not within the terms of it. If he cannot rely on the licence, then the original offence&#151;that for which he obtained the licence; for example, the shooting of a bird or the disturbance of a habitat&#151;will, of course, have been committed. We think that the powers in this Bill are appropriate and are particularly relevant to the compliance functions of wildlife inspectors.
</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="60227-18_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for his response. I shall read very carefully what he has said. I am disappointed in his reply. Perhaps there is a technical reason why a wildlife inspector should be treated differently in legislative terms from a pesticide inspector. The noble Lord tried to explain that and I shall need to read his words very carefully. I thought he rather glossed over my point about what I described as the leading NGO and the recommendations made by the investigations officer. I hope that the noble Lord will condemn outright any suggestion that the police or the wildlife inspectors will be co-operating behind the scenes with NGOs to try to secure a prosecution. It seems to me that they have to remain absolutely independent. I hope that that will be made quite clear in the code of practice. I hope that the Minister will confirm that what I have suggested should in fact be the situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="60227-18_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   As I understand it, there is a draft of the new code of practice in the Library. I do not have it in front of me at the moment. The noble Earl is quite right to be cautious about how these things happen. However, it is important that, if wildlife offences are committed, those who perpetrate them are brought to justice in a fair and reasonable way. There has been a thought that not all those who have committed offences of that kind have, in the past, necessarily been prosecuted or convicted. That is something that we have to bear in mind on the other side as well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_159"></a>

<a name="column_66"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 66</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Baroness, Lady Miller. Surely he condemns the idea that a senior NGO investigatory officer should be involved in the preparation of individual case files. That is going way beyond their remit, and I believe that the police and the wildlife inspectors should have absolutely nothing to do with it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="60227-18_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I am drawing on the only other parallel I can think of at this moment: an NGO running a women&#039;s refuge might, in a case of domestic violence, gather quite a lot of evidence and help the victim. It would not be the prosecuting agency, but would simply pass the case over to the authorities at the appropriate moment. I must declare an interest as a patron of a women&#039;s refuge. I cannot see why what happens in other walks of life&#151;such as the example I have given, which is a fairly common occurrence&#151;should be any different for wildlife.
</p>




<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="60227-18_spnew7"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I come back to the point that producing a case file often requires confidential information. I would be horrified if I thought that confidential information was going to be shared between the wildlife inspectors, the police and possibly an NGO.

<a name="60227-18_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The amendment as drafted would allow the taking of a sample from a seal for the purpose of testing for disease. It consequently raises questions about how this proposed power would be used in relation to live seals. Wildlife inspectors do not have routine contact with live seals, and in most cases it is outside their experience. That is why the Bill contains a requirement to consult the Natural Environment Research Council about any authorisation of a wildlife inspector in the context of the Conservation of Seals <br>&nbsp;<br>

Act 1970. I am advised that there would be practical difficulties in capturing and confining a live seal in the environment where they live. Seals can be aggressive, and there would be associated risks to safety. It would also be necessary to anaesthetise the animal in line with common practice before a sample could be taken. Those are the reasons why the Bill as drafted specifically excludes the power to take a sample from a live seal. I am not persuaded that such a power should be made available to wildlife inspectors.

<p>&quot;PART 3 CONSTABLE&#039;S SEARCH WARRANT POWER EXTENDED TO CERTAIN OTHER ACTS
</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_6"></a><br>
12   (1)   Section 19(3) of the 1981 Act (issue of search warrants for purpose of obtaining evidence of offence) applies in relation to an offence under each of the Acts mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) as it applies in relation to an offence under Part 1 of the 1981 Act.

<br>
(2)   The Acts are&#151;


<br>
(a)   the Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932 (c. 12);


<br>
(b)   the Conservation of Seals Act 1970 (c. 30);


<br>
(c)   the Deer Act 1991 (c. 54);


<br>
(d)   the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 (c. 51).&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_169"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a government amendment that seeks to extend the powers of constables to obtain warrants under Section 19(3) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to four other Acts where police currently have only very limited powers of entry; namely, the Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932, the Conservation of Seals Act 1970, the Deer Act 1991 and the Protection of Badgers Act 1992. The powers would allow constables, under a warrant issued by a justice of the peace, to enter and search premises for evidence where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence has been committed and that evidence may be found on those premises. These extended powers would ensure that wildlife protection legislation is complied with, and that wildlife crime could be more effectively investigated. The provisions within this amendment also provide greater consistency across the main wildlife legislation. I beg to move.

<a name="60227-19_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The lack of current powers under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992, as it was passed, is a major concern to the police when tackling crimes, particularly badger-baiting. The amendment will bring the Act into line with the provisions introduced in Scotland under an Act that I am sure the noble Duke knows well, the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004. While there are provisions in the Deer Act 1991 to enter and search without a warrant, those powers do not allow entry to dwellings, nor do they allow a general search of premises to obtain evidence. We believe the amendment will close a perceived gap in the legislation, but with the safeguards associated with a requirement to obtain a warrant.
</p>

<a name="60227-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>With regard to the Conservation of Seals Act 1970, the police are increasingly involved in cases relating to the shooting of seals, especially as the close season for grey and common seals in certain areas of England was extended. The 1970 Act has limited powers to search vehicles and boats. The police need wider powers. Looking around, I do not think that anyone in the Committee today was present when the Destructive Imported Animals Act became law. The police currently have powers to seize and detain any animals that are imported or are attempted to be imported in contravention of the Act, but no power to enter premises to search for such animals.
</p>

<a name="60227-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>All this arose, as the noble Duke may recall, because a chief constable expressed concern about the apparent disparity between the enhanced powers proposed for wildlife inspectors in the Bill and those of constables. The view of ACPO is that the current drafting of the Bill would unintentionally shift primary responsibility for enforcing wildlife crime from the police to wildlife inspectors. This amendment&#151;and I hope the noble Earl will be delighted to hear this&#151;seeks to restore that balance to some extent.

</p>




<p><a name="st_173"></a>The noble Baroness said: Like many other noble Lords, I am sure, I listen to the wildlife programmes on Radio 4. Fortunately for me, many of them are broadcast at the weekends. A common theme in recent months has been the way that certain animals and plants are changing the habitat of native species, and, in some cases, killing them. We have had debates about striking a balance between protecting the red and the grey squirrels. The noble Lord will not be surprised that I was disappointed by the Government&#039;s response. I believe that far more relevant action is needed than is currently taking place.

threat to our variety. That is to say nothing of the destruction they cause to riverbanks. We have for many years now faced the whole question of rhododendrons and, more recently, Japanese knotweed. As I am sure that noble Lords are aware, there are many further examples I could draw upon. The important factor in the context of this debate is that they usually start from small beginnings and then romp away. By the time the threat is appreciated, it is already out of control, or nearly so.
</p>

<a name="60227-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>I cannot see a single valid reason for time-limiting the prosecution of someone who breaks the rules on importing destructive animals, or indeed any form of proscribed wildlife. If such an offence comes to light, perhaps in the course of another investigation, it should surely be prosecuted no matter what the time interval. I ask the Minister why the interval of two years has been chosen. Several Members of this House have been trying by various means to slow the illegal inflow of bushmeat, wild birds and other items dangerous to humans or animals in this country. Many questions have been asked; the replies make it clear that prosecutions of those caught in breach of those rules are rare. &quot;Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime&quot; does not seem to apply to those plying illegal trades through our borders. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="60227-19_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The amendment seeks to remove the upper time limit for bringing summary proceedings for offences against the Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932. The Bill already extends the present requirement to bring summary proceedings for offences under the 1932 Act within six months of the commission of the offence. Under the Bill, summary proceedings must be brought within six months of the acquisition of evidence sufficient, in the prosecutor&#039;s opinion, to warrant proceedings and, in any event, within two years of the commission of the offence. This amendment would remove that two-year long-stop.
</p>

<a name="60227-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>While I agree with the need to improve our ability to deal effectively with wildlife crime&#151;indeed, I have talked about it this afternoon&#151;and to provide a better deterrent to those seeking to commit it, we do not believe, on balance, that the proposed amendment is necessary. Its effect may be disproportionate. For example, under the amendment proceedings could be commenced for an offence committed many, many years in the past. There needs to be a proportionate time limit in commencing&#151;and I emphasise this&#151;summary proceedings, to ensure a realistic possibility of securing a conviction and that the evidence is reliable. We believe that the time limits set out in the Bill are proportionate and will allow the enforcement authority sufficient time to conduct investigations and gather evidence.

<a name="60227-19_para10"></a>

I do not mean this disrespectfully, but while we are delighted that the noble Lord is still within the brief, he is still fairly new to it. We have had discussions over many years about the need to control the illegal trade in bushmeat, for example. I could give other examples, but bushmeat is a particular case, especially when it entails the taking of animals that are becoming rare species. The success rate&#151;or lack of it, as it currently stands&#151;is an absolute disgrace, to be frank. I hope the Minister, when we are not in Committee, will have a chance to look back at some of our discussions on illegal bushmeat. The number of prosecutions brought is small; the success rate in prosecuting somebody and their being fined is even smaller. That is what makes me so nervous about a restriction such as the two-year time limit.

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>I do not know what discussions the Minister has had with the various bodies that have given evidence to the Government, or brought this sort of thing to the Government&#039;s attention, but I can assure him that it is a very unsatisfactory situation. My fear is that in restricting it to two years, an already poor conviction rate will become even poorer, and people may well not be prosecuted. I am sure that the Minister will share my concern that we should get to grips with crime in this way. It is a big illegal trade, which has been going on for many years. I know the Minister would support that. I hope that between now and Report the Minister and his colleagues will have a chance to reflect. I give way to the Minister.

However, there is also the possibility that very occasionally an area of land might be included within a notified SSSI boundary that is not of special interest and never was. With advances in technology and the digitising of geographic information in place of good old paper maps, it is possible that cartographic discrepancies or errors could arise. Therefore, Amendment No. 300 removes the implication in the current provision that the power can only be used to denotify land that was at some point of special interest in its own right. It is a small facilitating amendment that avoids the need for more complex solutions, should any landowner discover that some of his land was included within a SSSI in error.
</p>

<a name="60227-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Amendment No. 301 is intended to provide clarity for the future and to further improve the legislative framework that Natural England will inherit. The SSSI legislation requires that notifications relating to the site must be served on every owner or occupier of the land in question or, in relation to certain of the requirements, affected by the notification. The relevant provisions, as significantly expanded through the CROW Act, are listed in subsection (2). This amendment introduces a saving to ensure that a SSSI notification, given after commencement, remains valid should it later be discovered that some relevant party&#039;s interests were not identified when the notification was served. It was by strong desire of Parliament, during the passage of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, that the original requirement to notify every owner and occupier of land to be made a SSSI was imposed on the conservation bodies. While nobody today would sensibly argue against the principle behind that, it is, on the face of the legislation, a tall order, despite best efforts, to identify all relevant interests, particularly on large or complex sites.

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>The significant enhancements to the regime introduced by the 2000 Act mean that government and their delivery bodies will be investing much of their public resources in protecting and managing these sites. As the Committee knows, we have set ourselves a challenging but admirable PSA target to bring 95 per cent of SSSI areas into favourable or recovering condition by 2010. Achieving that is also drawing down on significant commitment from private landowners, public utilities and a range of other bodies. We should therefore take steps to minimise any risks that would unreasonably undermine that. In Scotland similar action was taken in 2004 where Section 48 of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act addresses the same point. As we are now in the <br>&nbsp;<br>

business of laying the foundations for Natural England to take over these responsibilities from English Nature, we have concluded that it would be right to take this opportunity to provide a similar safeguard for England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="60227-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>By way of seeking a balance between the interests of owners and occupiers on the one hand and those of the public on the other the amendment would be effective only if the conservation bodies have taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the requirement to serve notification on every owner or occupier is met. Where that is the case, we believe it is right to provide that the validity of the site should be preserved. Where that is not the case, the courts will determine the issue according to the circumstances. In the event of discovering a party whose existence or identity was unknown at the time of service of the notification, subsection (4) removes any doubt as to whether and at what point the notification is to be treated as served, and subsections (5) and (6) require that a copy of any notification be served on such a person once they have come to light and ensure that they will not be liable for anything done or not done prior to that point in time under the offence of carrying out damaging operations without the consent of the conservation bodies.
</p>

<a name="60227-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>We believe that this reflects a pragmatic and realistic approach to the duty in the legislation, recognising both the practicalities of the task faced by the conservation bodies themselves and the importance of safeguarding the status of sites which many individuals and other bodies have managed and conserved. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="60227-20_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   I hope that the Minister can clarify a point on Amendment No. 301. As I understand it, the amendment applies only to notifications made by English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales from the point of commencement onwards. A great number of SSSIs have already been notified in England and Wales. Indeed, I understand that the suite of SSSIs is considered to be largely complete. There is therefore a significant body of existing sites in respect of which there may be scope to argue about the consequences of any failure to notify a relevant owner or occupier from many years ago. I hope that the Minister will deal with that point.

<p><a name="st_180"></a>
<a name="60227-20_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   Government Amendments Nos. 300 and 301 seem to be practical amendments but I have one question in relation to SSSIs. Is there now any database which the public can access to see all the SSSIs in their area? Defra has developed a very sophisticated geographical information system. Can one now log on to that and see where all the SSSIs are?
</p>

<a name="60227-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>I believe that the Minister said that ultimately the courts would decide the matter if a mistake had been made. I should be grateful if he would confirm that. I shall not move the amendment standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley.

advised that there is such a list. I do not know how long it is but I presume that it is fairly long. We shall put a copy of it in the Library at the earliest possible opportunity.

I hope that the Minister is about to tell me that it is.
</p>




<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="60227-20_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I am about to tell the noble Baroness that. It is on the website, which includes details of the SSSIs, why they are important and what the condition of the site is. The noble Baroness can log on later and find that out. I thank her for her question.
</p>

<a name="60227-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>It is very much hoped that in some cases the parties would reach agreement but in the last analysis the courts could determine any issues that needed to be determined. That is why we think it is a practical way of looking at the issues which arise out of these amendments.
</p>

<a name="60227-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>The noble Baroness referred briefly to Amendment No. 302. Its aim is to expand the areas over which Natural England and, in Wales, the Countryside Council for Wales, can exercise their powers to put in place management schemes and, if necessary, enforce them through the use of management notices. This goes wider than the SSSIs; outside the SSSIs. A scheme may be made for the purpose of conserving the special interest features of a SSSI, restoring them or both. While there must be consultation with the owners and occupiers of the SSSI, the final decision as to whether the scheme is necessary and what it can contain is a matter for the conservation bodies. Where an owner or occupier is not giving effect to the scheme and the SSSI features are being inadequately conserved or restored, the conservation bodies may serve a management notice on him provided they are satisfied that it is not possible to conclude a management agreement with that individual on reasonable terms. Failure to comply with the terms of the notice is a criminal offence. Additionally, the conservation bodies may carry out the work required by the notice and recover the costs from the landowner or occupier. These are all strong positive powers introduced by Parliament in 2000 to secure the conservation of SSSIs. They are currently applicable only to owners and occupiers of the SSSI&#151;people who have had the opportunity to make representations when the SSSI was created, have had the benefit of advice and been given the list of operations likely to harm the site&#039;s features. They will also have had a say in the management of the site. As a registrable land charge, successors to these people will be aware of the SSSI nature of their acquisition.
</p>

<a name="60227-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>However, we believe that the position is very different for other landowners whose land is not within the SSSI itself&#151;they would have acquired their interests with no prior warning or expectation that such robust restrictions or management prescriptions might be later imposed on them and their business <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_74"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 74</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

activities by the nature conservation bodies. We believe that there are more co-operative means for securing appropriate management by land owners outside the SSSIs. The Bill already provides a power in Clause 7 for entering into management agreements with any person, on any land, for anything within the broad purpose of Natural England. SSSI agreements can already be entered into with owners and occupiers of land outside an SSSI if this is necessary for the conservation of the site. Additionally, Natural England will administer the Environmental Stewardship Scheme and experience to date is that most land managers are willing to co-operate and to enter into land management agreements.
</p>

<a name="60227-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>There are other factors too that will encourage or require land managers generally to raise environmental standards more widely. These include the CAP reform cross-compliance requirements and in relation to the water environment, the need to achieve the ecological standards of the Water Framework Directive. Given this continual drive towards better land management and the fact that neither English Nature, nor the Countryside Council for Wales considers such an extension to their powers is justified, I do not believe that Amendment No. 302 is necessary.
</p>

<a name="60227-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>The changes would give Natural England very imposing control over adjacent and possibly even more distant land owners and occupiers. We think instead that Natural England should continue to work through positive partnerships with land managers who have no immediate interest in the land holdings containing the SSSI land as it does with the majority of those within the sites. It should work collaboratively with other regulatory advisory bodies whose functions might be better suited to some of the issues arising out of the SSSIs. That is why we do not believe that Amendment No. 302 is appropriate.
</p>

<a name="60227-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>Lastly, perhaps I may reply to my noble friend Lord Carter and thank him for raising the important issue on our Amendment No. 301. This provision is indeed prospective rather than retrospective. It is an improvement to the existing regime and will apply to any notifications, including amendments to existing sites, made after the provision comes into force. It makes the position quite clear for the future. However, as my noble friend pointed out, the current amendment will not provide such a safeguard to existing sites, of which there are more than 4,000. It is also right that we do not expect this current suite of SSSIs significantly to increase in future and therefore the majority of the risks of legal challenge to validity are no doubt already inherent in the system.
</p>

<a name="60227-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>One of the perhaps few advantages we have had during the Committee stage is that it has been useful to allow us to reflect further on the issue in relation to existing sites. While we consider that in the event of any challenge there would be very strong public interest arguments to maintaining the validity of a SSSI, we agree that while we have this opportunity it would be preferable expressly to deal with the situation in relation to existing sites so that they are safeguarded as future sites will be. I would of course wish to ensure that there is clarity and certainty over whether and at <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_75"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 75</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

what point any existing missed owners or occupiers become subject to the control regime, with the aim of ensuring that the system is fair and proportionate to all SSSI landowners and occupiers.
</p>

<a name="60227-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>For these reasons, careful consideration is now being given to further widening the measure if this amendment is accepted, so that it will apply to existing notifications as well as future ones. I hope that the Committee will appreciate that this raises slightly more complicated issues than the ones we are debating now. However, subject to this further consideration, may I indicate to the Committee that I hope to come back to this issue at Report. I beg to move.

(4)   For the purposes of sections 28 to 28Q, the time when the notice is to be treated as having been served is the time when the relevant conservation body took the last of the steps referred to in subsection (1)(a).


<br>
(5)   If the relevant conservation body becomes aware of its failure to serve a notice on an owner or occupier, it must serve a copy of the notice on that owner or occupier.

The Minister said that he would expect Natural England to liaise with owners and occupiers. I am sure that he is right but we would encourage him to accept our more restrictive amendment.
</p>

<a name="60227-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>The Countryside Alliance was also interested in this amendment because it would ensure that a land manager would be fully aware of any signs being placed on his land and be consulted on the issue. One of the points it made was that Clause 55 currently goes against the spirit of community conservation and the Government&#039;s commitment to working with local land management communities. The purpose of this Bill is to devolve responsibilities closer to rural people and ensure that practical integration on the ground is achieved. Failing to consult local land managers of any changes is failing to deliver on the objectives of this Bill.

<a name="60227-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Amendment No. 304 probes the parity between punishments that are on the same tariff. In Clause 54 there is an insertion into the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to the effect that anyone who does damage on a SSSI commits an offence punishable by a level 4 fine. It seems rather odd to have the same <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_77"></a>

level of fine for damaging a notice. We feel that either the greater offence should have a greater fine or that the damage to a notice should have a lesser one. On balance, we feel that the latter course of action is more desirable. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="60227-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Clause 55 provides a general power for Natural England or the Countryside Council for Wales to put up signs or notices relating to the site on land within the SSSI. They will be able to maintain the signs and remove them and it will be an offence for any other person to interfere with those signs or notices without reasonable excuse.
</p>

<a name="60227-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>At present, the conservation bodies have no general power to convey information by means of signs or notices on SSSI land. Such provision as there is for using notices relates only to the formal service of notifications or documents required or authorised by the legislation.
</p>

<a name="60227-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>What is the justification for this general power? English Nature&#039;s press release of June last year announced a 100 per cent increase in unlawful activities on SSSIs in the previous year, 71 per cent of this being attributable to third parties and more than 160 recorded incidents in England of damage caused to SSSIs by off-road vehicles. The provision of information in areas subject to particular pressures could therefore help raise awareness of the importance of the land, reduce or avoid harm to the sites and any need for enforcement action, and complement the efforts of owners and occupiers to manage and maintain the interests of the sites. The noble Duke&#039;s amendment seems to require prior consultation before the power could be used. A similar concern was expressed in another place.
</p>

<a name="60227-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>I seek to reassure noble Lords that in the interests of good working relations we would of course expect Natural England to liaise with owners and occupiers of SSSIs if it is intended to erect signs or notices on their land. If there is a need to deter activities that are damaging the land and its special interests or to steer visitors away from sensitive areas, it would serve both their interests to take steps to alert users to the importance of the sites. These things have of course already been the subject of discussion between them. We expect the power to be used as and when there is a particular need or a useful purpose for putting up signs or notices. Natural England will of course want to be as discreet as possible so as to minimise any visual impact or unnecessary interference without compromising effectiveness. For the most part we would naturally expect signage or notices to be sited at entry points of the SSSI.
</p>

<a name="60227-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>With all that in mind, a strict legal requirement to consult each time the power was to be exercised&#151;either to put up a sign or to maintain one, especially in the case of some common land SSSIs for example&#151;would be a completely disproportionate administrative exercise. Our view is therefore that any consultation should be left to the normal relationships and liaison with owners and occupiers.

<a name="60227-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Amendment No. 304 would remove the summary only offence that would deter interference with any such signs or notices. To be effective and to justify the time, effort and resources that may be involved, these signs and notices must be protected from damage or interference. The Countryside Council for Wales has experienced many cases of signs erected with the agreement of the landowner having been destroyed or damaged. We think it may be important to note that the offence is committed only if the act is intentional or reckless and without, of course, any reasonable excuse. Otherwise it would be all too simple just to remove or take down any warning notices. It is for these reasons that we invite the noble Duke to withdraw his amendment but I think he may have a query of me.

<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="60227-22_spmin0"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  I am considerably mystified by some of the arguments put forward by the Minister. I confess to being the owner of a SSSI which was designated before devolution and presumably was part of the same legislation that we are talking about here. Under the management agreement, it was laid out that signs would be erected and the landowner agreed to the signs being erected. It sounded to me when the Minister quoted the number of signs that had been destroyed as if he was suggesting that the landowners were destroying the signs. In fact, if Natural England has the agreement of the landowner to put up a sign and the sign is destroyed, whether that is done under this legislation or through agreement with the landowner will not reduce the number of signs that are destroyed. That is vandalism by persons unknown whom we hope someone will try to find.
</p>

<a name="60227-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>In some ways, this seems to be part of the whole tendency towards more heavy-footed government. At the moment, there is a possible problem with common land, but now that we are talking about the setting up of proper governing bodies for common land you would think that SSSI agreements would have a body with which they could consult about putting up notices. There might be an odd area in which the owner of the land was not known, but very soon there should at least be some body for common land in most areas. Our amendment is a halfway house, suggesting that agreement should be reached with the person with whom the SSSI has been set up. It might be a tenant; it would not necessarily be the owner. Making a blanket power that the government body can implement of its own volition without consulting anyone else is going a little too far.
</p>




<p><a name="st_189"></a>

<p><a name="st_192"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of amendments is intended to reverse the recent Meyrick judgment. It serves to amend Section 5 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, and its purpose is to re-establish the link, which we had always assumed to exist until Meyrick, between the purposes that national parks are expected to deliver and the criteria for choosing areas to become national parks. The Countryside Agency was nervous that the drafting could be interpreted to mean that all three of those criteria&#151;natural beauty, wildlife, and cultural heritage&#151;would have to be met before land was designated. The intention, and the current practice, is that wildlife and cultural heritage considerations are factored into the natural beauty assessment rather than being free-standing tests in their own right.
</p>

<a name="60227-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>As a consequence of the Countryside Agency&#039;s view, which has some merit, we have put in train a new series of amendments to deal with that point. I wrote to noble Lords earlier today, and I hope that many of them will have received the letter. If not I can only apologise. I do not intend to move Amendment No. 305 or the other government amendments in this group at Committee stage. I will return with government amendments on Report.

<p><a name="st_194"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am grateful to the Minister. I put on record that he told me earlier today that the Government were going to withdraw their amendments because there was a technical fault with them. My Amendment No. 306A is grouped, and I explained to the Minister that I would speak to it as it seemed to me that if the Government were going to reflect on their amendments and come forward with new ones it would be of benefit to them to hear some of the views that might be expressed around the Committee in anticipation of those new amendments.
</p>

<a name="60227-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>The Minister has explained why he has withdrawn his amendments at this stage and that he will be bringing new amendments forward on Report. Mr Justice Sullivan, in the case of <i>Meyrick </i>v <i>Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</i>,<i> </i>ruled that the land at Hinton Admiral Park was unsuitable, and the New Forest National Park Designation (Confirmation) Order was quashed. The Minister has indicated that the department will appeal. Even so, it seems to be at best hasty and at worst rash to push through legislation in the way that would have happened if the Minister had not decided to withdraw his amendments. Unless the amendments are changed in a major way, that will still apply. Does the noble Lord accept that this could be viewed as a case of <i>sub judice</i>?
</p>

<a name="60227-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>Mr Justice Sullivan said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;It must be remembered that the question is not what factors should, as a matter of good countryside planning practice in the 21st century be taken into consideration in designating a National Park, but what factors may lawfully be taken into consideration under an enactment that is now over 55 years old&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>Parliament had an opportunity to change that in 1995, but did not do so. Government Amendment No. 305 rewrites the legal basis for national parks, by changing both the criteria of natural beauty and open-air recreation.
</p>

<a name="60227-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>The addition of the words &quot;wildlife and cultural heritage&quot; overturns the High Court decision. What is meant by cultural heritage? It is not defined in this Bill <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_81"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 81</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

or the 1949 Act. What will it cover, and who will decide what is or is not relevant? Any Secretary of State could choose to decide to that anything counted as cultural heritage and could feasibly designate any area with an old building&#151;or in the case of the South Downs an Anglo-Saxon burial ground&#151;as a national park. Our Amendment No. 306A would ensure that no land would be designated as a national park unless it had already achieved a high degree of &quot;relative naturalness&quot;. We have chosen the wording that Mr Justice Sullivan used in the Meyrick case. It is a tried, tested and, at the moment, legally binding position.
</p>

<a name="60227-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>As the judge said, natural beauty is a relative concept. In the case of a national park, it is an extensive tract of land that is relatively natural. That will invariably include some more managed areas that would otherwise not have been considered as meeting the national park criteria, such as, for example, Chatsworth Park in the Derbyshire Peak District National Park, which is entirely surrounded by a very extensive area of moorland. In England, we have a spectrum of wild upland areas at one end, and intensively cultivated or managed land at the other. In the judge&#039;s ruling, it was clear that the law needs to include criteria for designating national parks of a high degree of relative naturalness. In other words, national park land should be that which has been least interfered with by man. It should be the finest landscape in the country.
</p>

<a name="60227-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>The next part of our amendment would ensure that any recreational potential in the possible national park land was assessed on its present potential. The Government&#039;s amendment&#151;which has not been moved, so it is quite difficult for me; but I hope that I am still in order&#151;redefines the criteria for open-air recreation. It enables national park designators to consider land that could be used for open-air recreation. In current legislation, open-air recreation is only a part of the national park criteria if that recreation already exists. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what is meant by the fact that national parks,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;could be used to promote opportunities for open-air recreation&quot;.</p>

</p>




<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="60227-23_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I personally have no difficulty with this. The intervention came from the noble Lord, Lord Carter. I thought that I was quite in order. It is important that the Committee should consider the wider aspects of national parks and the reasons why we are raising them, so that when the Government bring forward another amendment, they will have had a chance to hear some of the views of other people. So I have no difficulty. I acknowledge that this morning the noble Lord kindly made contact with me. I was promised a letter, which did not arrive, although that is not his fault. So I do not think that I am wrong.
</p>

<a name="60227-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Will the Minister tell us what is meant by the fact that national parks could be used to promote opportunities for open-air recreation? Will it be quiet recreation? Or will the other activities be considered suitable under a new amendment that is put forward? I could argue, for example, that the CenterParcs holiday centres are out in the open air. But under this amendment they would fall within the new criteria. While my family has enjoyed the centres at CenterParcs&#151;and I wholeheartedly support the ethos and the enjoyment that they provide&#151;I have to question whether the Government&#039;s amendment, which is much more widely defined, would be appropriate. It would certainly take it further away from that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_202"></a>
<a name="60227-23_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   The <i>Companion</i> clearly states that the debate should be relevant to the Question before the House.

If the Government are going to come back later, on Report, with amendments that we will not have the chance to discuss in Committee, it is perfectly reasonable to have as full a debate as we can now on the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment. She is quite entitled to compare the wording in her amendment with a hypothetical wording which the Government may still be inclined to use. Although the noble Lord, Lord Carter, shakes his head, and I am aware it is nearly the dinner hour, it is important to get the wording of this absolutely correct. In saying that, I do not support the wording of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, either.

In the circumstances I would like commend the noble Baroness on having pursued her amendment as far as she did. I agree with what was said from the Liberal Front Bench.

</p>

<a name="60227-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>I apologise for speaking fully on this matter, but it is very important that I do so. I think that the noble Baroness will agree that the views she puts forward reflect the view of those who are unhappy about the creation of the South Downs National Park and who claim that the Bill will move the goalposts for the designation process. The outcome of the Meyrick case in the High Court, which excluded land at the Hinton estate in the New Forest from the new park, has clearly therefore provided ammunition for this anxiety and this proposition. I want to deal with that in the context of what the noble Baroness has said about her amendment.
</p>

<a name="60227-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>Section 5(2) of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, which gives the criteria for designating national parks, currently states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;The said areas are those extensive tracts of country . . . as to which it appears to the Commission that by reason of (a) their natural beauty&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>While Section 5(1) of the same Act gives the purposes of the national parks as:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;(a) to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife, and cultural heritage&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>In the Meyrick case, the judge concentrated on the difference between the criteria and the purposes. His analysis, as I understand it, was that the added distinction of &quot;natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage&quot; in national park purposes, compared with the sole mention of &quot;natural beauty&quot; in their criteria, meant that wildlife and cultural heritage are not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_84"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 84</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

factors which can be considered when selecting areas of landscape for national park designation. But this is surely questionable. Prior to the 1995 Environment Act, the purposes and criteria of the national parks were the same. The purposes were only then amended so that national parks could be certain that they could focus more on biodiversity and heritage improvements. In practice, for the last half century, wildlife and cultural heritage have been a clear influence on what land should be included for national park designation. For whatever reasons, however, the judge did not address the issue of practice and precedent.
</p>

<a name="60227-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>However, because of the focus on &quot;natural beauty&quot;, the judge pondered what that could mean and, in the absence of a legal definition in the 1949 Act, put forward his own. It was,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;a high degree of relative naturalness&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>&#151;in other words, very little interference by man. By that definition, the Hinton estate in the New Forest, with its parkland, farmland, woodland and Grade 1 listed building, did not qualify. That clearly has big implications for national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty alike. The 1949 Act applies to the creation of both. They all contain land influenced by man, through farmland to physical infrastructure and settlements, and to areas very similar to the Hinton estate, like Chatsworth or Lyme Park in the Peak District. Again, it must be underlined that the judge did not address practice and precedent. All national parks in Britain are influenced by man. That is why the Government&#039;s new clause, which we were expecting this evening, made common sense&#151;but we must not discuss that.
</p>

<a name="60227-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>We need to look at some of the history. The application of the natural beauty criterion by the Countryside Agency has been fully exposed to debate and ratification in Parliament and by government for more than 50 years. Starting with the reports that led to the creation of national parks, it is obvious that &quot;natural beauty&quot; or &quot;scenic beauty&quot; and the influence of wildlife, cultural heritage and man have been critical to the designation process. The 1945 Dower report, which made the first post-war recommendations for national parks, set out the requirements clearly&#151;the characteristic landscape beauty is strictly preserved; access and facilities for public open-air enjoyment are amply provided; wildlife, buildings and places of architectural and historic interest are suitably protected; and established farming use is effectively maintained.
</p>

<a name="60227-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>The report of the national parks committee chaired by Sir Arthur Hobhouse and presented to the Minister of Town and Country Planning in 1947 underlined that approach with its references to &quot;merit in variety&quot;, &quot;wide diversity of landscape&quot; in England and Wales, and the need to include,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;other districts, which though of lesser grandeur, have their own distinct beauty&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>The report tellingly observed:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_85"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 85</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>&quot;We are dealing with a closely populated and highly developed country where almost every acre of land is used in some degree for the economic needs of man and has its place in a complex design of agricultural, industrial or residential use&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>Both the Dower and Hobhouse reports had far-reaching influence on the preparation and legislative process that produced the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949.
</p>

<a name="60227-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>Between 1951 and 1957, 10 national parks and 37 areas of outstanding natural beauty were designated. Again, I emphasise that all of them contained manmade features&#151;settlements, farmlands, and areas similar to the Hinton estate. In 1974, the so-called Sandford report, by the committee established by the government with the Reverend Lord Sandford in the chair, after taking much evidence and holding many public meetings did not find any need to review the criteria. Again in 1991, the national park review panel chaired by the distinguished professor, Ron Edwards, recommended no changes; indeed, it re-emphasised the influence of man, observing that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a>&quot;the essence of the concept of national parks lies in the striking quality and remoteness of much of the scenery, the harmony between man and nature it displays . . . the softer and less remote areas of our national parks also exemplify at their best a harmonious interaction between humanity and the natural world . . . This part of the national parks scene where man&#039;s hand is most in evidence is no less an integral part&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>If there is any question of the goalposts being moved, it is not by anything that we might have been debating this evening&#151;I must remain in order&#151;but by the ruling in the Meyrick case. I hope that what I have said will help to reassure the noble Baroness that the situation as it stood until that ruling is the one that overwhelmingly recognises what the national parks are about, clearly, explicitly and in every sense. In this Committee today, we should continue that tradition. Therefore, I hope that on consideration she will not find it necessary to press her amendment.

<a name="60227-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I am sorry to intervene at this stage and delay us still further into what is normally regarded as the dinner hour, but unfortunately I happen to have with me the Minister&#039;s letter. It is appropriate to quote from it, so that we know why there is the dilemma, why my noble friend has rightly initiated this debate, and why it needs to continue to take place. The letter states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a>&quot;I explained in my letter that this recent High Court case has produced a difficult judgment regarding the purposes and criteria for designating land as a new National Park, and in particular on how the term &#039;natural beauty&#039; is to be interpreted. The effect of the combination of amendments 305 and 353 with consequential amendments . . . sought: to clarify what may be considered under the &#039;natural beauty&#039; criterion, to clarify the role of the purposes in designation, and to clarify that just because an area is used for agriculture, woodland, as parkland or is the product of human intervention in the landscape it is not prevented from being treated as area of natural beauty.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>Since laying these amendments the Board of the Countryside Agency have only very recently raised an important possible ambiguity in amendment 305; i.e. that it could be taken to imply that wildlife and cultural heritage considerations carry the same weight as natural beauty, whereas in fact they should be subsidiary to it.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>Defra lawyers and Parliamentary Counsel are looking at how that intention can be made unequivocal but have not been able to draft an alternative amendment in time&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>It is therefore clear that the Government&#039;s intention is that the general purport of the amendments should stand. Therefore, despite the fact that the amendments have not been moved tonight, they are the background to this discussion.
</p>

<a name="60227-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>In sympathy with my noble friend, I am bound to say that as time moves on it appears increasingly that the criteria for designating national parks is becoming relatively looser, if I can put it that way; my noble friend Lord Renton of Mount Harry would be suitably furious with me for those words. While there is considerable justification in the original designations&#151;the New Forest was an inevitable and natural extension&#151;when we get to the South Downs, if we are not extremely careful we get to the point where almost any area that happens to look rather attractive scenically is included. I have an area of outstanding natural beauty in my area. It is an attractive piece of countryside&#151;not particularly so, but it happened to be painted by a notorious artist and, as a consequence, everybody thinks that it must be special. It is a bit of the English countryside&#151;heaven help us. The English countryside has its glories all over the place, but they do not all justify the designation of a national park.
</p>

<a name="60227-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>The way in which we are moving makes it increasingly possible that beautiful areas can be designated as national parks, whereas they are simply natural bits of glorious English countryside. It is right that we are having this discussion, although it is probably time to draw it to a conclusion, as we will clearly have it all again at some point on Report.

I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Judd, but I shall not debate the issues now. I simply want to say that this is not the correct way of dealing with legislation of this magnitude.

<a name="60227-24_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   Given the importance of national parks and the difference between how each area of land has been treated historically in the south-west, for example&#151;Exmoor became a national park while the Mendips did not&#151;even under the withdrawn government criteria there would have been a debate. Even under Amendment No. 306A there would have been a debate. There is always a long public inquiry and plenty of consultation. We should not make a mountain out of a molehill although it is important that we get it as right as we can. I declare the same interest as a vice president of the Council for National Parks. I am most concerned that the importance of national parks is at the forefront of our minds. I believe that the Government are correct to give some thought to the issue. I acknowledge that the Minister tried to telephone me, but I was coming back from seeing the parrots, so I was not at my desk. I do not believe that the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment is correct because I am unhappy with the phrase,

I do not intend to stand at the Dispatch Box and reply to the questions that have been raised now. If anyone wants a particular question answered by letter, I shall be happy to do that. We shall meet again at Report and will have another discussion on this important matter. I thank all those who have taken part in the debate, and once again apologise to everyone, except the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith&#151;in other words, all those who did not receive my letter.

That is why I genuinely welcome the debate that we have had in Committee this evening and the one that will take place on Report. We do not believe that this case is <i>sub judice</i>.

That is very unfortunate, and I hope that the Government will take consultation between now and Report all the more seriously. I am sure that the Minister will do so. I mean that with no House of Lords hyperbole whatsoever. There is no Minister who takes his responsibilities to this House more seriously. I am sure that he will consult fully before Report.

To those who do not like my amendment&#151;that is the only one we are allowed to talk about&#151;I am grateful to them for expressing their views. We were trying to have a debate around the future concept. As I said earlier, the Conservative Party supports national parks. We believe that we should have them. There is no question of us saying that they are rubbish and should not exist. There are good reasons for being slightly concerned, as I tried to explain earlier, about what we are not allowed to talk about. We look forward to talking about it on Report. I am grateful to those who have spoken in the debate. For those who are concerned about my amendment, I shall read the contributions&#151;particularly that of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, which was very detailed&#151;with great care. When we return to the issue on Report, we shall see whether an amendment of ours is important. It may not be relevant by then. I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that if circumstances had been known in advance, he would probably have tabled an amendment himself. It is not often that I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Carter, who I thought consistently tried to cut me off at the knees. I know him well and know him to be a just man. On this occasion, I think that I was a just lady. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_219"></a>
<a name="60227-25_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall </b>  rose to ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government whether globalisation will reverse the long-term trend towards greater equality in the distribution of income and wealth in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the basic story I have to tell is that the positive processes of globalisation have some negative effects on income distribution in Britain but national governments are not impotent in being able to correct that. Our own Government seem not prepared to challenge, as they should, the grossly disproportionate increases in income at the top of the distribution, which those involved often attempt to justify by rhetoric about globalisation, thereby running the risk of a perception of globalisation that will bring it into disrepute. It is a story about two levels of experience.
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>Globalisation affects different levels of income distribution in different ways. That has been well documented by the European Commission, which has competence for our trade policy, in its introduction to the new European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. Its assessment shows that displacement rates tend to be greater in sectors where international competition is most intense, such as textiles, clothing and automobiles. But it shows that the broader benefits&#151;price decreases for consumers, and so on&#151;are on a longer timescale than the downside costs. Moreover, costs and benefits are typically concentrated in different regions. Furthermore, the costs borne by &quot;trade-dislocated workers&quot; tend to be higher than those borne by other job losers. For example, they often have vocational skills specific to declining occupations and industries.
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>Wage rates in replacement employment can be especially low for older job losers. Noble Lords will recall that precisely this group was identified in the recent welfare Green Paper as a target group that we want to be able to get back to work. The wage loss seems to be particularly pronounced for high-tenured blue-collar workers who have normally been well above the minimum wage, welcome though that is. Costs are mainly concentrated on less skilled and more vulnerable workers&#151;women in particular&#151;as a result of the high female representation in employment in the trade-affected sectors. Displaced workers tend not only to be older, but less educated and have held the lost job for longer than workers generally.
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>The Commission&#039;s concern and its determination to rebalance this unequal redistribution is because, in political&#151;as well as social and economic&#151;terms,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a>&quot;this mismatch directly fuels rejection of the opening up of the economy&quot;.</p>
</ul>

</p>

<a name="60227-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>In other words, it leads to protectionism. It is a timely and accurate analysis requiring active programmes to respond to these &quot;market externalities&quot; of globalisation, and I think we would all accept their emphasis on dealing with information gaps, though job search assistance, for example; qualification gaps, through tailor made training; and geographical mismatch, through relocation allowances, and so on. I think everyone would acknowledge the broader point that, as we move relentlessly to employment in service sectors, with <i>ipso facto</i> different earnings distribution from manufacturing, the sectoral shift <i>per se</i> brings with it a negative impact on the overall distribution of income.
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>However, it is an impact which a number of other European countries have, unlike Britain, been able to neutralise. The big picture, if I may oversimplify, is the Anglo-Saxon countries versus the rest; pure capitalism, if you like, versus the social market variety of most of the European Union. Samuel Brittan&#151;not a left wing firebrand&#151;in an essay in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 10 February on the American experience of extravagant top salaries, and an explanation of the distributional effects of globalisation, says that the pay of chief executive officers rose by 100 per cent in the past decade, while that for maths and computer sciences occupations rose by less than 5 per cent. He questions the reliance, as in the report of the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, on the &quot;shift of skills and technology&quot; explanation of these effects. He concludes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a>&quot;One day, competition from China and India will deal with bloated top salaries. But not yet&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>Here in Britain, too, it is the chief executives and other executive directors of top companies&#151;particularly of global corporations&#151;who are prominent among the winners in this game of snakes and ladders. When I say &quot;Britain&quot;, I had better include the Isle of Man, with no corporate tax, and the Channel Islands and the Cayman Islands&#151;companies with household names are registered in all three. The UK is a prominent home for multinational corporations, which make up one-third of world output and two-thirds of world trade, half of which takes place within the trans-nationals themselves, at prices which they often fix in order to minimise tax.
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>But company law and tax law at national level have themselves been so far overtaken by globalisation that, in the vast proportion of cases, boards feel they are under no pressure to discuss the rationale of directors&#039; remuneration. Remuneration committees do not so far include workers representatives&#151;an overdue reform some of us have been campaigning for&#151;and the picture is generally as Samuel Brittan describes it for the US, even if the numbers here are not quite so extravagant.
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>To avoid any misunderstanding about where I am coming from, I very much welcome the fact that that India and China are growing at 10 per cent per annum. There is no way in which typical European countries which are 10 times better off need to flagellate themselves about not growing at that pace. That is what world development is all about. The need for the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_91"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 91</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

trade unions to work together within sectors and multinationals was the theme of a lecture I gave a couple of years ago in Bangalore to professionals as well as trade unions. The last thing we want is any doctrine that the interests of workers in Britain and in India, for example, are opposed.
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>But we have a difficulty. With globalisation now taking centre stage as a catch-all explanation for almost everything that moves&#151;mergers and acquisitions also spring to mind&#151;the perception which our members are taking from the debate is that, in a number of sectors, they are becoming more vulnerable and that, in this brave new world, any idea of having an overall policy on income distribution is now as viable as King Canute trying to stop the incoming tide. That is the perception&#151;what people think they are being told&#151;which my noble friend now has an opportunity to correct.
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>Of course, the media have fallen for this new historicism hook, line and sinker. Even the <i>Financial Times</i>, normally cool and analytical, opined on 7 February that shorter working time was now,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>&quot;unsustainable in the face of competition from China and India&quot;.</p>

<a name="60227-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>It was, paradoxically, only a few days later that it ran a story highlighting the growing dilemmas of work/life balance in this country&#151;notably, but not exclusively, for women&#151;arising from our long hours culture.
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>The share of the top 1 per cent of income recipients in Britain has in recent years jumped back to pre-war levels. The richest 1 per cent doubled their share of pre-tax income from 6.7 per cent in 1981 to 13 per cent in 1999&#151;precisely the same as in 1937, the year of my birth, so we have gone back 68 years. This top 1 per cent last year paid themselves some &#163;100 billion pre-tax, and about &#163;75 billion post-tax. As the American Senator would have said, &quot;&#163;100 billion here and &#163;100 billion there soon starts to add up to real money&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>For those of you who cannot quite get the hang of billions, a topical comparison&#151;I say this with my tongue firmly in my cheek&#151;is that &#163;100 billion corresponds to the proceeds of 2,000 top-of-the-range bank robberies. And for anyone who thinks that there is something tricky about quoting the top 1 per cent, the share of the top 10 per cent in the UK also rose from 28 per cent in 1979 to 40 per cent before tax in 1999&#151;that is &#163;350 billion&#151;and from 26 per cent in 1979 to 36 per cent in 1999 after tax&#151;that is &#163;270 billion. That trend has certainly not been reversed, if one reads company reports.
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>Britain is unique in the EU in this huge growth of differentials at the top. In an important study comparing Britain with the Netherlands&#151;an economy with a similar degrees of openness to that of the United Kingdom&#151;Professor Tony Atkinson, with his unchallenged reputation in this field, found that their top 10 per cent shares were absolutely unchanged between 1979 and 1999, at 28 per cent before tax and 24 per cent after tax; in other words, a huge way below ours. Indeed, Britain now finds itself with Spain, Greece and Portugal in a distinct group at the end of the European inequality league table, with the Nordics <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_92"></a>

being at the other end. Incidentally, the latter are collectively the winners of the world competitiveness index. To those who say that this explosion of top incomes is the specific result of innovation and generally brilliant performance, the only answer in Lancastrian is, &quot;Pull the other one!&quot; Do the Dutch, Swedes and Finns not innovate as well?
</p>

<a name="60227-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>I am looking forward to this short debate. I saw reports that David Cameron was making a speech about a one nation approach to social and economic progress under the banner &quot;Young Etonians for Social Justice and Equality of Opportunity in a Globalised World&quot;. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, who I welcome onto the Front Bench for this debate, will be able to give us more details.

<a name="60227-26_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord Bishop of Worcester:</b>  My Lords, I am sure that I speak for a number of noble Lords when I say that although we may not be a very full Chamber, but the importance of this topic is none the less much greater than the attendance would suggest. We are dealing with a phenomenon that will decide not only our future, but that of our children and grandchildren. We are dealing with a phenomenon which, as the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, has so eloquently said, is constantly being described in terms that make it sound like the tide coming in&#151;something that we can do absolutely nothing about.
</p>

<a name="60227-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>I remember a family friend&#039;s child&#151;brought up in a strictly urban setting&#151;was given a set of tide tables for a part of the Isle of Wight, where we were, and said &quot;I don&#039;t expect they keep to them&quot;, imagining that, like buses, they were subject to human control. Globalisation has to be. We are not experiencing something totally new. After all, there have always been superpowers with global ambitions&#151;and we as a nation have been particularly prominent in that field.
</p>

<a name="60227-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>Globalisation is not something to be either afraid of or surprised about. What has changed, I venture to suggest, is that technology and the explosion in the world money supply has meant that money itself has far more power in the human economy than it has ever had before. Possessions were previously measured much more in terms of static objects such as houses and estates. Now they have numbers and they move very fast. Since the oil price rises of the 1970s and since the explosion of plastic and other computerised technology for the manipulation of money we now find money much more determinative of people&#039;s attitudes and much more prominent in their ambitions. People have always wanted to be wealthy, but the fact of the power of money makes a huge difference to how wealth is conceived and how wealth is manipulated. That is exactly what gives rise to the phenomenon to which the noble Lord has drawn such eloquent attention.
</p>

<a name="60227-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>When the Doctrine Commission of the Church of England produced a report called <i>Being Human</i>, a report on the character of human being in our time, it thought it necessary, as well as having obvious chapters on things like sex and power, to have one on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_93"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 93</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

money. It did that not because it did not realise that what the Scriptures talk about is the love of money, but because it recognised that money had come to the point where it generates its own speed and its own love of itself. That is why we are at a time when it is crucially important that humankind takes control of this phenomenon. It is a world that is of course getting smaller; a world in which movement is faster; and a world in which we have the possibility of becoming more aware of one another and our effect on one another. But that makes it crucially important that we do not surrender to the view that this is like some global tide. It is actually within the realms of possibility that human beings should control their future and should take to themselves the advantages and possibilities of an increasingly global way of living. That means of course attending to the effects of what produces prosperity for some on the poverty and vulnerability of some of those most deeply affected in our own country and of course elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="60227-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>So, we need to overcome the polarisation which has existed between those who favour regulation, which is thought to be left wing, and those who do not, which is thought to be right wing. We need to discover ways of guiding&#151;not perhaps regulating but guiding&#151;that development, which is so crucial to us all. We need to find ways of capturing for humankind the values and the possibilities of humankind, the globalisation process. We are not here to stop it. We are not here to moan about it. We are here to humanise it and to make it our own, for the sake of ourselves and our children.

<a name="60227-26_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bhattacharyya: </b>   My Lords, this is an important debate and I thank my noble friend Lord Lea for raising the issue. Tacking poverty and inequality can only come from economic growth. Often when I hear people in Britain or Europe talking about globalisation I think they are missing the point. After all, what we call globalisation has generated huge economic benefits for Britain. Let us face it; some parts of Britain would be like the Sahara desert without the huge investments from the Japanese, the Germans or the Americans. Did they come to the UK and to Europe for lower labour costs? Of course they did not. They came to Britain for access to the market. In the process they have created large numbers of high-value jobs.
</p>

<a name="60227-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>We cannot pick and choose when it comes to globalisation. This is the new world in which we are living. Our best companies are doing well because of globalisation. Whether that is Tesco exploiting a global supply chain, Vodafone exploiting global markets, BP harvesting global resources or RBS making global investments. They are all succeeding in a global environment.
</p>

<a name="60227-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>The big issue today is the developments in Asia. Ten or 15 years ago the issue was the out-sourcing of some manufacturing from the US to the Pacific Rim countries. The debate was often expressed in terms of labour costs. The &quot;tiger economies&quot; are relatively small and with export-led growth, labour costs played a minor part, particularly in sectors such as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_94"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 94</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

electronics. But the current situation is different. And labour costs are not the be all and end all when it comes to decisions about where to locate production. The consequences today are of the opening up of China and India. They are not small &quot;tigers&quot;; they have markets that dwarf anything we have ever seen before.
</p>

<a name="60227-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>For manufacturers the motive for investment is not just about off-shoring production but about the desire to be a part of these new, fast-growing markets. Countries such as China and India say that if you want to sell it in our country you have to come and make it here. That is what their governments and their people want. For market access they require us to manufacture in their markets, generating jobs and purchasing power and a positive spiral of economic development; and why not? Is that not what we have been doing in Europe for many years? The route to success in this new environment has to be one based on partnership. Over the coming years we can expect, at best, sluggish economic growth. We have all got to pursue higher growth in these emerging markets. In other words, the only way to get good economic growth in Britain will be by riding on the back of the Chinese and the Indians.
</p>

<a name="60227-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>The world&#039;s economic centre of gravity has moved east. Sometimes I think our leaders in politics and industry are in denial about this simple fact. The old colonial days of trade following the flag have long gone. Access to these markets cannot always be by the simple route of exporting. There is no single way of entering these new markets. The key word is partnership. Establishing production facilities and distribution networks in a new market can be very time-consuming and costly. Firms will need to pursue alternative strategies ranging from mergers and acquisitions, to alliances and joint ventures if they are to gain access to these new markets.
</p>

<a name="60227-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>As I have said, the key word is partnership. This requires a far better understanding of these nations and markets than we have shown so far. After all, our export performance to China and India has not been particularly outstanding. Our competitors often out-perform us. We hear a lot about Chinese exports, but it is an importer too. Between 1999 and 2004 US exports to China went up by 159 per cent. From the EU countries we trail well behind Germany, France and Italy. Our export business with China is less than one-sixth that of Germany. Recently, one of the leaders of the UK business community commented that Germany was in a difficult position because it had not restructured its manufacturing economy. Would that be the Germany that in a joint venture, Shanghai-Volkswagen, now has one-third of the Chinese auto market, selling some 700,000 units in 2004?
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a> With India we start in a stronger position. Between 1996 and 2004 our exports grew at 3 per cent per annum&#151;not bad, until one realises that that is less than half the growth of the Indian economy. That is leading to the erosion of our market share. It is not just in cricket that we have to raise our game in Asia. Our response to the new Asia has often been neo-colonialist in character. We hear talk of a knowledge-based economy in which there is somehow a global <br>&nbsp;<br>

division of labour, a division that means that we do all the clever stuff&#151;the design, research and development&#151;while all the manufacturing is done elsewhere. There are two flaws to that argument. First, what is to stop the Indians or the Chinese from doing the higher added-value work? Last year, China produced 21 per cent of the world&#039;s software graduate engineers against 7 per cent for India and 5 per cent in the United States.
</p>

<a name="60227-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>A couple of weeks ago I was addressing the Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur, which is my alma mater. I first went there 50 years ago. Today it is ranked in third place in the global league for technology universities. Tell its students that they can only do the manual work! Furthermore, what makes us think that we can do without a vibrant manufacturing sector? Manufacturing is still a major source of wealth creation and we have to make sure that we are up there with Sweden and Denmark spending money on research and development and innovation. At the same time, we must attract the best people to come to this country and therefore we must make sure that the way in which they access our competitive markets for work is simplified. The Chancellor of the Exchequer must also make sure that the regulatory and fiscal environment in this country is good for every year for indirect investment.
</p>

<a name="60227-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>Therefore, in tabling the Question my noble friend was articulate in expressing his concern for the rise of inequality here in Britain: a concern I wholeheartedly share. As I have already said, the surest way to tackle poverty and inequality is from economic growth. If the UK is to continue to grow in the global environment we will have to leverage to some extent the economic growth in Asia to maintain growth here in the UK. That is the only way that we will be able to maintain downward pressure on inequality and poverty. Failure to do so can lead only to a rise in unemployment and inequality here in Britain.

<a name="60227-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Giddens: </b>   My Lords, let me too thank my noble friend Lord Lea for initiating the debate. It is always good to be in discussion with a fellow stalwart of the House of Lords tennis team as it goes on its all-conquering way.
</p>

<a name="60227-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>I first started studying globalisation intensively in the 1980s. That was about the same time that I left the academia bit and moved into a more political environment. At that time I could not get any political leader, politician or anyone else much to be interested in globalisation. Now the position has reversed: we cannot stop politicians or other people from talking about it. The result is that globalisation is often blamed for things that are not the result of globalisation, and other things are attributed to it that come from different sources. I am going to concentrate on the distribution of wealth in the UK. It is possible that globalisation has some impact on the distribution of wealth, but many other factors do as well, so it is a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_96"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mistake simply to concentrate on globalisation if one talks about the distribution of wealth and what one should do about it.
</p>

<a name="60227-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>What do we know about the distribution of wealth? We know, first, that this country is highly unequal. One per cent of the population owns about 32 per cent of total wealth. About 50 per cent of the population owns about 90 per cent of total wealth. We know that shareholding is even more unequal than wealth in general. Secondly, we know that the situation is worsening; that is, the distribution of wealth seems to be becoming more unequal in this country than it used to be. That is not the same as the distribution of income, incidentally, because the latest data on the distribution of income, measured usually by economists by the genie coefficient, show that the distribution of income has stabilised. Most people attribute that to government policy: for many years since the late 1970s it was increasing, but it has now stabilised.
</p>

<a name="60227-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>Thirdly, there is a possible connection between the increasing inequality of wealth and globalisation. It might be found in the so-called &quot;winner take all&quot; effect; that is, as corporations become larger, as they become global corporations, who leads them becomes more important; therefore those who lead them receive higher remuneration because there is more competition on a global level. That is much the same thing, one might say, as has happened in professional football, if you follow the events of the past 20 years or so since the setting up of the Premier League, where salaries have increased staggeringly. That is income, rather than wealth, of course.
</p>

<a name="60227-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>Does it matter what the top 1 per cent earn and what they do with their wealth, or their income? The new Labour approach so far has been to say that it does not matter too much. New Labour has concentrated on alleviating the position of the poor; it has raised about 2 million poorer people out of poverty&#151;a notable achievement. There is some sense in that, because there are far more poor people than rich people. Whatever you do to the top 1 per cent in terms of redistribution will not matter very much. Does it matter about the top 1 per cent? I think: &quot;Yes, you bet it does&quot;. The Government must take seriously overall inequality, not just the position of the poor. Therefore, we should ask what we can do to reduce the inequality of wealth that we have in this country.
</p>

<a name="60227-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>There are two or three things that one could consider. First, it would be a mistake to raise top levels of income tax. In fact, the top 1 per cent of income earners pay a greater proportion of tax these days than they did 30 years ago, when the top tax rates were much higher. Secondly, we can consider inheritance tax. A study by the Institute for Public Policy Research about a year ago suggested a more progressive inheritance tax. That is a sensible move and a sensible framework for it was suggested in that study.
</p>

<a name="60227-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>Thirdly, we can develop a more philanthropic culture in this country. It is not only the poor who should be good citizens; it is not only the poor should be told that rights carry obligations. Richer people <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_97"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 97</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should be told and should follow the same injunction. The wealthy in this country give away a far smaller proportion of their income and assets to charities than they do in the United States. You could argue that the UK gets the worst of both worlds, because it does not have high tax rates at the top but people do not give away much of their wealth. In the US, they give away enormous amounts&#151;more than would be attributable to high tax rates in continental countries; so it is a kind of voluntary tax. We are not very successful in that at the moment here.
</p>

<a name="60227-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>Fourthly, we could consider what happens in corporations, because corporate salaries are not necessarily the result of &quot;winner takes all&quot; competition; they could simply be the result of power. We know that there is not a close connection between the success of corporations and the money that the executives in those corporations get. We also know that the leaders of corporations do not bear the risk that they expect their employees to bear, because they are normally protected by pension systems when they take on a job.
</p>

<a name="60227-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>In conclusion, I have two questions for the Minister. Does my noble friend agree that we should be doing more at the top and that we should not just concentrate on poverty but that we should take seriously overall inequality, especially inequality of wealth, and strive if we can to reverse the trend of the past 20 years? Secondly, does he think that it is worth while following initiatives that Patricia Hewitt made when she was head of the DTI, when she set up schemes&#151;or tried to&#151;that would more closely connected the salaries of top executives with the performances of the companies that they run?

<p><a name="st_223"></a>
<a name="60227-27_spnew1"></a><b>  Lord Desai: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Lea has raised a very important Question, for which I am very grateful. I shall concentrate my few minutes on answering that Question. As my noble friend Lord Giddens said, inequalities have not worsened due to globalisation. If we really care about incomes, maybe we should care about median income or incomes in lower deciles.
</p>

<a name="60227-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>However, we are talking about wealth inequalities and the question is: why have wealth inequalities grown more in the UK than in comparable developed European economies? I have a brief answer to that, which takes off from what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester said. That is that it is a well known phenomenon that when income expands by a factor of X, trade expands by a multiple of X.
</p>

<a name="60227-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>Finance has expanded by a much larger proportion of income since globalisation&#151;deregulated capital markets&#151;happened. For example, there are many more stock markets across the world than there were before. In stock markets, there are many more assets, especially in hedge funds, and so on. So financial markets have grown. It is almost like a reverse pyramid effect: from a small base of income there is a large fanning out of financial markets.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_98"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 98</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>Therefore, those people who have access to the kind of skills that are financial-market related can make enormous incomes or losses. In the UK, for example, given the way in which our housing market is biased, people invest much less in equities than in houses so that, by the time you come to invest in equities, you must be very rich. Therefore, the benefits of financial market expansion accrue to those who take part in equity markets. The returns for people with skills in the financial markets in terms of their salaries and share options are a multiple of what anyone else can get in manufacturing or even in hi-tech services. There is a Chinese fan effect: because the UK has one of the most successful financial centres in the world, many financial services and corporations are concentrated here, and many multinational corporations prefer to have their headquarters here. So very large incomes that accrue global returns, as my noble friend Lord Bhattacharyya said, are counted as UK incomes.
</p>

<a name="60227-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>The income of the noble Lord, Lord Browne of Madingley, could be attributed to any of the 35 countries in which he operates, but because it is attributed to the UK, UK income statistics show that our income inequality is very large. I think that the noble Lord perfectly well deserves his &#163;30 million if he makes &#163;15 billion or so of profits&#151;I do not begrudge him that in any way whatever&#151;but the important thing that I want to explain is that the concentration of financial markets here, the welcome environment that the UK offers multinationals to locate here, and the very great activity of mergers, acquisitions and hedge funds here mean that, at the top of the 1 per cent or less of income distribution, people have opportunities to make enormous gains from capital market operations.
</p>

<a name="60227-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>Does that have serious welfare consequences? I agree with my noble friend Lord Giddens that it does not. One may not like to live in a society of great inequality, but I do not think that we still live in a society of haves and have nots. We have the haves, the have mores and the have much, much more than anyone elses. It is exciting that the UK has this financial capability, but if we wanted to kill it, it would be very easy to do so. One thing that governments are very good at doing is killing industry, but I hope that we do not do that.

<p><a name="st_224"></a>
<a name="60227-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, I too welcome the debate. I will concentrate more on the domestic than the global implications, and I shall put my cards on the table straightaway; I come from a political tradition that says that equality of outcome is as important as equality of opportunity. I am not quite sure where the Government stand on that.
</p>

<a name="60227-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>As my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall has said, when he and I were taught economics, the UK was one of the most equal societies in Europe; at the end of the 1980s, we were one of the least equal. It is true that there have been several welcome measures under this Government, such as a concentration on the least well-off, the minimum wage and the tax credit system, that have been designed, in part, to reverse that. But the net effect of all that effort and substantial public <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_99"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 99</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

expenditure is that we have just about halted the shift to inequality in income, but only just about held the position that we occupied at the end of the Thatcher era. Indeed, given the very top incomes, as my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall has said, it is not even that. So far as wealth is concerned, inequality has increased. That applies as much to post-tax income as it does to pre-tax income, and I am certainly not arguing that all this can be rectified by substantial redistributive taxation, although I think that we could with a little more of that.
</p>

<a name="60227-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>My first question to the Minister is: why is this happening? Is it because, as the title of the debate might imply, globalisation inevitably causes greater inequality in developed economies as we struggle to compete with India and China and so on, or is it because greater equality of outcome is indeed no longer an objective of public policy? Is it just that the Government&#039;s interventions to which I referred simply take a long time to permeate the system? Or is it, as my noble friend Lord Lea suggested, that British business and the British labour market behave differently from certain other economies? After all, other European economies are also subject to pressures from globalisation. I know that some people would argue that they have not coped with it as efficiently as the UK has. Yet, as the noble Lord, Lord Bhattacharyya, has pointed out, Germany is an infinitely better exporting nation than us and the Nordic countries have higher achievements in competitive indices than we have ever achieved.
</p>

<a name="60227-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>It is true that calculations of the distribution of income are just snapshots at any given time. There are those who would argue that it is not the snapshot but the question of social mobility that matters and those who used to argue that, although the United States was a clearly unequal society, mobility applied; therefore, inequality at any given time was not relevant. Unfortunately, that is no longer true of the United States: it never was true of the black or Hispanic populations, or other minorities, and it is true of an increasingly smaller proportion in the United States. Indeed, the US is not only more unequal in a snapshot sense than most of Europe; it is also one of the least socially mobile western economies. But if the United States is at the bottom of that league, the United Kingdom is close to the bottom.
</p>

<a name="60227-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>Why have social mobility and inequality not improved since the end of the Thatcher era, which I think most of us now recognise as a very regressive era in British public policy? Some of that is no doubt due to international pressures, but there are at least three areas of domestic policy that make a difference, particularly to the social mobility argument. I have had cause to underline in housing debates the degree of stratification in the housing market, which has led to ghettoisation and the prevention of people moving socially in that area.
</p>

<a name="60227-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>Education is a topical issue, but I do not think that either the proponents or opponents of the recent White Paper have given us a way to ensure that the education <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_100"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 100</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

system stops failing working class children. Intervention in the labour market and the minimum wage have been important, but the enforcement of minimum labour standards in other continental European countries is better and more effective than in this country.
</p>

<a name="60227-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>There are many versions of the European social model, but Europe has certainly delivered greater equality than either the United States or Britain. There are some lessons to be learnt, but we should also recognise that globalisation does not inevitably lead to inequality in our economy&#151;trade is based on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage. Therefore, there is no point in us trying to emulate Chinese labourers&#039; wages or boardroom salaries in Texas.
</p>

<a name="60227-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>All those policies are relevant. I end by asking whether it is at least possible to adopt one procedural measure: to check on each new area of government policy, as we do for gender&#151;rightly so, in view of the report today&#151;or race, and sometimes for region. Is the impact of that policy likely to increase or decrease inequality of wealth and income in our country?

<p><a name="st_225"></a>
<a name="60227-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Lea, has raised an important issue, which is something of a challenge to deal with in a five-minute speech. As a number of noble Lords have said, the starting point is income in aggregate: distribution of income has not shifted significantly, certainly over the past decade and during the lifetime of this Government. Over a number of decades, there has been a big shift in the relative importance of various sectors of the UK economy, which has had a significant effect on individuals.
</p>

<a name="60227-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>Noble Lords have talked already about the strain which our manufacturing industry has been under. Compared with manufacturers in the rest of Europe, we have done very badly in taking up opportunities presented by the growing economies, particularly in China and India. Over the past decade, German exports have increased by about 60 per cent and ours have not increased at all. Interestingly, our exports of services over the same period to those countries have increased strongly and it is in that area that we have a comparative advantage, although I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bhattacharyya, that we should not, as it were, cast manufacturing aside and say that we cannot do it. We are very good in some sectors and we need to look carefully at how to strengthen them.
</p>

<a name="60227-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>However, there is no doubt that globalisation offers more easy opportunities for Britain in the field of services. I declare an interest as a director of a brand design consultancy called Elmwood, which is based in Leeds and employs 50 staff. Recently we opened an office in Melbourne, where we are doing great work using a combination of locally recruited, British and Canadian staff. The company has a comparative advantage in some aspects of the design world and it is going to grow in no small measure internationally. Having operated in Australia and having been working in the United States, we are now looking to <br>&nbsp;<br>

operate in the middle&#151;looking at Asia on the way to Australia. So there are huge opportunities in the service sector that will continue to deliver significant benefits.
</p>

<a name="60227-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>One aspect of globalisation that has not been mentioned this evening is the effect of the increasingly free market in labour, particularly within the enlarged European Union. This is having a significant impact on the UK labour market. Just as I would argue with the noble Lord, Lord Bhattacharyya, and others that globalisation and the growth it brings has been beneficial, the effect of the growing numbers of Polish plumbers or Polish dentists and other ancillary workers in the health service coming into the UK economy has been beneficial. They have filled gaps in the market which we were unable easily to meet ourselves. Indeed, one of the huge successes of this Government is that, by introducing the minimum wage, the inflow of potentially very cheap labour has not resulted in very low wages, particularly in the public sector where many of these people are working.
</p>

<a name="60227-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Desai, about the importance and significance of the financial services sector in the City in pushing up both wealth and income at the top end. But, as with footballers where we are also global leaders, that has resulted in inevitably high levels of income. Is that acceptable? At one level I suspect that not much can be done about it, but equally we all feel slightly queasy at the thought of footballers earning &#163;100,000 a week or people in the business world earning many millions in a short period. A number of noble Lords have suggested how to moderate the growing inequalities of wealth&#151;if one shares the views of the right reverend Prelate, this is not how we want mankind and humanity to develop in the longer term. Trying to develop a philanthropic culture is important and the Government can take a lead in this. They may have their work cut out for them with some of the people we have mentioned, but it is a good start.
</p>

<a name="60227-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>Another approach is redistributive taxation. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, on the principle. My party has argued that a higher top rate of tax would be beneficial. It has the advantage that we might collect quite a large proportion of it. The noble Lord&#039;s preferred measure would be to introduce higher levels of inheritance tax. However, it has a major demerit in that the wealthier you are, the easier it seems to be to circumvent it. I am not sure it works. However, I agree with most noble Lords that looking at how to moderate excess at the top through a combination of moral persuasion and redistributive tax policy is something to which this House should return.

The noble Lord, Lord Lea, asked me to comment on the young Etonians. As an old Etonian, rather than a young one, I would not be impertinent enough to enter that frame.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_102"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 102</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>Impressive as all the arguments have been, I think it is worthwhile examining the question itself. It is a matter of both economic and social concern that there are still people living in poverty in the United Kingdom, as there are in many other countries of the world, especially those to which the noble Lord, Lord Lea, referred. No one seeks massive inequalities in the distribution of wealth. It is tempting to suppose that the crux of the issue lies in the distribution of wealth, but surely there is a greater virtue in improving the prosperity and well-being of the less-well-off members of society, rather than worrying about relative wealth. It is much more important for the poor to become better off than to achieve equality by making the rich poorer. That process has been proved to reduce the prosperity of all, in spite of what the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, has said. Surely the criterion on which globalisation should be judged is whether it has raised the general standards of wealth and prosperity for the greatest number of people and whether it has contributed to an improved life for the poorer members of society.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>Globalisation has come about from the removal of trade barriers and tariffs. Their progressive removal, often against much opposition, has encouraged international trade, which in recent years has been accelerated by the development of technology. Trade barriers were created to protect vested interests from outside competition which would force prices lower and create pressure to improve quality. With no outside competition, prices could be maintained at artificially high levels and there was no impetus to produce better quality goods. The effect of those higher prices was to restrict the availability of the protected goods and services to the better off. The poor could not afford, or would find it difficult, to pay higher prices. It is very much to its shame that the European Union persists in the practice of trade barriers, notably in agriculture. If it were not for the historic protection of European farmers against the forces of competition from elsewhere in the world, the price of food could tumble by as much as 50 per cent. It is an example of how restrictive trade practices work to keep prices up.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>Where trade has not been obstructed, the less well off have benefited. With the reduction in tariffs and trade barriers came globalisation, but with globalisation there was a massive increase in the availability of cheaper and higher-quality goods, as well as the arrival in this country of international corporations, as pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Bhattacharyya. To see how consumers benefit, your Lordships need only think of the impact on all our lives: mobile telephones, shoes, clothes, cars, cameras, televisions&#151;an endless succession of goods. The same competition will help to reduce costs in service industries.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>It is impossible to tell precisely and objectively whether the abolition of trade barriers and the resulting globalisation has, in the short term, created greater inequality of income and wealth in the United Kingdom. It has certainly made a massive <br>&nbsp;<br>

contribution to the improvement in the well-being of the less well off, who can afford things their parents and grandparents could only have dreamt of.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>Globalisation, in spite of its faults, has been a force for good. Far from reversing the long-term trend towards equality, globalisation has been one of its driving forces and it would have been prevented or reduced by maintaining trade barriers. Where trade barriers have been maintained, it is the poor who pay the price, from farmers in Africa to Mr Mandelson&#039;s proposed tariff on leather shoes, which will restrict their availability to those on tight budgets.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>The contributions to the debate have been impressive. I doubt whether there is much division over our objectives. We all want a more prosperous world. We all want an increasing number of people to enjoy the affluence that most take for granted.

<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>There is no standard definition of globalisation. Typically the term is used to describe the increasing integration of world markets. Technological progress and the rise of emerging markets have driven increasing international flows of goods and services, including finance, to which my noble friend Lord Desai made reference; people and resources; and ideas and culture. Most commentators judge that the present wave of globalisation started in the late 1980s. Globalisation and technological progress are the key drivers to rising prosperity in the UK, the EU and the rest of the world. Over the last 50 years world trade, which the noble Lord, Lord Howard, spoke about, has expanded some 75 times.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>Globalisation has the potential to generate substantial economic benefits. Production and resources can be allocated around the world in the most efficient manner. Technology can also be distributed more widely, increasing the productivity of the world&#039;s workers. My noble friend Lord Bhattacharyya spoke with great conviction and expertise on this matter. Developing countries are also now playing an increasing role, and accounted for 29 per cent of world trade in 2001. Indeed, one of the key successes of the UK&#039;s recent presidency of the G7 was to convince the other economic powers to commit to further trade liberalisation so that developing countries can grow faster. Emerging economies account for an increasing share of global output, trade and investment.

<a name="60227-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>The Government are committed to promoting further economic openness, and to an ambitious pro-development conclusion to the current Doha development agenda round of trade talks by the end of this year. If all merchandise and agricultural trade were freed, the world economy would be boosted by nearly $300 billion per year by 2015&#151;more, if trade in services were also liberalised. Properly managed&#151;as the right reverend Prelate reminded us, it is not just a question of letting the tide come in&#151;globalisation will also help the Government to achieve their economic targets of improving the UK&#039;s productivity, and thus people&#039;s welfare and prosperity. It will encourage UK firms to concentrate on those sectors of the economy where we have an advantage over our international competitors. It will give firms access to new technology and reward them for their innovations.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>Globalisation will also provide consumers with a greater choice of goods and services at lower prices. Around the world, those countries most open to the global economy are growing the fastest. We also need further globalisation to help developing countries and provide them with access to rich countries&#039; markets. In agriculture alone, barriers prevent developing countries earning up to $75 billion a year, significantly more than current aid flows. That is why the G7 under the UK presidency agreed to work to further liberalise world trade.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>Lower trade barriers to poor countries is a necessity, but not a sufficient condition for those countries to reach their potential. Problems of capacity also need to be addressed, such as trade-related infrastructures like roads, ports and customs, and, more importantly, the basic systems that help to keep populations healthy and well skilled. To help countries invest in capacity, the Government have increased aid flows, and UK aid will reach nearly &#163;6.5 billion a year by 2007-08. In 2005, under the UK presidencies of the EU and the G8, the international community has committed to raise an additional $50 billion of aid by 2010, and to cancel 100 per cent of the multinational debts of the world&#039;s poorest countries.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>Even though globalisation has the potential to benefit everyone, there have been increasing concerns, some expressed tonight, about its impact. People fear the changes globalisation will cause, even though these changes are rational and probably inevitable in the long run. As this debate shows, there are worries that while globalisation might generally promote faster economic growth, this may be at the expense of greater inequality. Inequality in the UK has risen since the 1970s. During the 1980s the income gap between high and low earners grew significantly. The gap stabilised in the 1990s and has since shown no firm upward or downward trend. Several noble Lords referred to that, including the noble Lord, Lord Newby, the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, himself, and the noble Lord, Lord Whitty. Some academics have recently found tentative evidence that the income of the poorest people has started to recover slightly, relative to top earners. However, the gap between top earners and those in the middle of the distribution has continued to widen. The relatively <br>&nbsp;<br>

better performance of the low paid could possibly be due to such measures as tax credit, referred to by a number of speakers today.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>I would like to deal with the issue raised, in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, about the pay and pensions of top directors. My noble friend Lord Giddens also posed questions about this. It is crucial that our top businesses have top managers if they are going to perform internationally and if our economy is to grow. For companies to attract, retain and motivate people of the right calibre and experience, they have to pay the going international rate. However, it is important that directors are held to account for their actions and that their pay reflects their performance. World-class pay should demand world-class performance. Ultimately, it is for the companies&#039; owners&#151;the shareholders&#151;to judge whether this is the case. It is not for the Government to determine or dictate directors&#039; levels of pay.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>However, the Government do have a role in ensuring that a framework is in place that allows shareholders to exercise their influence effectively on companies&#039; remuneration policies. That is why the Government introduced the Directors&#039; Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 to improve transparency and make directors more accountable to shareholders, and why we are working with the Financial Reporting Council in implementing the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. These are matters I know we will debate further during the passage of the Company Law Reform Bill. Recent data shows that this approach is having some impact in moderating pay at the top and certainly making it more closely related to performance.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>Wealth inequality has also continued to widen and is greater than income inequality. We would expect the distribution of wealth to be more unequal than that of income, because a large part of wealth inequality is due to the accumulation of houses and other assets as people age. As such, much of the wealth gap is between young and old people, not rich and poor. Economists, however, are unsure of the role globalisation has played in the widening of inequality. My noble friend Lord Giddens challenged this mantra. Much of the rise in equality is due to workers with the skills and education wanted by today&#039;s economy receiving much higher wages. Although the income of workers without the new skills is still rising, some groups have fallen behind over the last 25 years. The academic consensus seems to be that the growth in this skills premium is mostly due to technological progress. Workers today need to know how to use the new technology, particularly the new information technology. There is little evidence linking globalisation, specifically, to rising inequality. It is also interesting to note that while many people seek to stop globalisation because of fears about inequality, few have sought to slow the development of new technologies, which seem to play more of a role in widening the income gap.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>While this Government are committed to globalisation, we also recognise that it can create challenges for some groups. Even as the economy <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_106"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 106</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

expands and exploits the opportunities unlocked through greater trade, some businesses will find it difficult to deal with increased international competition. Businesses in the low-skill sectors will find the competition particularly intense. This inevitably means that some workers will leave present jobs and will need to find work elsewhere. They may find that they need new skills to compete. Without proper economic management globalisation could lead to greater inequality but that does not mean that we should attempt to turn back globalisation and protect our businesses from the rest of the world. Experience in this and other countries has shown that protectionist policies are costly and ultimately ineffective. Restricting access to our country&#039;s markets would also go against the commitments this country has made to the developing countries.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester said that humankind should take control of this process. I agree. The approach the Government have adopted is to increase flexibility in the economy so that business and workers can respond to new opportunities and shift the expanding areas of our economy. It is critical to ensure that flexibility is accompanied by fairness through polices which support individuals through periods of change. The New Deal in particular has helped over 3 million people find work. In parallel with changes to free up the economy, social policies have been introduced that provide support without blocking change. The tax credit is one example. As a result of personal tax and benefit measures introduced since 1997, from April 2006 families with children will on average be &#163;1,500 a year better off and families with children in the poorest fifth of the population will be on average &#163;3,350 a year better off. To spread wealth more widely the Government seek to make saving, assets and wealth ownership accessible to all and so give opportunity to the many, not the few.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>My noble friend Lord Whitty posed a question about procedural matters. He asked whether the Government had to assess the impact on inequality of new initiatives that came forward. That is an interesting proposition. In some respects it would be very easy to measure the impact on inequality of a measure such as a tax change, a tax credit or a pension credit change. The impact of investment in education, science and skills is less easy to spot immediately. That is a dynamic process. However, it is an interesting thought that is worth developing.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>In the longer term we need to ensure that this country has the skills needed to successfully compete on the international stage. To ensure our skills base the Government have invested in education and will continue to do so. Over the past 10 years the proportion of graduates in the labour force has grown from 19 per cent to 26 per cent. Since 1994 the number of people with no qualifications has fallen from 21 per cent to 14 per cent.
</p>

<a name="60227-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>If measures are taken to increase the country&#039;s flexibility to adjust to change, including investment in infrastructure and better regulation, and by investing in our skills, innovation and science base, <br>&nbsp;<br>

globalisation can drive growth in this country, as it is around the world, without eroding the progress this Government have made on reducing poverty and tackling inequality.

</p>


<p><a name="st_228"></a>
<a name="60227-30_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </b>   moved Amendment No. 307:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a>Page 22, line 28, leave out subsection (2) and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_10"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   In paragaph 1, for sub-paragraphs (2) to (6) (constitution of National Park authorities) substitute&#151;

<br>
&quot;(2)   A National Park authority shall consist of an appropriate balance of national and local members, consisting of&#151;


<br>
(a)   a specified number of directly elected members who live or work within the National Park boundary; and


<br>
(b)   a specified number of other members to be appointed by the Secretary of State;


<br>
and &quot;specified&quot; means specified in the relevant order.


<br>
(3)   The total number of elected members must exceed the number of other members having regard to the minimum proportions for the Secretary of State&#039;s appointees as described in subsection (4) below.


<br>
(4)   The total number of members who are appointed by the Secretary of State shall&#151;


<br>
(a)   as respects any National Park authority for a National Park in England, be a minimum proportion of 25 per cent;


<br>
(b)   as respects any National Park authority for a National Park in Wales, be a minimum proportion of 25 per cent.


<br>
(5)   The Secretary of State shall consult all relevant authorities and interested bodies in specifying the number of local authority members, parish members and other members to be appointed by him in the relevant order.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_229"></a>The noble Baroness said: The main difference between the present system and that which this amendment proposes is that the proportion of national park authority members who do not represent the national interest shall be directly elected. I reiterate my interest as a vice-president of the Council for National Parks. This is not the view of that body.
</p>

<a name="60227-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>However, we on the Liberal Democrat Benches believe that, given the increased social and economic duties of national park authorities and the fact that they now have full planning duties, the national interest should constitute no less than 25 per cent of the membership of the national park authority&#151;that would safeguard all the national interests&#151;and that the people best able to represent the social, economic and environmental interests of the park as a whole are those people who live and work within the park.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_108"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 108</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>In the same way as one would expect members of any other local authority to either live or work within the area they represent, we believe that this should equally apply to those representing a national park. At the moment, a national park member may live 40 or 50 miles or more from the park, even though they are an indirectly elected member. While many may absolutely have the parks&#039; best interest at heart and may do their best at representing it, there is no doubt that it makes a difference if you do not live or work within the park. We expect people to be representative of their local authority because they understand how that community works&#151;they understand its wishes and desires. How are national park members different from local authority members? It is true that you could end up with the parish council members from within the park, but those who are from the principal authorities&#151;the district and county councils&#151;could live outside the park. Then, there are the national members as well, so you could end up with a situation where very few people either lived or worked within the park but could still be on the national park authority. As the Government take forward the legislation, this is an appropriate moment to look again at the issue. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_230"></a>
<a name="60227-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dubs: </b>   I wonder whether I am the only member of the Committee speaking in the debate who is not on one local national park body or another. I have no such interest to declare although my home is in a national park, in the Lake District.
</p>

<a name="60227-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>What is it that we expect of the members of the national parks authorities? What contribution do they bring, or ought they to bring, to the work of national parks? It is right that we should be seeking a wider mix of membership. That was supported by the various reviews that have taken place, both in England and in Wales, where wider membership was supported and indeed the consultation process suggested precisely that.
</p>

<a name="60227-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>However, we have a departure from an important principle in the way in which the Bill is now drafted, in Clause 57. The Bill will give a future Minister or Secretary of State enormous discretion to change the numbers of persons in membership of a national park authority. That means that the Minister or Secretary of State will have enormous powers to change the membership and balance it in one way or another. I would have thought that that is not desirable. I understand that the department will say, &quot;We need flexibility to deal with future contingencies&quot;. That is fair enough; one does not want to tie the department or the Government in such a way that any slight change in circumstances will require new primary legislation. However, Amendment No. 307A gives the Minister the necessary discretion while at the same time ensuring that there is a proper mix.
</p>

<a name="60227-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>Why is the mix important? It is important because national parks are not just local bodies serving people in the local area. National parks are, by their very name, national bodies which provide a service and provide facilities for people from all over the country. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_109"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 109</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

That is why so many people travel to the national parks for their leisure and recreation. It would be rather limiting to say that we do not need national members but should simply appoint people on a very local basis. I am not saying that the Government have that in mind but my concern is that the very wide discretion that the Government are taking upon themselves in Clause 57 may well work against having the sort of membership mix that is conducive to the effective running of national parks.

</p>




<p><a name="st_231"></a>
<a name="60227-30_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   I apologise to the Committee because I did not hear the opening remarks of the noble Baroness, but I did come in at the tail end of her speech. I am bound to say that on balance I prefer the amendment of the noble Lords, Lord Dubs and Lord Judd, to that of the noble Baroness, merely because I am not sure what the noble Baroness means by,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a>&quot;a specified number of directly elected members who live or work within the National Park boundary&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>Does she mean directly elected members of parish councils, district councils or county councils? Or does she actually mean that there should be elections to the park authority?
</p>




<p><a name="st_232"></a>
<a name="60227-30_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   Just to clear that up, I mean directly elected to the park authority, like to any other authority.
</p>




<p><a name="st_233"></a>
<a name="60227-30_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   That slightly changes my perspective. The idea of having directly elected members to the park authority is very interesting. It considerably alters the concept of local democracy, particularly in view of the fact that there would be an immense potential for conflict between the elected members of the park authority and elected members of the parishes and county councils within it and around it. However, that is nothing new because there is inevitably in life already conflict between members of county councils, members of district councils, and members of parish councils. From time to time there are wonderful occasions when they all reach agreement; that is the nature of democracy. If we are talking about directly elected members of park authorities, that would be a considerable change in the way that this works, and it would give the parks authorities considerably more direct interest in their communities. It would represent a considerable strengthening of the democratic process for national parks. If that is what we are talking about, it is almost a revolution. It is a real and major change. I have always been a big believer in democracy. I find that proposal quite attractive and of considerable interest. I wait with interest to hear the Minister&#039;s reaction.
</p>




<p><a name="st_234"></a>
<a name="60227-30_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   It always upsets me when I find myself not in total agreement with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. Wherever we sit in this House, we have the utmost regard for her dedication and commitment to the issues that we discussing. Frankly, I am bemused by part of her proposal. Naturally, I am delighted that she is in line with part of the amendment put down in <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 110</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

my name and that of my noble friend Lord Dubs, but I am a bit bemused by the rest of her proposal. I always looked at the Liberal Party as one that regards itself as the praetorian guard for the principle of local government and local democracy. It seems to me therefore that the best way in which the views of the local community can be represented in the administration of the parks is to see the local authorities&#151;whether local councils, parish councils or district councils&#151;represented in the way that is now provided for. I do not quite see what this new embellishment on democracy would achieve that is qualitatively better than concentrating on that.
<a name="time_29"></a>
<a name="60227-30_time1"></a><h5>9.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60227-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>I warmly support my noble friend Lord Dubs in his objectivity as someone who does not carry any responsibility in a park body; official or unofficial. It is incumbent on us all to remember that the parks are national parks, as my noble friend emphasised. They are there for the recreation and regeneration of the people of England and Wales as a whole. As the pressures and stresses of society increase, they become more important as a resource of this kind. It is therefore tremendously important to ensure that, in their administration, the interests of those from the rest of the nation who enjoy them are well represented and ensured. I am worried about the Government&#039;s proposal. If one took an extreme example of how the cookie might crumble, it is not impossible that you could have a local authority element of 95 per cent, and that would leave precious little room for those who were supposed to represent the general public as a whole by being the national members.
</p>

<a name="60227-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>I have already paid enough compliments to the Minister this evening. He knows how much I admire him and how much I am behind this Bill, whatever my sense of bereavement and grief at having been denied the opportunity to support him on specific legislation this evening. I would like just to make this suggestion to him. I am sure he will agree on reflection that what is now being proposed by the Government was not a matter for consultation in the context of the recent reviews of the English and Welsh national park authorities. That means that the reservations and hopes expressed today become all the more important because they represent a very considerable body of opinion in the country. While I would not therefore necessarily look to my noble friend to concede the point tonight, I hope that he will, with his usual goodwill, give a real undertaking to the Committee that he will take away this point about a 25 per cent guaranteed national membership, think about it carefully, and bring back some constructive proposals of his own on Report.

<p><a name="st_235"></a>
<a name="60227-31_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I rise briefly to comment on one or two matters. We on these Benches are also concerned about the wide discretion that this government amendment proposes. We recognise and accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that they are national parks. However, I think that having a 25 per cent proportion seems to be commonly agreed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_111"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 111</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and is the right one to aim at. If the amendment requires directly elected members to the authority, I have to ask the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, who will be in that election process? Is it everybody who lives in the area, or is it down to the parish councils, or the district councils or the county councils which fall into that particular area? Secondly, if we are going to have more national parks&#151;and obviously the case of South Downs is still outstanding&#151;that covers a great number of local authorities. How will they decide who will or will not be elected?
</p>

<a name="60227-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>When the issue was debated in another place, Jim Knight, the Minister, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a>&quot;We are considering the mix of members, not the number of them, which will be set in secondary legislation&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee A, 30/6/05; col. 239.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>We have a chance here in primary legislation to get it right. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify that, because I am somewhat alarmed if it is to be left to secondary legislation when there is a chance to set it in primary legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_236"></a>
<a name="60227-31_spnew1"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, for not being in the Chamber when he moved his amendment. I have read it with interest and I would be curious to know why he thinks that it is appropriate for the Secretary of State to be responsible for appointing parish members. I ought to know the current legislation, but I cannot remember whether parish councillors are appointed by the Secretary of State. I do not think they are. To the best of my knowledge, I think a nominee is appointed by the parish council, which seems to me the correct way of doing it. One thing is absolutely certain. Since parish councillors were introduced on to national park committees, it has made a great deal of difference and brought a much greater local democratic process into the system. But I am curious to know why the noble Lord thought it was appropriate for the Secretary of State to appoint the parish councillors, rather than for them to appoint themselves.
</p>




<p><a name="st_237"></a>
<a name="60227-31_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dubs: </b>   The Minister can probably explain the previous legislation better than I can, but my understanding of the Environment Act 1995 is that the agency shall consist of not fewer than eight or more than 15 members, of whom three shall be appointed by the Minister and the others by the Secretary of State. I am not aware that the previous legislation was so specific as regards parish councils; I do not think that they were mentioned. The Minister might prefer to answer that point rather than leaving it to me.

<a name="60227-31_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   I come from Somerset where we have one national park, shared with Devon, and a number of areas of outstanding natural beauty. The interests of the residents of national parks are more important than those of visitors to national parks; after all, most of the residents live there all 12 months of the year and, if they were not there, there would be far less of interest, beauty and accessibility for the visitors to benefit from. I would like the balance tilted somewhat <br>&nbsp;<br>

in favour of the residents. Perhaps I should mention that national parks came into being as a result of a report from a commission chaired by Sir Arthur Hobhouse, who was a neighbour and friend of my father.
</p>

<a name="60227-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>Maybe one way out of the dilemma&#151;it was hinted at by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, who wanted a further period of reflection&#151;is that there should be at least a convention. Perhaps it should be referred to or incorporated in some way in the legislation, but its practical effect should be that the Secretary of State would only or at least usually appoint elected councillors&#151;and especially the parish councillors to which the noble Earl, Lord Peel, referred&#151;from the area of the park in question, not from the rest of the county or district so that those councillors are not actually resident or representing the people in question. I offer that as a conceivable way out of the difficulty.

</p>




<p><a name="st_240"></a>
<a name="60227-31_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   On that issue, the advice that I have received is that it is always the Secretary of State who appoints the nominees from the parish councils; he or she will do that in all cases.
</p>

<a name="60227-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>The two amendments are on an interesting subject. I garner three general principles raised by them, and I shall address them before I make some comments on the practicability of Amendment No. 307 itself. The first general principle, which is raised by both amendments, is that the primary legislation should specify that national members should always make up at least 25 per cent of an authority. The second general principle, again raised by both amendments, is that before laying an order to establish the membership of an authority the Government should consult not just the local authorities affected but,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a>&quot;all relevant authorities and interested bodies&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>The third general principle, which is raised only by Amendment No. 307, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, is that national park authorities should include some members&#151;perhaps a majority&#151;who are directly elected to that authority.
</p>

<a name="60227-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>Let me take those three principles in turn. First, I refer to the 25 per cent rule. That is the case for specifying in primary legislation that 25 per cent of each national park authority must always be made up of those other members whom the Secretary of State appoints, and who are often referred to as the national members to distinguish them from their colleagues who are drawn from local authorities or parish councils. The key consideration is not so much the 25 per cent figure itself, which is in any case consistent with current practice, but whether it is sensible for any level to be set in primary legislation, and whether that is a decision best left for secondary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_113"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 113</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

legislation, when the make-up of each individual national park authority&#151;one is different from another&#151;is being set by statutory instrument.
</p>

<a name="60227-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>The Government&#039;s clear view is that such decisions are best left to secondary legislation where they can be taken on a case-by-case basis, and can reflect the context in which NPAs are working at the time. The Welsh Assembly Government are preparing to consult on membership arrangements and have expressed the view that they would not want the Bill to pre-empt the decisions that they will take in light of their consultation.
</p>

<a name="60227-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>The second principle is whether the Government should have to consult more widely before introducing secondary legislation. Although the existing statutory requirement is to consult only the local authorities, it is already Defra&#039;s practice to include other consultees who may have an interest. In practice we are already doing what the amendment seeks. Perhaps it could be argued that no change to the legislation is therefore needed.
</p>

<a name="60227-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>I turn to the principle of directly elected members, which is again part of Amendment No. 307 but not Amendment No.307A. This is a well-worn issue, having recently been debated and rejected in another place. Directly elected members for England and Welsh park authorities was a subject discussed when the existing legislation was being enacted, and was looked at again in both the English and Welsh reviews. The issue has never commanded general support. Indeed, as the noble Baroness was frank enough to say at the start of her speech, neither the Association of National Park Authorities nor the Council for National Parks supports the idea.
</p>

<a name="60227-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>National park authorities are unique bodies. We need to recognise that and devise our approach accordingly. They have many of the characteristics of local authorities, including being subject to most of the generic local government legislation. They also have some features of a non-departmental public body. That duality reflects their dual responsibilities. They serve the country as a whole&#151;they are after all national assets and called national parks&#151;but they also have a direct responsibility towards those whose lives are spent in the park. The noble Lord talked about them in his speech.
</p>

<a name="60227-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>The current arrangements reflect their unique role rather well. At present, each authority has some members who have been elected to local authorities in the area, some members who have been recruited through a national competition, and in England some members who have been elected to parish councils. That mix gives them a broad range of skills and expertise that they perhaps need. It also ensures that they do not overlook either their national or local responsibilities. Is it na-ve to say that the real test of the current system is whether or not it actually works? It seems to us that it does. It certainly seemed to work to the authors of the 2002 Defra review of English national park authorities, who said that they were not persuaded that directly elected members would bring clear benefits. The separate review of the Welsh <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_114"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 114</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

national park authorities also found no consensus on this issue. I have already mentioned what the Welsh Assembly Government plan in terms of consultation. In short, and to end, we see no need for a directly elected component. We believe that to introduce one could unbalance the approach that has proved successful for many years since independent national park authorities were established.
<a name="time_30"></a>
<a name="60227-31_time0"></a><h5>9.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60227-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>Moving on from general principles, there are some drafting weaknesses in Amendment No. 307, which we fear is ambiguous and would not be workable. First, it is unclear whether it is intended for local authority and parish members to remain on national park authorities. The start of the amendment implies that they do not, yet they are mentioned in subsection (5). While the amendment would remove the part of the Bill which specifies that there are to be three categories of members&#151;local authority, parish and national&#151;perhaps inconsistency leaves in place those parts of the existing legislation which relate to each category.
</p>

<a name="60227-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a> Secondly, Amendment No. 307 does not define what working in a national park would mean. Would part-time or unpaid work qualify? Would a directly elected member lose his or her place on the authority if they lost their job? Thirdly, the amendment does not specify how direct collections would be run; I refer, for example&#151;and this point has already been made by the noble Baroness&#151;to the simple question of who would be eligible to vote. For those reasons, I am afraid that we cannot support either of the amendments tonight.

I am sure that he would agree that, back before women were given the vote, whether they should do so was probably called a &quot;well worn issue&quot; when it was debated time and again. Some issues of democracy are just that.

<a name="60227-32_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   That is probably&#151;in fact, definitely&#151;one to the Minister. But the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, made the point that the views of residents of the park are important.

</p>

<a name="60227-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>Given the wide-ranging remit of national park authority business&#151;which includes planning, consideration of where residents will have their homes in future, what sort of business will be allowed and so on&#151;I must ask Members who spoke against this proposition why that is any different from members of any other local authority. Is it right that people who live 50 miles away are making fundamental decisions <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_115"></a>

for those residents? That is what the indirectly elected members of county councils who live well outside the park boundaries are&#151;my husband was one of them when he chaired Exmoor National Park. I speak with no disrespect for what he, or anyone else outside parks who represented national park authorities, did, but the fact is that those who live and work in the park authority are best placed. On the argument about how you would qualify, those rules about whether you live or work there, and what happens if you lose you job and so on, are all well laid down in local authority elections legislation.
</p>

<a name="60227-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Judd, says that he is bemused. I know that he is never disingenuous, so I could not possibly accuse him of that. Nevertheless, this argument will be discussed again. It is right that residents should have a say. I was not aware that the first Scottish park has locally elected members elected by a specified park, but I am interested to hear that and will look into it further before report stage. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_244"></a>
<a name="60227-32_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   Perhaps I may just entreat my noble friend not to be quite as absolute as he sounded in his rejection of these amendments, and to go away and ponder some of the merit which they represent. In my view it would be good if he could come back with a constructive proposal on Report to meet some of the anxieties.
</p>

<a name="60227-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>I put it to my noble friend that what my noble friend Lord Dubs and I suggest in our amendment is a win-win situation because it retains flexibility for the future, which we are the first to agree is vital, but it also protects the national interests of national park authorities. I put it to my noble friend that there is not really room for complacency on this. It is not true to suggest that there is never a tension between the national interest and local interests. It is therefore, it seems to me, very important that, because of the national character of the parks, national representation is a guaranteed element within whatever equation is reached.
</p>

<a name="60227-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>My noble friend referred, I think, to the recent review of the Welsh national parks and the English national parks. It is interesting that the review of the Welsh national parks made no recommendation to change the mix of two-thirds local and one-third national, while the English review recommended more of a swing towards increasing national membership, with three-fifths local and two-fifths national appointees. It is presently of course a quarter for the latter. I hope that my noble friend, with his usual consideration, will feel able to go away and think more about this and perhaps come back to us with a more positive response at Report stage.

<p><a name="st_245"></a>
<a name="60227-32_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   Apparently, the definition of &quot;significant&quot; is still a problem so far as we are concerned. It was not placed in the 1949 Act and has been causing difficulties within the national parks. For the past seven years I have been trying to persuade the Government to define &quot;significant&quot; wherever it occurs in a Bill. I have already had a go on this in a series of sittings on the Commons Bill.
</p>

<a name="60227-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>The fact that the task of definition is not easy should not necessarily mean that it is not included. The effect of Clause 58 is to completely take off the brakes. On page 42 there is an interesting subsection which reads,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a>&quot;any increase attributable to this Act in the sums payable by virtue of any other Act out of money so provided&quot;.</p>

</p>




<p><a name="st_246"></a>
<a name="60227-32_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   Perhaps I may put in a brief word on this. I think that my noble friend would agree that the recent Defra review stated that the constraint does not appear to have presented serious difficulties. I believe that the review also said that provided the socio-economic duty continues to be in support of the purposes, there would be benefit in removing the constraint. I do not in any way oppose the Government&#039;s proposals but it would be helpful if my noble friend could make it categorically clear that the duty must be carried out in ways compatible with the purposes of the parks. With that assurance I hope it will be easier for us all to support him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_247"></a>
<a name="60227-32_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Clause 58 serves to remove an uncertainty in the existing legislation. Section 62(1) of the Environment Act 1995 sets out the duty of national park authorities on socio-economic development. It makes it clear that their socio-economic work should be linked to their purposes and should be carried out in co-operation with other bodies. It also says that they should not incur &quot;significant expenditure&quot; on this activity, but the word &quot;significant&quot; is nowhere defined. Defra&#039;s 2002 review of NPAs recommended that the uncertainty should be removed by deleting the reference to &quot;significant expenditure&quot;. We are now implementing that recommendation. We are doing the same for AONBs in paragraph 165 of Schedule 11.
</p>

<a name="60227-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>The alternative approach would have been to set some specific limit on what national park authorities might spend, but we felt that that would not be reasonable given the different circumstances of national park authorities. By way of example, Northumberland has by far the smallest population and so a small budget. Precisely because it is so sparsely populated it may have a greater proportionate need to spend on socio-economic matters than larger national park authorities. Equally, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_117"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 117</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a limit might have been seen as a target&#151;something that authorities should spend up to&#151;which is not our intention either.
</p>

<a name="60227-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>Our aim is rather to give the authorities the flexibility they need to support sustainable development in their areas; we believe that removing the financial constraint does that. I want to emphasise that other constraints remain; namely, that national park authorities&#039; socio-economic work should be linked to their purposes and should be carried out in co-operation with other bodies. That is in our view a neutral measure that simply removes an ambiguity and leaves responsibility for setting socio-economic spending levels with the national park authorities where it best belongs. It certainly does not imply any increase in grant at all and I agree exactly with what my noble friend Lord Judd said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_248"></a>
<a name="60227-32_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s response, but I would urge him and his colleagues to bear in mind that parts and in some cases maybe even the majority of the area of a given national park are already sparsely inhabited. Moreover, we know that employment in agriculture continues to fall and there is little reason to be seen for it ever recovering or increasing. Therefore, social and economic expenditure for the benefit of those residents of national parks who remain in place becomes year by year all the more important; it should not be whittled away and should probably be increased. I hope that that point can be given some further thought.

Will the authority be allowed to raise income from visitors by, for example, levying car parking charges or requiring walkers to buy an annual licence; or will it have to indent for a precept from local homeowners?

</p>

<a name="60227-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>Maintaining the waterways of the broads is a costly business and the navigation account is already severely stretched. If the funds in the navigation account were to be applied to non-navigation expenditure, the boating public would be subsidising the non-navigation functions of the broads authority and the navigation interest would suffer as a result. In view of the substantial increase in the fees that boat users already have to pay to the broads authority merely to maintain the navigations, the amendment seems unreasonable.
</p>

<a name="60227-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>It is my impression that the Bill is about maintaining a balance between the conservation interest, on the one hand, and other interests, such as the boat users, employment and all the rest of it, on the other.

Subsection (4) was inserted into the clause to prevent any increase in spending arising from the rewording of the first two purposes which did not&#151;in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Greenway&#151;relate to navigation from falling on either local authorities and thus, possibly, on their council tax payers&#151;in response to the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose&#151;or the navigation toll payers.

<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>In practice, we do not expect Clause 62 to lead to any increase in spending, but subsection (4) provides a guarantee that, even if it did, the effects would not be borne by the local authority or boaters, except where navigation issues were the cause of the extra spending.

as without subsection (4), it might just be argued that the particular interests of the local authorities and boaters would require this measure to be addressed through private, rather than public, legislation. It does not change navigation rules on the navigation account, saying merely that increases should not be allowed to make the Bill hybrid. So in practice, removal of subsection (4) would mean that the Bill would have to be referred to the examiners of petitions for private Bills on the ground that it would be a prima facie hybrid.

<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>Section 155(4) lists the categories of local authority that may be covered by such a scheme. County councils, which managed the national parks at the time of the 1989 legislation, are on the list of eligible authorities. However, in 1997&#151;1996 in Wales&#151;responsibility for the parks passed to independent national park authorities, but these new bodies were <br>&nbsp;<br>

not added to the list of eligible bodies. That treatment reflected a view that only charging or major precepting authorities&#151;in other words, those authorities with a separate formula spending share under the RSG system&#151;should be eligible. It also reflects the reality that national park authorities will rarely be responsible for the emergency phase of any incident.

<a name="60227-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>But it has created the potential anomaly that an incident in a national park which could have attracted Bellwin support before the advent of independent national park authorities might not do so now. Attention was drawn to this by the flash floods of last June in North Yorkshire; the North York Moors National Park Authority will receive some Bellwin funding, but it has had to go through the county council to do so. Amendment No. 309 and consequential Amendment No. 365, by adding national park authorities to the list of eligible authorities, will remove this potential anomaly, in effect restoring the pre-1997 position. I feel, having moved this amendment and spoken to the other amendments, that I really ought to declare an interest, as I was a member of the county council at the time. I beg to move.

<a name="60227-34_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </b>   moved Amendment No. 310:

<p>
</p>


<p>&quot;PART 5A BIOSPHERES RESERVES
</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_12"></a><br>
BIOSPHERES RESERVES

<br>
   Biospheres reserves, as designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, may, subject to the affirmation of the local authorities therein, be given by the Secretary of State a pilot status as regards the interpretation of planning and other ministerial guidance.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_260"></a>The noble Baroness said: During the passage of this Bill we have talked about national parks, AONBs and SSSIs. My amendment seeks to introduce biosphere reserves into the debate. I should declare an interest: I live in the Braunton Burrows biosphere reserve. As the amendment states, these reserves are nominated by the national government and then designated by UNESCO. We could do more with designated reserves than we have to date. In the UK we have eight reserves. Internationally, there are 440 biosphere reserves in 97 countries.
</p>

<a name="60227-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>Biospheres are very special landscapes or are of particular interest environmentally, but they also work very hard to balance that with the communities who live in them. In one way, they represent a particularly interesting approach to sustainable development. Because of their international nature, there is a lot of learning that can go on between them. Because it is late, I do not want to talk too much about exactly what <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_121"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 121</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is involved in a biosphere. However, we could make much more use of those that we have to progress some interesting ideas.
</p>

<a name="60227-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>I am aware that before 2007, Defra will undertake a review of the suitability and effectiveness of our biospheres. While that review is being undertaken, we should be aware that we have not perhaps made the best use of what could be a very exciting test-bed for sustainable development. In the past we have talked about national parks as a test-bed for sustainable development, but they truly cannot be because they do not contain very much industry, larger settlements and so on. Very often, biospheres have to contend with all the normal things of life, besides having SSSIs, special landscapes within them and very often large coastal and maritime areas.
</p>

<a name="60227-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>My amendment seeks to suggest that we could make better use of biospheres. The Government could choose to use them as pilot areas for looking at new ways of involving the community in planning and involving people in the environment and governance. They could also use them for some of the things that we often talk about in this House in airy-fairy terms, but do not have anywhere on the ground to develop them. Biospheres offer an exciting opportunity nationally, but perhaps their most exciting possibility is internationally at a time when we are trying to address climate change, biodiversity and co-operation between countries. I hope that in raising this issue, I may at least succeed in raising the profile and awareness of what biosphere reserves are about and that we may have an opportunity to debate them at greater length. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_261"></a>
<a name="60227-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   Whether or not my noble friend feels able to accept this amendment in the form in which it is presented, I hope that he will warmly receive the ideas behind it. There is a real issue here of the general public, in very general ways, beginning to understand some of the imperative of sustainable development, but not being able to see in specific ways the implications of that or how it can be furthered. The great opportunity presented by the biospheres is in their practical, real living situation. These larger concepts are made relevant to everyday life. The noble Baroness has tabled an imaginative amendment and I hope that my noble friend will feel able to respond warmly to the principle, even if he is not able to accept it.

<a name="60227-34_spmin0"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  This is a very interesting topic, but it would be difficult to go into it in great detail at this time of night. I wonder whether most of the national parks of Britain are not forms of biosphere. So far as I can see, they are concerned with integrating people with the landscape and, with luck, with sustainable development. We have a particularly individualistic definition of national parks in this country. The major items looked at are recreation and access, whereas the international definition of national parks is something very different, concerned mainly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_122"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 122</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with preserving nature and natural conditions. However, the noble Baroness has raised an interesting issue and I hope that we shall hear more about it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_263"></a>
<a name="60227-34_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   This is a most interesting concept and I was intrigued to learn that we already have eight biosphere reserves around the country. I would like it if they covered both the land and its adjacent sea because that would provide scope both for intelligent tourism and for scientific study, perhaps involving people from other countries.
</p>

<a name="60227-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>On the amendment itself, perhaps it is worth raising one or two niggling points of drafting. First, I wonder what the word &quot;affirmation&quot; used in the second line actually means. Does it mean that all the local authorities in the area, if there are more than one, have to give their consent to further action by the Secretary of State? Secondly, what does &quot;a pilot status&quot; as regards the interpretation actually mean? I am sure that it could be a useful tool, but a little further elucidation might be helpful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_264"></a>
<a name="60227-34_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   This clause introduces a provision for biosphere reserves selected by the UK and designated under UNESCO&#039;s Man and the Biosphere programme, to be given pilot status with regard to planning and ministerial guidance. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for raising the profile and awareness of the subject of biosphere reserves, UNESCO sites which aim to reconcile the conservation of biodiversity with its sustainable use.
</p>

<a name="60227-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>At present the three English sites&#151;Braunton Burrows; Moor House, Upper Teesdale and the North Norfolk Coast, and the other five UK sites for that matter&#151;do not fully meet the UNESCO criteria in that they are primarily designated for just a core zone and none has included complete buffer zones or transition zones indicated as necessary under the 1995 revised UNESCO criteria. This reflects the UK&#039;s approach to the selection and protection of wildlife sites whether they be at a local level, for instance national nature reserves, at national level, SSSIs or internationally&#151;Natura 2000 and Ramsar sites. For each of these, our approach has been to identify the main populations that require protection and draw a tight line around those to ensure that all parties know the area merits protection.
</p>

<a name="60227-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>Whereas many other EU member states and countries around the world have included within their statutory designations buffer zones and/or transition zones, as highlighted by the UNESCO designations, the UK&#039;s regulatory regime is such that this is not a necessary requirement to achieve the sustainable conservation protection of the sites. The UK&#039;s application of the EC Habitats Directive&#039;s network of sites, Natura 2000, highlights this approach.
</p>

<a name="60227-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>While Natura 2000 sites encompass the important habitats or species of concern, controls on activities that may impact on these are not limited by where they occur but by where the affect may be felt. In other words, the UK&#039;s approach is that the potential buffer zone to its protected area network is the wider countryside in general.

</p>

<a name="60227-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>Although, as speakers have recognised, a further review of the UK&#039;s network of biosphere reserves is due, I do not at this stage see any wildlife benefit from extending zonations. As the core area of the UK&#039;s current crop of biosphere reserves is already statutorily protected, additional designation by UNESCO appears unlikely to result in additional direct wildlife gain. That said, I recognise that indirect benefit may derive from this international accolade, as it may encourage other stakeholders to give greater consideration to their actions and their consequences. The regional approach of biosphere reserves also reflects landscape-scale approaches to conservation found in conservation policies at global to local levels, and can contribute to the delivery of biodiversity action plan objectives.
</p>

<a name="60227-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>On the basis that the current statutory designations on which the UK&#039;s biosphere reserves have been selected are already included within existing planning and ancillary ministerial guidance&#151;this is unlikely to change&#151;I do not believe that the proposed amendment will achieve any wildlife gain. On the contrary, it may actually increase duplication and red-tape which could detract from the consideration of the important wildlife sites on which the reserves are based. Nevertheless, the noble Baroness and my noble friend Lord Judd have raised some important points which I will ensure that Natural England will explore.
</p>

<a name="60227-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>On the basis that the aims of the biosphere reserves are already adequately addressed by the protection afforded to the statutory designations at their core, I hope the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment. If, on reflection, having read the debate, I have anything to add, I shall, of course, write to noble Lords.

<a name="column_124"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column 124</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Duke of Montrose, put his finger on the point when he said that there was international agreement about what a biosphere is. The fact is that there is no international agreement, except what constitutes national parks. That is what makes biospheres particularly interesting. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, that I wanted to include &quot;affirmation of the local authorities&quot; as they are the planning authorities, so they need to be fully signed up to the idea of the pilot status. What would be the pilot status? That would be for the Minister to decide.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>That is where the Minister&#039;s brief slightly missed the thrust of my amendment. Not only does it concern the wildlife aspects of the biosphere, because as she quite rightly said that is already very adequately protected, but it also concerns how the wider biosphere can interact, learn and do all those things that we talk about. Educational establishments can become involved, industry can sign up to its local SSSIs and so on. It is all that working together.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>Before tabling the amendment, I had a conversation with Sir Martin Doughty of Natural England. He has expressed an interest in this concept.

</p>


<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60227-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </b>   moved Amendment No. 246A:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 108, line 13, leave out paragraph (b).</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<a name="60227-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>The noble Lord said: With this amendment we come to Part 11 of the Bill, which is entitled &quot;Derivative Claims and Actions&quot;. This is another area that has caused some concern and about which we have had a good many representations from business organisations, such as the CBI, and from practitioners, such as leading firms of City solicitors. In particular, I put on record my thanks for the very helpful expert briefing that we have had from Maitland Chambers, in the shape of Mr Matthew Collings.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>I find this quite a technical area, legally, as I am not a lawyer. I am not even an accountant&#151;industry and commerce are where I have lived my life. Therefore, it would be very unwise of me to trade legal punches with as persuasive and experienced an advocate as the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General. In my experience, when one takes a Bill through this House, one usually finds some legal precedent, which is repeated like a mantra by the cognoscenti. When I was doing the Charities Bill, it was Re Resch, which was a dense piece of legislation. It was never quite clear to me why an Australian case involving private hospitals was the seminal case for public benefit tests in the United Kingdom, but let that be as it may.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>With regard to these provisions, the important case seems to be <i>Foss</i> v <i>Harbottle</i>. I am sure that the noble and learned Lord has probably forgotten more about that case than I shall ever know, so I shall cut to the chase in summarising what we see as the basic disagreements over Part 11.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>The Government have argued that the part as drafted does not change the law at all. That was the view expressed by the Minister, Mr Alun Michael, in his letter to the <i>Financial Times</i>, on Wednesday 9 November 2005, in which he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;It should not give rise to concern on the part of the millions of directors in this country who have high standards of conduct and make such an important contribution to Britain&#039;s economy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>That line was followed through by the noble and learned Lord in Committee on 6 February, when he said:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC2"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;We will come to Part 11, which deals with derivative claims and action by members, describing the mechanisms under which shareholders can enforce the duties on behalf of the company. I can say now that we do not see any reason why those provisions should increase litigation&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6/2/06; cols. GC242-3.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a> The representations made to us suggest a contrary view, and our amendments, all probing at this stage, are designed to test the Government&#039;s position and legal reasoning. I hope that in that way all interested parties will be able to see the two sides of the argument. In the absence of some Damascene conversion&#151;and I am having some trouble finding the road to Damascus on this issue&#151;I hope that after Committee stage has finished the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General might be prepared to have a meeting outside the Committee at which some of the more technical legal issues could be thrashed out to see if some common position with which everybody is comfortable can be reached. I rather doubt that it is helpful to swap heavyweight detailed technical arguments about derivative actions in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>I am sorry if I have irritated the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, by tabling these amendments&#151;and I understand his irritation. After all, he no doubt thinks that after eight years people might have made all their points before getting to Committee; but that is not how it has turned out. To put it in vulgar, non-legal terms, people who have spoken to us fear a double whammy. In Part 10, directors&#039; duties are widened, while Part 11 makes it easier for shareholders to commence actions against directors. There is concern. Is it justified? That is what we are trying to find out in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>I turn to the specifics of Amendment No. 246A, which concerns the first clause in Part 11&#151;Clause 239, on derivative claims. As we understand it, Part 11 is intended to put in statute the exceptions to the rule in <i>Foss</i> v <i>Harbottle</i>. Indeed, paragraph 480 of the Explanatory Notes refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;a new procedure for bringing such an action which set down criteria for the court distilled from the <i>Foss v Harbottle </i>jurisprudence&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>However, a number of representations made to us claim that this risks enlarging the scope of such derivative claims. Many have argued that Clause 239, rather than mirroring the common law as the Government claim, in fact goes further. The common law is uncertain. These provisions have not been much used and the outcomes have sometimes been conflicting, so it is hard to specify exactly what the current position is.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>These clauses seem to be mostly modelled on the &quot;fraud on the minority&quot; exception, where shareholders are permitted to bring a claim against the wrongdoers in the name of the company where the wrongdoers are in control of the company, so that the proper claimant, being the company, is improperly prevented from bringing a claim against them. There are other exceptions, such as where the act complained of is <i>ultra vires</i> or where it infringes the personal right of a shareholder. However, these seem more remote from the procedure proposed in the Bill.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC3"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>It appears from the case law&#151;I am quoting from Megarry Vice-Chancellor in <i>Estmanco (Kilner House)</i> <i>Ltd</i> v <i>GLC</i> from <i>Tolley&#039;s Company Law</i>, paragraph S4032&#151;that fraud for these purposes comprises,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;fraud for the wider equitable sense of that term, as in equitable concept of fraud on a power&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-35_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>Tolley also suggests in the same paragraph that fraud in this sense does not include pure negligence. Therefore, it seems that Clause 239, in allowing claims involving negligence, may in fact go further than the common law.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Overall, given the uncertain nature of the common law position, and since the provisions of Clause 239 cannot possibly take account of all the nuances reflected in the line of cases on exceptions to the rule in <i>Foss</i> v <i>Harbottle</i>, it is fair to say that the new statutory procedure may make it easier for shareholders to bring claims.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>I have not, of course, had the benefit of seeing the Attorney-General&#039;s speaking note, but I dare say that one of the arguments that he will develop is that the Government introduced this codification in the light of the recommendation to do so by the Law Commission. However, it is important to remember that this recommendation pre-dated the Company Law Review final report as well as the proposed new clauses relating to directors of companies in Part 10, which we have discussed previously. In particular, it pre-dated the concept of enlightened shareholder value that the Government have proposed to enshrine in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>In practice, derivative claims are exceedingly rare. It has been put to us that this codification, if passed as currently worded, will have a minimal positive benefit of clarifying a rarely used piece of law while having the damaging and far more significant effect of increasing shareholder litigation and reducing the number of people willing to take directorships.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>This first amendment would remove subsection (2)(b). Section 459 of the Companies Act 1985 provides a separate cause of action to shareholders where their company&#039;s affairs have been conducted in an &quot;unfairly prejudicial&quot; manner. Section 461 then gives the court wide powers to grant relief in respect of the matter complained of. There is, therefore, no place or need for a derivative claim as provided in Clause 239(2)(b) of the Bill&#151;the court has all the appropriate jurisdiction under Section 461.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>It has been argued to us that the existence of Section 459 is another reason why the codification of derivative claims need not take place: there is already a working method whereby aggrieved shareholders can exercise their rights. If this codification goes ahead, the Bill should not muddy the waters with such a reference to Section 459, which is a stand-alone procedure unrelated to derivative claims.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Amendment No. 249A seeks to make it absolutely clear that the jurisdiction of Section 459 and the process it provides do not in any way affect the new statutory basis for derivative claims. As I have said, there appears to be no need for a statutory basis for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC4"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

derivative claims, as they can effectively be brought under Section 459. It is obviously unfairly prejudicial for a director to act in breach of duty and cause loss to a company, and he can be made liable to compensate the company pursuant to an order under Section 461. The case law of <i>Lowe </i>v <i>Fahey</i> in 1996 is relevant here. We argue in these two amendments that it should be made absolutely clear that Section 459 will continue to operate as it currently does.
</p>

<a name="60227-35_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>I am afraid that I have spoken at some length, but I felt that it would be helpful on the first amendment in this part to explain our fundamental misgivings. This will enable me to be a great deal briefer on later amendments. I beg to move.

<a name="60227-36_spmin0"></a><b>The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith): </b>  I thank the noble Lord for explaining the nature of the concerns that he wants the Committee to explore. They do not come as a surprise to me, but it is helpful that the noble Lord has set them out in the way that he has. I shall adopt very much the same approach. I will address the detailed points as they arise under the amendments, but it may be helpful if I first make some more general comments about the Government&#039;s approach to this part of the Bill and seek to address the concerns that have been expressed about its operation. I say at once that the Government will be very happy to take up the request of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, for a meeting outside the Committee in order to explore some of these matters further. I am happy to say that that invitation will be taken up.
</p>

<a name="60227-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The noble Lord is absolutely right to say that it is the Government&#039;s intention to implement the recommendation of the Law Commission, which goes back as far as 1997. I have got it here. The key recommendation was that there should be a new derivative procedure, with more modern, flexible and accessible criteria for determining whether a shareholder can pursue an action. Although it goes back a number of years, the clear majority of those who responded to the several consultations on the proposals for a statutory derivative procedure have accepted that the Law Commission&#039;s proposals have important advantages over the common law derivative action. The proposals make it clear that the procedure is potentially available as a means of enforcing the whole range of directors&#039; duties&#151;including statutory fiduciary duties and the duty of skill and care&#151;and the procedural requirements for bringing a claim will be more accessible and more clearly set out.
</p>

<a name="60227-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>So what of the concerns? First, the Bill does not introduce any major change of principle to the law in this area. Although, as the noble Lord said, the derivative claim is not at the moment frequently invoked, it is a well-established mechanism by which shareholders can, in certain circumstances, bring an action in the name of the company. Secondly, it is a fail-safe mechanism rather than a weapon of first resort. It is important to remember&#151;I have made the point previously&#151;that the damages are paid not to individual shareholders but to the company itself, and yet it is the shareholders, the members who bring the action, who may be required to bear heavy legal costs.

</p>

<a name="60227-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Thirdly and importantly, there will continue to be tight judicial control of cases brought under the new procedure. Fourthly, a derivative action is not and will not be the same thing as an American-style shareholder class action brought in the name of a group of shareholders. Under the reforms of directors&#039; liabilities, introduced by the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004, to which I referred during the previous Committee sitting, companies may already indemnify directors against any liability incurred in respect of such actions, even if judgment is given against the director.

</p>

<a name="60227-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>We will need to return later to the changes caused by the procedural reforms introduced by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, that adjust the way that derivative actions are brought at the moment and which affect some of the procedural mechanisms in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60227-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>What do we expect? I repeat that we do not expect there to be a significant increase in the number of derivative claims as a result of putting derivative action on a statutory footing&#151;and the Law Commission did not expect that, either. There will continue to be tight judicial control of such cases and we would expect the judiciary to be circumspect when reaching decisions about applications; in particular, we would expect the judiciary to continue to take the view that a disagreement between members should usually be resolved under the company&#039;s constitution without recourse to the courts. The procedure that we have set out provides proper safeguards in that respect.
</p>

<a name="60227-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>We also expect the courts to respect commercial judgments; the procedure that we impose will ensure that. It goes without saying&#151;and this is what the Law Commission wanted&#151;that there should be greater clarity about how a shareholder may bring a derivative action. The existing tests have been widely criticised and we firmly believe that they need to be replaced.
</p>

<a name="60227-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>May there be cases where courts give permission for cases to continue which might not have been able to previously? Yes, there may be, but in cases where proper claims were improperly being frustrated, that would in general be a welcome development. Certainly I would not expect this to result in opening the floodgates or any other of the horrendous spectacles that I have seen mentioned in some places.
</p>

<a name="60227-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>We have to strike a careful balance between protecting directors from vexatious and frivolous claims and protecting the rights of shareholders. It would be dangerous to move too far against either of those interests. Have the Government got the balance right? We believe that we have, but we shall explore that matter further in Committee and at subsequent stages.
</p>

<a name="60227-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Against that background, let me turn to the two amendments. Both relate to the procedures already available under Section 459 of the Companies Act 1985. I understood the noble Lord&#039;s point and I recognise that these are entirely probing amendments about the need to ensure that Section 459 will continue <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC6"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to allow an application to be made for a derivative claim. That is what Clause 239(2)(b) achieves. It is common for a derivative claim to be brought under Section 459 in pursuance of an order of the court, but it is quite a lengthy and expensive procedure&#151;the Law Commission had much to say about that.
</p>

<a name="60227-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>We do not believe that the provision under Section 459 to permit a derivative action should be removed. We continue to believe that there should be two alternative routes by which a claim may be brought, either under Section 459 or under the new procedure in this part of the Bill. Under Section 459, the shareholder would be required to prove unfair prejudice. Neither amendment proposed by the noble Lord would improve the position. It is clear in the drafting that the availability of that route would remain.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60227-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for that full reply. I am sure that we will wish to avail ourselves of his kind invitation. I shall make just two points, the first of which I made in my opening remarks. The Law Commission&#039;s recommendation pre-dates quite a lot of events. That is one of the issues that have been brought to our attention. The world has moved on. How much the world has moved on in this technical area is hard for me to discern, but we would like to explore that outside Committee. My second point is the purpose behind the amendment. Although I understand what the Attorney-General said in reply, it has been put to us that Section 459 is not a derivative action in the true sense; it is a parallel and different sort of action. Therefore, to bring it under subsection (2) runs the danger of confusing two parallel possibilities for redress. Unless the noble and learned Lord wishes to respond to that point now, I suspect that this is as far as we can take the matter this afternoon. If that is the case&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60227-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for allowing me to take up that invitation. When one looks at the requirements in relation to derivative actions in the remainder of the part, it is clear that those are derivative claims under this chapter. The Section 459 procedure is in that respect left untouched. That is why I do not think that the clause muddies the waters in relation to Section 459. I say that in case it helps those who are assisting the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60227-36_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful for that further clarification. We will come back to this matter at a later date outside Committee. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="column_GC7"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC7</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<p>
<a name="stpa_31"></a>The noble Lord said: The background to the amendment is a briefing that we have received from Allen & Overy, the well-known firm of City solicitors. The amendment would closely mirror the common law in that the proposed statutory action would be available only where the company has refused to seek appropriate redress. It is not in the interests of companies for members to be able to bypass the board&#039;s usual decision-making process in this way, which is likely to increase the risk of unmeritorious claims being brought for tactical reasons.
</p>

<a name="60227-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>I anticipate that the Attorney-General will argue that this matter is covered by Clause 242(3)(e), but the argument has been put to us that that provision would come into force later in the process and that it would be better for this limitation to appear up front in the legislation. As drafted, the Bill is not sufficiently clear and explicit to achieve that purpose. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60227-37_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   Before we hear the Attorney-General&#039;s reply, will the noble Lord indicate whether the request to directors should have been made orally or in writing? I would prefer it that the directors had been requested in writing by a member of the company.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60227-37_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am always delighted to take suggestions for amendments to my drafting from any corner of the Committee. If the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, believes that that would clarify the draft and make it better, I am happy to consider it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60227-37_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   That exchange illustrates one of the concerns I have about the amendment as it stands, which is about placing rigid but possibly difficult-to-apply conditions on whether a derivative claim can be brought. One of the difficulties with the present law is the need for a shareholder to demonstrate, for example, that wrongdoers are in control&#151;that is one of the ways in which a derivative claim may be brought. The shareholder has to allege and then demonstrate that those whose actions he complains of are in control of the company and will not permit its name to be used as claimant in the action. That can become a protracted issue because, as the Law Commission observed, it is not clear what &quot;wrongdoer control&quot; means. As long ago as 1962, the Jenkins Committee stated that it would be extremely difficult to devise a satisfactory general provision expressing this concept and the remainder of the exception to the rule in Foss v Harbottle in wider terms. That is one of the reasons why the Law Commission proposed a new statutory remedy.
</p>

<a name="60227-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Having to demonstrate wrongdoer control does not appear in the Government&#039;s approach, nor have we included in Clause 242 a requirement that the directors have been requested to bring a claim and have decided not to do so. That requirement might give rise to a dispute about whether a request had been made, perhaps going beyond the question of whether it was in writing or made orally to how clear it was and whether the shareholder put sufficient information <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC8"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC8</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

before the directors so that they were able to determine whether the claim should or should not have been brought. Furthermore, what is meant by,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;have decided not to bring the claim&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>What would happen if the directors say, &quot;We&#039;re not saying we won&#039;t, but we are not, at the moment, saying we will; we want to do this and that and hear the other&quot;? One can see circumstances&#151;a cynic might say that we would see them regularly&#151;in which the directors might, without deciding not to bring the claim, spin it out in order to buy time.
</p>

<a name="60227-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>We think it is better to set out the requirements which the court must have regard to under Clause 242(3). They include a number of matters, one being that the company has decided not to pursue the claim. In circumstances where the company has decided not to pursue the claim, the court will want to look at why it decided that. There are a number of possibilities. One would be that it had made a bona fide decision that the claim ought not to be pursued. Such a decision would be very influential with the court, which may decide not to allow the claim to go ahead. Alternatively, the company may have decided not to pursue the claim for reasons that the court finds unsatisfactory, which might have the opposite effect. It would be for the court to determine.
</p>

<a name="60227-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>I would not want to bring in a rigid requirement of the sort that the noble Lord&#039;s amendment provides. However, civil procedure rules and pre-action protocols, which are now part of the new civil procedure world, might well require that some form of notice should be sent. That would be for after the Bill, but if notice were to be required, the court would, when deciding whether to grant permission, have regard to whether the pre-action protocol had been met and what its consequences had been. However, the Government are not minded to accept it as a requirement on the face of the Bill.

<a name="60227-37_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   Again, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General for that response. I accept perfectly the issue of clarity of purpose, how it might be achieved and how directors with malice aforethought might seek to string the matter out. Indeed, if we reached the situation of pre-action protocols envisaged by the noble and learned Lord, where there was an opportunity to stop the thing before it reached the fullness envisaged under Clause 242, I suspect that the concerns that we have been expressing would be met. As it is&#151;we shall be discussing this under Part 13 when we deal with some of the questions relating to resolutions of meetings&#151;there is a feeling that it should be possible to find a way to prevent directors from stringing it out unreasonably. Perhaps we can explore that then and also explore this issue further in our meeting outside the Committee. In the mean time, I am grateful for the response and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60227-37_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Goudie </b>   moved Amendment No. 247:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>Page 108, line 17, leave out from &quot;omission&quot; to end of line 20 and insert &quot;by a director of the company which is negligent, in default, in breach of duty or in breach of trust&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>The noble Baroness said: The words used in Clause 239(3) could potentially allow a member to sue a third party directly in respect of the third party&#039;s negligence. The wording indicates that such an action could be brought only where the director was also negligent or in breach of duty. That is likely to be an easily achievable threshold&#151;in particular, in the auditing context of financial reporting. An actual or alleged breach of duty by a director&#151;for example, preparing incorrect accounts&#151;could effectively be used as a springboard for the member to bring a derivative action against others. Another example would be an auditor. I do not believe that that is the intention of the Bill, but it would encourage nuisance claims against directors in order to open up a route to others. The amendment provides clarity that the clause enables a member to bring a derivative claim in respect of an act or omission by a director or another party.
</p>

<a name="60227-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>Would it be convenient for the Committee if I also dealt with the next amendment, which relates to Clause 239(4)? Does the Minister wish to respond to the two together?
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60227-37_spmin0"></a><b>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</b>  It is normal to declare a group at the beginning. If the noble Baroness wishes to speak to that amendment at the same time, she may do so if the Committee is agreeable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60227-37_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Goudie: </b>   I just wanted to check the position because sometimes it is easier to deal with amendments in that way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60227-37_spmin1"></a><b>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</b>  I do not think that that would be a good idea, and I advise the noble Baroness to proceed with Amendment No. 247.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60227-37_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Goudie: </b>   Sometimes people want to do it that way; it depends on the Committee. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60227-37_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My name is added to this amendment and I support what the noble Baroness said. I do so on a basis which goes slightly wider than merely the auditing concern. In particular, our concerns are about line 20, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;The cause of action may be against the director or another person (or both)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>It is not really clear to us how wide &quot;another person&quot; could be drawn. It seems to us that that drafting could leave people with a peripheral connection with the company in danger of having a derivative claim brought against them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60227-37_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   The amendment would have two effects. First, it would change the formulation in subsection (3), which is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;an actual or proposed act or omission involving negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by a director of the company&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The formulation follows that suggested by the Law Commission and it seems to us that it better captures all the circumstances in which a director should be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC10"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC10</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

liable for claims arising from breach of duty. The noble Baroness will, I hope, forgive me, as I do not at the moment fully understand what change she seeks to obtain with that part of the amendment. What the rest of the amendment does is much clearer; it would drop the sentence,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;The cause of action may be against the director or another person (or both)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>That is the point to which the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, particularly spoke. That follows very clearly from the Law Commission&#039;s recommendation that, in this circumstance, a claim against a third party should be possible. However, the claim under this head should be allowed only if there has been a breach of duty by the director.
</p>

<a name="60227-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>The Law Commission posed a couple of examples. One concerns circumstances where, by reason of a breach of duty by the director, a third party has come into possession of property of the company when, according to standard principles of law, it should be required to hand that property back&#151;for example, the property has been transferred in breach of trust or the individual has been giving knowing assistance. In those circumstances, it seems to us right that it should be possible for a derivative claim to proceed not only against the director, but against the third party&#151;otherwise the substantive and important belief would not be adhered to of getting back for the company from the third party the property that has been transferred. That is an example where it ought to be possible, in the Government&#039;s view and we think in the Law Commission&#039;s view, to have such a claim.
</p>

<a name="60227-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Another example given is that of a profitable company that is the victim of a tort by a third party. The directors might decide that they do not want to bring that claim against the third party. I ask the Committee to hypothesise that these directors, although otherwise committed to the well-being of the company, on this occasion do not wish&#151;for bad reason and ulterior motive&#151;to enforce the remedy for tort. They would in those circumstances be in breach of duty, but that breach of duty would not have given rise to the claim&#151;in the words of the Bill, the claim is not


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;arising from an actual or proposed act or omission . . . by a director&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>So it would not be possible in those circumstances for a member to bring a derivative claim against the third party.
</p>

<a name="60227-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I identify those two examples because they show why it is desirable that a claim should be capable of being brought in certain circumstances&#151;although certainly not in every case&#151;where the company has a claim against a third party and there has been at some point a breach of duty by the directors. Those are the reasons for wanting to keep the provision in the Bill. I should add that it needs to be clear whether it would be standard for the company to want to proceed&#151;and therefore, in the derivative claim, for the shareholders to want to proceed&#151;against both the director and the third party. It is important that the Bill should make it clear whether that could or could not happen.

<a name="60227-38_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   Will the Attorney-General clarify for a non-lawyer whether negligence, which the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness would strike out from the Bill, is covered in Foss v Harbottle? All the evidence that we have is that negligence is nothing to do with Foss v Harbottle. That is one of the areas where derivative claims have been widened. The matter may be too technical for us to raise at this point, but negligence is at the heart of one of the issues that has been raised with us: it is a new ground for derivative action.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60227-38_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for drawing my attention to part of what my noble friend had said which I had not fully addressed. This was a recommendation of the Law Commission which was quite clear; it was one of the areas upon which it consulted, and it reached a clear conclusion. There is a deficiency in the current law in relation to Foss v Harbottle; in certain circumstances, it would be possible to use the derivative claim where the complaint was of negligence by the directors but only, as I understand the law, if it could be shown that the directors&#151;or at least the majority shareholders&#151;had profited from the negligence, which would not always be the case. So there is a deficiency&#151;there would certainly be cases of negligence by directors where a derivative claim could not be brought. It does not apply to any claim for negligence&#151;in claims for negligence where the directors or the majority obtained a profit, it could be brought, but not otherwise. That is a change, but in the view of the Government and the Law Commission, it is a good change.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60227-38_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Grabiner: </b>   On the last sentence in Clause 239(3), there may well be cases of wrongdoing by a director against whom proceedings could be brought by the derivative process; he could have acted in cahoots with a third party&#151;there is simply a conspiracy between the third party and the director. The provision would enable proceedings to be brought against both or either as appropriate; that would certainly meet the justice of the case. I cannot really see any advantage in restricting, limiting or barring that derivative process against the third-party conspirator who, on this hypothesis, is not a director of the company.

<a name="60227-38_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My name is attached to the amendment and I support what the noble Baroness has said. Ex ante claims, where people who were not members of the company at the time seek to buy a single share and build a case against the directors, are an invitation for all sorts of activities. We have frequently used the example of environmental claims, or animal rights people who might take advantage of this by finding a company which had previously done something, buying a share and building a claim along these lines. That is an important point which is separate to that made by the noble Baroness.

<a name="60227-38_spnew6"></a><b> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </b>   Along with my noble friend Lord Hodgson, I hesitate to embark on this area because, like him, I am neither an accountant nor a lawyer. But I have been approached by a number of directors who are concerned about Part 11 generally, and this amendment is one on which I can usefully express their views.
</p>

<a name="60227-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>This comes back to the points that the noble and learned Lord made at the beginning: he did not expect this to be the same as US derivative claims and we would not see the same pressures as exist in the United States. I recognise that derivative actions in the United States have developed out of a completely different aspect of American corporate law, because many states do not allow shareholders to remove directors. This is one way of letting concerned shareholders instigate actions. Nevertheless, based on the experience of some people who have told me about their experiences, there is a real risk of US-style derivative claims coming here on a much greater scale. That is why I would like the noble and learned Lord to explain further why he thinks that will not happen.

</p>

<a name="60227-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>For example, I was told of one case in respect of a major reconstruction of a UK company. It was difficult to sort out, not least because the company was under siege from its creditors. Hedge funds were becoming involved by pursuing their own ends in trying to upset the deal and encourage corporate raiders. The view expressed to me was that, if dissident shareholder groups&#039; rights were considerably enhanced, new directors would not take on the task of reconstructing companies because they would be put in a difficult situation. The case related to a major UK company. There was the argument not only about disincentives to take it on, but about there being considerable uncertainties about how those new directors would see their way through if they were subject to a large number of derivative actions, too&#151;particularly from hedge funds.
</p>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC13</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

experience in the United States told me that US law firms are keen to take advantage of the proposed provisions. I am going rather wider than the amendment, but it gives me the opportunity to ask the noble and learned Lord if he would say more about why he does not believe that the American experience will come here. Entirely reasonably and not least for the reasons given by my noble friend, the amendment limits the scope for bringing derivative actions for reasons other than legitimate concerns by minority shareholders.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60227-38_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Grabiner: </b>   The amendment, along with others that we shall examine later, is directed towards a legitimate concern&#151;namely, the risk of proliferation of vexatious or near-vexatious litigation. It is said, rightly, that that would damage commercial activity. It is easy to think of some examples, which my noble friend Lady Goudie and other noble Lords have identified, such as the venture fund, working in cahoots with the rough equivalent of the ambulance-chasing solicitor, buying a few shares in a targeted company and then bringing a derivative claim, alleging that its rights as a minority shareholder have been abused by the controllers of the company.
</p>

<a name="60227-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Perhaps I may put another factor into the pot. There might be an additional incentive for such persons to make such claims because it is possible for the court to make an order that indemnity costs can be paid, so that the claimant can claim his costs out of the company and be indemnified fully in respect of those costs. That might be an added inducement to the kind of complainant that we are discussing.
</p>

<a name="60227-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>These considerations focus attention on a key procedural question. What is the machinery for weeding out abusive or near-abusive claims? My immediate reaction to the suggestion in the amendment that only past or previous shareholders should be allowed the complaint was that that does not sound right, because you can buy and sell shares in the company on a daily basis. Once you buy shares, you are party to a changing contract and you derive all the benefits and rights associated with that contract. The fact that you arrive later rather than earlier on the scene should not in principle deprive you of the entitlement of that contractual bargain. That is not consistent with company law experience. I am more interested in focusing on how we weed out the abusive or near-abusive claim.
</p>

<a name="60227-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>Perhaps I may say something about the existing procedure, because improvements to that have been suggested elsewhere in the Bill, and we will examine them in due course. First, in relation to indemnity costs, the law is clear that the court will not make an order for indemnity costs until a late stage in the proceedings when it has a good understanding of what the facts are. That is extremely good protection against the risk that a vulture fund might come along, get its costs protected from the outset and then bring an abusive claim. That was established as long ago as 1986 in Smith v Croft (No. 1).

<a name="column_GC14"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>I shall say something about civil procedure rule 19.9. I am conscious of the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hodges, that this is technical legal territory. My point is technical and legalistic, but brief and clean. Under rule 19.9, the claimant, having commenced proceedings, is obliged to secure permission from the court to continue those proceedings. The application must be made before any other step is taken in the action. Having commenced proceedings, the claimant must make an application as the first thing he does. In the leading case, Barrett v Duckett 1995, the Court of Appeal laid down some general principles to be applied by the judge who decides whether to allow a case to continue. First, the alleged wrongdoer must have control of the company&#151;in principle, that includes cases of de facto control because one could have de facto control with less than 50.1 per cent of the company. Secondly, the complaining shareholder must satisfy the court that he has a prima facie case and should be allowed to sue on behalf of the company. The mere fact that he can demonstrate that he has an arguable case will not be good enough. Thirdly, the complaining shareholder must also show that he is bringing the claim in good faith for wrongs done to the company in respect of which no other remedy exists. It follows that if the claim is brought for an ulterior purpose or if another adequate remedy is available, the claim would not be allowed to proceed.
</p>

<a name="60227-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The potential problem, which ought to be acknowledged, is that because the application to continue the proceedings has to be made immediately under the existing rules, there is a risk that the court may feel the need to make a ruling at a very early stage in the proceedings, on very flimsy material, before documentary disclosure or any exchange of witness statements. If that were the case, the danger is that a judge would be understandably reluctant to stop somebody at that early stage in the proceedings and might well give leave to continue the proceedings, whereas if he had been invited to address the question nine months or a year later when more material was available he might have thrown the case out on the basis that no prima facie case was disclosed in the material. This problem was identified by Mr Justice Collins in the 2003 case Konamaneni v Rolls-Royce (India). The key point is that there is nothing in CPR 19.9 that would prevent the judge from dealing with the point at a later stage, which would be consistent with Barrett v Duckett and Smith v Croft. There may well be scope for clarifying the rule and/or the notes to the practice book, in consultation with the rules committee. It would then be possible to produce a simple and satisfactory solution.
</p>

<a name="60227-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>It would be very unattractive to cut across the well-established principle of company law that when one becomes a member of a company, one is party to the bargain. To superimpose a prohibition against going backwards in time upon that well-established rule is an unattractive solution, so I am not able to support this amendment.

<a name="column_GC15"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC15</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendment&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord MacGregor, and my noble friend Lord Grabiner. I am grateful because the amendment has provided a vehicle for a rather wider discussion on what is obviously a very important issue under this part of the Bill&#151;that is, whether the procedural safeguards that we have built into the Bill will be sufficient, as we believe they will be, to protect against the concerns raised, which I accept are legitimate.
</p>

<a name="60227-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>In his very helpful intervention, my noble friend Lord Grabiner indicated how the courts already use their powers to control vexatious, frivolous or otherwise inappropriate actions. Those are important points to consider. It is also important&#151;here I respond directly to the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, by repeating what I said previously&#151;to ask what other things will prevent American-style class actions. This will be a claim, albeit brought by a shareholder&#151;perhaps at his own expense&#151;for damages to go to the company rather than to himself. There is an important difference in incentive there.
</p>

<a name="60227-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Fundamentally, this is a question of judicial control. On that broad topic, I apprehend that the meeting which the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, asked for at the beginning of today&#039;s sitting will be one where those issues can be explored a little further. We will be happy to do that, and we continue to be happy to consider any specific amendment to the Bill that is put forward.
</p>

<a name="60227-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I want to make two additional points before I sit down. First, I want to respond specifically to the point raised by my noble friend Lord Grabiner about the ability of a court to say, &quot;I don&#039;t know enough at this stage to decide that permission should be granted&quot;. It seems to me that Clause 240(2)(c) gives the court the option, in addition to rejecting or accepting the grant of permission, to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;adjourn the proceedings on the application and give such directions as it thinks fit&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Such a circumstance might be if the court adjourned the application while a general meeting took place. That might be a way of dealing with the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, under another amendment about testing whether the company is prepared to take the action itself or, in some circumstances, to take some other action such as ratifying a particular act which has taken place. It will be for the rules committee to consider whether amendments to the procedural rules are needed to give effect to that sort of power, but the power will be there in the Act and so can be exercised.
</p>

<a name="60227-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I recognise the legitimate concern which is being raised, but is this amendment a good way to deal with it? Like my noble friend Lord Grabiner, I do not think that it is&#151;for two reasons. First, historically, this is the present position under the common law derivative action&#151;that is, it does not matter when you became a member. The subsection states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;It is immaterial whether the cause of action arose before or after the person seeking to bring or continue the derivative claim became a member of the company&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC16"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC16</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Of course, the claim has to be there. You cannot create it but, if it is there, it should not matter whether you became a member before or after it came into existence. I agree with my noble friend that company law works on the basis that, when you acquire shares, you get all the bad and all the good that go with them and sometimes perhaps a bit of both.
</p>

<a name="60227-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>My second point is that the measure has the additional benefit of making it clear that it is the people who are members at the time that they wish to bring proceedings that bring those proceedings. You cannot sell on your shares and then seek to bring a derivative claim in the name of the company at that stage. So in principle it is right to have the position as stated in the Bill. I think that I am right in saying that some respondents, including the Law Society, wanted us to make it clear in the Bill that that was the position, following the current law. I cannot accept the amendment as it stands, but that does not detract from recognising that we have had an important debate on an important topic.

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 239(5)(b) states that a shadow director is to be treated as a director in respect of this part. That means that a shadow director is liable in the same way as a fully paid-up registered director of a company and can be the subject of proceedings in a derivative claim by shareholders. Given the nature of shadow directors, we do not accept that that should be so without some limitations. As their name implies, they have ill-defined roles. We dealt with the question in Committee on 6 February, when the noble and learned Lord said, in reply to my noble friend Lord Freeman:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;The noble Lord is right in saying that there is a lack of law at the moment on the extent to which the general duties of directors apply to shadow directors. There are differences of view about it as well. The law commissions took the view that the duties apply to a shadow director where he effectively acts as a director through the people whom he can influence, and recommended that the duties should apply to shadow directors . . . However, several consultation responses argued that the general duties do not and should not apply to shadow directors. On top of that, although there are cases in the past that suggest that some of the general duties may apply to a shadow director, a recent well argued and impressive judgment suggests the opposite&quot;.&#151;[Official Report, 6/2/06 ; col. GC247-8.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>We argue that it is not reasonable or desirable to burden shadow directors with the full brunt of responsibility for everything that occurs in a company in the same way as a director is burdened. One such issue would be the question of derivative claims. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC17"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC17</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

However, shadow directors should not always be able to evade responsibly no matter what the facts are. They could be intimately involved in a matter that gave rise to a derivative claim. The amendment would limit the liability of shadow directors to circumstances in which they were, in the words of the amendment,


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;actually aware of the facts that formed the basis of the claim or ought reasonably to have been known having regard to the general skill and experience that he actually possessed&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="60227-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>That is the test that the courts are well versed in applying, mirroring as it does the subjective professional standard applied in many tortious claims.

<a name="60227-39_para11"></a>

<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60227-39_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   The noble Lord is right in saying that this is a bit of a rerun of the debate that we had on 6 February.
</p>

<a name="60227-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Clause 154 provides that the general duties, which we have debated, apply to shadow directors when, and to the extent, that the corresponding common law rules or equitable principles so apply. As I explained in the earlier debate, that was a way in which to say that it is not clear at the moment how far exactly those general duties apply, so we should leave it to the law to develop and to identify precisely the degree of that responsibility. The provision in Clause 239(5) is simply a consequential effect of that. The place to change the burden on the shadow director is not under the procedure of whether a derivative claim is there but by reference to Clause 154. For reasons that I have explained, we have decided not to impose particular restrictions at this stage but to leave the law to develop.
</p>

<a name="60227-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>If we were to accept the amendment which the noble Lord proposes, it would mean imposing a particular restriction on bringing a derivative claim without changing the nature of the duty which the shadow director had. I am afraid that it is not an amendment which commends itself to us. That does not mean that we do not understand the rationale, as the noble Lord put it, but the rationale goes back to the question of the extent to which the shadow director owes the same duties as other directors. It is right to leave that to the law to develop, as Clause 154(5) intends.

endeavour to use this procedure as a way of putting pressure on boards of directors. If we can cut those vexatious claims out at an early stage, that will be beneficial.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60227-40_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   The Bill is drafted as it is because of changes to civil procedure as a result of the work of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. At present, a derivative claim is commenced by the issue of a claim form; it must generally be served within four months after it has been issued. There is no requirement to seek the permission of the court, but the rules provide that, after the claim form has been issued, the claimant must apply to the court for permission to continue the claim and the application must be supported by written evidence. No further steps may be taken until permission has been obtained. One does not need leave to start but one needs the court&#039;s leave to continue. The defendant is notified at the earliest possible time after the commencement of proceedings of the existence of those proceedings. The difference between having leave to start before and starting and having permission afterwards is not a major issue. One can just as easily apply a strong filter by the courts by requiring somebody to have permission to continue as by requiring them to obtain leave in advance.
</p>

<a name="60227-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The other question, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, is whether it is a good idea to have a substantive hearing in relation to that with both sides present and a lot of information known&#151;as my noble friend Lord Grabiner suggested in some cases&#151;or whether it is better to do it at an earlier stage. There will be arguments both ways. The court would have the opportunity to determine that it is a case where the permission hearing should be pushed off awhile, in the circumstances I have described, or to deal with it then and there. The Law Commission&#039;s belief is that it is best to have a preliminary hearing of the issue of leave but that the court should receive all the pleadings before taking that decision. We would leave it to the courts to determine precisely what, in particular cases, they consider the right moment might be under the powers proposed in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60227-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>Under the procedures, it would also be possible in an appropriate case for a defendant to apply to strike out a claim. That power exists under the civil procedure rules, which will no doubt need to be amended to take account of the new derivative claim procedure. I see no reason why the general power to be able to strike out a claim should not be applicable as well.
</p>

<a name="60227-40_para8"></a>

At the same time, without being quite as definitive as the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment would suggest, that would allow a little flexibility and therefore, in large measure, would achieve what she was seeking without putting on the straitjacket envisaged by her amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The difficulty with the amendment is that it creates another hurdle, with an opportunity for lawyers to argue about whether the requirements have been met.

practicable&quot;. It think that at one stage it was almost a little industry in itself. Given the way in which the rules work&#151;that is, as things stand, the shareholder would not be able effectively to get on with the action without applying for permission&#151;like my noble friend Lord Grabiner, I wonder whether there is any point in having this additional requirement. The safeguard that you cannot do anything with the action should be adequate.
</p>

<a name="60227-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>There is also a time limit for service of the claim. Once you have started the claim, you have to serve it within four months&#151;unless it is outside the jurisdiction, in which case it is six months. The Civil Procedure Rules Committee might decide different rules. It might also decide that the rules should have some other requirement as to time and it might even find the requirement relating to time referred to by the noble Lord more helpful than I think it is. But it is better to leave it to the committee to set out the procedure and rules, which it will then police, than to put them in legislation at this stage.

<a name="60227-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The Law Commission canvassed views on whether there should be a threshold test on the merits of the case, which is what the amendment proposes, under the new procedure. The commission&#039;s concern was that, if one included an express test, that would increase the risk of a detailed investigation into the merits of the case taking place at the stage of leave or permission, and that such a mini-trial could be time-consuming and expensive. The commission accepted that there would have to be some consideration of merits, because it would be wrong for the court to allow a clearly hopeless case to proceed. As I have already mentioned, under the civil procedure rules the court has the power to dismiss a claim at an early stage that claim has no realistic prospect of success. But the Law Commission&#039;s view was that it would be undesirable to encourage the parties to bring evidence to show that the case met, or failed to meet, a particular merits test. There is a real risk of satellite litigation, which can balloon out of all proportion to the significance of what one is doing, if one adopts that approach. Most respondents to the consultation agreed with that view.
</p>

<a name="60227-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The Government&#039;s view is that there is a real risk, as the Law Commission said, that a threshold test would lead to fine distinctions being drawn about whether the facts of an individual case fell on one side or another of an individual test. Therefore, we prefer to leave, as Clause 242(3) does, a much broader set of requirements, which the court must take into account in deciding in its discretion whether to allow the case to proceed. Whether the court, when it develops its principled approach, decides to include some statement about a merits test generally to be reached or always to be reached would be for the court to develop. But, following the Law Commission&#039;s line, we are not disposed to build another threshold test into the statute.

<a name="60227-42_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   This amendment again raises some of the issues that we have already debated, particularly the formulation in Clause 156. I said then that it would have been legally possible to use the formulation proposed, which is the one that the noble Lord proposes to insert into this clause, but the Government preferred to use the formulation put forward by the Company Law Review, because it answers the question in whose interests companies should be run. The noble Lord reminded us why that answer may not be quite the same in relation to a company that is purely profit-making, as opposed to a company that has different public interest measures in mind.
</p>

<a name="60227-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>As the noble Lord said, this phrase appears twice. Clause 242(2)(a) would put a bar on a claim if the person acting in accordance with the duty in Clause 156 did not continue the claim. That seems to me to be a very proper thing to do. If Clause 156 stated something different, it could be formulated in a different way from the way in which it is. However, it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC24"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC24</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

seems to me to be entirely right that, as long as the duty in Clause 156 remains as it is, that duty should be the test for determining whether the claim should be stopped.
</p>

<a name="60227-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>As to the discretionary side of the clause in subsection (3), the formulation there is somewhat different. The subsection states that the court should take into account the importance that a person acting in accordance with Clause 156 attaches to continuing the claim. That seems to me to be entirely right. Once one has set out the basic duty on the director, it is right that if someone applying that approach did not continue the claim, there should be a bar to a derivative claim. The importance which someone applying the duty does or does not attach to the claim is a factor that the court should take into account. There is little merit in changing the definition of that fundamental duty in one part of the Bill but not in another. I recognise that the noble Lord may want to come back to this issue and make changes to the earlier part of the Bill at a later stage but, standing where we are, I believe that it would be wrong to take a different approach in the two parts of the Bill.

</p>

<a name="60227-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>It has been put to us that, as currently drafted, the Bill appears to contain the problem that the alleged wrongdoers are themselves in a position to authorise or ratify their wrongdoing. Clause 242(2) states that where such ratification or authorisation has occurred, the claim must be discontinued. Similarly, subsection (3) allows the court to give consideration as to whether this would be likely to occur. In this regard, it has been argued to us that there is a danger of this undermining the whole purpose of Part 11. What is to stop an unscrupulous director ratifying his own action and so preventing a claim against him and his colleagues on behalf of the company? The amendments suggest a change which would still enable ratification to be authoritative provided that it was effected in good faith and in what was considered to be the best interests of the company.

<a name="60227-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>The Attorney-General may argue that the amendment is unnecessary, as ratification involving the wrongdoers would not be valid. That may be a satisfactory reply, but I should still like to hear his arguments on that point. Certainly it has been put to us strongly that there is a degree of uncertainty as to how case law will apply to a new statutory action&#151;if, indeed, it does at all. The words &quot;in good faith&quot; in our amendment are well defined in law and it is not for me to elaborate on them. Suffice it to say that the ratification or authorisation must be given for the right reason and with no hidden motives.

<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>is intended to allow some leeway for directors to authorise minor faults. For example, if a director were to make a mistake which costs the company &#163;10,000 but the company stands to earn &#163;1 million over the next few months as a result of the action, it is surely right that the company should be able to ratify the small error for the greater good of the company and protect the director from petty claims by shareholders that might jeopardise the future gain. Indeed, even in the event of such ratification, the shareholders would remain free to attempt an action under Section 459 of the Companies Act 1985, about which we have already spoken a great deal. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="60227-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   On a previous occasion, I explained that the Bill preserves the current law on ratification of acts by directors but makes one significant change, which is that any decision to ratify conduct by a director that would amount to negligence, breach of duty, default or breach of trust in relation to the company must be taken by the members, without reliance of the votes of those members with a personal interest in the ratification. That is the effect of Clause 216 as amended on our previous day in Committee and it will be the law in relation to ratification in play under this provision. If the ratification is in accordance with those rules, it will be a bar to a derivative claim. I agree with the noble Lord that it should be possible for that to happen. Where I take issue with him is on whether it is necessary to put in a further requirement that the ratification has to be effected in good faith in the interests of the company. With the exception of the change that we are making, our position remains that shareholders are able to exercise their votes as they please. That may include their own selfish, short-term reasons as well as what they believe to be in the best long-term interests of the company. Subject to the important change that is being made in Clause 216, we leave the rules on ratification for the purposes of derivative claims as they are in other parts of the Bill and do not wish to add the additional hurdle proposed by the noble Lord in this amendment.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>Page 109, line 37, leave out &quot;, and in the circumstances would be likely to be&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of tabling the amendment is to understand whether the Government wish to expand the purpose of granting permission to continue a derivative action beyond that which I understand to be embodied in the current law. As I understand it, the current law requires the court to take into account only whether the act complained of could be ratified by the company and not whether it is likely to be ratified.
</p>

<a name="60227-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>The new statement of directors&#039; duties in Clause 156(3) introduces an objective list of matters which directors must take into account in deciding whether a particular course of action is likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of the members. It follows that derivative claims are more likely to be brought under the statutory procedure than under the current law. Given the impact of such claims and the management time likely to be absorbed, it is my view that Clause 242(3)(c) should not go further than the common law. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="60227-43_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   I think that I have already made it clear that the approach adopted in Part 11 deliberately introduces some changes to the law. The noble Lord is right that the ratifiability of an act or omission would no longer be an absolute bar to the continuation of an action. The wrongdoer control test would equally no longer apply.
</p>

<a name="60227-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>We want the courts to look at what is really happening in the company. The court would take into account what will be the absolute bars to a case going forward and consider whether conduct has in fact been ratified or, as stated under subsection (2)(a), whether a person acting in accordance with the duty to promote the success of the company,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;would not seek to continue the claim&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>It could also include the provision in paragraph (b) where an act has not yet occurred but the act or omission has been authorised by the company. Once the claim gets over those initial hurdles, the court would adopt this second stage and the discretion of the court would come into play, having regard to all the factors listed in subsection (3). This would include paragraph (c), which states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;where the cause of action results from an act or omission that is yet to occur, whether the act or omission could be, and . . . would be likely to be&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>authorised or ratified, and paragraph (d), which states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;where the cause of action arises from an act or omission that has already occurred, whether the act or omission could be, and in the circumstances would be likely to be, ratified by the company&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>So the court would take into account the possibility that the act or omission could be ratified. When commenting on something that my noble friend Lord Grabiner said, I mentioned that the court might adjourn the proceedings for something to happen. One possibility is that the court might decide in certain circumstances to adjourn to see whether the act was ratified. I am not saying that it would have to, but that is a possibility.

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>I would resist an absolute bar&#151;which is what the noble Lord&#039;s amendment would achieve&#151;because an action can be ratified. Rather, I would put it in terms that if it has been ratified it is a bar, but otherwise it is a matter for the court to take into account and, in particular, to take into account the likelihood that it would be ratified.

<a name="60227-43_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Grabiner: </b>   If you delete those words, as the amendment suggests, you are taking away a quite valuable mechanism for excluding what might be regarded, on analysis, as being a rather hopeless claim. The court may, on good material, be able to say, &quot;Well, it is quite obvious that if this comes before the company in a general meeting the conduct will be ratified, and that means that we will not&quot;&#151;assuming this becomes a critical factor of the various factors listed in subsection (3)&#151;&quot;give leave to continue these proceedings in those circumstances&quot;. If the words are deleted, that possibility, on the face of it, is excluded. There may be other ways of achieving the same result but, at the moment, this might be a quite helpful mechanism for reducing or avoiding vexatious claims.

<a name="60227-43_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Sharman </b>   moved Amendment No. 251B:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>Page 109, line 44, leave out &quot;company has&quot; and insert &quot;directors have&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to, I hope, remove a possible confusion. Almost everywhere in Clause 242, &quot;the company&quot; is used to refer to decisions of its members. The decision to pursue litigation would normally be taken by the board or the directors and the reference to &quot;the company&quot; in Clause 242(3)(e) is therefore likely to cause confusion.
</p>

<a name="60227-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm that the effect of the clause is that it would be open to the court to allow a member to continue a derivative claim even though the company had not been asked&#151;and had therefore not refused&#151;to bring proceedings in its own name. We consider that the statutory action should be available only where the company has refused to seek appropriate redress. It is not in the interests of companies for members to be able to by-pass the boards&#039; usual decision-making process in this way, which is likely to increase the risk of unmeritorious claims being brought for tactical reasons.
</p>

<a name="60227-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>It would also be helpful if the Minister could confirm that the effect of Clause 242(2)(a), taken together with Clause 242(3)(e), is that it will be necessary for the court to review any decision by the board not to pursue a particular claim, in that the court will be required to consider, in deciding whether or not to allow a derivative claim to proceed, whether <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC29"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC29</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

such a decision was taken in accordance with Clause 156. In our view, this is likely to impose a significant burden on a company where the directors have decided, for legitimate reasons, not to pursue a claim and are facing a derivative action in respect of the matter to which it relates. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="60227-43_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   There are three parts to this amendment that I need to deal with. The first is the drafting. The noble Lord would change &quot;the company has&quot; in Clause 243(3)(e) to &quot;the directors have&quot; because there may be some confusion in other places where &quot;the company&quot; refers to the members. For the purposes of this clause, &quot;the company&quot; means whoever has the right to decide matters for the company. It may well be that that decision will be a matter for the directors. In that case, if the directors have so decided, the company has so decided. However, it would be quite wrong to exclude consideration of those cases where the members have reached a decision. I do not see why the scope of the provision should be narrowed in the way that the amendment suggests. I hope that that deals with what the amendment proposes.
</p>

<a name="60227-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>The noble Lord made two further points. The first was whether it could be right that the statutory action should be available only where the company had refused to seek appropriate redress. He suggested that it is not in the interests of a company for members to be able to bypass the board&#039;s usual decision-making process by taking action themselves. I do not agree that the statutory action should be available only where the company has refused to seek appropriate redress. Indeed, we discussed earlier that it would be open to directors to take a dilatory approach and to keep putting off the decision about whether to bring proceedings in order to buy time for reasons that may not be good. The court can take into account what has happened, but I do not agree that it should be a requirement of the action that the company has refused to seek appropriate redress.
</p>

<a name="60227-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>The second point raised by the noble Lord was whether I can confirm that the effect of Clauses 242(2)(e) and 242(3)(e) is to make it necessary for the court to review any decision by the board not to pursue a claim. He suggested that that would be burdensome. I am not sure that I understand why that should be so. Under Clause 242(2)(a), the court would look at the question of whether a person acting in accordance with the duty to promote the success of the company would not seek to continue the claim. If the court is satisfied that such a person would not seek to continue the claim, that would be an end to the derivative claim. When it comes to the discretionary element under Clause 242(3)(e), the court would look to see whether the company had decided not to pursue the claim. If it had, that would be a powerful factor, but it would not be conclusive. Looking at all the circumstances, the court might see that there were ulterior reasons for doing so, or even that it was an obviously bad decision. I do not see that that imposes <br>&nbsp;<br>

a significant burden on the court or the company, which is the way in which the noble Lord referred to the matter.

&quot;(   )   whether the company suffered loss as a result of the act or omission that forms the basis of the claim&quot;

<p><a name="st_71"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment concerns Clause 242 and whether permission be given. The issue has been raised with us by the CBI. It concerns the list in subsection (3), which has formed a great part of our discussion in the past hour and we have already looked at it in some detail.
</p>

<a name="60227-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The concern is that, under the provision as drafted, claimants may pursue a derivative claim where there has been no loss to the company. That is an undesirable consequence of the drafting. Nowhere in the list of matters for the court to consider is this mentioned, nor is it included in the factors that trigger automatic refusal of permission by the court given in subsection (2).
</p>

<a name="60227-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The amendment does not go so far as to require a loss to be proven for permission to be given&#151;the lack of which would require the court to refuse permission&#151;although there may well be an argument for this approach. Instead, it proposes an addition to the list in subsection (3) which the court must take into account. This should be sufficient to achieve a shared aim of preventing pointless and time-wasting claims, burdening company directors, and therefore companies, as well as the courts. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="60227-44_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   Without any disrespect, I shall be brief. We do not see that it is necessary to state this as a particular factor for the court to take into account.

</p>

<a name="60227-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>To illustrate the point, let me revert to what I said with regard to the previous amendment. I said in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, that there might be circumstances in which the fact that the company had decided not to pursue the claim was not conclusive as far as the court was concerned&#151;for example, if it was apparent that the directors had an ulterior or a bad, improper motive. Generally speaking, the court would not interfere with commercial judgments. I was not intending to undermine that proposition. I can see that if the directors decided not to pursue a claim because no loss had been suffered and to continue with it would simply mean paying money to lawyers, excellent though that ambition is&#151;I am reverting momentarily to another life&#151;that might be a very good reason for the company to decide not to pursue the claim; or it might be a claim to which a person acting in accordance with Clause 156&#151;the duty to promote the success of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

company&#151;would not attach any significance in continuing. &quot;What is the point&quot;, they might say, &quot;in bringing a claim where no loss has been caused?&quot; I am trying to illustrate circumstances in which those factors would be taken into account but in which it would not be necessary to include them as a specific factor in the Bill.

The issue of loss is quite important, not necessarily in absolute terms but in the partial terms in which our amendment is drafted. We may wish to come back to this and probe a little further. The question of loss is important and should not be subsumed into some of the other factors listed in Clause 242(2) and (3).

<a name="60227-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is the last I have tabled on this clause relating to &quot;Whether permission be given&quot;. We seek to leave out subsections (4), (5) and (6). Subsection (4) provides the Secretary of State with a power to amend subsections (2) and (3), which have taken up much of our time during the past couple of hours and deal with the factors that contribute to whether permission to continue a derivative claim is to be granted by the court. Subsections (5) and (6) are related to that power&#151;first, in requiring consultation and, secondly, in specifying that they are subject to affirmative resolution procedures.
</p>

<a name="60227-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>With this power it will be possible for a future Secretary of State to change completely all that we have just debated&#151;maybe as soon as the Bill has been passed. I am not suggesting that the Government, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General or the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, would do that&#151;but who knows what may happen? We have been arguing that Part 11 is important in its potentially large impact on directors and shadow directors and that many high-quality individuals might be deterred from serving on boards due to their increased potential personal liability. To give them reassurance, we need to secure as legal a framework as possible. That will not be provided if a future Secretary of State could radically alter the contents of subsections (2) and (3).

Obviously, we want to get subsection (3) right if we can, but is it not right for there to be the possibility of changes in the future as circumstances may appear to demand? It is not right to say that the Secretary of State may simply do that. That provision is simply there due to a requirement for the affirmative resolution procedure. To allow for the possibility of a degree of flexibility to take account of changing circumstances without the need for new primary legislation seems a sensible balance to strike.
</p>

<a name="60227-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>The genesis of this clause were the differences in Scottish procedure, which is why this provision has been included.

As my noble friend Lady Noakes reminded me <i>sotto voce</i>, this is all about primary legislation and about what is needed in changing this provision. We are not going to advance the sum of human knowledge much further. We have consistently argued in relation to subsections (2) and (3) that if a government, not necessarily this Government, wished to change those provisions, which are important for directors of British companies, primary legislation would be the way to do it. We have discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> the deficiencies in statutory instrument procedures&#151;the inability to amend and the fact that they do not always receive the scrutiny they deserve. Therefore we are unhappy, but we will not take it any further now and the issue will form part of our debates on Part 31.

Is it not an obvious example of territory that lends itself satisfactorily to regulation because it is concerned with ensuring that the court will take into account exactly the right considerations, which, in the light of experience, might subsequently need some amendment or revision without the need to return to primary legislation, with all the complications and expense associated with it?

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>After Clause 243, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_4"></a><br>
&quot;APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO SETTLE OR DISCONTINUE A CLAIM

<br>
(1)   This section applies where a member of a company has been granted permission under section 240, 241 or 244.


<br>
(2)   Such a claim may be settled or discontinued by the member concerned only with the permission of the court.


<br>
(3)   In granting permission under this section, the court may make such orders as to the notification of interested parties, and the payment of costs, as it thinks fit.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_80"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to establish whether the court&#039;s permission should be obtained before a derivative claim can be settled or discontinued.
</p>

<a name="60227-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>We are concerned that the settlement and discontinuance of claims can give rise to difficulties. For example, several members who are pursuing a claim may disagree about the merits of settling it or the reasonableness of a settlement offer. Where the court has ordered the company to bear the costs of a derivative claim, it seems unreasonable that it should be open to the member pursuing the claim to settle or discontinue it without reference to the company. These potential problems could be resolved if the court&#039;s permission were required for the claim to be settled or discontinued.
</p>

<a name="60227-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>It would be helpful if the Minister could explain whether it would be possible for the company to take over a claim begun by a member, if he decides that he no longer wishes to pursue it. Clause 243 provides for a member to take over a claim begun by another member in certain circumstances. Although that claim would strictly speaking no longer be derivative, it would be helpful to grant the company a similar right, with the court&#039;s permission. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="60227-45_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   I understand the principle behind the amendment; however, is it really necessary? He first asked: what about the case where a member brings a derivative claim which other members are bringing also? The existing rules of procedure would in any event provide that where there was more than one claimant who wanted to discontinue a claim, he could not do that without either the consent of all the claimants or the court&#039;s permission. So in that example it should not be necessary to have this power.
</p>

<a name="60227-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Secondly, he raised the situation where a company has been ordered to bear the costs of a derivative claim. I need to give some thought to the example that the noble Lord raised. I understand the circumstances in which a court might provide some indemnity to a claimant in respect of costs. I am not sure how that would operate in relation to the sort of continuance he has in mind, so I need to take that away.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC34"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC34</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The noble Lord also raised a point which I am happy to consider, but which does not strictly arise out of the amendment, regarding whether a company can take over a claim that was started by a member. As he rightly said, the Bill specifically provides for a member to take over a claim by a company that effectively the company is not proceeding with in a way that is appropriate. Matters can take place by agreement&#151;if the company wants to take over the claim and is prepared to get on with it, it is not obvious why the claimant would want to continue to bear the costs himself. It is also possible in certain circumstances for courts to allow people to intervene in other actions. The big difference between the company and the shareholder is that the company always had the right to bring that action. That is the point&#151;it is the company&#039;s claim and the shareholder is saying, &quot;I want to bring this claim&quot;, often because the company is not doing so.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>So I am not sure that there is any need expressly to provide for that. We need expressly to make provision for the shareholder to do that, otherwise he has no right to prosecute a course of action that is not his own. The company always has the right to prosecute that course of action, subject to whether a bar has prevented that through the passage of time or by another event having taken place. I shall give further thought to that matter. For the moment, I am not sure that it is necessary to change the Bill to allow for that possibility.

<a name="60227-45_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sharman: </b>   In reflecting further on my question, would he also take into account the notion that perhaps the entire board of directors might have changed during the progress of the claim? One would be dealing with a different group of people, as has been mentioned, and in those circumstances there might be a complete change of view.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="60227-45_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   I understand that. My point was that I am not sure why in those circumstances the shareholder, who the directors might then see as the one person who was on a white charger in relation to this, might not agree for this action effectively to be prosecuted with the full-hearted consent of the company&#151;whereas previously he was on his own. However, I will take the noble Lord&#039;s point into account.

<a name="column_GC35"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC35</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to protect the interests of the company and to obtain a remedy on its behalf in certain circumstances. The provisions are equivalent to provisions in Part 11, Chapter 1 for England and Wales and Northern Ireland, but take account of differences in Scottish law and court procedure.
</p>

<a name="60227-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>The amendments in this group seek to ensure consistency between the position in England and Wales and Northern Ireland and the position in Scotland. It may be helpful for me to run through them briefly.
</p>

<a name="60227-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>First, Amendments Nos. 252 to 253, 255, 257 to 266, 268, 272 and 276 widen the scope of the chapter beyond what is covered by the Scottish term &quot;action&quot;. This is necessary because that term would not cover, for example, proceedings commenced by Scottish petition procedure, which would in some circumstances include proceedings for interdict, which is broadly equivalent to an English injunction. The amendments are therefore necessary to ensure that the chapter covers the appropriate forms of court proceedings.
</p>

<a name="60227-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>Amendment No. 254 deletes Clause 244(3)(b), which provides that derivative proceedings may be raised where an act or omission involves a director putting himself in a position where his personal interests conflict with his duties to the company. This provision is unnecessary because a director who puts himself in such a position would be in breach of duty in terms of Clause 159, regarding the duty to avoid conflicts of interest and Clause 161, regarding the duty to declare an interest in a proposed transaction or arrangement. The cause of action which results from such behaviour would be covered by clause 244(3)(a).

</p>

<a name="60227-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>Amendment No. 256 provides that it is immaterial whether the act or omission in respect of which the derivative proceedings are to be raised arose before or after the person seeking to raise them became a member of the company. It brings the position for Scotland into line with the position for England and Wales and Northern Ireland under Clause 239(4).
</p>

<a name="60227-45_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Amendment No. 267 makes provision for Scotland for a member of a company to continue proceedings which have been raised by the company as derivative proceedings under this chapter. It brings the provisions for Scotland in line with the provisions for England and Wales and Northern Ireland and is equivalent to Clause 241. In Scots law, there is no existing concept of proceedings being continued in the manner contemplated by Clause 241, so provision has been made for a member to apply to the court to be &quot;substituted&quot; for the company in the proceedings, and the proceedings to then continue as derivative proceedings under this chapter. The orders which the court may make under subsection (3) also differ from the provisions for England and Wales and Northern Ireland in order to ensure consistency with existing Scottish court procedures.

</p>

<a name="60227-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 282 is equivalent to Clause 243 for England and Wales and Northern Ireland, allowing a member of a company to apply to the court to be substituted for another member who has raised derivative proceedings under this chapter. As with Amendment No. 84, because there is no existing Scottish concept of continuing proceedings as envisaged by the equivalent provisions for England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the amendment provides that a member may be &quot;substituted&quot; for another member in the proceedings. As with Amendment No. 84, the orders which the court may make under subsection (3) differ slightly from the orders which may be made under the equivalent provisions for England and Wales and Northern Ireland to take account of existing Scottish court procedures.

<a name="60227-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his explanation of the amendments. We have no trouble with the ones that are correcting the wording, but could I ask the noble and learned Lord about Amendments Nos. 256, 267 and 282?
</p>

<a name="60227-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>Am I right in thinking that Amendment No. 256 inserts here what the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, sought to remove in Amendment No. 248? If that was the case, we would not wish the amendment to be passed. I seek clarity on that matter.
</p>

<a name="60227-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a> The noble and learned Lord said that Amendments Nos. 267 and 282 corresponded to Clauses 241 and 243 in English law. Does this mean that the court is required under Amendments Nos. 267 and 282 to have regard to the factors in Clause 242, as to whether permission be given?
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="60227-46_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   I beg the noble Lord&#039;s pardon, but could he repeat his last question?
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="60227-46_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   If I heard the noble and learned Lord right, he said that Amendment No. 267 was the Scottish equivalent to Clause 241 and Amendment No. 282 was the Scottish equivalent to Clause 243. If that is the case, under Scottish law would that mean that Clause 242, on whether permission be given, still had an impact in Scotland?
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="60227-46_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   With regard to the last point, there is a difference in Scottish procedure. Amendment No. 267 is the equivalent of Clause 241. It differs from Clause 241 because there is no existing concept of proceedings being continued in the manner contemplated by Clause 241.
</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="60227-46_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   If you are in Scotland, do you have to have regard to the provisions of Clause 242 as to whether permission be given? <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC37"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC37</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I understand precisely what the noble and learned Lord is driving at. He is giving us a Scottish equivalent for Clauses 241 and 243.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="60227-46_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   Clause 246 applies in Scotland, not Clause 242.

<a name="60227-46_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   Yes. I am sorry.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="60227-46_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   Clause 246 sets out the circumstances. It differs in its precise structure because of the difference in Scots procedure about whether you are continuing the proceedings or whether you are, as it were, starting them. I hope that deals with those two points.
</p>

<a name="60227-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>As to the first point on Clause 256, the noble Lord is right to say that the effect of the amendment would be to insert into the Scottish procedure the provision that already exists in the English procedure, which we have discussed before. The noble Lord has said that, under those circumstances, he does not want the amendment to go into the Bill today. If he does not, I cannot force the issue because we are in Grand Committee and I cannot do that. The question is whether that is the most sensible way to proceed or whether it would be more sensible to put in the provision in relation to the English and Scots procedure and, if the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, or any other noble Lord, seeks to remove it at the Report stage, I would not raise any objection. But it would be better if we were to insert the provision in Committee, just so that we have the Bill on an even keel. I look to others for guidance as to whether what I have suggested makes sense.

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The amendments seek to redraw the line between companies that are required to have a company secretary and those that not so required. We are grateful for the help that the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators has given us in these amendments and those that follow on from them.
</p>

<a name="60227-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>In the Bill as it currently stands public companies are required to have a secretary and private companies are not so required. This is a major change from Section 283 of the Companies Act 1985, which stated,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>&quot;every company shall have a secretary&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60227-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The role of secretaries is an important one. They are recognised as influencing and monitoring the governance of a company by, <i>inter alia</i>, advising the chairman and the directors on new developments and compliance with codes of practice, regulation and corporate law; being a source of information and advice about the company for nonexecutive directors and shareholders; monitoring the governance implications of papers put to the board; and ensuring the follow-up of board decisions.
</p>

<a name="60227-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>The role requires day-to-day attention. It can give creditors, employees, shareholders and other stakeholders an important assurance that governance and corporate social responsibility issues are being recognised and addressed on an ongoing, not just a periodic, basis. The Bill, as I said earlier, would remove the requirement for any private company to have a secretary. A number of arguments have been put to us that this is not the right approach. I am looking forward to hearing the Government&#039;s view.
</p>

<a name="60227-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>First, having a statutory requirement reminds directors very effectively that they need to give the necessary weight and importance to the responsibilities of that role. The removal of any statutory backing could give out the wrong signals to directors. Secondly, it would remove an important safeguard for employees, creditors, shareholders and other stakeholders whereby they can have a high level of assurance that proper procedures are followed and that corporate governance, regulation and company law will not be overlooked or deliberately forgotten. A good company secretary is a major influence in ensuring that a director who may be tempted to treat his responsibilities unduly lightly is reminded as to what is expected of him.
</p>

<a name="60227-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>Thirdly, this change could lead to an increased likelihood that companies which elect not to have a secretary will overlook the legal requirement for the maintenance of statutory registers and of filing statutory returns, with all that it implies for the company itself&#151;not to mention an increased workload of surveillance and follow-up for the Registrar of Companies and his team.
</p>

<a name="60227-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>There must also be a question to be asked about the message that the Government are trying to send. We have had a series of lengthy debates on directors&#039; duties in Part 10. At a time when the Government are seeking to shine a spotlight on corporate responsibility <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC41"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC41</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and provide a clear framework within which people can engage with companies as shareholders, employees, customers and so on, it seems strange that the Government have decided to withdraw a prime protection. This seems to be at odds with the objective of minimising the chances of corporate impropriety.
</p>

<a name="60227-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>However, we certainly agree that for many companies a secretary does not add weight or value; in many small businesses the role is given to a family member who contributes little to the job and is simply there &quot;to be on the books&quot;. However, that is not true for all private companies. There are some private companies of a size greater than many public companies, in financial terms and in terms of public recognition. Why should they be excluded from the requirement to have a secretary?
</p>

<a name="60227-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>So where can we better draw the line? Currently, small and medium-sized companies are exempt from certain accounting and statutory audit requirements. The threshold is set at, among other factors, a turnover threshold of below &#163;5.6 million. We propose that this should be the line to be drawn between those private companies required to have a secretary and those not. After all, if a company is large enough to require a statutory audit and meet more stringent accountancy tests, then surely it should also require a secretary. The amendments seek to give effect to this proposal and I look forward to hearing the Government&#039;s reaction. Amendment No. 289, which is included in the group, is purely a formal drafting amendment. I beg to move.

As a director of several private companies, I do not believe that the abolition of the requirement to have a secretary does anything for a company&#039;s corporate governance.

<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="60227-47_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Trenchard: </b>   I was saying before the Division that, in my experience as a director of several private companies, the position of company secretary is extremely important. The abolition of the requirement to have a company secretary does nothing to improve corporate governance. The job normally carried out by a secretary in most companies has to be done, and it is better for those dealing with the company from outside to know who is doing it. That applies equally in small companies as in large companies&#151;and many large companies start life as small companies. It is a move in the wrong direction.
</p>

<a name="60227-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>Those who do the jobs that company secretaries normally do are probably less likely to do them well if they do them only in the capacities of persons specifically authorised by the directors to do them, rather than in their capacity as company secretaries.

<a name="60227-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Why are the Government treating the company secretary differently from that other, more universal, anachronistic organ of company government, the company seal&#151;the common seal? Clause 45 provides that a company, public or private, may have a common seal. It need not have one, but if it chooses to have a common seal it involves certain official purposes. Similarly, even if, as a private company, a company is not required to maintain a secretary, it may still do so. However, in this case, the secretary derives no official status or powers from his office. Any powers of the secretary must be granted by the directors in the same way as they may grant powers to any other person.
</p>

<a name="60227-47_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Thus, unlike the common seal, the position of secretary is effectively abolished under the Bill. My noble friend&#039;s amendments will go some way towards mitigating the damage to good corporate governance otherwise done by the Bill.

<a name="60227-48_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  In addressing the amendments, it might be useful if I set out the background to the Bill&#039;s approach to the company secretary. The Bill abolishes the requirement in the 1995 Act for a private company to appoint a secretary following a recommendation of the Company Law Review. The reason for this is deregulatory in nature: it is to avoid unnecessary statutory burdens on private companies.
</p>

<a name="60227-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>One of the Bill&#039;s primary aims is to introduce a range of deregulatory measures designed to benefit private companies&#151;the abolition of the requirement on private companies to have a secretary being one of them. In considering these measures the Company Law Review considered where to draw the line in terms of the companies which would benefit from the simpler, deregulatory approach to company law, and it saw the public/private distinction as the crucial one.
</p>

<a name="60227-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The Company Law Review was anxious to avoid applying a special internal governance or constitutional regime to small companies based on size, whether economic size or some criterion based on governance considerations&#151;for example, the number of members or turnover. It argued that such an approach would lead to transitional problems as companies grew. Therefore, its recommendation was to abolish the requirement for a company secretary for all private companies regardless of size. In the light of this, the Government have adopted this approach in the Bill and it would not be sensible to provide that larger private companies should be required to appoint a company secretary.

<a name="60227-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>The amendment assumes that it is the company secretary&#039;s job to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act. While we accept that company secretaries often fulfil that role, the 1985 Act is silent on the specific functions of a company secretary. The Bill follows this approach, as it will now be for each company to decide on the role and functions conferred on the secretary, if any.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC43"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC43</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>In practice, many private companies contract out the role or function of secretary to external advisors. Others appoint a family member to fill the position. While we agree that properly qualified company secretaries can provide a valuable service to some private companies, the statutory requirement to appoint a secretary imposes a burden beyond what the Government consider is necessary in the light of the Company Law Review recommendation. This would not, of course, remove the obligation on the company to carry out the functions that a secretary may be called on to carry out in any company. However, the Bill gives greater flexibility to companies in their internal administrative arrangements. Private companies will remain free to decide whether to appoint someone to the office of company secretary and whether to require him or her to perform certain functions. However, private companies will no longer be required by law to have a company secretary.
</p>

<a name="60227-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>Why is the company treated differently from the seal? It is immediately obvious to third parties if a company has a seal. That is not the case for a secretary.
</p>

<a name="60227-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Amendment No. 283 would mean that not only public companies, but larger private companies would be required to appoint a company secretary. It draws on the audit exemption thresholds for private companies in Chapter 2 of Part 7 of the 1985 Act, which are restated in Chapter 1 of Part 16 of the Bill, as its basis to distinguish between which private companies are required to appoint a company secretary and which are not. This would mean that a private company would be required to appoint a company secretary if it did not qualify as &quot;small&quot; for accounts and audit purposes, because, in the current financial year its turnover would be more than &#163;5.6 million or its balance sheet exceeded &#163;2.8 million. It would mean also that a charity would be required to appoint a company secretary if it did not qualify as &quot;small&quot; under the separate threshold for charities. The other amendments are consequential on this, extending the requirements of Part 12 of the Bill to larger private companies.
</p>

<a name="60227-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>It would be extremely onerous for all those who deal with private companies if company law were to create circumstances in which it mattered to third parties whether or not a private company was required to have a secretary. Company law ensures that whether a company is public or private is immediately evident to third parties from the company&#039;s name and stationery. The audit threshold is peculiarly inappropriate for triggering a requirement to have a company secretary. The exemption from the requirement would apply to the financial year covered by the audit exemption, but a company itself, let alone third parties, might not know whether or not it was exempt during the year in question.
</p>

<a name="60227-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>In the light of that approach, I resist Amendments Nos. 283, 284, 286, 287, 293 and 299, which would require larger private companies to have a secretary and make changes consequential on that extension. The amendments would create unnecessary complexity and are over-regulatory. They may also <br>&nbsp;<br>

create problems for third parties. It would be not be helpful if the law were to introduce distinctions where it mattered to parties whether or not a private company had a secretary.
</p>

<a name="60227-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 289. We agree that the reference in Clause 249 to an &quot;offence under this paragraph&quot; is incorrect and that the correct word is &quot;section&quot;. Therefore, we accept this amendment.

</p>

<a name="60227-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The Minister was right in saying that the distinction between public and private companies is important. We accept that. However, to say simply that all private companies can dispense with secretaries is not the right answer either, because the game is in part given away by the fact that private companies have an audit threshold. If the argument from the Government is that this is complex, it is complex to have an audit threshold, and a secretarial threshold at the same level would not add greatly to the complexity.

<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="60227-48_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, as he asks a very good question. We are using a benchmark adopted by the Government, in the audit threshold. If you have assets of &#163;2.2 million or turnover in excess of &#163;5.6 million, you have to have an audit. That means that the company has a size and sophistication that requires an imprimatur from an outside body&#151;namely, an audit, and I have no problem with the audit threshold. All we are doing is to link the secretarial requirement to that same level.

I accept part of the noble Lord&#039;s point, which is that wherever you draw the line there is bound to be companies that fall just the wrong side of it. I accept that.

<a name="60227-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>On the points that the Minister made, I understand that he is not inclined to accept the line that we are drawing in the sand.

We have made it clear that there is no need for a secretary in small, private companies because it is cheaper. If the company does not have a secretary, and in the absence of someone whose function it is specifically to focus on governance and other issues, the directors should specifically be made aware that that is a joint and several responsibility.

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 290, I shall speak to Amendment No. 292 as well. Amendment No. 290 would extend the requirement for all companies which wish to have a secretary that the secretary should appear to have the requisite knowledge and experience to discharge the functions of secretary and, by Amendment No. 292, for public companies only, the requirements of a qualification under subsection (2) of Clause 250.

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>If a company chooses to have a secretary, I see no reason why that person should not be required to be competent in his role, and the responsibility of selection must lie with the directors. However, the test to become a secretary of a private company could be set a little lower. As such, the amendment seeks to leave the higher test only for public companies by inserting the words in Amendment No.  292. I beg to move.

<a name="60227-49_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Amendments Nos. 290 and 292 would extend the ambit of Clause 250 to require that where a company had appointed a secretary, it would be the duty of the directors to ensure that the secretary had the requisite knowledge and experience. That would mean that the directors of larger private companies which were required to appoint a secretary and the directors of any smaller private companies which had chosen to appoint a company secretary in addition to public companies would be bound by this duty. Amendment No. 292 is linked to this and would provide that only the secretary of a public company would have the qualifications as set out in subsections (2) and (3) of Clause 250.
</p>

secretary. However, given our approach to private company secretaries, I see no reason for providing for a specific duty on the directors of, say, a private company which had chosen to appoint a secretary to ensure that such a secretary has the requisite knowledge and experience. Section 286 of the 1985 Act, which is restated in this clause, makes provision as to the qualifications of public company secretaries only, and I am not persuaded that any of these requirements should be extended to anyone appointed secretary to a private company. Again, this would result in unnecessary regulation on the directors of private companies and would be contrary to the recommendations of the company law review. A central function of the Bill is to reduce regulation and to reduce that which has very little purpose other than as regulations. That seems to be not in the spirit of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="60227-49_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I certainly agree with the Minister on that last sentiment: we would support removing regulation that has no purpose other than regulation. I am surprised that he has not been more sympathetic to this pair of amendments. If a group of directors decides to appoint a secretary, it is surely in the interests of all of us&#151;UK plc, everybody&#151;that that secretary should be competent and capable. We are simply saying that if you choose to go down this road&#151;you are not required to&#151;you must make sure that that person is competent. There is a slightly higher test for a public company&#151;that is why we left the lower test for private companies.

<a name="60227-50_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   The whole purpose of any regulation has to be that this is a requirement&#151;one does not simply leave it to the discretion of the directors. Where we are saying that they have the responsibility to say what the duties of a company secretary are, it follows that they should see that the person to whom they give those duties has the necessary experience. The question is: does one require regulation for any purpose to mean that they have to do that?

That seems a potentially onerous requirement at worst and a rather fuzzy one at best. What are &quot;all reasonable <br>&nbsp;<br>

steps&quot;? This could end up as another long list of box-ticking exercises that directors are required to perform, which is far from the deregulatory objectives the Minister was espousing a minute or two ago.
</p>

<a name="60227-50_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Further, it has been argued that it will be hard for directors to get any guidance on what steps have to be taken to meet the test of &quot;all reasonable steps&quot; until this reaches the courts. That would paralyse directors seeking to recruit a secretary by requiring them to be overly risk-averse, thus diverting them from other tasks in connection with the running of their companies.
</p>

<a name="60227-50_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>If the word &quot;all&quot; were removed, directors would then simply have to take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; in this matter. Given their common law duties, that should provide enough incentive for directors to recruit a suitable candidate while not tying them up in pointless exercises designed to cover their backs in the event of possible litigation. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="60227-50_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>These amendments deal with the issue of which companies must keep registers of secretaries and all the subsequent duties associated with that register. Under the current wording, only public companies need keep a register of secretaries. Amendment No. 294 and the consequential amendments change that, so that any company that is required to have a secretary or, although not required to do so, has one, would be required to keep a register and to inform the registrar of changes to that register. This is another strand in a thread of amendments that restores to the Bill the statutory backing of secretaries that is currently lacking. It should not matter whether a secretary is required or not; if a company has a secretary, that person should be given full statutory authority to act as a secretary and should therefore be subject to all the controls that that authority entails. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="60227-50_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Amendments Nos. 294, 295, 296, 297 and 298 would require all companies which were required to or which had chosen to appoint a secretary to keep a register of secretaries and notify the registrar of any changes in their secretary or particulars registered. The Bill&#039;s approach to company secretaries is simple: public companies must have a secretary; private companies may do so but are not required to. Whether or not a private company appoints a secretary, that decision will affect only its directors and members. The Bill ensures that third parties will not be affected by their decision. It would be unnecessary regulation, therefore, to require either the existence or the identity of the secretary of a private company to be on the public record. Consequently the Bill removes any requirement for the secretary of a private company to appear on the public register. I therefore hope that the noble Lord will withdraw Amendment No. 294.

We come back to an issue we touched on briefly earlier in the proceedings and what is intended by these clauses. As far as we can see, &quot;stock&quot; does not appear in the index of defined expressions in Schedule 9 and it is not clear why &#163;10 of stock should give equal voting rights to one share, particularly since that share is of an undefined par value. I was grateful for the Minister&#039;s attempt to explain about stock when I spoke to Amendment No. 114. He said that stock could be subdivided in a way that shares could not, but further clarity about the clause as a whole would be helpful. For example, is it intended that Clause 261 should be a default position, in that the company&#039;s articles may provide for different voting, for example with classes of shares and weighted voting or non-voting stock, as provided for in Clause 261(4)? It seems that clarification would be useful and, in particular, I am not clear why &#163;10 of stock automatically equals one share. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="60227-51_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   I shall explain the difference between stocks and shares in this context and the reason we need to have this clause. If a company has 100 shares of &#163;1 each, its members can hold whole numbers of shares only. However, if its share capital is converted to stock, members can hold fractions of stock, so a member could hold 16.73 of stock and this is where the complexity comes in. The use of &#163;10 is historical and is a default provision. Taking the two points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, together, the Bill will no longer provide for companies to issue stock in the future. Companies will be able to issue shares only. However, there will continue to be companies that have stock rather than shares and for those companies, we must provide default rules on voting rights and rights to appoint proxies. Thus, Clause 261(3) restates Section 370(6) of the 1985 Act by ensuring that, as a default, a member of a company with stock may <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC52"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC52</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

exercise one vote in respect of each &#163;10 of stock he holds. Clause 299(1), which is the subject of the amendment, makes an equivalent provision for written resolutions. We need this in the context of the new written resolution procedure. Similarly, Clause 299(2) ensures that a member may appoint multiple proxies: one proxy for each &#163;10 of stock held. It is necessary to have this provision as a default position for companies that have stock. I hope the noble Lord will accept the need for this clause.

That clause makes it clear that shareholders have to be informed about the meeting. Amendment No. 300CZA requires companies to notify its relevant members of such a posting. That must be good sense, as it will avoid the undesirable situation where information could pass by unnoticed by those for whom it is intended.

<a name="60227-51_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson, Lord De Mauley, Lord Sharman and Lord Razzall, for tabling these amendments, which are the first of several amendments they have tabled in relation to the written resolutions provisions under Part 13. This is an important, even if relatively uncontentious, part of the Bill. Private companies will no longer be required to pass an elective resolution to dispense with the AGM; they will not need to hold an AGM at all. At the same time, it will be easier to pass written resolutions. Consequently, companies are expected to make extensive use of the new written resolution procedures and it is essential for us to get those procedures right.

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>Turning to Amendments Nos. 300CZA, and 300EZA, noble Lords are seeking to ensure that members are notified by the company when a written resolution is posted on the website. We agree entirely with that sentiment. It is quite right that members cannot be expected to check the website just in case company information has been posted. That is why we have imposed a requirement under the communications provisions of the Bill&#151;specifically Clause 751(6) and paragraph 12 of Schedule 6 for non-traded companies&#151;to notify intended recipients of the presence of all official documents or information that is sent, in the language of the Bill,

Clause 270 specifies what a company has to do when it is required to circulate to its members a written resolution proposed by some members of the company. Subsection (3) requires a company to distribute copies of a member&#039;s written resolution within 21 days of being requested to do so by those members. The subsection contains a proviso that, if the written resolution is circulated to members on different days, then the first copy should be dispatched not more than 21 days after the request for the resolution to be circulated. That is clearly contradictory. The requirement should surely be that the last copy of the resolution should be circulated within the 21-day limit and not outside it. I beg to move.

Subsection (3) requires the company to circulate copies of the resolution to members within 21 days of being requested to do so. If the copies are circulated from one member to another in turn, as allowed under subsection (2)(b), then subsection (3) requires only that the first of those copies should be sent out within the 21-day limit.

However, given the proviso of circulation being done &quot;without undue delay&quot;, we took the view that it was sufficient to require only the first of the copies to be sent out within 21 days.

If, as envisaged in Clause 272(2), a resolution can be returned to the company in electronic form, clarity is needed as to how a member is to &quot;indicate&quot; or &quot;signify&quot; his agreement to it. Amendment No. 300EZA will provide for that clarity by requiring a resolution, to which written agreement can be given, to give instructions on how such agreement should be given by the members. Similarly, the signification signified in line 22 also refers back to that and makes it clear how the instructions are to be followed. I beg to move.

The amendments seek to require a member to indicate his agreement to a written resolution by following the instructions given in the resolution. The implication here is that a member will be allowed to signify his agreement only in the manner given in the instructions and that the company will not be able to accept his agreement if it is given in any other way.

Clause 270(4)(a) requires the company to include guidance&#151;I stress that this is guidance and not instructions&#151;on how to signify agreement. It should describe the applicable rules rather than create them. Of course, under the communications provisions in Part 28 and Schedule 5, a company may specify that it requires written communications or particular types of electronic communication. In this case, the guidance provided with a written resolution should make that clear.

In most circumstances, that is an appropriate piece of deregulation with which we have no problem. However, the downside is that annual general meetings often provided a valuable means&#151;indeed, often the only means&#151;of calling directors to account, as pointed out in a letter which appeared in the <i>Times</i> on 7 February.

The amendments would lower the bar to enable the calling of such meetings from shareholders holding 10 per cent of paid-up capital or voting rights to 5 per cent. That would give members more opportunity to call directors to account for their actions in using investors&#039; money.

I emphasise that here we are dealing with circumstances where there is no other redress for shareholders because the company will have dispensed with the holding of an AGM and this is the only way that they are able to call directors to account. Our point is that, if you wish not to have an annual general meeting, the corollary to that is that the bar for someone being able to make you have a meeting should be lowered from 10 to 5 per cent.

The amendments seek to reduce the threshold required for members to require a general meeting to be called from 10 to 5 per cent of paid-up capital or voting rights. That would make it easier for members to require a general meeting to be called but it could also result in significant unanticipated cost burdens on companies.

The Government are wrong not to accept a 5 per cent threshold because, if a company has nothing to hide, there is nothing to fear. In the circumstances, 5 per cent is still a pretty high barrier. The Government should look again at this matter. I am sure that we will return to it, given that 5 per cent is accepted elsewhere. Therefore, to some extent, the impasse has been solved.

We are again grateful to Mr Matthew Collings of Maitland Chambers for helping us. On the one hand, the amendments would provide limitations to the process whereby members can force the directors of a company to call a general meeting. On the other, they would protect members from being ruled out of order on a technicality.
</p>

<a name="60227-53_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>Amendment No. 300FD would ensure that there is not a resolutions free-for-all at a meeting. The business of the meeting must correspond with the reasons for which it has been called. The amendment would add two new paragraphs to Clause 279(4). Amendment No. 300FE would add a new subsection (6) for the same purpose. The amendments would stop shareholders bouncing directors.
</p>

<a name="60227-53_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>Amendments 300FC, 300FF, 300FG and 300FH are designed to stop the directors doing the bouncing. They would reduce the scope for the use of technicalities to deflect the underlying purpose of the meeting. Amendment No. 300FC is aimed at situations where shareholders are ruled out of order on the grounds that the resolution is not quite right and a technicality allows directors to refuse to have it considered. Case law exists in which shareholders who have called meetings to consider specific resolutions have been stymied by directors altering the text of those resolutions at the meeting, despite the fact that their thrust was clear and all fell well within the scope of the specified business of the meeting.
</p>

<a name="60227-53_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>For the same reasons as I gave when speaking to Amendments Nos. 300FA and 300FB, this process should be user-friendly. It should not seek to catch out members with technicalities where there is no good reason to do so, but, at the same time, general meetings should not be hijacked and taken beyond the specified scope of the meeting. These proposals strike a balance between these two objectives. I hope that the Minister will accept them. I beg to move.

<a name="60227-53_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   The amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, to Clauses 279, 280 and 281 concern the terms of a resolution to be moved at, and the nature of the business to be conducted at, a meeting of the company required by the members. Together, the amendments appear to seek to achieve three main objectives: first, to ensure that the wording of a resolution to be moved at a meeting required by members can be changed; secondly, to ensure that notices of such meetings state the general nature of business to be conducted; and, thirdly, to provide that business outside the scope of business as stated in the notice is out of order.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC61"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column GC61</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60227-53_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>I shall deal with the first objective relating to the terms of a resolution to be moved. While the power for members to require a general meeting under Clause 279 derives from Section 368 of the 1985 Act, the Bill introduces a new right for members, if they wish, to include the text of a resolution to be moved at the meeting. However, Clause 279 does not differentiate between ordinary and special resolutions. Case law provides that for an ordinary resolution it is not necessary for the notice of the meeting to set out the actual terms of the resolution and that a general indication of the nature of the proposed business at the meeting is sufficient. But, for a special resolution, the meeting notice must specify the exact terms of the resolution to be moved, and the text, apart from minor grammatical corrections or clerical errors, cannot be changed.
</p>

<a name="60227-53_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>We think that the noble Lord&#039;s amendments are unnecessary. For ordinary resolutions, although the clauses state that the text must be included, there is nothing in the Bill to preclude similar resolutions being tabled at the meeting. For special resolutions, we would want to preserve the existing requirement for the text to be stated in the notice.
</p>

<a name="60227-53_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>The nature of the business to be conducted at a meeting required by members cannot be looked at in isolation from Clause 287. Subsection (2) already requires the notice of a general meeting to state the general nature of the business to be dealt with at the meeting. As in existing law, this is subject to the articles. The noble Lord&#039;s amendments seek to reinforce the point that no other business can be conducted at the meeting but, as this is already the general law, we think that the amendments are unnecessary.

<a name="60227-54_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for the very thorough research and response to the amendments. What he said was quite technical and he also referred to later clauses. Rather than respond now, it will be better if I read carefully what he said, consider the cross-references that he made to later clauses and then perhaps come back at a later stage. I do not think that I can usefully respond further now. I am grateful to the noble Lord. I may wish to come back to the matter later when I have thought and read further. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="wms_subhd_0"></a>
<a name="60227-54_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Africa: Gleneagles Plan</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="60227-54_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60227-54_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>In my Written Statement of 12 December, I set out the Government&#039;s commitment to ensuring that the pledges on Africa and development made at the G8 summit at Gleneagles in July are implemented. The Gleneagles implementation plan for Africa consists of the milestones that the Government believe need to be achieved, and I indicated that we would update this plan monthly. I am placing a copy of the first update in the Libraries. This highlights progress made against the milestones set for December and January; and also incorporates new milestones that have been adopted by the international community.
</p>

<a name="60227-54_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>All the milestones for December and January have    been achieved, with the exception of the implementation of the multilateral debt relief initiative by the African Development Bank (AfDB). This is now expected by July, and the AfDB will apply debt relief retrospectively to January 2006. As expected, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) implemented this initiative in January, and the World Bank will be implementing it in July.
</p>

<a name="60227-54_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>EU Heads of Government agreed a new EU strategic partnership with Africa at the European Council in December. This provides a framework to guide Europe&#039;s activities as it increases its support to the continent.
</p>

<a name="60227-54_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>The World Trade Organisation Ministerial in Hong Kong in December did not achieve as much as the Government would have wished. However, it did agree a deadline of 2013 for the elimination of agricultural export subsidies; and that developed countries should provide quota and duty-free access to their markets for most products (97 per cent) from least developed countries by 2008. Substantial new funds were also pledged to build developing countries&#039; capacity to trade, including &#163;100 million a year by 2010 from the UK.
</p>

<a name="60227-54_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>The United Nations Peace Building Commission was established and the UK have been elected as a member. The United Nations Convention Against Corruption entered into force on 14 December, following ratification by 30 countries. The UK have sent their instrument of ratification to the UN on 30 January and ratified it on 9 February. A new global plan to stop tuberculosis was launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos. My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who attended the forum, confirmed the Government&#039;s strong support for this plan.

<a name="60227-54_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>Two future milestones have been adjusted. The first is the bonds for the International Financing Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm), which are now likely to be launched in April rather than February, due to delays in finalising the legal documents with donors. The second is the Central Emergency Revolving Fund, which is now expected to be launched in March rather than February.

<a name="60227-54_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Gordon Brown) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60227-54_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>At its meeting of 14 February 2006 the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) adopted opinions on the stability programmes of Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria and on the convergence programmes of Estonia, Latvia and Slovenia.
</p>

<a name="60227-54_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>ECOFIN discussed the Commission&#039;s annual progress report on the Lisbon agenda and held a first debate on the ECOFIN key issues paper for spring European Council.
</p>

<a name="60227-54_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>The council discussed the role the European Investment Bank can play in promoting jobs and growth.
</p>

<a name="60227-54_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>ECOFIN examined a report from the Economic Policy Committee on the impact of ageing populations on the sustainability of public expenditure and agreed council conclusions on the basis of that report.
</p>

<a name="60227-54_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>ECOFIN was de-briefed on a conference held on 6   to 7 February to discuss VAT fraud issues. The council was briefed on a forthcoming conference on innovative methods of financing for development. The Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Ivan Lewis MP, represented the UK.

<a name="60227-54_head2"></a><h3 align=center>Income Tax Bill</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="60227-54_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My honourable friend the Financial Secretary (John Healey) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60227-54_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>I am pleased to tell the House that the Government&#039;s tax law rewrite project will soon reach another major milestone. Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs will shortly publish a draft of the project&#039;s fourth Bill, the Income Tax Bill, which will in practice complete the rewrite of income tax. More specifically, it covers the core provisions of income tax, the mechanics of the tax computation and a variety of reliefs and other provisions. It is planned to introduce the Bill in Parliament by the end of 2006. The project&#039;s three previous Bills were enacted as the Capital Allowances Act 2001, the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005.
</p>

<a name="60227-54_para29"></a>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="60227-55_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Jack Straw) is today announcing the winding up of the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust (ISSLT) in accordance with the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act 1987. The ISSLT was founded in 1922 to provide support for Irish First World War veterans and their dependants. In 1997 his predecessor gave direction to commence the final winding up of the trust. This process has now been completed. The residual assets and liabilities of the ISSLT will now be taken forward by the Milibern Trust, which has managed the day-to-day running of ISSLT holdings since 2001 and will continue to use the assets for the benefit of all Irish ex-service personnel in need and their dependants.

<a name="60227-55_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Murder and Manslaughter</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="60227-55_spmin1"></a><b>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </b>  On 1   September 2005 we published a consultation paper <i>Hearing the Relatives of Murder and Manslaughter Victims</i>.
</p>

<a name="60227-55_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>Our consultation paper outlined proposals for piloting ways of providing improved assistance to bereaved relatives of homicide victims by: improving advice and support to relatives during the criminal justice process, and helping bereaved relatives make an oral statement to the court after conviction but before sentencing about the effect of the crime on them.
</p>

<a name="60227-55_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>The consultation closed on 30 November 2005. In total we received 87 responses. The overall number of returns was sufficient to provide a good cross-section of views on the proposals from stakeholders across the legal profession, the criminal justice system, victims&#039; organisations, relatives of victims of murder and manslaughter and members of the public.

</p>

<a name="60227-55_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>The consultation provided firm support for the Government&#039;s aim to put the needs of victims at the heart of the criminal justice system. Many respondents supported efforts to improve the information and support given to relatives throughout the criminal justice process. Respondents supported the Government&#039;s proposals for the courts to be better informed about the impact of the crime on the relatives of murder and manslaughter victims. Families of victims and victims&#039; groups, as well as many within the criminal justice system, welcomed proposals to give victims a real voice in court, including allowing them to make an oral statement to the court after conviction but before sentencing. We published a summary of the responses on 23 February 2006.

The pilots will cover those bereaved by murder and manslaughter within a    12-month period. Pilots will take place at Birmingham, Cardiff, the Central Criminal Court, Manchester Crown Square and Winchester.

<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="60227-55_spmin2"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker): </b>  The Northern Ireland Priorities and Budget 2006&#150;08, launched on 14 December 2005, established three new ring-fenced priority funding packages for: children and young people; skills and science; and environment and renewable energy. These funding packages are worth some &#163;48 million in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;58 million in 2007&#150;08, and underpinned by a further &#163;15 million and &#163;34 million capital investment in those years.
</p>

<a name="60227-55_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The priority funding packages will direct resources to services that make real differences to people&#039;s lives&#151;in children and young people; in promoting long-term economic growth through investment in training and skills; and in protecting the environment by the research and development of new sources of renewable and clean energy. A fundamental aspect of   these funds will be the integrated delivery of programmes and activities to ensure real and effective joined-up thinking and working by the key departments and agencies involved.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><i>Children and Young People</i>
</p>

<a name="60227-55_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>For children and young people, some &#163;28 million and &#163;33 million will be available to ensure every child has the best start in life. This will include driving forward our policies in areas such as pre-school and    extended/out-of-hours school-based activities, childcare and Sure Start, along with measures to foster their health and well-being. This will be a distinctive allocation of funding that will be used to make good the shortfall in provision for these key areas of support for families.

<a name="60227-55_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><i>Skills and Science</i>
</p>

<a name="60227-55_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>We are already committed to significant investment in skills and training programmes for employment. We recognise the critical importance of ensuring a secure foundation for lifelong learning and employment. It is for this reason that &#163;15 million next year and &#163;20 million the year after will be available to tackle economic inactivity and to promote greater investment in skills and science training leading to employment&#151;alongside investment in research and development.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>The quality of life in the future will also depend on our children continuing to enjoy the same clean and healthy environment that we do. That means that we need to take action now to support the development and use of renewable forms of energy.
</p>

<a name="60227-55_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>An extra &#163;5 million in each of the next two years will   be allocated to encourage the research and development of renewable forms of energy. Over the next two years, &#163;10 million and &#163;30 million will also be available for capital investment in renewable energy. Capital investment of &#163;5 million in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;4 million in 2007&#150;08 will also be available to ensure the Warm Homes Scheme in Northern Ireland can be extended to match the commitments made for central heating for pensioners in England, as set out in the Chancellor&#039;s recent Pre-Budget Report.
</p>

<a name="60227-55_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>On 21 February I announced details of the skills and science funding package, outlining the objectives and the range of activities that will be taken forward. I have today placed details of this funding package in the Library, together with details of the environment and renewable energy funding package. I will place details of the children and young people&#039;s funding package in the Library on 7 March.

<a name="60227-55_spmin3"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  Russian citizen Boris Abramovich Berezovsky was granted asylum in the UK in 2003, as is public knowledge. The grant of asylum to Mr Berezovsky was made after due assessment by the relevant authorities of his case and of the UK&#039;s obligations under the 1951 UN Convention on refugees and domestic law. He did not enter the UK at the invitation of Her Majesty&#039;s Government. A grant of asylum does not imply support from the UK Government for an individual&#039;s views, activities or statements.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>Legislation to prevent companies making arrangements in order to obtain corporation tax relief in the UK for losses of a company established outside the UK will be introduced in the Finance Bill 2006. The legislation will apply to claims for loss relief by UK resident companies, and UK branches of companies which are not UK resident, and will deny loss relief in the UK where there are arrangements which either result in losses becoming unrelievable outside the UK that were otherwise relievable, or give rise to unrelievable losses which would not have arisen but for the availability of relief in the UK, if the main purpose or one of the main purposes of those arrangements is to obtain UK relief.
</p>

<a name="60227-56_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>The legislation will have effect from 20 February 2006. A press notice issued by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on that date giving the relevant background to, and further detail on, this measure was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on 20 February 2006 and is also accessible on HMRC&#039;s website.

<a name="60227-56_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  The General Affairs and External Relations Council decided on 30 January to renew the European Union&#039;s sanctions against the Government of Zimbabwe, with effect from 21 February, for a further 12 months. The European Union&#039;s sanctions are an arms embargo, and a travel ban and assets freeze on Mr Mugabe and leading members of his regime. The renewal of these measures sends a powerful message of the European Union&#039;s continued concern about the erosion of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. The European Union&#039;s measures are specifically targeted against the Mugabe regime rather than the economic interests of ordinary Zimbabweans. Indeed, the European Union and its member states continue to provide considerable <br>&nbsp;<br>

humanitarian aid to ordinary Zimbabweans. The United Kingdom is one of the three largest cash donors to Zimbabwe, alongside the European Union and the United States, providing &#163;38 million in the 2005&#150;06 financial year for humanitarian assistance and tackling HIV/AIDS.
</p>

<a name="60227-56_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>In the past 12 months the situation has deteriorated, with two flawed elections, further human rights abuses, woeful economic mismanagement, an unchecked food crisis, and country-wide destruction of informal settlements and markets, affecting more than 700,000 people. These developments have created growing international concern, with the United Nations, European Union, African Union and neighbouring states seeking an urgent resolution of the crisis. Sadly, Mr Mugabe&#039;s policies continue to damage his country. In the past few weeks his regime has underlined its contempt for basic human rights and for the welfare of its people. They have launched a sustained programme of intimidation against an independent radio station, Voice of the People, and are preventing journalists for both foreign media organisations and Zimbabwean newspapers from legally carrying out their work.

aimed at benefiting Mr Mugabe&#039;s cronies. There have also been attacks on opposition-led local councils. Most recently they have arrested hundreds of women and children taking part in peaceful demonstrations. We are strongly concerned at these developments. A free media is essential to the healthy development of any country, and media repression is the hallmark of regimes attempting to hide their failings. Continued land seizures destroy Zimbabwe&#039;s agricultural productivity and underline Mr Mugabe&#039;s contempt for property rights and the rule of law. Vibrant and independent local government and the right to freely express views through peaceful demonstrations are the building blocks of healthy democracy.
</p>

<a name="60227-56_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>We call on the Government of Zimbabwe to respond without delay to the concerns set out by the international community, including the United Nations, European Union and the African Commission on Human and People&#039;s Rights. The Government of Zimbabwe need to demonstrate commitment to the restoration of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law, and the pursuit of sustainable economic policies.
</p>

<a name="60227-56_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>We will continue our pressure on the Government of Zimbabwe to reform, and will continue to provide support for the long-suffering Zimbabwean people.

The possibility of such monitoring cannot, however, override the need for a thorough risk assessment before the issue of any licence. If a licence application is not consistent with the consolidated EU and national export licensing criteria it will be refused. Our overseas posts watch carefully for reports about the possible misuse of UK-exported equipment in the countries that they cover. Defence and military attach&#233;s, where available, are a valuable resource in this regard and in the rigorous assessment of export licence applications themselves.

[HL4124]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_34"></a>
<a name="60227w04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   The use of solar photovoltaics is one of the more expensive means of generating electricity. The Energy Saving Trust report on microgeneration states that a typical domestic installation costs around &#163;12,500.
</p>

<a name="60227w04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a>However, the Government recognise that there are circumstances where photovoltaics could become more economic; for example, where the cost of connecting to the grid is particularly high, or where they are being used instead of a premium building cladding. There are also a range of non-cost values and attributes that make photovoltaics an attractive option, which is why the number of installations has grown substantially in recent years (from 589kWp in 1997 to around 8,164kWp in 2004).
</p>

<a name="60227w04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a>Part L of the Building Regulations sets levels for energy performance in ways that offer designers the flexibility to choose solutions that best meet their needs, are cost-effective and practical, and enable innovation. Without prescribing solutions this enables builders to take up the benefits of renewable and other &quot;low and zero carbon&quot; technologies.
</p>

<a name="60227w04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a>In September 2005, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced further improvements to these energy efficiency requirements that will come into effect in April 2006 that will encourage greater take-up of renewable and other low carbon systems. The overall package of proposed changes, including the further encouragement of low and zero carbon systems will save around 0.9 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2010 and help to combat climate change.

The report supports the decision of the UK to open its labour markets and the Government welcome this endorsement of their decision. Nationals from the new member states are making a welcome contribution to our economy and society. They are taking employment in sectors where hard-to-fill vacancies exist and in many cases are supporting the provision of public services in communities across the UK.

<p><a name="wa_st_56"></a>
<a name="60227w07_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  Preventing conflict and building stability are fundamental to the Government&#039;s foreign policy. The Prime Minister&#039;s Strategy Unit (PMSU) report <i>Investing in Prevention</i> underlines the importance of continued government effort to make the international response to instability and conflict more effective. The report&#039;s recommendations are broadly consistent with government policy. The role played by the UK&#039;s EU and G8 presidencies in building international commitment to tackle instability and improve crisis response, particularly in Africa, is one example; UK efforts in support of the successful establishment of the UN Peacebuilding Commission, alongside our contribution in helping to build UN and regional organisations&#039; peacekeeping capacity, is another.

[HL4059]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_58"></a>
<a name="60227w07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   We have urged Iran on many occasions to reinstate and maintain a full suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, which they agreed to in the Paris agreement, and which has been requested many times by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of governors as an essential confidence-building measure.
</p>

<a name="60227w07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_29"></a>Iran&#039;s resumption of uranium conversion last August violated their commitments in the Paris agreement and was a rejection of the process of negotiations under that agreement. Despite this, the E3/EU held exploratory discussions with Iran on 21 December 2005 to see whether it was possible to agree a basis for resuming negotiations. The E3/EU made clear that for any resumption of negotiations to be possible it would be essential for Iran to refrain from any further erosion of the suspension. In full knowledge of this, Iran resumed enrichment-related activity on 10 January 2006.
</p>

<a name="60227w07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_30"></a>The E3/EU have been flexible, twice last autumn delaying involving the Security Council to leave more time for diplomacy and for Iran to address international concerns. Iran have responded by hardening their position and further disregarding IAEA board resolutions. On 4 February, the IAEA board decided with an overwhelming majority to ask the IAEA director-general to report to the Security Council the steps required of Iran by the board. The onus is now on Iran to reinstate a full suspension without delay.

[HL3596]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_65"></a>
<a name="60227w08_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  Responsibility for the funding of secure psychiatric services rests with primary care trusts, which are required to identify the needs of their population and develop integrated local secure services accordingly. There is, however, central oversight of the arrangements for the commissioning of high-security psychiatric services, and the funding for these services is effectively ring-fenced. The Government are undertaking a capacity review of high- and medium-security services with a view to ensuring that they are of a level and quality to meet current and future requirements, and that they sit within an integrated network of wider mental health services. Courts have the power to refer offenders to the Criminal Justice Liaison Scheme (CJLS)&#151;sometimes referred to as the Court Diversion Scheme.
</p>

<a name="60227w08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_34"></a>There are currently 139 local schemes that allow mental health assessments of offenders to be undertaken in order to provide the court with information about the offender&#039;s mental condition and any treatment that may be appropriate. This enables the courts to refer offenders to mental health services, where their mental condition warrants this, rather than to proceed automatically with a prosecution. Where a prosecution is appropriate, courts have the power to order the admission of a convicted offender to hospital for treatment or to add a treatment requirement to a community order or suspended sentence order instead of passing a prison sentence.

The pooled treatment budget has increased significantly from &#163;191 million in 2002&#150;03 to &#163;299 million in 2005&#150;06. Attendance at residential rehabilitation services is voluntary, with some clients consenting to attend as part of a community sentence through the provision of a drug treatment and testing order, or from April 2005, a drug rehabilitation requirement of the community order. Residential rehabilitation services are not provided within a secure environment.

<a name="60227w08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_37"></a>The main reason cited by the British Dental Association (BDA) and individual dentists for increasing the proportion of work done privately has been concern that the current fee-per-item system of remuneration in the General Dental Services (GDS) <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WA27"></a>

<b>27 Feb 2006 : Column WA27</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

creates a &quot;treadmill&quot; effect that leads to excessive workload and insufficient time for preventative care. The new GDS contracts, being implemented from April, abolish the fee-per-item system and provide for dentists to receive a fixed annual NHS income (which will typically give a net income of around &#163;80,000 on average) in return for providing an agreed level of courses of treatment. This is designed to address the long-standing concerns expressed by the BDA and the profession, as well as promoting a more preventative approach that will have benefits for patients.
</p>

<a name="60227w08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_38"></a>In addition, over the last 10 years there has also been a significant increase in demand for private cosmetic treatment, which is, quite rightly, outside the scope of the NHS.
