as the universal service obligation requires that all but the most

no social obligations have been placed on mobile phone operators.
However, 99.9 per cent of the UK population live in postal districts

out of the licences, should there not be a social obligation on them to
extend basic coverage at least to all substantial villages in the

rainforest is crucial to developments in climate change and the fact
that we are still losing 12,000 acres a day in Brazil alone, can he
help us to understand why the European Union has withdrawn its support

Commission has provided significant funds for forest-sector work in
Brazil under the tropical forest budget line, which comes to an end
this year. There is a reorganisation involving the creation of a new
environment and natural resources fund. Money for forests will not be
ringfenced within the budget line, and I do not yet know what it will
mean for expenditure on, particularly, forestry. However, the
EC&#146;s Brazil country strategy paper provides for work on the
environment. Also, the EC will continue to contribute to PPG7, an
ambitious pilot programme set up in the 1990s with the World Bank and
other donors for forest conservation in
Brazil.</p><p><a name="06101746000025"></a><b><a name="61017-0001.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="06101746000269"></a>Baroness

Witness report regarding forest law? Experts estimate that we are
losing 137 plant, animal and insect species every single day due to
rainforest deforestation. That equates to the loss of 50,000 species a
year. Most important, as rainforest species disappear, so do many
possible cures for life-threatening diseases. What steps are Her

educate people through projects in countries with rainforest

held over a year ago, and they have been revisited at a high-level
meeting in Mexico attended by the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary
of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs just a short time ago.
The aim of those meetings is to deal with climate change in a general
sense and to make sure that the overall policies on the retention of
forests and the natural environment that is dependent on them is part
of the sustainable programme and project. I suggest that the outcomes
of the discussions in Mexico show a great willingness to do that and a
willingness to carry the issues into discussions in the United

one of the facts that my noble friend has introduced in his question.
The point about forestry is complex: it concerns the environment and
its contribution towards the elimination of some greenhouse gases. It
is also about different species of animals and about the people who
live in and are dependent on the forest as part of their way of life.

I have no doubt of that from any conversations that I have ever had

the development of sugar for other purposes, which, given what has
happened in Europe and elsewhere, is very significant to these

going into care is due almost entirely to care orders involving those
who would be at risk if they were not taken into care and is not due to
voluntary placements. The social exclusion action plan has at its heart
better identification and earlier intervention, including better
protection tools for use by front-line practitioners&#151;for
example, health visitors and community midwives. We very much expect
that giving the support to families that is needed will result in fewer

their parents will be better supported in the child&#146;s earliest
years.</p><p><a name="06101746000048"></a>In conjunction with that,

reach &#163;1.8 billion next year, which is double the figure for

Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I am sure that
everyone supports the Government&#146;s intention of reducing the
number of children taken into care. However, do the Government intend
to make available support and resources that would enable ageing
grandparents or disabled members of a child&#146;s family to take on
the responsibility for that child, who might otherwise have to be taken
into care, and, if not, why
not?</p><p><a name="06101746000050"></a><b><a name="61017-0001.htm_spnew40"></a><a name="06101746000293"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, kinship care is complex, as the
noble Baroness will recognise. At the moment, many relatives, including
grandparents, are registered foster carers and are eligible for the
full support available to foster carers, including the new minimum
allowances for foster parents, which were introduced this year. Local
authorities that have not offered those allowances to kinship carers
have been subject to legal action. Recently, a major local authority
settled an out-of-court action in respect of relatives who were not
given that allowance. Martin Narey will examine the wider issue of the
development of kinship care and the role that relatives such as
grandparents can play as part of his review on the future of
care.</p><p><a name="06101746000051"></a><b><a name="61017-0001.htm_spnew41"></a><a name="06101746000294"></a>The

the first place and to tackle issues such as the poor standard of
education which children in care experience at present, the more likely
we are to keep them out of the custody system&#151;a measure which I
am sure the right reverend Prelate supports. A whole section of the

choose to remain in foster care until the age of 21, or even later if
they are in further or higher education. Has the Minister any idea of
the number of young people choosing to do that? Will he assure the
House that, when the relevant figures are collected in future, the
figure relating to those children will be recorded separately so that
we can genuinely see any increase or decrease in the number of children

option to remain in care. Better support arrangements are in place to
enable them to do so. A substantial and rising proportion have chosen
to do so. I believe that we will monitor the number in the older age
ranges who choose to stay in care. I shall let the noble Baroness know

fact about children in care is that they are 66 times more likely to
have their own children taken into care, creating a generational
vicious circle. There are massive variations in the number of children
taken into care across the country. What action has been taken, other
than publishing the Green Paper, to address
that?</p><p><a name="06101746000056"></a><b><a name="61017-0001.htm_spnew46"></a><a name="06101746000299"></a>Lord

We are doing a great deal to promote best practice between local

Greengross:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
that helpful reply. I agree that NICE plays a very important role in
assessing the benefits of particular drugs and the direct costs of
providing them through the NHS. But does he not agree that it is the
Government&#146;s job to set those costs against their own
priorities, for example prevention of disease and early intervention,
and to take into account the costs of alternative medications that are
often needed and the huge cost to families, whose lives are turned
upside down when Alzheimer&#146;s strikes? Above all, there are the
costs to the national economy of carers being forced out of the labour
market, often on to state benefits for the rest of their life. Will the
Minister agree to take all those costs into account and tell your
Lordships&#146; House whether these drugs, at &#163;2.50 a day, are
really not
cost-effective?</p><p><a name="06101746000060"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew50"></a><a name="06101746000303"></a>Lord
Warner:</b> My Lords, we set up NICE with cross-party
support, and it has achieved a huge international reputation. It needs
to be able to carry out its difficult work free from political
interference. If Ministers were to overrule NICE, it would set a
dangerous and undesirable precedent.</p><p><a name="06101746000061"></a>The findings of the appraisal do not in
any way suggest that the drugs concerned should not be used for
moderate to severe Alzheimer&#146;s disease, except Ebixa, a new drug
that was not recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe
stages. The three existing drugs continue to be recommended for
moderate to severe Alzheimer&#146;s, and the patients currently
receiving all four drugs, whether routinely or as part of a clinical
trial, may continue to do so until it is considered appropriate to
stop. This is not a wholesale removal of those drugs from the treatment
of Alzheimer&#146;s
disease.</p><p><a name="06101746000062"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew51"></a><a name="06101746000304"></a>Lord
Forsyth of Drumlean:</b> My Lords,
does the Minister not accept that the health service once had a
principle that people should be able to get the care they need
regardless of ability to pay? No one is disputing that Aricept is not
effective in the early stages of treatment of Alzheimer&#146;s. What
is happening is that only those who can afford to buy the drugs will
get the treatment. That cannot be right, and the Minister cannot hide
behind his responsibilities as a Minister to ensure that the health
service does what it is supposed to do and remains true to its central
principles.</p><p><a name="06101746000063"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew52"></a><a name="06101746000305"></a>Lord

adhered firmly to the principle that the NHS provides free care at the
point of clinical need. If I may say so to the noble Lord, it is his

do not feel inclined to accept lectures on this issue from him. This

is a matter of extremely difficult clinical judgment to tell when early
Alzheimer&#146;s disease becomes moderately severe, when the drugs
may be prescribed under the NICE guidelines, and when it is advanced,
when according to the guidance the drugs may not be prescribed? It is
crucial that the guidance to be produced next month should be carefully

strongly support Amendment No. 7, standing in the name of the noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley.</p><p><a name="06101746000074"></a>In one
sense, the purpose of the amendment is to emulate the example of
legislators north of the Border in Scotland. They have seen fit to put
on the face of their legislation, as the cornerstone of everything they
want to achieve, the principle of the right of every child to
education. I should declare an interest at this point, because I am a
half-Scot and sometimes my English half wishes that we had the courage
of Scots conviction. With the greatest possible respect to the
Minister, I believe that he should again look at this point before he
finally makes up his mind.</p><p><a name="06101746000075"></a>The
Minister listens very carefully to arguments&#151;he is almost
exemplary in how this should be done&#151;and he is extremely
courteous and thorough in following up points. We approached and
discussed this issue in Committee, and I deeply appreciate the full
letter that he has sent to me about the concerns behind my amendment. I
am sure that it was no fault of the department, but I am afraid that
the Minister&#146;s letter did not reach me in time to have meetings
with his officials before this discussion. However, because I take his
letter seriously, I should like to examine some of the points that he
makes in it.</p><p><a name="06101746000076"></a>He emphasises that
the right to education is guaranteed by Article 2 of the first protocol
to the European Convention on Human Rights and, for children, by
Article 28 of the European Convention on the Rights of the Child. The
right to education, he argues, is provided by the European convention
and is already part of national law by virtue of the Human Rights Act
1998. We recognised that when we argued our case in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06101746000077"></a>I
do not believe that anyone could be a more committed internationalist
than I am. I am glad that the conventions say what they do and I am
proud of the part that Britain played in leading the cause in making
those conventions. However, internationalist though I am and seriously
though I take the conventions, at a time when we are determined to make
a success of our education system&#151;the Minister is second to no 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_652"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 652</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one in that respect&#151;and when we are also debating other
dimensions, such as the importance of emphasising what it is to be
British, what makes the British character and what is important about
Britain, I believe it is important that we do not approach education
simply by saying, &#147;Ah, we now have commitments under certain
international conventions and the right is established under those
conventions&#148;. We must make it clear that in our own approach
within the United Kingdom to these matters we take the right to
education of every child as absolutely central to everything that we
do. For that reason, I believe that the Scots were right and I wish
that we would follow their
example.</p><p><a name="06101746000078"></a>The Minister argued
that, because the objective is spelt out in the Human Rights Act 1998,
the amendment would confuse the issue as it would not be clear whether
the Human Rights Act or this Bill prevailed. I do not think that there
is any problem in that respect. As I understand it, it is absolutely
clear that ultimately the European Convention on Human Rights prevails
in all aspects of legislation and activity in this
country.</p><p><a name="06101746000079"></a>My noble friend also
goes on to emphasise the importance of the judgment by the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Bingham, in the Ali case, when he upheld what has
been described as the fourfold foundation for this right. The Minister
very kindly spells out again in his letter to me what the fourfold
commitment amounts to. The first element is the duty of parents under
Section 7 of the Education Act 1996 to cause their children to receive
efficient and suitable full-time education, either by regular
attendance at school or otherwise. That is a great objective and a
great principle. But what happens if the parents do not share that
commitment or do not fulfil it?</p><p><a name="06101746000080"></a>The second element is the Secretary of
State's duty under Section 10 of the Education Act 1996 to promote the
education of the people of England and Wales. Again, that is absolutely
salutary. That is great, but that is not an objective that
automatically becomes fulfilled. To promote the importance of it is not
actually ensuring that it happens.</p><p><a name="06101746000081"></a>The third element is
that local education authorities are required by Section 13 of that Act
to secure that efficient education is available to meet the needs of
the population of their areas. Such education being available is not
ensuring that every child enjoys it. The fourth element is that
maintained schools themselves have a responsibility to ensure that
their governing bodies conduct the schools with a view to promoting
high standards of educational achievement at the schools. Again, that
is excellent but it does not ensure that every child is able to enjoy
that
provision.</p><p><a name="06101746000082"></a>On
Report, we are proposing, in a slightly different form, that, because
of the residual overall responsibility of local education authorities,
it should be made quite clear that those authorities have a
responsibility to secure the right to education for every child. We
then go on to demonstrate how that should be done. Part 1 of the Bill
talks about the responsibilities of local education authorities. For
local education authorities in England it is about promoting high
standards, ensuring fair access to educational opportunity and
promoting the fulfilment by every child concerned of 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_653"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 653</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>its educational potential. Those are all absolutely first-class
principles&#151;none of us would question them&#151;but not one of
them ensures that that right is being enjoyed. With great respect to my
noble friend, we spell out in the amendment the fact that local
educational authorities have a responsibility to secure the rights
spelt out in the convention&#151;we are not now insisting that it is
established as a right in the introduction to the Bill, but we want to
establish the right that the Government themselves argue is established
in the convention.</p><p><a name="06101746000083"></a>I know that
the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, with all her experience and all her
usual commitment and analytical power, will put forward a powerful
argument to this set of amendments. A mistake that all of us in
Parliament sometimes make is to think that the battle has been won when
we have introduced legislation. We have seldom won the battle; at best,
we have usually created opportunities. What wins the battle is winning
the hearts, minds, commitment and understanding of the widest possible
cross-section of people to the principles that we are trying to achieve
by education and by enthusing the population as a whole with an
objective that is worth while
achieving.</p><p><a name="06101746000084"></a>I ask my noble friend
to say that a responsibility and a right are spelt out in international
conventions, but we, for a host of convoluted reasons, do not think it
is appropriate to spell out that right in the Bill as the cornerstone
and presentation of all else we are doing. I think that is sad. With
the greatest possible respect to all concerned, I think it is
institutional Whitehall getting caught up in the niceties and missing
an opportunity to take the nation forward.</p><p><a name="06101746000085"></a>In his letter to me, the Minister
emphasised&#151;and he was generous to do it so strongly&#151;that
if there are doubts about legal problems that might be opened up by
such a declaration, one can look at Scotland where no single parent has
tried to introduce any complaint or criticism on the grounds of that
declaratory principle in the Bill. That is very significant. He
says:</p><ul><a name="06101746000216"></a>&#147;As regards the
risks of changing the meaning of the existing right to
education&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06101746000202"></a>which
he has gone into in some detail in his
letter&#151;<ul><a name="06101746000229"></a>&#147;the
Scottish Executive took the view that the declaratory benefits were
worth the risk of legal challenge. This is not a view that, on serious
reflection, we share&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101746000086"></a>I beg the Minister to indicate in his
reply that he and his officials will go away and think about this. I am
a very open-minded sort of chap, and if he can come back to the
House&#151;or indicate that he is prepared to do so&#151;with some
wording that gets this principle flying as a standard at the head of
all we are trying to do on education and, with the legal advice that
has so far been holding him back from endorsing our amendment,
expresses in a watertight way what we enthusiastically propose, I shall
be greatly encouraged. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101746000087"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew60"></a><a name="06101746000313"></a>Baroness

in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Sharp. The Bill gives a
clear duty to the LEA to identify those children who are not receiving
an education. That is a very important

terms of their safety and protection. Children who do not come in front
of teachers and other professionals every day may escape attention when
they show signs of abuse and mistreatment. That is what happened to
Victoria Climbi&#233;. However, the Bill misses the opportunity to
make clear who is responsible, not just for identifying these children,
but for making sure that they receive a suitable education. That is a
pity, because the Bill is an ideal vehicle for so doing.</p><p><a name="06101746000088"></a>I am a great believer in clarity in the
law and in making it easily understandable and, in particular,
accessible to the citizens of this country, not just to clever lawyers.
In Committee, and in his letter to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, the
Minister made clear that several bits of law added together do what the
noble Lord and I seek to do today. He referred to several pieces of
statute in different Acts of Parliament and a case-law judgment by the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, in which those are all listed.
Other clauses lay out the sanctions that the LEA and the courts can use
against parents who do not send their child to school or provide a
suitable education at home. I do not think that is good enough. In the
Bill, we have an ideal vehicle of statute to make the law clear, as was
done in Scotland.</p><p><a name="06101746000089"></a>We would not
need to rely on case law. People would not need to go into a lawyer's
office and have him take down several Acts of Parliament in order to
explain what the child&#146;s rights were. We would not be just
talking about sanctions against the parents, but making it clear that
it is the duty of the legal authority either to ensure that the child
has a place in a suitable school&#151;that can be very problematic
these days where children cannot even get a place in their first six

itself that the alternatives are in place for a home
education.</p><p><a name="06101746000090"></a>Frankly, I do not
mind if this involves a certain amount of repetition. British law is no
stranger to repetition. That is why some people call for a total review
of our laws, a codification and clarification. I understand that this
may take a very long time and result in a vast reduction in the size of
legal libraries, let alone legal bank balances. However, it is not a
bad idea. I do not seek to do anything so ambitious today, but I am
loath to let pass an opportunity to make the rights of children to
receive an education absolutely clear, and to make clear on whom the
duty lies to fulfil that
right.</p><p><a name="06101746000091"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Judd, mentioned the rights of children enshrined in a number of
international human rights conventions, but it is UK law that gives
effect to the rights of children enshrined in those conventions. Let us
not lose an opportunity to emphasise our commitment to children's
rights as enshrined in those conventions by not clarifying the law in
this way today.</p><p><a name="06101746000092"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew61"></a><a name="06101746000314"></a>Lord

argue the detail of the case. The noble Lord makes the extremely
important point that children should have rights and, in particular, a
right to education. I used not to believe in rights but in
responsibilities and duties. Those words are out of fashion today.
However, given that we have substituted &#147;rights&#148; for
&#147;duties&#148;, we have to give those rights to children as
well as to grown-ups. This is a particular case in point where the
opportunity arises to do that for the great benefit of the child
population. The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, is
extremely important in so far as it places squarely on the local
authority the duty to find those children who are not getting the
education they deserve and need and to give it to
them.</p><p><a name="06101746000093"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew62"></a><a name="06101746000315"></a>Baroness

my Whitehall colleagues would certainly not convict me of that offence,
although they might convict me of others. I have given a very great
deal of consideration to Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 since my noble friend
first raised them in Committee, including extensively quizzing my
department&#146;s legal advisers. I say frankly to my noble friend
that I am attracted to simplicity in the law, and to calling a spade a
spade. I was instinctively attracted to a simple clause at the outset
of the Bill which provided for a positive duty to secure the right to
education on the lines that he has set out.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_656"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 656</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101746000097"></a>However, having explored
the issue exhaustively over the summer, I am persuaded by the arguments
that we should not change the law in the way proposed by this
amendment. While at best it would not confer any new rights over and
above those which currently exist, although I accept that it would
declare them more clearly, it might&#151;for me, this is the decisive
argument&#151;have the perverse effect of requiring the state to make
available types of education which we do not favour on grounds of
equity, values or standards. I set out these points at length in a
letter to my noble friend, to which he referred. I am sorry that he did
not receive it longer before the debate, but let me summarise the
arguments.</p><p><a name="06101746000098"></a>Rights to education
are already guaranteed in England through Article 2 of the First
Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, for children by
Article 28 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and in
national law by virtue of the Human Rights Act 1998. The Act also sets
out in detail the procedure for making a claim that a right has been
infringed and the remedies available for a breach. To legislate along
the same lines in an education Bill is at best superfluous and at worst
might undermine the regime set out in the Human Rights Act
1998.</p><p><a name="06101746000099"></a>However, the more
substantial concern that I want to address to my noble friend is that
the &#147;right to education&#148; in Article 2 of Protocol 1 of
the European Convention on Human Rights, as given effect in national
law by the Human Rights Act 1998, is phrased negatively. It states
that,</p><ul><a name="06101746000231"></a>&#147;no one shall be
denied the right to education&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101746000100"></a>The fact that the right is phrased
negatively has crucially influenced the way in which the courts have
construed the right. It has been held that the negative formulation
does not require that member states establish at their expense, or
subsidise, education of a particular type or at any particular level,
but rather implies for those under the jurisdiction of a member state
the right to&#151;to cite the European Court of Human Rights in the
Belgian linguistics
case&#151;</p><ul><a name="06101746000232"></a>&#147;avail
themselves of the means of instruction existing at a given
time&#148;.</ul><a name="06101746000204"></a>Its primary
objective has therefore been held to be to guarantee a right of equal
access to the existing educational facilities.
<p><a name="06101746000101"></a>A positive right along
the lines of that envisaged by this amendment would, I am advised, be
likely to be construed differently by the courts. It might be
interpreted as imposing an obligation on local authorities to ensure
that children could receive education of a particular type or standard
which the authorities were unable to provide, or which they considered
it positively undesirable to provide. Taking, for example, the Belgian
linguistics case, the European Court of Human Rights held that the
right to education, as phrased negatively, did not give rise to a right
to be taught in the language of the child&#146;s or their
parent&#146;s choice, nor was there a right of access to a particular
school of choice. Logically, therefore, a positive right might be held
to require the state to make provision for teaching in, or schools for,
languages other than English, or in any type of faith or cultural
school&#151;an issue which of course goes to the heart of debates we
will have later, where I believe 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_657"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 657</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that my noble friend does not support an unfettered right of parents to
any type of education, regardless of its impact on social
cohesion.</p><p><a name="06101746000102"></a>In the case of
Scotland, my noble friend is right&#151;there has been no case so far
but, to some extent, that supports my argument. We simply do not know
where such a right might go if cases were brought under it requesting
types of education that the state thought undesirable.</p><p><a name="06101746000103"></a>Existing rights to education of a
character which we believe worthwhile appear to me entirely robust.
They rest on a fourfold foundation: Section 7 of the Education Act
1996, which requires parents to cause their children to receive
efficient and suitable full-time education; Section 10 of the Education
Act 1996, which imposes a duty on the Secretary of State to promote the
education of the people of England and Wales; Section 13, which
requires local authorities to secure that efficient education is
available to meet the needs of their populations; and the duty on each
school&#146;s governing body to conduct the school with a view to
securing high standards of achievement.</p><p><a name="06101746000104"></a>The effectiveness of this fourfold
foundation was set out only this year by the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Bingham, in the case of Ali v Lord Grey School. He
said:</p><ul><a name="06101746000217"></a>&#147;This fourfold
foundation has endured over a long period because it has, I think,
certain inherent strengths. First, it recognises that the party with
the keenest personal interest in securing the best available education
for a child ordinarily is, or ought to be, the parent of the child.
Depending on age, maturity and family background, the child may or may
not share that interest. But the parent has a statutory duty. Secondly,
the regime recognises that for any child attending school it is that
school through which the education provided by the state is in practice
delivered. The relationship between school and pupil is
closeand personal: hence the restrictions on its interruption
or termination. It is a relationship resembling, but for the want of
consideration, a contractual relationship. But, thirdly, the regime
recognises the need for a safety net or longstop to ensure that the
education is not neglected of those who for any reason (whether
&#145;illness, exclusion from school or otherwise&#146;) are not
being educated at school in the ordinary way. It is plainly intended
that every child of compulsory school age should receive appropriate
education in one way if not another, and that responsibility rests in
the last resort with the
LEA&#148;.</ul><a name="06101746000205"></a>Those are the
unambiguous words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, and, on
that basis, I hope I may have persuaded my noble friend that the status
quo is supportable. I will, however, continue to reflect further on his
arguments.<p><a name="06101746000105"></a>We believe that
Amendment No. 7, too, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley,
is unnecessary for two reasons. First, a duty already exists under
Section 19(1) of the Education Act 1996 for local education authorities
to,</p><ul><a name="06101746000233"></a>&#147;make arrangements
for the provision of suitable education at school or otherwise than at
school for those children of compulsory school age who, by reason of
illness, exclusion from school or otherwise, may not for any period
receive suitable education unless such arrangements are made for
them&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101746000106"></a>Secondly, Section 7 of
the 1996 Act places a duty on parents to ensure that every child
receives efficient and suitable education. Parents can choose to send
their children to school or ensure that they receive education
otherwise. A parent receives support inthe exercise of this
duty by virtue of duties placed on

promotion and provision of education, such as the safeguard in Section
19 of the 1996 Act, to which I have referred. Therefore, although we
accept that the local authority should be obliged to make arrangements
for the provision of suitable education where children of compulsory
school age would not otherwise receive it, the primary responsibility
to ensure that a child receives a suitable education rightly rests with
parents.</p><p><a name="06101746000107"></a>Clause 4 will be
supported by new statutory guidance, a draft of which is currently
available and has been published for consultation. In producing it, we
listened carefully to the important issues raised by noble Lords in
Committee. The draft guidance has been considerably strengthened in the
area of placing children identified as not receiving suitable
education. There is now clear reference to local authorities having a
statutory duty to ensure that suitable education is provided for
children who might not otherwise receive
it.</p><p><a name="06101746000108"></a>I hope that I have managed
to reassure the noble Baroness that the effect that she seeks to
achieve is fully covered by existing
legislation.</p><p><a name="06101746000109"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew65"></a><a name="06101746000318"></a>Lord
Judd:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful again to the
Minister for his considered and full reply to the points that we have
just made. I am encouraged that he is prepared to think about it more.
I am sorry that it took up so much of his Summer Recess, but I am sure
that a little more time spent on it would be well used.</p><p><a name="06101746000110"></a>I shall make just two points. First, I
remain convinced that, if we believe that every child in our society
has a right to an education, we should say so loudly and clearly. It
seems odd, to say the least, to be producing a Bill of this magnitude
that is so far-reaching without spelling out in it that we take that
right seriously and are committed to
it.</p><p><a name="06101746000111"></a>After quite a number of
years in political life, there are occasions on which I get angry when
decisions do not go the way I think they should. There are also
occasions on which I become very sad. One of the things that makes me
the most sad is when there is a lot of common ground between people
about what is attempted, and not very much is dividing them, but a
great historic opportunity clearly to spell out something that we see
as central to our society and to the values that we hold dear is
missed. That is where political management gets in the way of political
leadership. We have a task and an opportunity to spell out to the
nation in the legislation that we are approaching on its behalf the
cause which we are
espousing.</p><p><a name="06101746000112"></a>Naturally, I take
very seriously all the points that my noble friend has made. However,
my second point is to emphasise that in Clause 1(1) the local education
authority is required to do all sorts of things, but nowhere in those
injunctions is the duty to secure the right to education of every child
explicitly spelt out. The implicit arguments may be in the convention
and elsewhere, but it seems rather strange that that duty is not
explicitly included in the injunctions to the local education
authority.</p>

support and expertise of his legal advisers in finding the right way of
spelling out this strategic cornerstone rather than avoiding spelling

well. The time has come to take the opportunity of the Bill to broaden
schools&#146; focus a little. We have had several decades of focusing
ever more closely on examinations and achievement to the point where
examinations have become an end in themselves and have started to
damage the real educational progress that we hope pupils will make.
Over the past year or two, a lot of people in the educational
establishment have started to look again at the wider purposes of
school and what we hope they will do for our children. We can use the
opportunity of the Bill to signal that in a couple of small
ways.</p><p><a name="06101746000118"></a>First, Amendment No. 3
would delete the word &#147;educational&#148; where it is
essentially repetitive, because it is a subsidiary clause to a
statement that clearly focuses on education and its provision. Schools
ought to have regard to the whole potential of children&#151;not just
whether they will pass Maths and English but what sort of people they
will turn into. Whatever their potential, in whatever sphere, and
whether or not the word &#147;educational&#148; can be stretched so
elastically that it covers everything from football to character, it
would do no harm to the Bill to remove that word and to make clear that
we expect schools to focus on the child as he or she is, not on some
narrow aspect of that child. Amendment No. 5 merely repeats that
sentiment in an earlier Bill where it would find a good home.</p><p><a name="06101746000119"></a>I hope that the Government will feel, as
I do, that this is how schools should operate and that it is therefore
a change worth making. I beg to

are required to do. The importance of education in supporting the wider
outcomes of that Act is also stressed.</p><p><a name="06101746000121"></a>We want the Bill to
ensure that schools help to deliver improvement on all five well-being
outcomes for children. Local authorities have embraced the provisions
in the Children Act 2004 that create integrated children&#146;s
services and give them a duty to improve outcomes for all children.
More than 130 now have directors of children&#146;s services, and all
over the country authorities are developing children&#146;s trusts to
deliver better, more integrated services for children. The development
of those integrated services is being reflected in inspection
methodology through joint area reviews. The current schools inspection
framework, introduced last year, and the creation of the single
inspectorate in this Bill are movement in the same direction. If that
approach is to be embedded within all children&#146;s services, the
Bill needs to support the Children Act 2004 and to reflect in schools
the joined-up approach being taken at local level.</p><p><a name="06101746000122"></a>Through S.I. 2149/2005
and government guidance there is a clear onus on local authorities to
ensure that schools are consulted and have full input to developing
wellbeing outcomes locally. At present, however, that onus is only in
one direction. Given schools&#146; obvious importance in delivering
the educational fulfilment and wider elements of wellbeing for
children, the onus on governing bodies to promote wellbeing must be
strengthened to ensure coherent and effective local delivery for
children and young people. We tried to persuade the Government of that
in 2004 but did not succeed, so I am trying again today.</p><p><a name="06101746000123"></a>When amendments on <I>Every Child Matters
</I>were moved in Committee, the Government countered that the Children
Act 2004 was sufficient to ensure schools&#146; co-operation in its
delivery. I dispute that. Certainly, some schools are working well with
other partners to ensure delivery of wider wellbeing outcomes, yet
others are not and do not see matters beyond educational attainment as
related and part of their core business in children&#146;s
development. Indeed, the more independent schools become, the more
difficult it will be to keep wellbeing at the heart of all their
activity unless there is a clear duty.</p><p><a name="06101746000124"></a>The Bill should therefore complement and
provide coherence by including provisions to ensure that education
outcomes reinforce wellbeing outcomes and vice versa, for they are
inextricably linked. The amendment is well supported by many
organisations in the Every Child, Every School coalition.</p><p><a name="06101746000125"></a>In Committee, there was considerable
support for this point of view across your Lordships&#146; House. The
noble Lord, Lord Dearing,
said:</p><ul><a name="06101746000219"></a>&#147;The purpose of
our amendment is formally to underlinethat the <I>Every Child
Matters</I> agenda, as set out in the Children Act 2004, is directly
relevant to the educational attainment of every child, and that the
educational purposes of the Bill will not be fully achieved unless the

support all the amendments in the group. This raises a fundamental
question about what education is for and is about. The insertion of the
word &#147;educational&#148;, which the noble Lord, Lord Lucas,

education. Do we believe that? I think that most noble Lords would
agree that education is about much more than that. It is a crucial

achieve what we want, but I would not want to miss an opportunity. This
is a very important debate, which is a tribute to the
Government&#146;s achievements in <I>Every Child Matters </I>and the
five outcomes. The delivery of the five outcomes into legislation was a
key moment in moving towards an integrated service for children in
workforce reform. In acknowledging that in serving children well and in
bringing them up and preparing them for life, everything is important,
but by themselves they are not sufficiently important and have to be
integrated.</p><p><a name="06101746000129"></a>These old debates
about our schools, education and caring, and whether we should find
time to look for the personal development of children or whether
education is always about passing exams were, to some extent, put to
one side. The <I>Every Child Matters</I> outcomes were a very proper
acknowledgement that what we want for children is the development of
all their abilities&#151;certainly academic but others as well. We
want an integrated service in which to deliver that. That does not take
away from the very special talents that teachers have and from the very
particular purpose of schools but, as I have travelled around the
country, I have seen education delivered best when it has been
integrated with other children&#146;s

only reason for pushing consideration of this being included in primary
legislation is that, since leaving the Department for Education and
Skills and going back into the real world, even four years later I
sometimes visit schools which are only just beginning to implement
things that were passed in my time in the 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_662"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 662</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>DfES. In politics we sometimes underestimate the difficulty of
implementation. We should seize as many opportunities as we can to send
a clear signal about what we want to achieve. I suspect that this
amendment is something no one disagrees with. I bet that no one is
going to stand up and say, &#147;It would be a really bad idea to ask
parts of the education system to secure the well-being of
children&#148;. Does anyone want to argue against securing the
well-being of children? So the debate becomes whether we are adding
anything here, and whether we are making it any easier to achieve these
objectives by putting them into primary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06101746000131"></a>My first reason for
supporting this proposal is that the crusade or huge cultural change
involved in persuading professionals&#151;teachers and those looking
after children who are not teachers&#151;to think differently needs
every encouragement and tool we can possibly harness and give it. We
should not miss any opportunity to make that happen. Thinking back to
when I was at the department, at certain times I saw words going into
legislation and, to be honest, I thought, &#147;I am not sure that
putting that word into legislation is going to achieve much&#148;.
But what I saw over the years was that it kept the agenda on that word
and sent a clear signal to the education world that change was
needed.</p><p><a name="06101746000132"></a>I
shall give a few examples which I know my noble friend on the Front
Bench will agree with. Way back in the late 1990s we put into primary
legislation the provision that schools and local authorities have a
duty to secure high standards. If ever there was no need to put
something into legislation, it was a reminder to teachers that they are
about achieving high standards. It was almost an insult, but it was
necessary and it has worked. Over the months and years it has allowed
people constantly to go back to the legislation and say, &#147;Look,
this is what you are about. This is about high standards&#148;. In
truth, the notion of high standards has now become part of the
vocabulary of what schools do. I could make a powerful case for words
that we put into legislation, such as the need for local authorities to
promote choice and encourage diversity. In themselves the words do not
mean a lot, but they provide the background to a set of priorities
towards which we want things to
move.</p><p><a name="06101746000133"></a>I wonder if this amendment
would achieve that. It would help those of us out in the field who are
trying to enact the five outcomes necessary to an integrated delivery,
getting professionals to cherish their own skills while acknowledging
that others can contribute to the job they are doing on behalf of
children. To me, this amendment has that sense of those primary
legislation clauses which said, &#147;You are about standards; you
are promoting choice; you are promoting diversity&#148;. I think it
might help those who are trying to take <I>Every Child Matters</I>, a
very important and fantastic agenda, into the field. For those reasons,
I ask my noble friend to consider it. To tell the truth, it is a good
trick to mirror something in the Children Act 2004 because it sends the
same message to different groups of professionals&#151;and we are
trying to encourage them to work together. I look forward to hearing my
noble friend&#146;s comments, but from my reading at the moment, this
might just be something that will help us in the years to
come.</p>

being with many forms of potential, and I certainly support all that
leads to the enhancement of that. However, I would regret dropping
&#147;educational&#148; in Clause 1, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas,
suggests, for two reasons. The first is that I have a very high view of
education and I believe that education properly carried out extends
well beyond what we call, I think mistakenly, the &#147;merely
academic&#148;. The second reason I would regret dropping
&#147;educational&#148; to qualify potential here is that I can
recall the case of a schoolboy who, to all intents and purposes,
certainly fulfilled the potential that his fellow schoolboys saw in him
to the extent of being subject to the detailed attentions of the fraud
squad and a period in Barlinnie prison following that. We need to
qualify &#147;potential&#148;, and I cannot think of a better word
than
&#147;educational&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101746000135"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew71"></a><a name="06101746000324"></a>Lord
Dearing:</b> My Lords, I shall speak briefly in
support of the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland. Schools exist primarily to
educate and I would regret dropping the word, but I do not believe that
education can be effective outside the context of the whole well-being
of the child. I recall the head of an inner-London primary school whose
first concern was to see whether the children had had any breakfast and
whether they had got dry feet before they started school. She knew that
they would attend the lessons better if they had physical comfort.
Their whole well-being was directly
relevant.</p><h5><a name="06101746000246"></a>4

say as well what I said last time&#151;or what the noble Baroness,
Lady Walmsley, said I said last time&#151;but I would make a
supplementary point. I said on the previous occasion that a busy head
gets this further dollop of legislation on his desk&#151;I have
forgotten how many hundreds of pages of guidance there are&#151;and
what happens? The emphasis goes. Let me give an illustration of that
happening in a related field. The Government had had a strong
commitment to providing 14 year-olds with work experience and then the
Chancellor&#151;I believe it was he&#151;saw the importance of
enterprise education, and I saw the shift of funding from one foot to
the other. It was not that work experience was not important, but the
emphasis which had just come into focus was enterprise education and
the funding for work experience was reduced. I fear that the horsepower
for caring about well-being in the interests of education will be
diminished unless we enforce it. I support the amendments of the noble
Baroness, Lady
Walmsley.</p><p><a name="06101746000137"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew72"></a><a name="06101746000325"></a>Lord

the principle that every child deserves a good education regardless of
their background or circumstances. They require local authorities to do
everything they reasonably can to promote the fulfilment by every child
in their locality of their educational potential, alongside their
existing duty to promote high standards and the new duty to ensure fair
access to educational opportunity.</p>

authority&#146;s educational functions, which is why it is framed in
terms of educational fulfilment. In respect of wider <I>Every Child
Matters</I> objectives&#151;which of course are vital to outcomes for
children, as every speaker in the debate has emphasised&#151;Section
10 of the Children Act 2004 already places a powerful duty on local
authorities to promote co-operation to improve children&#146;s
well-being, defined within the <I>Every Child Matters</I>terms
as physical and mental health and emotional well-being; protection from
harm and neglect; education, training and recreation; the contribution
made by them to society; and social and economic
well-being.</p><p><a name="06101746000139"></a>The Bill needs,
therefore, to be seen as complementary to existing legislation on
children&#146;s outcomes and services. Indeed, the reason we need
these legal changes in the first place is, following precisely the line
of argument set out by my noble friend Lady Morris, because we wish to
strengthen existing education legislation to bring it in
linewith the principle underlining the <I>Every Child
Matters</I> agenda&#151;that every child, regardless of their
background, should have the education they need to enable them to
fulfil their potential.</p><p><a name="06101746000140"></a>The Bill deliberately
recasts existing formulations which focus simply on the standards of
education and the provision of sufficient schools&#151;a formulation
which goes back to 1944&#151;with the far more demanding duties of
Clauses 1 to 4 to promote high standards, fair access, choice and
diversity, and to consider parental representations. In effect, the
Bill does for educationin terms of its declaratory value what
the ChildrenAct 2004 does in respect of children&#146;s
services and the wider <I>Every Child Matters</I>
agenda.</p><p><a name="06101746000141"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Lucas, seeks to reinforce these duties by adding a further duty to
promote the fulfilment of every child&#146;s potential and to remove
&#147;educational&#148; in respect of potential. Like the noble
Lords, Lord Sutherland and Lord Dearing, we think it right that
educational potential is spelt out as such in the Bill. We therefore do
not support Amendments Nos. 3 and
5.</p><p><a name="06101746000142"></a>As to the amendments of the
noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley&#151;Amendments Nos. 55, 56, 84 and
85&#151;we entirely share her aims but we believe that it is neither
necessary nor appropriate to introduce them in the Bill. It is not
appropriate because it duplicates the existing Children Act 2004. It is
not necessary because improving educational achievement is a key
priority at the very heart of, rather than separate from, well-being,
as my noble friend Lady Morris so rightly said. For schools to achieve
high standards for all, they need to improve well-being and to remove
barriers to achievement at every level. Similarly, the contribution of
educational attainment to wider well-being is self-evident. We also
have evidence from Ofsted, based on judgments made using the new
inspection framework, which demonstrates a clear correlation between
the <I>Every Child Matters</I> outcomes and pupils&#146; achievement
and concludes that most schools make a valuable contribution to the
health and well-being of pupils.</p>

Government pledged to
give,</p><ul><a name="06101746000235"></a>&#147;governing
bodies and head teachers of all secondary schools and many primary

have arrived at those same conclusions&#151;the right conclusions for
our children&#146;s education. Those are the substantive points, and
none is more important than that vital ingredient: school autonomy.
Autonomy and freedom from the control of local authorities enables
schools to provide for and adapt to the local community. Yet I read
this morning that the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee has
found that nearly 1 million children are being taught in poorly
performing schools. It was interesting to hear the noble Baroness, Lady
Morris of Yardley, say that a declaratory statement on high standards
in schools can make a difference, but where is the difference when
nearly 1 million children are being taught in such schools? That is
unacceptable.</p><p><a name="06101746000154"></a>The first priority
of Government should be to tackle that situation. We now offer them an
opportunity to commit to their original vision of a system in which
schools are given the autonomy from local government that they need to
succeed. How many more children can the system afford to fail? I take
the liberty of reminding the Minister of the White Paper statement
that:</p><ul><a name="06101746000223"></a>&#147;The best local
authorities recognise that providers need autonomy if they are to be
able to innovate and develop, and that their role is to provide robust
challenge when standards are not high
enough&#148;.</ul><a name="06101746000210"></a>It goes on to
say that local authorities
will,<ul><a name="06101746000237"></a>&#147;support new
schools and new provision where there is real demand or where existing
provision is
poor&#148;.</ul><a name="06101746000211"></a>What is more,
it repeats:<ul><a name="06101746000224"></a>&#147;This is a
very different role from acting as a direct provider of school
places&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101746000155"></a>I stress that
this amendment will not preclude the establishment of community
schools. A Government run from these Benches may have tackled that
differently in the Bill. Indeed, it was the original intention of Her
Majesty&#146;s Government to stem the creation of new community
schools. Paragraph 9.11 of Chapter 9 in the White Paper clearly states
that local authorities will have
to,</p><ul><a name="06101746000238"></a>&#147;make their own
proposal for a self-governing (Foundation) school, if they cannot find
a suitable promoter, in keeping with the commissioner role no more
community schools (primary or secondary) will be
established&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101746000156"></a>In
rereading the Minister&#146;s responses to my amendments in
Committee, including those that would have prevented the establishment
of new community schools, I was able to confirm that, regrettably, the
positive, constructive heart of policy in the White Paper has been
abandoned. It seems that the price of school freedom becomes ever
lower. My amendment seeks to stem the erosion of school freedom as it
is viewed by central Government. It would enhance, not denigrate, the
role of local authorities. We should remember what the Prime Minister
said almost a year ago, on 24 October
2005:</p><ul><a name="06101746000225"></a>&#147;We need to see
every local authority moving from provider to commissioner so that the
system acquires a local dynamism responsive to the needs of their
communities and open to change and new forms of school provision. This
will liberate local authorities from too often feeling the need to
defend the status quo so that instead they become the champions of
innovation and diversity and the partner of local parents in driving
continuous improvements&#148;.</ul>

Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to
Amendments Nos. 12, to 15, in my name and that of my noble friend Lady
Walmsley. This series of amendments is almost, but not quite, on the
opposite track to that proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe.
The Government propose that, other things being equal, all new schools
should be foundation schools. The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe,
suggests not only that all new schools should be foundation schools but
that there should be positive encouragement for all existing schools to
become foundation
schools.</p><p><a name="06101746000159"></a>We
argue somewhat differently. Our amendments propose that, in the
competition for new schools, there should be even terms between
foundation schools and community schools. What is the difference
between foundation schools and community schools? Both are financed via
the dedicated schools budget, which comes through the local education
authority and is paid for partly by government grants and partly by
local taxes. But the foundation school owns its own buildings, has
control over its own budget and runs its own affairs. It is, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said, an independent state school. The
community school, via local management of schools, manages around 93
per cent of its budget, but the local education authority owns its
buildings, employs its staff and appoints its governors, who are
responsible for its overall running.
</p><p><a name="06101746000160"></a>The key issue is the link to
the local education authority and how far the school can act wholly
independently of that authority. As the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe,
stressed, the notion of foundation schools, deriving from the
Conservative proposals for grant maintained schools, is that state
schools should be independent of local education authorities. We
believe that the link with local education authorities is beneficial,
because we see education provision as a system whose
parts&#151;nursery schools, Sure Start centres, schools and
colleges&#151;are interdependent at community level and need some
overarching control system at that level: the local education
authority. Schools and colleges are there to serve the local education
authority. The community helps to pay for them, so it is right that the
community should have some say in how they are run and that there
should be some accountability, through the governance process, to the
community.</p>

derived from grant-maintained schools, but the idea goes back
considerably further, because the concept of the grant-maintained
school was derived from voluntary-aided and voluntary-controlled
schools, which are the church schools. That was part of the deal done
with the churches at the end of the 19th century and, particularly, as
enshrined in the Education Act 1944. While the state would meet all the
current expense of such schools, the church would maintain the capital
fabric of the school and appoint the governors. That model of the
voluntary-aided school was copied in the 1980s, when the Conservatives
introduced the grant-maintained system. The only difference with
foundation schools, which were introduced in 1998 under the School
Standards and Framework Act, is that the old grant-maintained schools
became foundation schools and were financed through the LEA budget
rather than directly by the department for education, as
grant-maintained schools had
been.</p><p><a name="06101746000162"></a>I stress
that Amendments Nos. 12 to 15 do not seek to undo this process in any
sense. We accept that church schools and foundation schools exist in
the system and that they have been&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady
Buscombe, and the Minister both stressed in their arguments in
Committee&#151;a popular and successful model of governance albeit,
as the Sutton Trust research highlighted, one serving a
disproportionately middle class constituency. We are also happy to see
this model extended to more schools, new and old, where that is the
wish of the local community.</p><p><a name="06101746000163"></a>That is the key issue in this group of
amendments. Amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 14 seek to allow local education
authorities to propose the establishment of a new community school
alongside other proposals that may go forward for foundation schools or
for other, what I would call, &#147;company schools&#148; run by
companies such as Edison as foundations in competition with new
schools. That is essentially what my noble friend Lady Williams, in
moving the amendments in Committee, called establishing a level playing
field between the foundation proposals and the community
proposals.</p><p><a name="06101746000164"></a>In
Committee, we had a protracted discussion on these issues, with
extensive consideration of international comparisons and the virtues or
otherwise of comprehensive education. As the noble Baroness will
probably remember, the debate ran late into the night. I do not wish to
consider all those issues again, and the set of amendments that we have
tabled today is slimline. It concentrates only on when a local
education authority may propose a community school, to be considered
alongside other proposals.</p><p><a name="06101746000165"></a>The
Government rightly state that the Bill allows local education
authorities to propose a community school; but, whereas other
providers, more or less irrespective of their track record, may propose
these schools&#151;it should be remembered that the proposals are in
competition with each other, and the providers will then be judged on
their track record&#151;LEAs are not allowed to enter that
competition unconditionally unless they have been awarded the top
performance assessment rating of &#147;4&#148;. Only 11 out of some
145 local authorities have achieved that top assessment

further criteria and obtain the Secretary of State&#146;s permission
to put forward proposals.</p><p><a name="06101746000166"></a>We
have tabled Amendment No. 15, because even when an authority meets the
criteria and is within the top Ofsted category, it still needs
permission from the Secretary of State to publish its proposals. Our
amendment states that when a majority of parents have indicated in a
ballot that they wish to have the chance to consider local authority
proposals, those proposals shall be published alongside the
others.</p><p><a name="06101746000167"></a>In his concluding
remarks in Committee, the Minister emphasised that the Government
had,</p><ul><a name="06101746000239"></a>&#147;struck a
sensible balance ... between allowing local authorities that have
a good track record and can show that they support the principle of
diversity to be able, in appropriate circumstances, to promote
community schools while ensuring that there are strong incentives for
diversity, especially in areas where local authorities are lower
performers&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/7/06; col.
818.]</ul><a name="06101746000213"></a>We maintain that
there is not a fair balance. There are constraints limiting the scope
of local authorities to publish their proposals and put them alongside
others. First, such constraints on their rights to publication run
counter to the principles of local choice and local accountability. As
democratically accountable institutions, councils need flexibility to
respond to local needs and circumstances. They should be required to
present a full range of options for new schools in their communities.
If local people want a new school and the locality needs one, a
community school should be among the
choices.<p><a name="06101746000168"></a>Secondly, the current
proposals contradict the Government&#146;s wider devolution agenda.
The Lyons local government review&#146;s interim report highlights
the need for local government to be less constrained, more accountable
locally and more innovative. The principle of earned autonomy which
supersedes local people&#146;s wishes and accountability can impact
across a large range of local authority commissioning and delivery
functions. It is at odds with the Government&#146;s commitment to
devolve power to local
communities.</p><p><a name="06101746000169"></a>Lastly, the
Government&#146;s proposals run against the principles of the Bill
itself, which sets out a new strategic role for local authorities in
education and seeks to promote choice and diversity and to champion
pupils and parents. By allowing only certain councils the freedom to
propose new community schools, the Government are suggesting that only
certain councils can undertake the full strategic role that all
councils have a duty to
deliver.</p><p><a name="06101746000170"></a>As I indicated in my
opening remarks, schools are provided and run for the benefit of the
local community. A good part of the council tax that we pay goes
towards the provision of that education. We elect our local councils to
oversee these activities and decide what best suits local people. They
are democratically accountable and should have some say in what sort of
schools best meet local needs.</p><p><a name="06101746000171"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew78"></a><a name="06101746000331"></a>Baroness
Carnegy of Lour:</b> My Lords, I have not entered
into any of the debates so far on the Bill because I live north of the
Border and my own experience, which is out of date but fairly copious
on the subject of state education in schools, has not seemed relevant. 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_670"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 670</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>But there are issues&#151;this is one and there will be another later
today in which I hope to take part&#151;which transcend our borders
in the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06101746000172"></a>It
seems to me that the Government and the leadership of my own party are
now asking themselves whether much more autonomy of professionals in
schools will bear great fruit. They are asking themselves whether
teachers and others in schools can stand a lot more trust from the
public in what they do, more freedom and more responsibility. The
Scottish Executive have concluded that they cannot stand those things,
and that conclusion has been endorsed by the teachers&#146; unions.
Of course, the Scottish Executive partly consist of the Liberal
Democrat Party.</p><p><a name="06101746000173"></a>Looking at what
is happening in schools in England, it seems to me that the Government
are certainly right. It is very exciting what more freedom can do to
help professionals to provide better schools. It is not at all exciting
to see what lack of freedom is doing to the Scottish education system,
whose outcome is less good than before, going by most of the measures
applied. I do not want to run down my own country: I am a great
believer in Scottish education and I am sure that it will
recover.</p><p><a name="06101746000174"></a>The question raised by
my noble friend in the amendment is simply: should they be asked to
continue to govern in future years, will the Government be prepared to
increase the autonomy of schools and to have more foundation schools?
If they are not, I think that she may be suggesting that our own party
would be interested in exploring that. I shall be very interested to
hear the Minister&#146;s
reply.</p><p><a name="06101746000175"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew79"></a><a name="06101746000332"></a>Lord
Sutherland of Houndwood:</b> My Lords, tempted as I
am to speak about Scottish education, I shall resist. I support
Amendment No. 4 and have three points to
make.</p><p><a name="06101746000176"></a>First, there is good
empirical evidence of the contribution that schools which have been
given additional powers of self-determination have made to some of the
most difficult areas, including in this city, of which Peckham is an
example. Such schools have made real contributions to education in that
area, and that is but one
example.</p><p><a name="06101746000177"></a>Secondly,
the amendment would give the local authority a responsibility to work
towards what is clearly an intended outcome of the Bill&#151;that is,
to increase the amount of autonomy and self-determination in schools.
It is important that local authorities take that on board as a
responsibility which they willingly share. If they do not, there will
be a risk of friction and envy between such schools and other
schools&#151;perceived sometimes rather than
real.</p><p><a name="06101746000178"></a>Thirdly,
there is no doubt that there will be a period of transition in which a
number of schools will seek such additional self-determination. In that
process, it is important that there is a common view about the
responsibilities of local authorities so that we do not have one local
authority encouraging it and another dragging its feet. There should be
equal opportunity throughout the system, and the amendment has the
value of indicating what that responsibility would
be.</p>

Morris of Yardley:</b> My Lords, I speak against
Amendment No. 4. The picture of the English education system described
by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, is not one that I recognise as of
the real world. I would have preferred her to start this interesting
debate with a recognition that every single indicator of improvement in
standards, in quality of teaching, in management, in leadership and
certainly in investment by the Government, shows things are far better
now than they were a decade
ago.</p><p><a name="06101746000180"></a>The argument
about foundation schools and community schools has run throughout the
passage of the Bill. I want to make what I hope is a relevant comment
to what I believe is an irrelevant debate. An error in all these
discussions is to believe that there is greater autonomy for a
foundation school than for a community school. If I really believed
that having foundation status gives schools more powers, more freedoms
and greater autonomy, I would support the amendment. I oppose the
amendment because I do not believe that foundation schools have greater
autonomy or more independence than community schools.</p><p><a name="06101746000181"></a>That is because I believe that the
Government have worked exceptionally hard over the past 10 years to try
to make the education system, the schools system, structurally more
equal and to give it greater equality. Having listened to the Minister
and many people over the past months, I am yet to be persuaded of one
meaningful, extra freedom, one grain of greater autonomy that one has
with foundation schools that one does not have with community schools
which would persuade me that standards would increase as a result. If I
could be persuaded of that, even at this late date, I would support the
amendment with great voice and great
enthusiasm.</p><p><a name="06101746000182"></a>However, one can see
no evidence that foundation schools now perform better than community
schools. I pay tribute to the many wonderful foundation schools that
exist in the inner cities which have turned schools around&#151;there
is one in Peckham to which I pay huge tribute&#151;but I need to hear
some generosity of spirit that pays equal credit to the wonderful
performance of many community schools&#151;many serving most schools
in the inner-cities&#151;that have really raised
standards.</p><p><a name="06101746000183"></a>On this debate, the
irony is that the only people with whom I have discussed community
schools and foundation schools are politicians. In the past five years,
I have not met one head teacher, when visiting a school or at a
conference, who has asked, &#147;Why don&#146;t you make it easier
for us to be a foundation school?&#148;. Quite simply, it is so easy
now to be a foundation school&#151;far easier than becoming a
grant-maintained school in the days of the Conservative
Government&#151;that if our good head teachers really thought that it
would make a difference, they would do it. They have asked me for lots
of other things, but not one single head teacher has said, &#147;If
only you made it easier for us to be a foundation school, with all
those extra freedoms that would go with it, I know that I could deliver
better outcomes for the children&#148;.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_672"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 672</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101746000184"></a>Given
that that is the picture, why would we want to put an extra
responsibility on a local authority to promote more of them? They have
better things to do than to promote something that is readily available
if a school wishes to take it. The noble Baroness talked about trusting
heads, trusting schools and trusting governing bodies. We should trust
them and if they want to become foundation schools they can; they do
not need a local authority encouraging and persuading them to do
that.</p><p><a name="06101746000185"></a>I am persuaded on two
points. I could interpret the notion of foundation in a slightly
different way and that would be a partnership in school improvement, an
external partner to provide support in raising standards. I am all for
that, but equally I know many community schools with the strength of
such an external partner, so I have come to the conclusion that I
really do not mind whether a school is a foundation school or a
community school. I do not mind one bit. I am happy to leave it to the
school because I believe we have a level playing field. To be honest, I
mind us all spending a lot of time debating the matter when the world
of education is not in any way putting an obligation on local
authorities to pursue these structural
changes.</p><p><a name="06101746000186"></a>The
real challenge for us is that schools and heads want greater autonomy
and ask for greater freedom. They tell me that if they had greater
freedom, they could do better for their children. But the freedoms they
ask are freedoms in the national curriculum, often freedom from the
accountability framework, sometimes freedom from the publication of
their results in the local press and the ability of the neighbouring
school to seduce the most able children to go to it. The difficulty is
that those are the freedoms we do not want to give, and a debate on
that will come later on Report. I am not against freedoms, but there is
nothing in foundation status that will give our heads more freedom to
do their job more effectively. If there were, they would take it
because it is there for the taking. Let us not place this additional
burden on local authorities by making them pursue something that will
do little for the children they are meant to be
serving.</p><p><a name="06101746000187"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew81"></a><a name="06101746000334"></a>Lord
Lucas:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness answered
herself in her previous contribution when she successfully outlined the
importance of having icons, totems and loadstones in legislation to set
out in a declaratory way the direction in which we think we are moving.
My noble friend&#146;s amendment makes two important points in that
regard. First, it is important that a school thinks that it is a
foundation school because that is an attitude of mind and sets the
direction that the school takes. I think that it is a thoroughly
constructive direction, as the Government do, as they are promoting it.
It is the way to go, and even if the physical powers are not much
different, the mental attitude is. Secondly, it sets out the mental
attitude that we expect of local authorities. Those of us who were
around at the time&#151;which I suspect is most of us&#151;will
remember how difficult local authorities made themselves at the time of
grant-maintained schools. Many still seem to be wedded to the idea that
schools must be theirs and they must control them, rather than that
they belong to parents and the community.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_673"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 673</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101746000188"></a>Across this House, we have taken a step
away from that. We have said that local authorities are as friends of
the parents and helpers of the schools, but not their owners. We are
going to get away from the difficulties that came from ownership, such
as local authorities just accepting their schools&#146; faults, not
doing anything about them and expecting parents to live with them; that
they were part of the community and satisfactory because they were the
local authorities. I can remember going around schools in Manchester a
long time ago. When a teacher was so bad that he was eventually removed
from a school, the local authority transferred him to another of its
schools because it thought that it owed a duty to its teachers first
and above any other duty. We have moved a long way from that, and we
are now in a very satisfactory position. The Government&#146;s vision
of the function of local education authorities is one with which I
thoroughly agree. To put a declaratory framework in the Bill so that
local education authorities know what they are about and where we are
expecting them to head has great value. I have been persuaded of that
by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley,
herself.</p><p><a name="06101746000189"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew82"></a><a name="06101746000335"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, the House is grateful to the
noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Buscombe, for coming back to us
with their slimline amendments. We remember the non-slimline versions,
which occupied us for many hours. I am glad that we have now managed to
focus the debate on two specific issues: that of promoting community
schools and whether there should be local authority balance in respect
of them; and the duty to promote non-community schools.</p><p><a name="06101746000190"></a>The amendments in this group tabled by
the noble Baronesses have opposing intents. The noble Baroness, Lady
Buscombe, wants us to encourage all schools to become trust, foundation
or voluntary schools, while the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, wants there
to be more community schools and wishes to amend Clause 7 so that local
authorities may promote new community schools in all circumstances. I
hope that I may come across as the voice of sweet reason because we
want to come through the middle between these two extreme positions and
stick with what the Bill proposes&#151;namely, that schools and local
authorities should consider the case for trust or foundation status on
its merit. We believe those merits are substantial.</p><p><a name="06101746000191"></a>I strongly underline what was said by the
noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, who spoke with all the authority of a
former chief inspector of schools, particularly in highlighting the
contribution which greater autonomy can make to schools operating in
more challenging circumstances. The evidence I have strongly supports
the points he made in respect of academies where results are rising
significantly faster than the national average, both at key stage 3 and
GCSE. Furthermore, looking at the relative performance in schools in
the most challenging communities, foundation schools, voluntary-aided
schools and community schools, there is a differential level of
performance in favour of foundation and voluntary-aided
schools.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_674"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 674</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101746000192"></a>Among schools where more than 21 per cent
of pupils were eligible for free school meals last year, the proportion
getting five or more GCSEs in voluntary-aided schools was 48 per cent
and in foundation schools 47 per cent, against 40 per cent in community
schools.</p><p><a name="06101746000193"></a>I join my noble friend
Lady Morris in paying tribute to the work of all schools. I visit
schools constantly, as she does. I make no differentiation in the
comments and the praise I give to schools whatever their category. We
should support them all and they all go about their job in a highly
professional way. But I believe that the evidence is clear that, all
other things being equal, greater autonomy helps promote higher
standards. Many schools are keen to explore opportunities for trust
status and academy status, and since we simplified the arrangements
more schools are opting for foundation status. That also supports this
point of view. We believe that this decision should be taken by
existing schools. Therefore, we do not favour Amendment No. 4, which
provides this new duty.</p><p><a name="06101746000194"></a>Local
authorities more directly control community schools. Therefore, it is
perfectly reasonable that they should have to demonstrate a good track
record before setting up new community
schools.</p><p><a name="06101746000195"></a>It is now a truism that
schools run best when they run themselves. But that is true. We seek to
build on successful experience. Local authorities without track records
which lead one to believe that they can take on these new
responsibilities successfully, should establish schools on the
foundation, trust or voluntary-aided
models.</p><p><a name="06101746000196"></a>The House knows that we
have made concessions on new community schools, as set out in Clauses 7
and 8. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked whether schools in the
highest performing category may automatically publish proposals for a
community school in a competition. I can state clearly that they can do
so automatically. They do not require the permission of the Secretary
of State. We believe that we have gone as far as is consistent with the
need for better schools in areas where they simply are not good enough.
I am not prepared to stand here and defend failure, blighting the life
chances of children. Therefore, I do not accept that a local authority
should have an unfettered right, however bad its track record, to
promote schools which it more directly manages. A local authority with
a poor track record should commission those with better prospects of
success&#151;be they a parents group or an education
foundation&#151;to take on the task by means of a trust or a
voluntary-aided school or an
academy.</p><p><a name="06101746000197"></a>Amendment
No. 15, spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, would allow local
authorities to publish proposals for schools outside a competition
without the need for the Secretary of State&#146;s approval where a
ballot of parents had supported it. We support the role of parents. The
Bill makes specific provision to strengthen their role by giving them
more choice and more say in the education of their children. Our
position on parental ballots has not changed since these matters were
raised in Committee and in another place, and we do not support this
amendment. This 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_675"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 675</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>particular ballot proposal is especially unsatisfactory in our view. In
effect, the amendment provides that local parents should be able to
vote to have no choice before they even know what the choice is. It is
hard to see how that could benefit parents or the local
community.</p><p><a name="06101746000198"></a>The
Bill already places new duties on local authorities to promote
diversity and choice and to respond to specific representations from
parents. Clause 10 requires consultation with appropriate parties
before any proposals are brought forward and guidelines will make clear
that that includes parents. If consultation with parents favours a
particular type of school, that will certainly add weight to that
proposal when the local authority or the adjudicator comes to take its
decision in the usual way.</p><p><a name="06101746000199"></a>We
accept that in certain circumstances, such as the amalgamation of
junior and infant schools, competition in the provision of a new school
may not be in the best interests of the local community. Where that is
the case, the current mechanisms set out in Clause 10 are in place to
provide for proposals to come forward without a competition, but we see
no reason to amend the provision further. Therefore, we oppose all the
amendments.</p><h5><a name="06101750000136"></a>4.45

will support new schools and new provision where there is a real demand
or where existing provision is poor. This is a very different role from
acting as a direct provider of school places. We recognise that in many
ways it is more challenging. But it also offers the scope to ensure
that communities receive the education they deserve and aspire
to&#148;.</ul>

bureaucratic constraints on our teachers because the wrong, ill fitting

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_679"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 679</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101750000014"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall
also speak to Amendments Nos. 70 and 80.</p><p><a name="06101750000015"></a>Amendment No. 6 raises the issue of
schools, local education authorities and community cohesion. We spent a
long time in Committee discussing these issues, in a debate that ranged
widely over parental choice and the concept of community
schools&#151;both in the sense that we have just discussed in
Amendment No. 4, and in that a school provides a location for many
community services. There may be, on the same site, not just a
secondary school but a pre-school, children&#146;s clinics, extended
after-school activities, adult education and even, sometimes, old
people&#146;s day centres.</p><p><a name="06101750000016"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, questioned
whether the amendment that we have brought back as Amendment No. 6 is
in the right place, as Section 14 of the 1996 Act is about establishing
new schools. I will return to that in a moment. However, much of this
Bill is also about establishing new foundation schools, and it is
perfectly viable that we should do so. The noble Lords, Lord Gould and
Lord Skidelsky, questioned whether the term community, in its
old-fashioned, geographical sense, had any meaning these days, but many
others argued that, in some areas of the country at least, community
and a sense of belonging are important.</p><p><a name="06101750000017"></a>I do not propose to repeat the debate. We
can justify using the term &#147;community cohesion&#148;, which is
used in Clause 33(6), which provides that the board of governors of
foundation and community
schools,</p><ul><a name="06101750000119"></a>&#147;shall, in
carrying out its functions in relation to the school, promote community
cohesion&#148;.</ul><a name="06101750000086"></a>In his
winding up speech, the Minister drew attention to the draft regulations
and statutory instruments on competitions to replace failing schools
with foundation schools. They require those proposing new schools to
provide, <ul><a name="06101750000120"></a>&#147;a
description of what the proposals are intended to deliver in terms of
community
cohesion&#148;,</ul><a name="06101750000087"></a>and,<ul><a name="06101750000121"></a>&#147;the
objectives which the promoters intend to set to further the aims of
inclusiveness and partnership
working&#148;.</ul><ul><a name="06101750000122"></a>The
Minister said that also to be taken into account should be,
first,</ul><ul><a name="06101750000123"></a>&#147;the extent
to which, and how satisfactorily in the circumstances of the community,
the proposals [for new schools] address the need to promote community
cohesion&#148;,</ul><a name="06101750000088"></a>and,
secondly,<ul><a name="06101750000124"></a>&#147;the
extent to which the proposals take account of the needs of families and
the wider community&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/7/06;
col. 310.]</ul><p><a name="06101750000018"></a>I make no
apologies for bringing back the issue of community cohesion. In
Amendments Nos. 6 and 70, we are arguing that this
obligation&#151;which is in the Bill in relation to foundations for
trust schools and in the regulations in relation to local authorities
and the adjudicator taking decisions on school closures and
competitions&#151;should be in the Bill explicitly for local
education authorities. If Section 14 of the Education Act 1996 is about
establishing new schools, and local education authorities are being
asked to think about diversity and parent choice, they should be
thinking also about community cohesion.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_680"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 680</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101750000019"></a>Why do we put such emphasis on community
cohesion? I can do no better than quote the noble Lord, Lord Dearing,
in Committee:</p><ul><a name="06101750000107"></a>&#147;We must
have some regard to a school within a community framework, particularly
where the community is socially and economically disadvantaged. As
schools increasingly become places for the extended school
day&#151;where there are recreational facilities for the community,
increased participation and a focus for lifelong learning&#151;I see
them becoming valued and important centres of community life. That is
especially true in poorer communities, where people do not go outside
their community much&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/7/06;
col. 298.]</ul><a name="06101750000089"></a>He described some
communities as &#147;housing deserts&#148;. We know very well that
these days pubs, post offices and shops are closing on housing estates.
They are becoming housing deserts. If we close schools as well, there
is no locus for that community to cohere around, which is why we are
anxious to see community cohesion in the
Bill.<p><a name="06101750000020"></a>It is also significant
that the Minister argued that the early part of the Bill
places,</p><ul><a name="06101750000125"></a>&#147;new duties on
local authorities to ensure fair access to educational opportunity and
to promote the fulfilment of every child&#146;s potential in addition
to the existing duty to promote high standards. We want to ensure that
... every child achieves their full potential, and nothing we can
do will help schools better to promote social and community cohesion in
their work than by succeeding in eliminating education inequalities
based on class and background. We believe that we achieve that purpose
in the Bill.&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/5/06; col.
310.]</ul><a name="06101750000090"></a>But whereas the
Childcare Act has written into it the aim of reducing educational
inequalities, that is not so in this Bill.
<p><a name="06101750000021"></a>We may bring back at Third Reading an
alternative amendment because the Bill does not place a specific duty
on local authorities to improve wellbeing and reduce inequalities. If
it did, we might not have tabled this amendment, but it does not and we
therefore propose that a duty to promote social inclusion and community
cohesion should be written into the Bill, at this point for local
authorities and in Clause 40 for admission
forums.</p><p><a name="06101750000022"></a>Amendment No. 70 deals
with the same issue as it relates to admission forums. Just as we think
it important that local authorities should take an overall view of the
promotion of social inclusion within their areas, so it is even more
important that admission forums&#151;in a sense the specialised
agencies within local education authorities now dealing with
admissions&#151;should be aware and recognisant of exactly the same
issues. Schools need to be a vibrant part of their community. Letting
them wither on the vine can kill a whole community. It is important
that those dealing with schools admissions are aware of the role they
play in helping communities to continue to
thrive.</p><p><a name="06101750000023"></a>Amendment
No. 80 tackles a somewhat different area of disadvantage and comes at
it from a different angle. Here we are talking about schools forums,
which are concerned with the distribution of money that is allocated to
a local authority under its dedicated schools budget. The job of
schools forums is to share out that money between different schools. In
the calculations made on how much government money should be spent by
each local education authority at the local level, weighting is given
to various indices of 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_681"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 681</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>disadvantage such as the number of children on free school meals and the
number deemed to have special educational needs of one sort or another.
Local education authorities in areas of greater disadvantage receive
relatively more funding than do those in areas perceived to be
advantageous. But whether those resources are passed through to the
schools is a matter for schools forums. There is a question about
whether they too use a weighting formula to give schools with a large
number of disadvantaged kids their &#147;fair share&#148; of the
resources. In many authorities, this does not happen. Money is to an
extent allocated on a per-pupil basis rather than weighted towards the
disadvantaged, or where weight is given to the disadvantaged it is not
the full weighting given to such disadvantage in the government formula
itself.</p><p><a name="06101750000024"></a>Members on these Benches
feel strongly that the schools which need the extra resources are the
ones in areas of disadvantage. It is precisely in these schools that
one wants to see extra teachers in the classroom. These children should
be taught in small groups and often need individual attention. All this
demands more resources because you need more people&#151;and that
costs a lot more money. We feel it is right that where local
authorities receive extra resources to help them cope with
disadvantage, they are channelled towards the schools which need them.
Amendment No. 80 is designed to influence schools forums into doing
precisely that. I beg to
move.</p><h5><a name="06101750000139"></a>5.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06101750000025"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew87"></a><a name="06101750000476"></a>Lord
Dearing:</b> My Lords, I have added
my name to Amendment No. 6; I wish I had added it also to Amendments
Nos. 70 and 80. The Minister knows from correspondence how deeply I
feel about the potential role of schools in the regeneration,
nourishment and development of neighbourliness in
communities&#151;especially in communities of severe deprivation,
where poverty creates tensions and communities need a centre where they
can come together. Looking ahead, I fear for an increasing division in
our society between those who can succeed and those who, through lack
of skills and the fast drop in the number of jobs available for them,
cannot succeed and live in ghettoes of disadvantage, deprivation and
despair. In such areas, I am concerned that the school should survive
and be a centre of renewal.</p><p><a name="06101750000026"></a>Let
me give an example. There is a school in West Camberwell where I am
told&#151;I have got it on a piece of paper, so it must be
right&#151;that 70 per cent of the pupils have free school meals;
that in six out of seven families whose children attend that school
there is no adult in full-time employment; and that 30 per cent of the
community are from ethnic minorities. That spells despair and a
potential disengagement from and a disavowal of the values of society.
It concerns me
deeply.</p><p><a name="06101750000027"></a>That
school had a vision of responding to the situation as a
&#147;communiversity&#148;, in which it raised the standards of the
school. It was, I think, in special measures at the time I visited in
2000. It saw its role as lifting its children&#146;s performance,
caring for them, their wellbeing, but also engaging with the community.
It persuaded some of its teachers and pupils to become 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_682"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 682</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ambassadors for the school in the community, creating links with
different generations and different ethnicities. It saw a role for the
school in being open all hours, its facilities being available to the
community and the community being welcomed. It created a radio
recording studio which was open to the community and pupils. Its vision
was to create a work village for artisans, craftsmen and artists, and a
health centre&#151;and, of course, it wanted excellent premises to
serve that dream. My fear is that in communities where school rolls are
declining and where the Government are encouraging the expansion of
successful schools in an environment in which&#151;and it is like
this&#151;a school&#146;s first duty is to itself, these schools
may lose out and die through attenuation of rights.</p><p><a name="06101750000028"></a>This is a major issue of societal
importance which we need to think about. I share the sentiments of
Amendment No. 6. This is not about bussing children from one district
to another or about the admission policies of faith schools; it is
about schools reaching out into the community, engaging with it and
being a part of it.</p><p><a name="06101750000029"></a>Amendment No. 70
relates to admissions; Amendment No. 80 relates to cash. The
Government&#151;rightly&#151;have greater weighting in funding for
areas of deprivation than the generality. This is because those kids
need more and the Government say that they should have it. Such
children are more difficult to respond to and to teach sometimes, but
it is not necessarily so that the funding goes from the local authority
in relation to the needs of the children of individual schools. I am
not arguing for the words of the amendments, but there are important
issues of substance here that the Government need to
weigh.</p><p><a name="06101750000030"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew88"></a><a name="06101750000477"></a>Lord
Northbourne:</b> My Lords, I support the amendments
and echo every word that my noble friend Lord Dearing has said. He made
such an excellent speech that I am going to scrap mine, because he
really said everything that I would have liked to
say.</p><p><a name="06101750000031"></a>Clause 2 as drafted is
really rather amazing. It has a whiff of the leafy suburbs about it;
you do not feel that it really relates to the real world out there that
exists in deprived areas. That is an issue that the noble Baroness and
the noble Lord have addressed.</p><p><a name="06101750000032"></a>I
am concerned about disadvantaged children and believe that the
Government are concerned about them, too. Surely, their case and their
needs should be clearly stated in this Bill as being
important.</p><p><a name="06101750000033"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew89"></a><a name="06101750000478"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I agree with my noble
friend Lord Dearing that the words are not quite accurate, but the
intention behind the amendments is very important. I hope and expect to
be reassured by the Minister when he
replies.</p><p><a name="06101750000034"></a>This issue takes my
mind back to the time when I served for a very brief period on the
Inner London Education Authority, when I and a colleague on the Labour
Benches were absolutely of one mind that in the very deprived areas the
pay of teachers should be higher because they had a far tougher job and
greater responsibility to carry at that time. Above all, the resources
must be greater, because it is a far tougher 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_683"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 683</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>job and teachers require specialised training in such areas. If ever
there was a need to have the well-being of an individual emphasised, it
is in such areas.</p><p><a name="06101750000035"></a>So I hope that
I shall be reassured that these amendments are not necessary. I
particularly support Amendment No. 80, which gets absolutely to the
crux of the matter. If school forums in some areas are not doing their
duty and not passing on the money that they should be, we have to take
rather stronger
steps.</p><p><a name="06101750000036"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew90"></a><a name="06101750000479"></a>Lord
Hylton:</b> My Lords, I support all three amendments
in this group, but I address Amendment No. 80 in particular. To give an
example of the known factors for educational disadvantage, there are a
number of schools, especially in London but in other areas too, in
which a majority of pupils have English as their second language, when
English may not be their home language. It is possible, too, that in
their homes you would find very few books. It is essential that pupils
attending such schools should leave them fully literate and numerate if
they are not to continue to be disadvantaged for life, employment and

amendments will commend itself to the

Adonis:</b> My Lords, I hope that I can give the
reassurance that noble Lords seek on these amendments. I very much
agree with the comments that noble Lords have made about the needs of
schools in more deprived areas and the objectives that the noble
Baroness, Lady Sharp, seeks to achieve through Amendment No. 80, which
have been supported so widely on all sides of the
House.</p><p><a name="06101750000038"></a>In
respect of Amendment No. 80, on the allocation of funding by
disadvantage, Section 47 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998
makes provision for regulations to be made that set out how a local
authority must determine the amount of funding each maintained school
receives in its budget share. Existing regulations made under Section
47 of that Act make provisions similar to those envisaged by the noble
Baroness. In particular, Regulation 17(2) of the School Finance
(England) Regulations 2006 states that local authorities must
ensure&#151;I stress the word &#147;must&#148;&#151;that their
funding formula reflects the incidence of social deprivation among the
pupils registered at the schools that they maintain.</p><p><a name="06101750000039"></a>We have also recently required local
authorities and their schools forums to review their local funding
formulae to ensure that they are, first, delivering the level of
resources we have identified in their overall allocations for tackling
the impact of deprivation and, secondly, that such resources are
distributed in a way that sufficiently differentiates need among their
schools. I hope that we have met the points that noble Lords have
reasonably raised in respect of the funding of
disadvantage.</p><p><a name="06101750000040"></a>On
Amendment No. 70, we discussed in Committee whether there should be a
requirement on admission forums to have regard to the contribution
their schools have to the well-being of communities in disadvantaged
areas when providing advice on admission arrangements. I explained then
that the illustrative regulations we

reports shall
include,</p><ul><a name="06101750000126"></a>&#147;the ethnic
and social mix of pupils attending schools in the area of the authority
and the factors that affect
this&#148;</ul><a name="06101750000091"></a>and,<ul><a name="06101750000127"></a>&#147;the
extent to which existing and proposed admission arrangements serve the
interests of looked after children, children with disabilities and
children with special educational
needs&#148;.</ul><a name="06101750000092"></a>I believe
that goes a long way to meet the objectives of Amendment No.
70.<p><a name="06101750000041"></a>Since we published the
illustrative regulations on the operation of admission forums we have
issued the draft School Admissions Code, which I have circulated widely
in the House and which is available in the Library. This makes clear
that admission forums should assess how well admission arrangements
serve the interests of local parents and children, and that they should
do so in their reports. Paragraph 4.10 at page 53 of the draft School
Admissions Code
states:</p><ul><a name="06101750000108"></a>&#147;Admission
forums have a key role in ensuring a fair admission system that
promotes social
equity&#148;.</ul><a name="06101750000093"></a>The document
further
states:<ul><a name="06101750000109"></a>&#147;Admission
forums must act in accordance with the provisions of this code and they
should amongst the activities that they carry out assess how well the
admission arrangements serve the interests of local parents and
children
collectively&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06101750000094"></a>I
stress
&#147;collectively&#148;&#151;<ul><a name="06101750000128"></a>&#147;and
try to promote agreement on admission
issues&#148;.</ul><a name="06101750000095"></a>I believe
that the objectives of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment are now
fully met in the regulations for the admission forums and the draft
School Admissions
Code.<p><a name="06101750000042"></a>On
Amendment No. 6, all categories of maintained schools have a duty to
operate within the same framework of admissions and local
responsibilities. Irrespective of their category, whether it be
community, foundation or voluntary aided, they are all subject to
explicit duties under the Race Relations Act 1976 to eliminate unlawful
discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good
relations between persons of different ethnic groups. Furthermore,
under the Bill it is a requirement on proposers of new schools to show
how their proposals will contribute to community cohesion and the
trusts of trust schools will be under a specific duty under Clause 33
to promote community cohesion as part of fulfilling their charitable
object of advancing education. The Bill also places explicit new duties
on local authorities. They will have to ensure fair access to
educational opportunity and to promote the fulfilment of every
child&#146;s potential in addition to the existing duty to promote
high standards. Local authorities are also subject to explicit duties
under the Race Relations Act
1976.</p><p><a name="06101750000043"></a>Moreover,
local authorities will be required specifically to consider the impact
of proposed new schools on community cohesion when carrying out their
commissioning role under Part 2 of the Bill. Local authorities will be
under a duty to have regard to

will need to consider the extent to which, and how satisfactorily in
the circumstances of the community, proposals for new schools promote
community cohesion.</p><p><a name="06101750000044"></a>In all those
ways I believe that the objectives of Amendment No. 6 are met by the
Bill. I hope that the noble Baroness is
satisfied.</p><p><a name="06101750000045"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew92"></a><a name="06101750000481"></a>Baroness
Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to
the Minister for his response. I am also most grateful to all noble
Lords who supported the amendments. The Minister has offered
considerable reassurance. I was interested to hear about a review in
relation to the regulations in Section 47 of the 1998 Act. There is
quite a lot of evidence to show that at the moment, or until quite
recently, the resources that are being provided to meet disadvantage
are not necessarily being passed through to the schools that need those
resources. I am glad to hear that they have set in train that review,
and I will be interested to hear the outcome when it is
completed.</p><p><a name="06101750000046"></a>In relation to
admissions forums, I regret to say that, although I should have, I have
not chased up the new regulations that were just issued on the draft
admissions code. It is good to hear that the admissions forums have a
specific duty to promote social equity and to look to the interests of
all parents and children collectively in their community.</p><p><a name="06101750000047"></a>Coming back to Amendment No. 6, I repeat
what I said earlier that we recognise that in giving an explicit duty
to local authorities to promote fair access and equality of opportunity
they are moving in the direction of promoting social cohesion. We may
come back at Third Reading with an amendment that provides a more
explicit power for local authorities, which might be more suitable than
the amendments that I tabled. I thank the noble Lord for what he
said.</p><h5><a name="06101750000140"></a>5.30

maturity.&#148;&#148;
<p><a name="06101750000055"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I
shall speak at the same time to Amendment No. 82A, which is in my name
and is part of this group. I should perhaps say at the beginning that
Amendment No. 8 has been suggested to me by the Children&#146;s
Rights Alliance, which represents a number of organisations concerned
with children&#146;s welfare, including Save the Children, of which I
was for a number of years a trustee and executive council
member.</p><p><a name="06101750000056"></a>The issue here is
consultation with pupils on all matters affecting their school. This
has been raised on previous occasions, and I think that the Government
accept the principle that pupils should be consulted, which is in line
with the obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the
Child. However, the view of the Government has hitherto been that a new
statutory provision is not required, and they will continue to
encourage schools to follow the <I>Working Together</I> guidance.
However, the alliance feels that this is not enough. A statutory right
is needed to provide a firm foundation for pupil participation in all
schools. Steps must be taken to strengthen pupil participation in line
with the obligations under the UN
convention.</p><p><a name="06101750000057"></a>Recent research
indicates that the guidance has not led to change. Less than one third
of students felt that they were consulted when school policies were
discussed. A survey by the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance indicated
that of the 99 LEAs that responded, fewer than 45 per cent had taken
any action to inform school staff of pupil participation guidance,
fewer than 20 per cent had run any training for it, and only 10 per
cent had informed pupils of the guidance. Many LEAs did not know which
guidance was being referred to.</p><p><a name="06101750000058"></a>Everyone agrees in principle with pupil
participation. It encourages positive behaviour, and better
teacher-student relationships emerge when it happens. Pupils want more
of a say. Young people-led organisations, such as the British Youth
Council, want to see the introduction of a statutory right. I tabled
the amendment to an early part of the Bill because of its importance.
There is no need to make a long speech about the principle involved,
because I am sure that most noble Lords would agree with it. I hope
that this time around the Minister will be prepared to agree that this
is a right that should be in the Bill, and I hope that he will be
prepared to accept the amendment or will agree to come back with a
government amendment to achieve the same result.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_687"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 687</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101750000059"></a>Amendment No. 82A is about the involvement
of children in the exclusion process. Guidance on school exclusions in
England states that in situations where the governing body of a school
reviews the exclusion,
</p><ul><a name="06101750000129"></a>&#147;they should allow
and encourage the excluded pupil to attend the meeting and speak, if
the parent requests this&#148;.</ul><a name="06101750000097"></a>In reference to appeals
hearings, <ul><a name="06101750000130"></a>&#147;an
excluded pupil ... should normally be encouraged to attend the
hearing and to speak on his or her own behalf, if he or she wishes to
do so and the parent
agrees&#148;.</ul><a name="06101750000098"></a>I emphasise
that the parent should agree.
<p><a name="06101750000060"></a>Although the guidance recommends that
pupils be given a voice in the exclusion process, it is not enforceable
and not all schools make provision for children and young people to
make representations at discipline committees or appeal hearings.
Furthermore, the current guidance does not cover the provision of
relevant information for children and young people regarding the
exclusion. As a result, children are not always in a position to make
representations at exclusion hearings, even if they are encouraged to
attend. The Government made assurances that the guidance would be
updated in 2004. Changes were finally made in September 2006, calling
on schools to &#147;allow and encourage&#148; the pupil to give
their version of events. However, they still have no right of appeal on
their own exclusion, and the guidance has not been strengthened
sufficiently to address our concerns on this issue.</p><p><a name="06101750000061"></a>The Government rightly place much
emphasis on citizenship and taking responsibility for one&#146;s
actions. Giving children a voice in exclusion hearings forces them to
think about their actions and the consequences of their actions and
allows them to explain why they behaved in the way they did. This goes
to the heart of being a good citizen.</p><p><a name="06101750000062"></a>In a Save the Children consultation
undertaken with young people excluded from school, many of them felt a
sense of injustice and disempowerment because they were not given an
opportunity to put their side of the story. One young boy
stated:</p><ul><a name="06101750000116"></a>&#147;You
don&#146;t get given your chance to say what happened. How are they
going to know what happened&#148;.</ul><a name="06101750000099"></a>Some professionals feel that the
current ineffective involvement of young people in the exclusion
process can cause them to be unaware of what it is they have done, and
this has resulted in their exclusion, making a reoffence highly
probable. That serves no one&#146;s interests. In some cases,
children are excluded on a false premise. Making false assumptions and
denying a child the right to defend himself or herself leads only to
alienation and bitterness, entrenching negative attitudes both towards
school and wider
society.<p><a name="06101750000063"></a>Excluding
a pupil, even when it is merited, is very serious indeed, given the
impact that exclusion has on a pupil&#146;s life chances. Truancy and
school exclusion are in the background of 70 per cent of young
offenders. The fact that some pupils are consigned to this fate on
false grounds is unacceptable. Giving pupils a fair hearing goes some
way to addressing a failure in the system. Both young people and
professionals to whom Save the Children spoke when it was doing its
survey perceived a lack of standard

resulting in anger and frustration and engendering a feeling of
powerlessness and low self-esteem. It is believed that fully involving
children in the exclusion process will ensure that they take
responsibility for their actions and do not become disengaged from
school and from society
altogether.</p><p><a name="06101750000064"></a>When a similar
amendment was debated during proceedings on the then Education Bill in
2005, the Government promised to strengthen guidance, rather than amend
regulations. Now the time has come to review whether the guidance is
having the required effect. It is about time that we looked at the
possibility of including legislative change in this Bill that would
give children in England the same rights as in Scotland and Wales. I
hope that this time around, the Government will be prepared to
reconsider what they have said on this issue. In the mean time, I beg
to move.</p><p><a name="06101750000065"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew96"></a><a name="06101750000485"></a>Baroness

the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, on Amendment No. 8 and have added my
name to it. I also support her Amendment No. 82A, to which, I am
afraid, I was too late to add my name&#151;but I would have liked to.
She rightly said that the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance for
England, which does so much to promote children&#146;s rights,
believes that pupils need a statutory right to have their views
considered in matters affecting the conduct of their school, which has
a great impact on their everyday lives. Of course, schools would still
require guidance and support to implement the amendment, which would
make education law, policy and practice consistent with broader
developments in public services and give England&#146;s children
entitlements that Scottish children have had since
2000.</p><p><a name="06101750000066"></a>I sometimes feel a little
frustrated when talking about the voice of the child in your Lordships'
House. I often wish that we could hear children themselves standing up
in this place to tell us why they would like to have statutory rights
to have their voices heard, rather than having to rely on elderly
Baronesses such as myself and some of my similarly minded colleagues.
However, I am afraid that your Lordships will have to make do with the
rather second-rate effort that I have to make on behalf of
children.</p><p><a name="06101750000067"></a>In Committee, the
Minister said that the Government unreservedly agreed with the second
part of the amendment tabled at that time, which aimed to remove the
current exemption of nursery-age children from the consultation duties
on schools and local authorities. Indeed, he has done something about
that, for which I very much thank him. I also thank him for his
Amendment No. 116 in this group, which accepts the point that these
Benches made in relation to the development of a school behaviour
policy to which every child in a school, rather than just a sample,
should have the opportunity to contribute his views. That is a valuable
move forward.</p><p><a name="06101750000068"></a>In relation to the

provide a firm foundation for pupil participation in all
schools.</p><p><a name="06101750000069"></a>In its recent report on
the Bill, the Joint Committee on Human Rights notes that it
has,</p><ul><a name="06101750000131"></a>&#147;written to the
Secretary of State asking whether, in light of the requirements of
Article 12&#148;,</ul><a name="06101750000100"></a>of the
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,
<ul><a name="06101750000132"></a>&#147;the Bill could do more to
provide children with greater opportunity to express their views in
matter which affect
them&#148;.</ul><a name="06101750000101"></a>Article 12 of
the UNCRC states that all
children,<ul><a name="06101750000133"></a>&#147;have the
right to express and to have their views taken into account and given
due weight according to their age and maturity in all matters affecting
them&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101750000070"></a>In October
2002, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child stated that the
Government,</p><ul><a name="06101750000134"></a>&#147;should
take further steps to promote, facilitate and monitor children&#146;s
effective participation, including in schools, like school
councils&#148;.</ul><a name="06101750000102"></a>The
Government have certainly done much on school councils and I give the
Minister a great deal of credit for that. The committee also stated
that the
Government,<ul><a name="06101750000135"></a>&#147;should
take further steps to consistently reflect the obligations of both
paragraphs of article 12 in
legislation&#148;.</ul><a name="06101750000103"></a>Now we
are moving close to an opportunity for the UK Government to do that,
because they must submit their next report to the UNCRC in 2007.

step towards fulfilling its recommendations in the 2002
report.<h5><a name="06101750000141"></a>5.45

Amendment No. 82A, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, about the
well-being and educational attainment of children who have been
excluded from school. We might have debated it later, in the group that
starts with Amendment No. 119 on exclusions, although I accept that
part of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment relates to giving the
child a proper voice in the proceedings, so there is a case for
debating the matter now.</p><p><a name="06101750000072"></a>She
rightly lays out in the proposed new subsection (5A) the basic
principles of well-being and educational attainment, to which we should
adhere when making arrangements for children who, for one reason or
another, have had to be excluded. She also asks that the child&#146;s
right to represent himself in his own right and to have the necessary
information to enable him to do so is given to him.</p><p><a name="06101750000073"></a>That is important because some children
cannot rely on their parents to represent them. Some parents do not
want to be bothered or feel intimidated by the system so that they feel
reluctant to appear before what seems a frightening panel, as if they
are in the dragon&#146;s den, to defend their child. Of course we
should do everything we can to encourage them to feel more comfortable
in taking part in those proceedings, but we also need to do something
about ensuring that the child has its own rights as an individual whose
whole life is in the hands of the panel considering their
exclusion.</p>

Dearing:</b> My Lords, I warmly support the amendment
tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, on listening to the voice of
pupils. I hope that the Government will respond warmly to it. However,
welcome though it is, I regard it only as paving the way for what has
already been done in Wales, where, using the powers of the 2002 Act,
school councils have been made mandatory in all ordinary schools. It
has been prescribed in regulations that schools&#146; councils should
be properly elected; their functions to comment on matters affecting
the school and education have been laid down; their representations
must be considered by the head and the governing body&#151;and they
are entitled to a response under those
regulations.</p><p><a name="06101750000076"></a>I recognise that it
is early days to form a judgment on the success of what has been done
in Wales and I know that the Minister will want to wait for the finally
considered views of Professor Whitty before marching on. Perhaps I may
quote the views of the head teacher of Malet Lambert, a school that I
left many years ago. She stated in a letter to
me:</p><ul><a name="06101750000117"></a>&#147;A school that is
passionate about education and effective in raising standards needs to
consider, promote and champion the rights and accountabilities of the
student body. The school council gives a coherent voice and overt
pathways for this process. I would strongly recommend this process and
its benefits&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101750000077"></a>I
consulted another head of a school that I know, Christ&#146;s College
in Guildford, where again there was enthusiasm for the idea of a
council, with contributions ranging from, &#147;Hey, they&#146;re
proposing a new menu&#148;, and the school&#146;s council was
invited to try it. Other opinions were sought on bullying and the plans
for a new building&#151;all useful input from the pupils. The noble
Baroness referred very modestly to the role played by people such as
her in representing the views of children. The headmistress at Malet
Lambert is so convinced of the value of consultation that she is
prepared to bring her school council to the Minister to do the noble
Baroness&#146;s job for
her.</p><p><a name="06101750000078"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew99"></a><a name="06101750000488"></a>Baroness

the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden,
will be taken seriously.</p><p><a name="06101750000080"></a>The
briefing from the Children's Rights Alliance for England was excellent.
It made all the points and I shall not go into them again, but I want
to mention exclusion hearings. It is crucial that children have a right
to hear what is going on and make their contribution. I had a very
interesting discussion with the Minister about involving mentors for,
in particular, looked-after children, who often face exclusion because
they are rather more difficult to handle. If a mentor were there to
take their part, in addition to the children themselves having a say,
that would be a huge improvement. I was delighted to hear in the letter
from the Minister that such a scheme is being planned using the
qualities of volunteers who are trained, to a certain extent, in the
community. For all those reasons, I very much support what has been
said on these
amendments.</p><p><a name="06101750000081"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew100"></a><a name="06101750000489"></a>Baroness
David:</b> My Lords, I, too,
support the amendment moved by my noble friend Lady Turner. I shall
repeat what I said about the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord
Judd. The UK Government must submit their next report to the UN
Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2007. The committee&#146;s
comments on the previous report said that the Government should take
further steps to promote, facilitate and monitor children's effective
participation, including in schools via school councils. The Government
should take further steps to consistently reflect in legislation the
obligations of both paragraphs of Article 12. I hope that the Minister
can pay attention to that, as it is important. The Children's Rights
Alliance for England produced a briefing for this issue. The noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and I are both patrons of it, so I am sure
that we should like to support the amendment from that point of view as
well. I hope that the Minister can give a good response this
time.</p><p><a name="06101750000082"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew101"></a><a name="06101750000490"></a>Lord
Elton:</b> My Lords, I want to say a word in support
of the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. One thing that
struck me and the group of people who were asked by Kenneth
Baker&#151;my noble friend Lord Baker&#151;when he was Minister for
Education to do a report on discipline in schools was the considerable
benefits that schools gained when they engaged children in aspects of
the schools&#146; management. If a child thinks that the school
belongs to him, anyone who does anything against the school offends
against him. The same goes for codes of discipline and behaviour within
a school. That can be carried beyond the level of the classroom and the
school, as is suggested in the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06101750000083"></a>I also wanted to say
a brief word on Amendment No. 82A and its proposed new subsection (5A),
which states:</p><ul><a name="06101750000118"></a>&#147;It shall
be the duty of all persons and bodies exercising functions under this
section ... to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child who
is proposed to be excluded&#148;.</ul>

drafting point but what happens to the child when he or she is excluded
is critical. In voluntary work, I have seen the extraordinarily fertile
recruiting ground for crime provided by excluded children because,
generally speaking, they are not given any level of education or
occupation sufficient to keep them out of it, and boredom is one of the
great instigators of bad
behaviour.<p><a name="06101750000084"></a>Mention has been
made of mentors. Some voluntary and other agencies are engaged in
intervening before this critical stage in a child&#146;s downward
slide into crime by identifying those who are next on the list for
exclusion and providing adult mentors for them. Very often, they are
children with no male role model in the family or immediate community
to look up to and be guided by. Mentors are invaluable in these cases.
These children are not always particularly articulate but the idea that
they should be included in any proceedings on exclusion is
invaluable.</p><p><a name="06101760000001"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew102"></a><a name="06101760000119"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, this has been an immensely
valuable debate. I begin by saying that, if the noble Lord, Lord
Dearing, would like to bring his school council to meet me, I shall be
delighted to meet its members. Indeed, I am struck by the fact that,
when I visit schools, it is now normal for me to meet the school
council. That does not happen at my request but at the instigation of
the school.</p><p><a name="06101760000002"></a>If I had to put my
finger on the single biggest change that has taken place at schools
between the time when I was a pupil&#151;it was not that long ago;
none the less, it was a reasonable period ago&#151;and schools today,
it would be the outbreak of democracy. That has been quite remarkable
in recent years. I take the example of school councils, referred to by
the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and my noble friend Lady Turner. They are
now present in virtually all secondary schools and in an increasing
number of primary schools.</p><p><a name="06101760000003"></a>One
thing that most surprised me when I became a Minister and started to
visit primary schools was the growing prevalence of school councils
there and the fact that they can, and do, operate very successfully in
promoting precisely the kind of inclusion that the noble Lord, Lord
Elton, referred to&#151;even among the very youngest children. I had
to change my thinking in respect of that as I visited schools. I
realised that it was perfectly possible to consult even young children
in a serious way. Of course, you have to make allowances for their age,
but they can play a role. My daughter, who is very young, told me about
the elections that took place for the school council at her primary
school and the rival programmes that were put forward in respect of
school meals and so on. I realise that this is a big idea which has a
lot further to go, and we are anxious to see it do
so.</p><p><a name="06101760000004"></a>In replying to this group of
amendments, I shall speak also to government Amendments Nos. 116 and
136. Government Amendment No. 136 would amend Section 176 of the
Education Act 2002, which provides for local authorities and governing
bodies to have regard to guidance on the consultation of pupils 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_693"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 693</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about issues affecting them. The amendment would broaden the definition
of &#147;pupil&#148; to include nursery age pupils in schools and
in maintained nursery schools. I bring this amendment forward in direct
response to the case made in our earlier debates by the noble Baroness,
Lady Walmsley. She rightly argued that we should broaden the definition
of &#147;pupil&#148; to include nursery age pupils in schools and
in maintained nursery schools. This provision also reflects the
position taken in the recent Childcare Act, which was significantly
improved in its passage through this House by the inclusion of
provisions very similar to the one that the noble Baroness proposed and
which I am glad to bring forward this
afternoon.</p><p><a name="06101760000005"></a>Amendment No. 8
tabled by my noble friend Lady Turner would place a direct duty on
school governing bodies and local authorities to have regard to the
ascertainable views of all their pupils on matters that affect them,
having regard to each pupil&#146;s age and maturity. It would place a
duty on schools and local authorities to consult pupils.</p><p><a name="06101760000006"></a>We do not agree that amending primary
legislation is the best or most powerful way to bring about the
improvements that we seek. As I said earlier, local authorities and
governing bodies must already have regard to statutory guidance on the
consultation of pupils in connection with decisions that affect them.
We are encouraging schools to put into practice the 2004 guidance
called <I>Working Together: Giving children and young people a say,</I>
issued under Section 176, in ways that are meaningful to children and
young people. A prime example of that is school councils, which we are
strongly encouraging. Indeed, we part fund School Councils UK, an
educational charity.</p><p><a name="06101760000007"></a>Further to
that, as the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, mentioned, my right honourable
friend the Secretary of State has asked Professor Geoff Whitty, the
director of the Institute of Education at the University of London, to
report to us specifically on strengthening the guidance in respect of
school councils. Professor Whitty is engaged in that work at the
moment. We expect his report early in the New Year and we will be
guided by him on issues such as the one to which the noble Lord, Lord
Dearing, referred; whether we should follow the practice in Wales of
making school councils statutory. In the Education Act 2002 we have the
power to do so, but we want to wait for the report of Professor Whitty,
who is engaging very substantially with young people in drawing that
up, before we decide on a precise way forward in that
respect.</p><h5><a name="06101760000116"></a>6
pm</h5><p><a name="06101760000008"></a>Furthermore, we have ensured
that school inspection arrangements make the views of children and
young people an important part of assessing how local areas are doing
and we have changed the law so that school governing bodies can now
appoint pupils as associate members, allowing them to attend governing
body meetings and become members of committees. Last month, when I
visited Finland, I was very struck by the engagement of pupils on the 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_694"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 694</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>governing bodies of schools, which is a practice that is not usual here.
We have now made it possible for schools to appoint pupils as associate
members of governing bodies and I believe that that is a development
that will grow in future
years.</p><p><a name="06101760000009"></a>Current arrangements
offer a non-prescriptive approach for schools, allowing them to find
the best way for them of involving young people. We believe that this
is the right way to proceed and we do not wish to proceed by means of
mandatory requirements on all local authorities and all schools in all
circumstances. We want to avoid introducing a very broad statutory
requirement that is likely to cause schools difficulties about the
meaning and interpretation of the law and increase the risk of judicial
review. We want to secure practical improvements in student
participation and in taking account of the voice of the child. On that
basis, I hope that my noble friend Lady Turner will feel able to
withdraw her amendment.</p><p><a name="06101760000010"></a>I now
turn to government Amendment No. 116. Clause 85 places a duty on the
school governing body to draw up a statement of principles on behaviour
and discipline that will inform the school behaviour policy determined
by the head teacher. Clause 85(3) obliges the governing body to consult
various persons before making or revising the statement of principles.
Those persons include the head teacher, parents, and a sample of the
registered pupils at the school.</p><p><a name="06101760000011"></a>When we were debating Clause 85 in
Committee, the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Sharp of
Guildford, laid an amendment that sought to oblige school governing
bodies to consult not just a sample of pupils but all registered pupils
at their schools on the principles underlying the school behaviour
policy. I agreed at the time that the case for seeking the views of all
pupils in this regard was compelling. I committed to taking another
look at this clause. I am glad to say that government Amendment No. 116
removes the sample qualification and extends the consultation process
to include all registered pupils at a school, precisely to meet the
points that she made again this afternoon and the points raised by the
noble Lord, Lord Elton; namely, that the more pupils at a school own
the behaviour policy and feel a real stake in having forged it, the
more likely they are to comply with it for the general good of all
pupils and the general good of the wider school
community.</p><p><a name="06101760000012"></a>I turn to Amendment
No. 82A in the name of my noble friend Lady Turner, concerning
exclusions from school. In Committee, my noble friend rightly pointed
to the fact that during deliberations on the Education Bill 2005 we
undertook to strengthen DfES guidance to emphasise that the excluded
child, or child threatened with exclusion, should be encouraged to make
representations about his exclusion at various stages of the exclusion
procedure, including at the point of exclusion, but have not yet
brought forward those changes. I said in Committee that I regretted
those amendments had not been made, but I am pleased to assure the
House that they were made in September in the latest exclusions
guidance. Although my noble friend has quoted views to the contrary, I 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_695"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 695</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>believe that on any reading of the changes that we have made, they meet
the commitments that we have given and give a very substantial voice to
the child who is proposed to be excluded in the deliberations
concerning the potential exclusion.</p><p><a name="06101760000013"></a>I have here the guidance on improving
behaviour and attendance&#151;I shall readily make it available to
noble Lords. It highlights on the first page the main changes that are
made in the more recent version of the guidance. As one of the key
changes made, it
highlights:</p><ul><a name="06101760000096"></a>&#147;Encouraging
the pupil to have a voice in the exclusion procedure, if he and his
parents wish&#148;.</ul><a name="06101760000080"></a>At
every stage of the guidance itself there are changes to promote the
views of the child. For example, it
states:<ul><a name="06101760000097"></a>&#147;Before
deciding whether to exclude a pupil, either permanently or for a fixed
period, the head teacher should: ... allow [and encourage] the
pupil to give his or her version of
events&#148;.</ul><a name="06101760000081"></a>It makes the
same requirements in respect of looked-after
children.<ul><a name="06101760000098"></a>&#147;Letters of
notification of exclusion must
state&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06101760000082"></a>not
only&#151;<ul><a name="06101760000107"></a>&#147;the
parent&#146;s right to make representations about the exclusion to
the governing body&#148;,</ul><a name="06101760000083"></a>but also&#151;this is a further
change&#151;how the pupil may be involved in that. Pupils are also
invited to attend exclusion hearings and to speak, if the parent
agrees. I believe these changes meet the commitments that we gave
during the passage of the Education Act
2005.<p><a name="06101760000014"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew103"></a><a name="06101760000120"></a>Baroness

parent? We have found that sometimes a child wants to appeal, but the
parent does not. It seems to us, and to Save the Children in
particular, that that is not good enough. Sometimes a parent is not
prepared to back the child when perhaps the child should have that

making decisions that affect the child&#146;s welfare in this
way.</p><p><a name="06101760000016"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew105"></a><a name="06101760000122"></a>Baroness

parent will have the right to make representations and to appeal. The
definition of a parent for the purposes of the Education Acts is
broadly drawn and includes

authority where they have a care order in respect of a child) and any
person (for example, a foster carer) with whom the child
lives&#148;.</ul><a name="06101760000084"></a>So it extends
to those groups. I do not believe that it would extend to a mentor, but
it extends to all those who have responsibility in respect of a

councils would have a good deal to say about pupil engagement in
schools more broadly. That may offer us an opportunity to proceed
further. I believe that our bone fides in this matter are sound, given
all the measures that I have elucidated this afternoon. Therefore, I
hope that my noble friend will not feel it necessary to press this

that&#151;and to learn that there has been a large growth in school
councils and that, as a result of the experience in Wales, where school

raised in Committee by one of my colleagues when I could not be in my
place. I raise it again because I am not satisfied that without the
prompt or goad of legislation local authorities will consistently
appoint as school improvement partners for schools with a religious
character educationists who fully understand and support that
character. We have anecdotal evidence to the contrary. I know anecdotal
evidence is always a little dangerous, but never mind, we have it. In a
number of cases, SIPs are being appointed who are undoubtedly highly
qualified and experienced teachers and advisers able to help the school
in various ways, but they are hampered because they do not really
understand the religious character of the school. My amendment is
modest; I am not asking for the appointment only of people of the same
faith as the school, but of people who are able to help the school
preserve and develop its religious character. I know the Minister
understands the point, and I do not labour it. I hope he may smile on
my wish to see the point enshrined in
law.</p><p><a name="06101760000028"></a>Let me now turn to the
other amendments in this group. I must confess that my speech almost
feels like the two journeys I made as a child when we went to Denmark
for Christmas in 1954. On the way over on the DFDS ferry, the North Sea
was as flat as duck pond and we could see our faces in water, but on
the way back, the storm doors went up before we left Esbjerg harbour
and the linen tablecloths were soaked to prevent the crockery sliding
off on to the floor. We will see how the debate goes.</p><p><a name="06101760000029"></a>Amendment No. 16 deals with of admissions
to Church and other faith schools, which has been much discussed in
your Lordships&#146; House and in the other place, as well as in the
media. The Church of England&#146;s position is clear: we are
strongly committed to providing schools that are distinctively
Christian and that are at the same inclusive. We see no opposition
between these two aims. Part of a school&#146;s

for the purpose of indoctrination, but in order to offer education
clearly based on Christian values. Church of England schools also aim
to nurture in their faith the children of Christian families, to
encourage those of other faiths and to challenge those who, rightly and
sincerely, claim to have no religious faith whatever.</p><p><a name="06101760000030"></a>The Church of England is expanding its
number of secondary schools in response to parental demand where
communities wish it. The majority of these new schools are serving
disadvantaged communities and have inclusive admissions policies. Most
give priority to local children or do not admit on the basis of faith.
Of the rest, only one has a proportion of places for local, as opposed
to faith, priority lower than 50 per cent and that school allocates 33
per cent of places to those of other faiths on a local basis.</p><p><a name="06101760000031"></a>Noble Lords may know that I wrote to the
Secretary of State earlier this month to make a specific commitment
that all new Church of England schools should have at least 20 per cent
of places available to children with no requirement that they be of
practising Christian families. The places would not be left empty if
they were not filled by such children, so this would technically not be
a quota, but would be a proportion. That commitment relates explicitly
to new Church of England schools. The fact that I have not had an
enormously negative postbag since that letter was published suggests to
me not that the general public had not read it or heard about it, but
rather that what the letter commits the Church to very largely, but not
totally, represents current practice in Church of England
schools.</p><p><a name="06101760000032"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Baker, is proposing that all new Church and other faith schools without
exception should be required by law to make that commitment. I want to
be clear that I do not support his proposal. My voluntary commitment is
for the Church of England; it is not a statement of policy for all
schools with a religious character. There is no need for legislation in
this area, particularly not at this time. I add that the cross I am
wearing was made in Aarhus in Denmark for my grandfather by the local
goldsmith, Hingelberg, a Jewish firm.</p><p><a name="06101760000033"></a>As I have said, the
Church supports the provision of more schools by and for minority faith
communities. It would not be right to require the same commitment from
them. They are themselves a sign of inclusion for their communities and
of fledgling potential inclusion gradually over the years. They are not
at the same stage as the Church of England schools in this respect. I
say that as a statement of fact with which I know they agree rather
than to crow. It is because of different social histories. Their very
existence promotes community cohesion. Those educated at such schools
will develop in self-respect within their own religious identity and
thus in respect for others. Members of the community looking on from
outside will also develop greater self-respect and respect for others
as they see their religious community taking its full place in British
society. That is in tune with the more positive aspects of the public
debate around these issues. All this would be further enhanced by the
development of 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_699"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 699</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>robust and effective educational links between schools of a different
character, which is very important. I welcome the commitment made by my
friend the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham, Vincent Nichols,
that Catholic schools will be inspected on such links. I would like to
see government support for such links between all schools.</p><p><a name="06101760000034"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Baker,
will not seek to test the opinion of the House on his amendment. I
believe that it would send profoundly negative signals at this time to
members of some of the other faith communities, the overwhelming
majority of whom are decent and trustworthy and may well be somewhat
bewildered at the fear and resentment they seem to arouse.</p><p><a name="06101760000035"></a>I now turn to the two amendments in this
group on collective worship and religious education. In May, the
Churches&#146; Joint Education Policy Committee, an inter-church body
that I have the privilege of chairing, agreed a position paper on
school collective worship. All the Churches&#146; representatives
agreed that we strongly support the continuation of collective worship
in all schools, recognising the major contribution it makes to the
spiritual and moral development of pupils, which is a prime goal of
education. We recognise that other faith groups saw collective worship
to be of benefit, even though its emphasis was mainly Christian. We
look for Government support to improve the quality of the acts of
collective worship and to ensure that all pupils are able to attend
meaningful acts of worship at school. The way we do things now could be
imaginatively improved&#151;as they could have been 500 years ago
when I was at
school.</p><p><a name="06101760000036"></a>It will be no surprise, therefore, that I
shall not support the amendment in the names of the noble
Baronesses&#151;good friends of mine though they are&#151;to remove
the requirement for worship and replace it with an opportunity for
spiritual and moral development. I believe prayer and worship to be a
fundamental human instinct, however it is located within the religious
spectrum, one that should be given expression and developed as part of
people&#146;s education and as every pupil's entitlement in school,
providing an important grammar and language for later life, even if the
specific theological tenets are rejected. It is part of our common
culture&#151;changing, yes, but there. That would clearly not be the
case through an assembly that gave no opportunity for prayer or
worship.</p><p><a name="06101760000037"></a>Everyone in their
lives faces times of personal pain and sadness, whether through their
own health problems or those of others close to them, or some community
tragedy. We saw at Soham a few years ago, and we have seen in response
to other tragedies, how the whole community comes together to pray and
worship. Those who have never experienced the tradition of prayer and
worship in school, unless they found it in their family and church, are
at a disadvantage in those circumstances&#151;although I know that
that view is not universally shared.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_700"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 700</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101760000038"></a>I find the provision for pupils to exclude
themselves from RE the most baffling of all. It strikes at the very
heart of what many of us, of whatever religious faith or none, are
trying to develop in the current educational system of our country at
this stage in our history. I emphasise &#147;at this stage in our
history&#148;. Whether one takes a specifically religious view of
reality or a functional approach to what broad-based religious
education can in the long term achieve for society as a whole,
religious education is vital to the educational enterprise. In no
school should religious education be about indoctrination. Those days
have long gone. All church and other faith schools have committed
themselves to teaching in religious education about other faiths as
well as their own. We on these Benches would strongly oppose the
provision in this amendment. We feel that it would send out the signal
that the subject does not really matter precisely when it is increasing
in popularity.</p><p><a name="06101760000039"></a>I
will say a word on the Government's amendment on the right of
sixth-formers to decide whether to take part in collective worship at
school. By freely choosing to study in a school sixth form, pupils with
the support of their parents are deciding to submit themselves to the
rules and regulations of the school in question and of schools in
general. It is therefore arguable that, while those of compulsory
school age should be able to be withdrawn from collective worship, that
right should not be available to sixth-formers.</p><p><a name="06101760000040"></a>However, if the amendment is
approved, I would like it&#151;and I know this view will be shared by
others&#151;to be made very clear in the DfES guidance to schools
that daily collective worship is part of normal practice in sixth
forms, it must be offered by the schools, and sixth-formers cannot
withdraw from it casually. That should mean that at the very least, as
in the case of parental withdrawal, a letter must be written to the
head asking for permission to withdraw from collective worship. While
it is recognised that heads cannot withhold permission, this should
ensure that the matter is understood to be serious. Guidance should
make it clear that it would be perfectly appropriate for a head to ask
for an explanation of the pupil&#146;s reason for the request. An
alternative educational or community activity should be specified to
take place at the same time as the act of worship, which is entirely
reasonable.</p><p><a name="06101760000041"></a>If I
can be given assurances on these matters, I shall not oppose the
Government&#146;s amendments. Meanwhile, I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101760000042"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew113"></a><a name="06101760000130"></a>Lord

arguments, perhaps I may say on behalf of the House what a pleasure it
is to see the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth back with

I suspect, not only to the skill of his doctors but to the
effectiveness of prayer.</p>

House has debated faith schools. The first occasion was on an Unstarred
Question by the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, in February, and the second
was during the Committee stage of this Bill on 18 July, when I moved an
amendment for a quota of 30 per cent of places in faith schools for
non-faith children. We are debating it again today, and, as the
Government have indicated that they will bring forward amendments on
this issue for Third Reading on 30 October, there will be a fourth
time. So we have debated this matter infinitely more than the House of
Commons did. It is a credit to the House that, on an important matter
of such major interest we have provided a focus for a national
debate.</p><p><a name="06101760000044"></a>When I moved my
amendment in July, no one spoke in favour of exclusive faith schools.
The Minister was not entirely hostile to the proposition, but I would
describe his attitude as cool. He said
that</p><ul><a name="06101760000108"></a>&#147;a whole set of
practical issues will emerge in seeking to have
quotas&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/07/06; col.
1207.]</ul><a name="06101760000085"></a>Having recently
attended a seminar when he spoke on private and public education, where
inclusiveness was in his every second sentence, I know that inclusion
runs in his veins. As he is the most intelligent Minister in his
department&#151;I hope that that does not entirely blight his
career&#151;he has probably had considerable influence in moving the
Government to a change of opinion on this. We learnt about that in the
leak of a Cabinet paper, no less, to the <I>Sunday Times</I>. I suspect
that that leak will not be examined by the Cabinet Secretary because it
not only had the fingerprints of the Secretary of State, but it had his
name in the second line. I seem to remember that we were rather more
subtle in Government, but that was a long time ago. It is clear from
the leak that the Government are moving and have moved considerably on
this matter. One should ask why this has happened. It has happened for
two reasons. <p><a name="06101760000045"></a>Over the past 50
years in our society, successive Governments and community leaders have
been grappling with the problems of race and colour. Tremendous
progress has been made to eliminating prejudice. The battle is not
entirely won, but it is a great credit to our society that we have
coped with those problems. Religion has not been centre stage; over the
past 40 or 50 years everybody has been able to practice their own
religion with complete freedom. It is one of the basic freedoms of our
country. What has become more evident in the past few years is how
religion can separate societies. The debate this summer, which probably
started with the cartoons of Muhammad while the latest manifestation is
Jack Straw and the veil, indicates that this is a matter of real
concern which the Government now
appreciate.</p><p><a name="06101760000046"></a>The second reason
why the Government have changed is what the right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Portsmouth has just said. At the beginning of October he said
that in future the Church of England would give priority to 20 per cent
of pupils from other faiths or no faiths for new Anglican schools. Do I
have that right?</p>

Baker of Dorking:</b> My Lords, the right reverend
Prelate says 25 per cent but <I>Hansard</I> will reveal that he said
&#147;20 per cent&#148; in his speech. Any advance on that would be
very welcome. That 25 per cent is a very wise and sensible move. I went
to a Church of England primary school, Holy Trinity in Southport,
during the war. It was totally inclusive. My closest friend was a
Jewish boy. I learnt about the Jewish faith by going to his home on
Fridays. It was my brand of Anglicanism, not too proselytising and not
too fervent. We went to church twice a year and we started every day
with a hymn and a prayer, but I think that most schools did in those
days.</p><p><a name="06101760000049"></a>As the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth said, that reflects the practice of
the Church of England today. He then hesitated&#151;I understand
why&#151;before saying, &#147;We are following the right path, but
I do not to want to force any of the other religions in our country to
follow my path&#148;. That reminded me of the description of Mr
Pecksniff in <I>Martin Chuzzlewit</I> by Charles Dickens, when Dickens
said that he was like a signpost: always pointing the way but never
going. That is not entirely fair, because the Church of England is
going, but although the road is so great and wonderful, it is not going
to twist the arms of other religions to go down it with it. I
understand its
view.</p><p><a name="06101760000050"></a>My
amendment would mean that we would follow the Church of
England&#146;s example and apply it to other schools. I think that it
is worth reminding the House of the argument for inclusion. It is wrong
to divide children by religion at the ages of five and 11. Where that
has happened in societies such as Northern Ireland, that crop has
produced a savage harvest. The comparison with Northern Ireland is
fair. There is great intransigence, but there is now hope in that
country because community schools are being established in which there
are 40 per cent Catholics, 40 per cent Protestants and 20 per cent
others. I have talked to the prime mover of that in Northern Ireland
and it is a very inspiring move
indeed.</p><p><a name="06101760000051"></a>The second reason why
inclusion is so good was expressed very clearly by Rabbi Romain, the
rabbi of the synagogue in Maidenhead, when he
said:</p><ul><a name="06101760000102"></a>&#147;I want my
children to sit next to a Sikh in class, play football in the break
with a Methodist, to do homework with a Hindu, and walk to the bus stop
with a Muslim before returning to their Jewish home ... Leaders of all
faiths should put aside religious self-interest and make national
cohesion a higher
priority&#148;.</ul><a name="06101760000086"></a>Of course,
he is not alone in that. The NUT strongly supports inclusion. So does
Trevor Phillips, the head of the Commission for Racial Equality. David
Bell, a former Chief Inspector of Schools, reported only two years ago
that,<ul><a name="06101760000109"></a>&#147;many young
people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little
appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British
society&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101760000052"></a>Then there
is Amartya Sen, who was the master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and
who won the Nobel prize for his distinguished writing on identity and

characterise people by one thing&#151;Christian, Hindu or
Muslim&#151;or by their race or nationality. To put people in pens
like that is a denial of human character, for the simple reason that
each one of us is subject to a variety of influences of all sorts that
affect our development. He thinks that that is very damaging. He
said:</p><ul><a name="06101760000103"></a>&#147;Being defined by
one group identity over all others, overlooking whether you&#146;re
working class or capitalist, left or right, what your language group is
and your literary tastes are, all that interferes with people's freedom
to make their own choices ... I think there is a real tyranny
there. It doesn&#146;t look like tyranny - it looks like giving
freedom and tolerance - but it ends up being a denial of individual
freedom&#148;.</ul><a name="06101760000087"></a>I strongly
support his words.<p><a name="06101760000053"></a>The last
person whom I pray in evidence for inclusion is Mr Cantle of the Cantle
report. Your Lordships will remember the race riots in Bradford, Oldham
and Burnley and the Cantle report spoke in rather chilling terms of
&#147;parallel and polarised lives&#148;. He
said:</p><ul><a name="06101760000104"></a>&#147;Self-segregation
is an unacceptable basis for a harmonious
community&#148;.</ul><a name="06101760000088"></a>He
recommended that in all schools 25 per cent&#151;one
quarter&#151;of places should be available to other
faiths.<p><a name="06101760000054"></a>I point out that my
amendment relates only to new schools. It is too ambitious to try to
move legislation to change what is in fact the educational settlement
of our country. I hope that many existing faith schools will follow the
example of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth, but the
amendment specifically relates to new faith schools. There is a problem
and we should not add to
it.</p><p><a name="06101760000055"></a>In
parenthesis, the department should know much more about the existing
faith schools that have been created. I have taken an interest in this,
but although you can get a lot of information from the department's
website about selection criteria, the department does not seem to know
much about the schools. One new Muslim school told me that it had to
send in photographs of its children&#151;which is, of course,
illegal. The department should watch that much more carefully, not just
in the case of Muslim schools but of all schools. It was a BBC
programme that revealed that the curriculum in some faith schools was
being very marginally followed. In one of them, European history was
not being taught at
all.</p><p><a name="06101760000056"></a>I turn to
two groups who are very concerned about the amendment. First, there are
the Roman Catholics. The first point to recognise is that many Roman
Catholic schools today are inclusive. In secondary schools, 20 per cent
of pupils come from other faiths. The Catholic Church does not look on
that as a disadvantage or a curse but an opportunity to try to persuade
those children to take a greater interest in religion. I think that the
proportion in primary schools is about 17 per cent. Secondly, the
amendment affects only new schools. I do not believe that there are any
proposals to start any new Catholic secondary schools. Since 1997,
there have been only two new Catholic faith schools&#151;two primary
schools, one in Milton Keynes and one in Cornwall&#151;so the
Catholic Church has not made a great advance in establishing new 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_704"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 704</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>schools. I also point out the encouraging change of attitude that, for
example, allows one of the new faith academies in Liverpool to be both
Catholic and Anglican. That is very
welcome.</p><p><a name="06101760000057"></a>Perhaps
I can say something about the Muslims. I have a high regard for Islam;
I have read parts of the Koran. To describe the Islamic faith as purely
concerned with violence is a total and ridiculous parody. All religions
are capable of being distorted by their extremists. There have been six
exclusive Muslim schools since the Government introduced the provision
and they all have the purpose of creating total Muslim personalities
through the training of children's spirits, intelligence, feelings and
bodily senses. I have no particular quarrel with that, but that should
be done in the mosque. If that is the object of Christian, Hindu, Sikh
or Jewish schools, it should be done in the synagogue, the church or
the temple. I should have thought that one purpose of the British
education system is to try to create a British
personality.</p><p><a name="06101760000058"></a>The
argument that is put, which I can quite understand, is that there are
about 120 private Muslim schools, many of which provide pretty
deplorable education and would certainly benefit from state funding. I
see that the former Secretary of State for Education is nodding. I am
sure that that is right. But if there is a request for public funding,
it is entirely appropriate that the state should determine some
standards and conditions to be
met.</p><p><a name="06101760000059"></a>I say to the leaders of the
Muslim community who have influence in our
society&#151;</p><p><a name="06101760000060"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew116"></a><a name="06101760000133"></a>A

choice.</p><p><a name="06101760000062"></a>I say to the leaders of
the Muslim community: is it really wise to promote the proliferation of
exclusively Muslim schools in Muslim communities? Let us suppose that
four primary schools are set up quite quickly in a Muslim community, to
be followed by two or three secondary schools. Supported by their
mosques, that community will become very closed and inward-looking.
Children from outside will not be welcomed or, if they are welcome,
they will not want to go in. That strongly reinforces separateness in
our society.</p><p><a name="06101760000063"></a>One lesson that we
have learnt as a country from migration not only in this century but
over several centuries is that the migrant groups who settle most
successfully are those who mingle, mix and merge. There is no better
example of that than the Jewish community which came in during the 19th
and20th centuries. What we are debating is not just a matter
of what is taught about religion in schools; it is the shape of our
society in many towns and cities during the next 50 years. I would like
that shape not to be separate, divided, isolated, jealous and envious;
I would like it to be cohesive, harmonious, integrated, tolerant and
generous. I commend the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06101760000064"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew118"></a><a name="06101760000135"></a>Baroness

affection and respect, even though I fundamentally disagree with him on
most occasions. I also thank the Minister for listening and responding
to concerns. I have more questions to put to him this
evening.</p><p><a name="06101760000065"></a>My original amendment
on faith schools, which I tabled and to which I spoke in Committee,
proposed that no new faith schools should be created. In fact, I would
still prefer that to be the case. I realise, however, that some
compromise may be the way forward at this stage. That compromise should
be to have schools that are not exclusive, as I am still concerned
that, in the past eight years, nine out of10 attempts by faith
groups to gain control of schools have been successful. Some of those
results have been unfortunate, to say the least.</p><p><a name="06101760000066"></a>We have got ourselves into a tangle on
faith in schools, and we need to untangle the problem, not make it
worse. We should learn from what has happened in Northern Ireland. I am
also still concerned that the report on Bradford by the noble Lord,
Lord Ouseley,
observed,</p><ul><a name="06101760000110"></a>&#147;signs that
communities are fragmenting along racial, cultural and faith
lines&#148;.</ul><a name="06101760000089"></a>His report
goes on to
say:<ul><a name="06101760000105"></a>&#147;Segregation in
schools is one indicator of this trend ... There is virtual
apartheid in many secondary schools in the
district&#148;.</ul><a name="06101760000090"></a>The
amendment would at least partially address this issue if there was no
fudge on the 25 per cent. Rumours of government amendments along these
lines are welcome, but I hope that no such amendments give rise to
escape routes.
<p><a name="06101760000067"></a>Poll after poll of
parents and the general public consistently show that they want good
neighbourhood schools. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, described one such
school in a community that he knows, and there has been much talk this
evening about community cohesion in our discussion of other amendments.
According to one poll, 79 per cent feel that separating children
according to religious belief is wrong&#151;as wrong as separating
them according to colour or accent. Another poll found that 64 per cent
of people oppose government funding for faith schools, fearing their
impact on social cohesion.</p><p><a name="06101760000068"></a>One
interesting find is that women of Asian heritage have been vocal in
opposing the expansion of faith schools. One education and Asian
solidarity group felt
that,</p><ul><a name="06101760000111"></a>&#147;single faith
schools will mean more discrimination and ... a greater
stranglehold of the most conservative, anti-women ... individuals
over our children&#146;s education and our communities as a
whole&#148;.</ul><a name="06101760000091"></a>We
must not forget that dividing off children also divides off parents.
Parents meet in the playground, at social events or at parent-teacher
meetings. It is dangerous to divide them in such a way. We are really
talking about encouraging separate and isolated communities, as the
noble Lord, Lord Baker, said, with fewer windows on the world. I am a
governor at a school that is firmly set in a south-London community,
with many different faiths and backgrounds. The children learn to
celebrate each others&#146; cultures and to enjoy each others&#146;
ceremonies in their schools. So do the parents. This mix results in

pupils. Ethos and values need not, of course, come from having a
faith.<p><a name="06101760000069"></a>I
return to my reasons for hoping the amendment will be accepted. The
Government need to be firm and purposeful about tackling exclusivity in
schools, otherwise loopholes will be exploited and difficulties, real
or imagined, will be put in the way. I ask the Minister three questions
about issues that have potential loopholes. First, is it true that the
Association of Muslim Schools and the Christian Schools&#146; Trust
have asked for a faith-schools inspectorate to do the work presently
done by Ofsted? If so, will this be allowed? Such a scheme would negate
discussion of a wide range of values and beliefs. Surely education is
about exploring options and not about dictating what children should
think. Separate inspection systems would reinforce differences and
divisions.</p><h5><a name="06101760000118"></a>6.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06101760000070"></a>Secondly, if a faith school
under any 25 per cent ruling did not attract 25 per cent of pupils of
other faiths or of no faith, would it still be eligible for state
funding? I foresee all manner of reasons and excuses for failing to
recruit other faiths, thereby avoiding having to broaden the
educational offering. Thirdly, if an independent faith school wanted to
become a state school, would it be classed as a new school or would it
be able to carry on under the old rules allowing it not to include
other faiths in the intake?</p><p><a name="06101760000071"></a>This
is an important amendment, and I would be most grateful for the
Minister&#146;s clarification on these issues, and for any
reassurance he can give that the Government will support a 25 per cent
intake of other faiths or no faith into new faith schools. If not, I
fear that we will reinforce divisions in society rather than heal
them.</p><p><a name="06101760000072"></a>Amendment No. 104, in
my name and that of the noble Baronesses, Lady Turner and Lady Flather,
relates to collective worship and seeks re-examination of the law. The
spirit of the amendment has enormous support in seeking to replace
compulsory worship with assemblies of a spiritual nature in schools.
There is widespread dissatisfaction with this
law.</p><p><a name="06101760000073"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew119"></a><a name="06101760000136"></a>The

Massey of Darwen:</b> Yes there is, my Lords. Some 70
per cent of secondary schools do not comply with conducting an act of
worship in their schools. The amendment is supported by several
teaching organisations and by many faith groups. In a national
consultation held in 1998 on collective worship, many organisations,
including the Christian Education Movement, the Board of Deputies of
British Jews, the Professional Council for Religious Education, the
National Association of Head Teachers and the National Confederation of
Parent Teacher Associations all supported the spirit of the amendment.
I mention all this because, when the amendment came up in Committee,
the Minister said that the Government did not want to reopen the debate
on collective worship because there
was,</p><ul><a name="06101760000112"></a>&#147;a fairly broad
consensus within the educational and faith
communities&#148;&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/7/06; col.

indeed broad consensus in the educational and faith communities, but it
is in support not of the status quo but of reform. This consensus is
not surprising. Teachers support a change. As the general secretary of
the Association of School and College Leaders has
said:<ul><a name="06101760000106"></a>&#147;Compulsory
worship is a contradiction in terms. Ordering a student to worship is
like ordering them to enjoy
mathematics&#148;.</ul><a name="06101760000093"></a>Heads,
as he says,<ul><a name="06101760000113"></a>&#147;cannot
compel teachers to take religious services&#148;.</ul><a name="06101760000094"></a>Nor should they. The law on collective
worship, he
says,<ul><a name="06101760000114"></a>&#147;has long
passed its use-by
date&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101760000075"></a>The
professional bodies for RE support a change, of course, as their
subject is all about increasing understanding of the different beliefs
in our society and assisting young people to come to their own
conclusions about their own beliefs and values. The current requirement
for collective worship is an impediment to this. Faith groups and
organisations such as the British Humanist Association&#151;I declare
an interest as a member&#151;support a change.</p><p><a name="06101760000076"></a>We live in an
increasingly diverse society, with increasingly diverse schools and in
a context where most young people&#151;65 per cent, according to a
DfES assessment&#151;have non-religious beliefs. They all deserve
assemblies that recognise the ways in which they make meaning and
purpose in their lives and the values that they are developing.
Positive ethos and spirituality are not the province of religion alone.
Religion does not have exclusive rights to the grammar&#151;to use
the words of the right reverend Prelate&#151;of values.</p><p><a name="06101760000077"></a>The amendment would
straightforwardly replace the requirement to conduct collective worship
with a requirement to hold assemblies that will further
pupils&#146;,</p><ul><a name="06101760000115"></a>&#147;spiritual,
moral, social and cultural education&#148;.</ul><a name="06101760000095"></a>Teachers, including non-religious
teachers, can and do use assemblies to demonstrate that moral and
spiritual values can be framed on shared values found in different
religions and beliefs, building on the common ground of our humanity. A
reform in the law would encourage this good practice.
<p><a name="06101760000078"></a>If the law on worship and assemblies were
changed, new guidance issued under the new law would doubtless continue
to contribute to a better sharing of good practice in the provision of
inclusive and educational assemblies, quite unlike the current
requirement to provide collective
worship.</p><p><a name="06101760000079"></a>Inclusive assemblies,
which I conducted when I was a teacher, can have great educational
value. They can be based on literature, science, the arts, sport or
citizenship, for example. They can build a collective ethos in the
school either by bringing the school community together for shared
experiences or for pupils to conduct the assembly themselves.
Spiritual, moral, social and cultural development can be encouraged.
Surely this is what assemblies are
about.</p><p><a name="06101763000001"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew121"></a><a name="06101763000066"></a>Lord

asked me about studying economics, and I said I thought that in the
present world climate, theology would probably be her best option.
Without an understanding of theology today, how are we to understand
the great issues that affect our world? Anyone who tries to undermine
the teaching of religion in schools would be making a huge error,
because there has been an increasing demand for religious education in
our
schools.</p><p><a name="06101763000002"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew122"></a><a name="06101763000067"></a>Baroness

Alton of Liverpool:</b> My Lords, before the noble
Baroness touched on that point, she mentioned what she described as the
vested interests that RE teachers might have and it seemed to me that
she was diminishing the importance of the role of religious education.
I am happy to hear her
clarification.</p><p><a name="06101763000004"></a>I want to speak
those amendments in the group which seek to impose a mandatory quota on
new faith schools and dilute their ethos by altering the arrangements
for collective acts of worship. I understand the sincere motives that
lie behind these amendments and the anxieties that the noble Lord, Lord
Baker, has expressed today, and the need for diversity and integration.
Coming, as I do, from a city such as Liverpool where there was great
sectarianism in the past, I agree with him, and have been very much
part of the move in that city to encourage ecumenism and
inter-denominational relationships. These have come about as a result
of a voluntary relationship, not of
legislation.</p><p><a name="06101763000005"></a>The
amendments do not seek to address the fundamental causes of
segregation, a point that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley,
made very eloquently on Radio 4 a couple of days ago, but they risk
undermining some of our country&#146;s most successful
schools.</p><p><a name="06101763000006"></a>Over the years, I have
regularly heard, as we have in these debates, calls for the complete
closure of Church schools. Although I know that the noble Lord, Lord
Baker, does not share that view, there are Members of your Lordships'
House who believe that. I think that in some ways it would be more
straightforward to test that proposition in a Division rather than
promote a &#147;thin end of the wedge&#148; amendment which will
gradually emasculate Church schools. The Government, and others, offer
a magician&#146;s bargain: they say that if we go along with the
amendment on new faith schools, they will not touch existing
ones&#151;not for now, at any rate. But in a country where, in the
past few days, a British Airways worker has been banned from wearing a
cross on a necklace, the Minister would be surprised if people of
religious faith were not anxious about the new intolerance that has
been gathering a head of
steam.</p><p><a name="06101763000007"></a>We should be clear that
Amendment No. 16 would significantly diminish the rights of governing
bodies of faith schools to establish their own admission criteria, a
right which was won in 1944, as the noble Lord, Lord Baker,
mentioned.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_709"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 709</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101763000008"></a>Rather than resisting this punitive
measure outright, the Government are now, we are told, considering
handing over decisions to local authorities. In certain parts of the
country, this will then become a political football, and faith schools
will find themselves at the centre of controversy and division. There
will be little consistency in outcome and it will doubtless lead to new
postal code lotteries. Families who are able to will move to more
benign districts. Paradoxically, the poorest will once again be the
losers.</p><p><a name="06101763000009"></a>In introducing the
Bill, the Government made much of their desire, which I supported on
Second Reading, to enhance the autonomy of schools, their trust in
governing bodies and teachers, and the enhancement of parental choice.
By interfering with something as central as admissions and taking that
power away from schools, they are building an inherent contradiction
into the legislation. Do we really have so little trust in governing
bodies that, having proper regard to local circumstances, we think they
are incapable of seeing the importance of social
cohesion?</p><p><a name="06101763000010"></a>Ten per cent of this
country&#146;s schools are Catholic. There are 1,723 Catholic primary
schools and 352 Catholic secondary schools. In addition, there are 17
Catholic sixth-form colleges and 156 Catholic schools in the
independent sector. Those schools were established only because of the
generosity and sacrifice of previous generations of Catholics, many of
whom were from poor immigrant communities. My own mother, an Irish
speaker from the west of Ireland, was typical of those people who gave
generously to collections every week to establish parish schools in
inner-city areas. Even today, in addition to many other forms of
support, parishes contribute around &#163;20 million a year towards
capital costs.</p><p><a name="06101763000011"></a>The achievements
of these schools are significant: 42 per cent of Catholic schools have
high value-added status and above average point scores. According to
Ofsted&#146;s figures, that compares with the national average of 30
per cent for other schools. A fifth of the top performing comprehensive
schools at A-level are Catholic and Ofsted says that they provide
better value for money than other schools.</p><p><a name="06101763000012"></a>Many of those schools have waiting lists
of families from Catholic parishes. The logic of the amendment, if it
were applied to all schools or even just to new ones, is that even
where they had helped raise funds to build a new school and were keen
members of the Catholic parish, they would be denied a place at the
local school. Think of the resentment that that could engender. Far
from encouraging community cohesion and integration, we will have sown
the seeds of division.</p><p><a name="06101763000013"></a>The Leeds
Association of Catholic Head Teachers said in a letter this
week:</p><ul><a name="06101763000057"></a>&#147;The introduction
of quotas would have an adverse effect on the social and ethnic
diversity of our schools as the restriction of places for Catholics
would, in some instances, result in children from
&#145;poorer&#146; backgrounds being access to Catholic
education&#148;.</ul>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_710"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 710</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06101763000052"></a>It is a classic example of the law of
unintended consequences. Why are we contemplating doing this? It is for
the worst reasons of social engineering.
<p><a name="06101763000014"></a>The issue of Islamic schools is
constantly raised to justify amendments like these. If we introduce
over-exacting and hostile measures, those schools will simply be
established in the independent sector. That point was very eloquently
made by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, and I agreed with him. There will
be no ability there to influence things such as admissions criteria.
Secondly, in the present climate, I find it hard to believe that a
Muslim school will be able to fill the 25 per cent quota with
non-Muslim children. This measure will have an adverse effect in
dealing with the perceived problem and will simultaneously antagonise a
sector which has an exemplary record. That is not a good example of
well thought through public
policy.</p><p><a name="06101763000015"></a>In the
long term, Catholic schools will be the most adversely affected by this
approach. Such a measure is wholly unjustified. Without the imposition
of externally imposed criteria, the Catholic sector has been making a
huge contribution to the development of communal co-existence and
responsible citizenship. Without external interference or mandatory
measures, it already has significant diversity. Some 18.2 per cent of
itspupils are drawn from ethnic minorities, compared with 16.7
per cent in the state sector.</p><p><a name="06101763000016"></a>Trevor Phillips has been quoted. The
chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality
says,</p><ul><a name="06101763000061"></a>&#147;when we look at
the ethnic mix of schools, Catholic schools tend to be far more mixed
than local authority
schools&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101763000017"></a>I was also
struck when the noble Lord, Lord Baker, referred to the situation in
Northern Ireland. He will have received a letter earlier this week from
Anthony Spencer, director of the Pastoral Research Centre. He was the
adviser on integrated education in Northern Ireland to the Government
of which the noble Lord was a member. In 1984, he founded the Belfast
Charitable Trust for Integrated Education, of which I have been a
patron. Like him, I believe that in the sectarian circumstances of
Northern Ireland, schools such as Hazelwood and Lagan College are very
helpful initiatives.</p><h5><a name="06101763000064"></a>7
pm</h5><p><a name="06101763000018"></a>It is often forgotten that
those initiatives were not secular ones; those are inter-denominational
Christian schools. No compulsion was involved and no quotas invoked. In
opposing the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Baker, Mr Spencer
says:</p><ul><a name="06101763000058"></a>&#147;The situation in
England has been and remains quite different. The lesson of integration
in Northern Ireland is that it must be voluntary. It should be
supported not
imposed&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101763000019"></a>I know from
personal experience of my own children&#146;s schools that admissions
there include significant numbers from other and no faith backgrounds,
without outside interference or anyone telling them to do it.</p><p><a name="06101763000020"></a>The recent report
<I>Quality and Performance:A Survey of Education in Catholic
Schools</I> convincingly demolishes many of the old hoary arguments
endlessly deployed against church schools. The survey reveals that
Catholic schools are socially and ethnically mixed, and may have large
numbers of pupils who are not 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_711"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 711</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Catholic. The high standards reported by Ofsted are not confined to the
academic but also encompass positive attitudes, good behaviour, respect
for others and excellence in personal development. The survey noted the
high degree of parental involvement in those schools and support for
children&#146;s learning; it also highlighted good
governance.</p><p><a name="06101763000021"></a>If there is an
issue to address about whether schools with a religious character are
not promoting proper respect for our democratic institutions, pluralism
and way of life, let them be subject to inspection and let Ofsted
report accordingly. I strongly support the earlier remarks made in that
context by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth and
note, in passing, that my own children&#146;s Catholic school
produced more Victoria Crosses than any other school in Britain, which
hardly denotes a lack of commitment to our country and its
ideals.</p><p><a name="06101763000022"></a>Transparency and
scrutiny about how schools contribute to community cohesion is not an
issue which faith schools will fear, if they are true to their ethos. I
note that the Catholic Education Service has made clear its support for
a requirement to report on issues such as how inter-faith dialogue is
experienced in a school, how other people&#146;s traditions are
explained and respected and how community service is promoted. I would
support an amendment to do that in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06101763000023"></a>Ten years ago, on
behalf of Liverpool John Moores University, I established a good
citizenship award scheme. It operates in nearly 1,000 schools on
Merseyside and in other parts of north-west England. In parenthesis, I
declare the chair I hold at that university. Time and again, children
from church schools have received our awards for the contribution that
they make to community life. Last month, 12 children from one of our
schools, the Sacred Heart in Crosby, received from Cherie Booth,
QC&#151;one of their alumni&#151;awards for the work they have done
befriending asylum-seekers. Another young recipient, Francesca
D&#146;Arcy of St Edward&#146;s College, had raised a staggering
&#163;100,000 for local hospices. Students and schools like those
need no lectures from us about social responsibility.</p><p><a name="06101763000024"></a>These amendments,
including government Amendment No. 79, also introduce opt-outs from
religious worship, for those in sixth forms, and from religious
education. Catholic schools were established primarily to educate
children of the Catholic faith, to form them as Catholics and to
provide them with a well-rounded education. They encourage pupils to
see all men and women as made in the image of God, and therefore of
infinite worth and value. They allow the cultivation of religious and
spiritual needs. Plenty of alternatives exist if parents do not want
those values for their children. That there are often waiting lists
demonstrates that what we have now is what parents want.</p><p><a name="06101763000025"></a>The Government regularly lecture parents,
including those of 16 to 18 year-olds, to be mindful of disciplinary
and developmental issues at school which affect their children. Now,
parents are to be told that this core activity, central to the identity
of their child&#146;s school, will be determined by peer group
pressure and argument. By incorporating a divisive opt-out into

school&#146;s mission and life.</p><p><a name="06101763000026"></a>I entirely agree with John Vaughan-Shaw
ofSt Edmund&#146;s College, Ware, when he states in a letter
to your Lordships
that,</p><ul><a name="06101763000062"></a>&#147;to present
worship as an optional extra contradicts the mission of a Catholic
school and will inevitably threaten its existence&#148;.</ul><a name="06101763000053"></a>What effect will it have on younger
pupils to see those they look up to opting out? Everyone knows that the
pressures of the pack and the voices of the most dominant will often
prevail. It is quite hard enough for young people to hold onto their
religious beliefs without being set up against another group who have
no belief. That is divisive and disruptive.
<p><a name="06101763000027"></a>A few days ago, I attended an act of
worship in my children&#146;s school at which the sixth form were
present along with the rest. It was led by a visiting priest from
Zimbabwe who, in a deeply moving and inspiring address, described the
depredations of the Mugabe regime and the role of the church in
standing up for the rights of the oppressed. If that had been an
optional extra, I wonder how many would have attended and what those
who had opted out would have missed.</p><p><a name="06101763000028"></a>Worship is part of the web and weave of
the Catholic tradition; everyone who opts into Catholic schools knows
this. In his memorable book<I>The Abolition of Man</I>, C.S.
Lewis wrote excoriating those who seek to eliminate the teaching of
religious belief. He said that educators had become mere conditioners,
and that,</p><ul><a name="06101763000063"></a>&#147;in a sort
of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function. We
make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We
laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We
castrate, and bid the gelding be
fruitful.&#148;</ul><a name="06101763000054"></a>These
schools being attacked offer an antidote to the conditioners. We should
celebrate their achievement and
worth.<p><a name="06101763000029"></a>To conclude, these
amendments encourage noble Lords to fight the wrong battle in the wrong
ditch. On Sunday, the <I>Sunday Times</I> reported that at least one
million children in England receive second-rate education in poorly
performing state schools. A report in London&#146;s <I>Evening
Standard </I>said that English is a second language in half of
London&#146;s schools. We should be tackling those issues along with
the low morale in the teaching profession and the pockets of poverty
and deprivation which genuinely threaten social cohesion, not
undermining high-achieving faith schools whose exemplary record is one
of our country&#146;s success stories.</p><p><a name="06101763000030"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew124"></a><a name="06101763000069"></a>Lord

been in no way their parents&#146; choice. In the present state of
community relations, I am not sure that that will help in any way at
all.</p><p><a name="06101763000032"></a>So far as Catholic schools
are concerned, I am not a Catholic, but Catholic parents would have
every reason to complain if their children were denied the opportunity
to go to the local Catholic school by making room for the children of
parents who are not members of that church. A great injustice would be
done, in the hope that some unquantifiable benefit would accrue to
society as a whole. That is the worst sort of social
engineering.</p><p><a name="06101763000033"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew125"></a><a name="06101763000070"></a>Lord
Skidelsky:</b> My Lords, I want to support Amendment
No. 16, to which I have appended my name. Therefore I do not agree with
the arguments of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth
or, indeed, those of my noble friend Lord Alton. The character of the
problem with which this amendment tries to deal is very different from
that which was put forward in their eloquent speeches. The right
reverend Prelate speaks as a representative of a long-established
national church and the noble Lord, Lord Alton, also speaks for one of
this country&#146;s long-established religious communities. This
amendment tries to grapple with the problem of how to succeed in the
ambitious project of creating a new basis for national life in large
areas of the country, particularly urban areas. Therefore, one cannot
deal with it or think of it in the same relaxed way as those
opponents.</p><p><a name="06101763000034"></a>In
view of the ambition that we have, it cannot be right to allow
exclusive faith schools to be set up funded by the public purse. That
is a very important point. If funding is private and these are private
schools, I agree that the Government have no interest in the matter. In
those cases, schools have an absolute right to their own admissions
policy, but this is part of national policy. We are trying to integrate
new communities into the life of this country. They are much more
ethnically and religiously diverse and are much newer than the
communities that noble Lords who oppose this amendment spoke
about.</p><p><a name="06101763000035"></a>I argue that once you get
into thinking about this as national policy, we have examples which
involve compulsion. How was the United States created? It had a
national policy of school integration in order to create Americans. I
am not saying that we should do that, but the US faced that problem and
that was how it coped with it. On the whole, over the years it has been
immensely successful. Religious communities have survived and have not

policies of these schools, which is very reasonable. The balance in
this amendment is exactly right, which is why I support

Taverne:</b> My Lords, I have put my name to the
amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, who spoke to it in a
most delightful and eloquent manner. I also wish to support the
amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey. Unfortunately, I
do not give quite the same reasons for supporting the amendment as have
been so far advanced. I support it because I regard it as an exercise
in damage limitation. I take the completely opposite view on what
education should do from that of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and I am
sorry to differ from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Portsmouth.</p><p><a name="06101763000038"></a>Let me explain why
I think that it is wrong in principle to teach religion in schools. I
start with the proposition that part of the history of civilisation has
been the gradual erosion of superstition by reason and the development
of respect for evidence. I believe that it should be one of the primary
aims of education to teach regard for evidence, to teach children to
ask questions and not to accept authority uncritically. In fact, they
should learn some idea of how science works, how nature works and how
to use their intelligence to find out about the world. I recognise that
there are many scientists who are Christians and, because Islam is
under fire, I direct my remarks principally at the teaching of the
Christian religion.</p><h5><a name="06101763000065"></a>7.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06101763000039"></a>I argue that teaching any
kind of religious belief depends on authority and undermines regard for
evidence, and is in opposition to what a good education should provide.
People may be religious because they believe in a vague numinous
presence in the universe, although most Christians believe in a
personal god who can physically intervene in this world, which is what
faith schools teach. They teach children to pray. If praying for the
welfare of others is a ritualistic way of encouraging concern for
others, which also makes the person who prays feel better, well and
good. I love the language of many traditional prayers. However,
children are taught to pray on the assumption that their prayers may be
answered and that the object of their prayers may recover from illness
or some other misfortune through a god&#146;s personal response.
Indeed, double-blind experiments have been done at considerable expense
to see if patients in hospital who are prayed for recover faster than
those who are not prayed for and&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;it
was found that prayers had no
effect.</p><p><a name="06101763000040"></a>A belief in the efficacy
of prayer as a possible cure for diseases is essentially a return to
medieval superstition, when it was seen as the only hope of a cure for
various illnesses. You prayed to a particular saint for a particular
disease. You would pray toSt Lucy, for example, who was very
beautiful and, according to one legend, avoided the lustful glances of
men by plucking out her eyes, and that made her the patron saint for
eye diseases.</p>

is claimed, performed miracles. Catholic saints qualify as saints
because they perform miracles. The resurrection is a miracle, and how
can the doctrine of the physical assumption of the Virgin Mary into
heaven be reconciled with the laws of nature? Miracles are, by
definition, events in which the laws of nature have been suspended.
Teaching people to believe in miracles is teaching them to ignore
evidence and to believe in the supernatural. No wonder so many
Christians reject the fact that animals and plants have evolved over
many millions of years and turn to intelligent design or creationism to
explain the world. A recent poll showed that 30 per cent of sixth
formers in British schools do not understand evolution. If you are
encouraged to believe in miracles, you can believe anything, including
creationism.</p><p><a name="06101763000042"></a>Roman Catholics
are taught that the Pope is infallible, just as in Galilean times when
the authority of the church overruled evidence. It is hardly rational
to treat the authority of the Pope as infallible when he can change his
mind and pronounce his predecessors wrong. Before 1861, as the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford has pointed out, the infallible
doctrine of the Pope held that the soul only entered the embryo 40 days
after conception in the case of the male foetus and 60 days after in
the case of the female foetus. Since then, Popes have decreed that all
abortion is murder because it has now been decreed that the soul enters
the embryo at the moment of conception. Even today the Pope can change
the official doctrine taught to Catholics because it seems that they
may have been wrong to believe that babies who died before they were
baptised go to limbo. Catholics may profess to argue on scientific
grounds that stem cells from adults are more likely to cure certain
diseases than embryonic stem cells, but their views are not decided by
evidence&#151;they are decided by the Pope&#146;s current decree
that the destruction of a human blastocyst is murder.</p><p><a name="06101763000043"></a>I do not object to children being taught
about various religions because they are part of our cultural heritage,
art, literature and music. I also accept that religion gives great
comfort to many people and that many moral teachings of the churches
are admirable. I accept the great contribution that churches and
religious groups make to the community. I regard the sermon on the
mount as a wonderful moral text which everyone should know about, but
you do not have to believe in a god to teach
morality.</p><p><a name="06101763000044"></a>Let us not, however,
forget the harm that religion does. It is religion&#151;the teachings
of the American evangelicals, the Pope and Islam&#151;that prevents
UN agencies distributing condoms in Africa and thereby condemns
countless Africans to death from AIDS, which I regard as a crime
against humanity. It is religion that has led to the poor education of
women in the world at large. It has also led to the decline and
international support for family planning, which, as I shall argue in a
debate tomorrow, is a vital part of any effective policy to reduce
poverty. As my favourite Latin poet Lucretius put it a long time
ago:</p><ul><a name="06101763000059"></a>&#147;Tantum religio
potuit suadere malorum&#148;.</ul>

days. Nearly a century ago when it was still in vogue, the
Conservatives pretended to understand even if they did not and the
Labour Benches pretended not to understand even if they did. It means,
&#147;Such crime did religion inflict upon the
world&#148;. <p><a name="06101763000045"></a>We should keep
religion out of the classroom, as the Americans do. In this they are
wise. Unfortunately they make up for that by letting religion interfere
in their politics. On the whole the tradition in our politics has been,
in the words of Alastair Campbell, that &#147;we don&#146;t do
God&#148;. It is a sad fact that through the promotion of faith
schools, the Government are now undermining that
tradition.</p><p><a name="06101763000046"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew127"></a><a name="06101763000072"></a>Baroness
Richardson of Calow:</b> My Lords, I am making a
great effort not to be tempted to defend the Christian Church. I shall
speak briefly from the viewpoint of the Methodist Church, which is not
a big player in education in this country nationally, although we have
a significant number of independent schools, of which I am chair of the
board of management, and a growing number of state-maintained schools
that are of Methodist foundation, some of them jointly with the Church
of England. I have to say that on the whole the Methodist Church
believes that Methodist foundation schools are a gift to society and
exercise an open-access policy, do not have a quota system of any sort
and would resist it strongly. If this amendment were to be passed, it
would create grave difficulties for a Methodist foundation school,
which would have to start asking about the professed religious
allegiance of parents and create a bureaucratic administrative process
which would be very difficult.</p><p><a name="06101763000047"></a>I
agree entirely and enthusiastically with the intention behind the
amendment, but it just would not work&#151;I cannot see how it would.
All of us are familiar with the lengths to which parents will go in
order to get their children into the school of their choice, moving
house and making all sorts of arrangements. When I was a minister in
the circuit, I noted a number of people who suddenly discovered a
profound religious faith about six months before the selection process
began to take place and lost it like mist in the morning sunshine soon
afterwards. Yet many parents see schools of a religious foundation as
institutions of excellence with a strong emphasis on justice and
discipline in the way they are run. They choose these schools on
educational grounds and on many occasions pretend to have a faith in
order to get their children into school. If this amendment were passed,
it is interesting to speculate whether it would work the other way
around. Would faithful people suddenly lose their faith in order to get
a place within the 25 per cent allotted to
them?</p><p><a name="06101763000048"></a>I know
that the policy in Church of England schools means that parents from
other Christian denominations have done rather well. If they can prove
that they are members of a church which is in communion with the Church
of England through Churches Together in England, they are often
successful in gaining a place. Would that be forbidden under this
amendment? Would those who are not members of the Church of England be
regarded as &#147;other religious denominations&#148; along 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_717"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 717</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with the other religious faiths? I cannot see how this quota system
could be fair and workable in any way at all. However, I would support
encouragement given to all our faith schools to have open access and,
with their strong foundations in the community, to have something to
offer the educational principle&#151;which I entirely and utterly
believe to be the case. Strong encouragement should be given to
providing wider access for people of all faiths and for those who
profess no faith, but for whom the Christian faith is in any case
dedicated to encourage in faith; to be a missionary opportunity, if you
like. In this Bill and by any other means I would very much like to see
faith taken seriously as an offering to society, but certainly not
imposed by a quota
system.</p><p><a name="06101763000049"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew128"></a><a name="06101763000073"></a>The
Earl of Onslow:</b> My Lords, my noble friend Lord
Baker&#146;s plea for inclusion was very heartfelt and immensely
important. On the defeat of Abd-er-Rahman by Charles Martel outside
Poitiers in 732, the great Edward Gibbon
wrote:</p><ul><a name="06101763000060"></a>&#147;And the Arabian
fleet might have sailed without a naval conflict into the mouth of the
Thames. Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in
the schools of Oxford and her pulpits might demonstrate to a
circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the Revelation of
Mohammed&#148;.</ul><a name="06101763000056"></a>It
looks as if we are getting to that state now. As has been pointed out,
Church of England schools are part of the ancient fabric of England and
society as a whole. All other faith schools, be they Roman Catholic,
Jewish or now Mohammedan, want to withdraw to an exclusivity for
themselves. It is that exclusivity which is dangerous. On Sunday I
heard a discussion on the wireless in which an Orthodox Jewish lady
said quite deliberately, &#147;We want our people to come to these
schools so that they do not marry out&#148;. These are habits of
exclusion.<p><a name="06101763000050"></a>All I now want to
do is to speak on a point that has been touched on already. Let us
assume for the sake of argument that there is a Muslim school in an
area which encourages all its girls to wear veils. Let us also remember
that the Prophet Mohammed had two Christian wives and one Jewish wife,
and said nothing about the veil whatsoever. It came about at the time
of the Abbassid Caliphate when there was an outbreak of immorality and
all women were forced to wear the veil. Equally let us remember that
Kemal Ataturk said of the veil that any woman wearing one would be
considered a prostitute. The number of veils whipped off faces of women
in Constantinople the next morning was quite enormous.</p><p><a name="06101763000051"></a>There is an element of
exclusion about this. It is a dangerous exclusion that will drive
people inwards into ghetto-like communities, and therefore my noble
friend Lord Baker must be supported because his amendment goes some way
towards offsetting the damage which new faith schools are, in my
belief, liable to cause. I cannot think that non-Muslim people from the
leafy suburbs are going to rush to buy a house close to a school where
their 13 year-old girls will wear the veil, so it is going to be
extremely difficult to make up the quota. I see a terrible danger of
exclusivity and people huddling in their own masses. That is what
worries me and that is what we have got ourselves in a muddle over in
wanting new faith
schools.</p>

Tombs:</b> My Lords, first, I want to associate
myself with the remarks made by my noble friend Lord Alton, who stole
most of my points and made them much more eloquently than I could have
done, so I am grateful to him. Since I am not going to repeat them, I
am sure that noble Lords will be grateful
too.</p><p><a name="06101773000002"></a>Why do we want a quota?
Many Church schools welcome those of any other faith or none. The point
has been made that in Roman Catholic schools in this country&#151;the
second largest faith in terms of schooling&#151;30 per cent of pupils
are not Roman Catholic. They also have a battery of arrangements with
other schools, exchanging and doing things together. The Secretary of
State made the point the other day that the Roman Catholic Church is
one of the most outward-looking faiths in the country and the one most
associated with social
cohesion.</p><p><a name="06101773000003"></a>If the aim is to
address a fractured society&#151;I think that is what underlies the
discussion&#151;this is not the best way to do it. To interfere in
state schools that are already outward looking is treading on eggs in
hobnail boots. There are genuine feelings involved; there are genuine
people doing very good things. A bull in a china shop is a poor simile.
National and local government share the bulk of the responsibilities
for our fractured society. Immigration and housing policies are two
good examples of the way in which separate sects, separate groups and
separate ghettoes have grown up, and they have infinitely more leverage
than schools. That is where we should be putting our
attention.</p><p><a name="06101773000004"></a>All
faith schools&#151;or certainly the Christian faith
schools&#151;teach comparative religions; there is no isolation and
no direct indoctrination of any kind. But quotas are blunt tools; they
are national figures which do not take proper account of what is
essentially a local issue. They do not take account of catchment
areas&#151;most pupils go to school in their catchment areas; they do
not take account of geography; of social and economic
conditions&#151;wealth versus poor, high unemployment versus low
unemployment. A blunt tool of that kind cannot, and should not, work.
The risk is that we may alienate yet other groups in the community. I
oppose the amendment. It is well intentioned but far too mechanistic to
work.</p><p><a name="06101773000005"></a>Finally, on a personal
note, I have been distressed to hear so much anti-religious talk
tonight. There is a great deal of it in the country, I know. I do not
object to atheists being atheists&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Taverne,
is welcome to his beliefs as far as I am concerned&#151;and I would
like to experience a similar tolerance from the Liberal Democrat

important differences from them.</p><p><a name="06101773000007"></a>The basic point is that Church of England

neighbourhoods in which we are set. Ever since we began in the 19th
century, Church of England schools have been serving some of the most
disadvantaged and deprived areas in this land. That is a part of the
responsibility that we have for the wellbeing of our society. That is
why Church of England schools are still so important, not least for the
reasons that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, and the noble Lord, Lord
Dearing, talked about earlier of social cohesion, community cohesion
and community renewal. Let me underline that none of us will have
anything to do with reinforcing any of the divisions in our society; we
are at one with the noble Lord, Lord Baker, and the noble Baroness,
Lady Massey, in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06101773000008"></a>That is why, too, it is
right for the Church of England to commit itself so that at least 25
per cent of the places in any new schools will be available on the
basis of local priority rather than on faith priority. That means that
at least 25 per cent will be made available to people from the local
neighbourhood&#151;and I underline &#147;at
least&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101773000009"></a>In reality, all
the church schools that I have had to do with in Bradford, in south
London and now in the north-east of England have been local community
schools. They have been distinctively Christian but they have been
totally inclusive. That applies whether we are talking about first
schools, primary schools, middle schools, upper schools or secondary
schools. Frankly, I do not recognise Church of England schools in the
way that faith schools are often talked about in the current
debate.</p><p><a name="06101773000010"></a>Let me tell your
Lordships about one school in particular in the city of Newcastle. It
is a Church of England secondary school, the only one that the Church
of England has. Four years ago, the local authority was at the end of
its tether. It had two Church secondary schools which were known
as&#151;I hate the description&#151;&#147;failed&#148; schools.
As a last resort, the authority asked the Church of England to combine
the two schools into one and to take them over as a new Church of
England school, albeit on one of the existing sites. Three years on,
although we are not out of the wood by a long way, that school is now
flourishing. Although the examination results do not necessarily say
so, the value added to the lives of its young people over the past
three years has been quite immense. I believe that it is highly
significant that in the first year we began there were five young
people in the sixth form; this year there are 90 and next year there
will be even more.</p><p><a name="06101773000011"></a>It is
essentially about that school building confidence, self-esteem and
aspiration in the lives of young people who have precious little from
their home backgrounds. It is the care, nurturing and development of
our children and young people educationally and socially&#151;and, I
would say, emotionally and spiritually&#151;that matters above all
else. I believe that Church of England schools&#151;and, indeed,
Church and faith schools in general which are open and
inclusive&#151;offering both the best kind of care and the best
quality of education that we can, together with, yes, daily worship and

the noble Lord, Lord Alton, gave me and content myself by saying that I
support Amendment No. 16.</p><p><a name="06101773000013"></a>The
question I asked myself as I listened to the House today is: why do we
have to have single faith schools? Why is the whole idea of a single
faith school so important? Has Northern Ireland not shown that it does
not work? It creates fear and allows some people within that community
to use that fear. We have seen that in Northern Ireland. As many noble
Lords know, Northern Ireland remains a very segregated place, and all
the out-workings of that we all know only too well. But, as the noble
Lord, Lord Baker, said, this is changing with the growth of integrated
education. This is not about interfering with religion in schools. As I
read the amendment, it is about trying to put a balance into the
schools. There is no doubt that when a school has one single faith, it
becomes a very closed
community.</p><p><a name="06101773000014"></a>The world today is a
much smaller place than it was when I was a child&#151;or maybe it
just seems that way&#151;but I passionately believe that children
will learn from each others&#146; faiths and cultures through
allowing this to begin in the formative years at school. We must
endeavour to let children learn and celebrate each others&#146;
cultures and faiths instead of fearing what they do not
understand.</p><p><a name="06101773000015"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew132"></a><a name="06101773000056"></a>Baroness

am encouraged in that by a conversation with a knowledgeable,
thoughtful, Muslim friend of mine, who is a newsagent in my home town.
He has two daughters, one of whom is a qualified doctor and the other
is studying to be a doctor. His experience of local education at home
leads him to think that the amendment would be a good idea provided
that it applies to all schools. That is a very important point to make.
If we are to pass a provision like this to solve the problem, it must
apply to all schools and to new schools in the future. I think the
noble Lord, Lord Alton, sees that point, although it presents a problem
which I deeply understand from his speech and from my own knowledge of
Roman Catholic schools.</p><p><a name="06101773000017"></a>Faith
schools have a great deal going for them. The ethos of a school, the
atmosphere&#151;what people call the hidden curriculum of a
school&#151;is usually very strong in a faith school. My experience
of Roman Catholic schools is that it is very strong there. You can tell
the ethos the minute you go into a
school.</p><p><a name="06101773000018"></a>I really do not believe

conflict. Jack Straw, in his quiet, tactful way, was wise to raise a
big subject, as he did. I am not quite so sure about the Roman Catholic

that.</p><p><a name="06101773000019"></a>What school should

recent book, <I>The Great Transformation</I>. Tracing the development
of the great religions of the world from their origins in 1600 to 900
BC, she shows how from the beginning and today those religions at heart
embody a shared purpose. All seek to promote sympathy and understanding
between people. She makes one wonder if that is what our faith leaders
must remember as we proceed into the future with our policies. In the
conclusion, the author
writes:</p><ul><a name="06101773000044"></a>&#147;There can be no
simple answers. We must learn to see things from other people&#146;s
point of view. If religion is to bring light to our broken world we

inclusive society. No one has preached the cause of exclusion, nor
would I expect that in this place. The question is one of ways and
means and how we capture that in our education
system.</p><p><a name="06101773000022"></a>To
make one point in passing, I think there has been a confusion in the
debate between religious worship and religious education in schools.
Government Amendment No. 79 gets it just about right on religious
worship. In relation to religious education, I would resist any attempt
to diminish its place in schools. Indeed, if our political leaders on
both sides of the Atlantic knew more about religion&#151;the Islamic
religion and the Christian religion and the way in which extremes can
show themselves in those religions&#151;we would be in a better
position now than we are in all sorts of other contexts.</p>

remark by David Hume, which I have quoted before in this place. He
said:</p><ul><a name="06101773000045"></a>&#147;Whereas the
mistakes in philosophy are merely
ridiculous&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06101773000041"></a>I

in religion are
dangerous&#148;.</ul><a name="06101773000042"></a>I think
we all agree to that, because we know that whatever form of religion we
espouse or reject, there are dangerous extreme forms. The question is
how we ensure that our school system is moving in the right direction.
That is all we will do in this Bill; we will not change the situation
radically forever, but we can move it continually in the right
direction.<h5><a name="06101773000052"></a>7.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06101773000024"></a>I do not support the notion
of quotas, as I do not think that they would work. The reasons for that
have been given; I would repeat them but it is too late. However, I
propose an alternative way in which to attempt to deal with the issue
and the dangers of religion and what will be initially schools that
recruit from a particular religious community&#151;and I look to the
Anglican example here. It is to use our inspection system thoroughly
and radically and for Ministers to back up the judgments that will come
from that inspection
system.</p><p><a name="06101773000025"></a>Ofsted has the
responsibility to report on the ethos of a school. These issues are all
partly to do with the ethos of a school and the direction in which it
moves. It has to report on the social, moral, spiritual and cultural
education provided for pupils in schools. Again, all these are
fundamental to the direction in which we should be moving. Of course
now we have citizenship taught in schools. All that comes within these
three bands. If instructions to inspectors were strengthened and made
more precise so that these areas were inspected clearly and certainly
in the case of all faith schools, with a punctiliousness that we would
all benefit from, I would look to Ministers to be willing to support
the tough judgments that will come up in some places and act on them.
There will be tough judgments to make and Ministers will have to stand
firm against a press campaign and a community campaign&#151;and that
applies to Christian schools as well as Muslim schools and Jewish
schools. An amendment could be brought forward at Third Reading, if
that were thought to be
worthwhile.</p><p><a name="06101773000026"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew134"></a><a name="06101773000058"></a>Baroness
Turner of Camden:</b> My Lords, I would like to speak
to Amendment No. 79, because I have a series of amendments to that
government amendment. It looks complicated, but it is not as
complicated as it would appear. Amendment No. 79 is to be moved by my
noble friend Lord Adonis and concerns the right of sixth-form pupils to
be excused attendance at religious
worship.</p><p><a name="06101773000027"></a>Currently only parents
can withdraw pupils from collective worship and religious education
through the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Following his
undertaking in Committee, my noble friend tabled a government amendment
to allow sixth-formers to withdraw from collective worship. 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_723"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 723</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The Joint Committee on Human Rights issued a report on 13 October noting
that human rights incompatibility would be reduced if older pupils were
permitted to withdraw themselves from collective worship and religious
education, and the criterion for ability to withdraw should be their
competence to make such a
decision.</p><p><a name="06101773000028"></a>The differences
between my amendment and that of my noble friend are as follows. In my
noble friend&#146;s, qualifying pupils can take advantage only of
part of the statutory withdrawal rights enjoyed by the parents. The
amendment does not extend withdrawal to religious education for
competent pupils as the law already does for parents and the JCHR
suggests that it should. Why should a 15 year-old who is mature enough
to have the pill or an abortion without parental knowledge not be
capable of deciding whether she wants to pray or attend religious
education in her state school until she is well over 16 under the
government amendment?</p><p><a name="06101773000029"></a>If the
withdrawal from religious education is exercisable by parents, why
should it not be for parents considered adults for human rights
purposes? Is there a reason why religious education withdrawal should
be withheld? We do not think so. Even for schools with a religious
ethos, some pupils attend at their parents&#146; behest, some may
simply have been enrolled because there was no other suitable school
and some may have changed their mind about whether they wish to
attend.</p><p><a name="06101773000030"></a>Why should they be
forced to attend religious education if they do not wish to? Both the
Catholic Education Service and the RE Council have suggested that
attendance at a religious school is some kind of package where pupils
are obliged to attend worship and presumably religious
education&#151;in essence leaving their human rights behind at the
school gate. It is hardly as if they will be ignorant of religious
matters. They will already have had to sit through10 years of
RE. Religious education is not supposed to be religious instruction. It
is not a national curriculum subject so there is little national or
even LEA control over the syllabus and style of teaching. Voluntary
aided schools with a religious ethos are permitted very wide scope in
what they teach. AtSt Luke&#146;s Sixth Form RC College in
Sidcup, religious education included compulsory attendance at certain
events. Even pupils over 16 were not permitted to leave when they
expressed a strong desire to do so. More than 100 of them rebelled at
that time.</p><p><a name="06101773000031"></a>It is interesting to
see precisely what the JCHR said as it is very important for this
discussion. It
stated:</p><ul><a name="06101773000046"></a>&#147;Children enjoy
the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion under both
Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 14(1)
of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The UK is also under
an obligation to assure to the child who is capable of forming his or
her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters
affecting the child, and to give those views due weight in accordance
with the age and maturity of the child. The latter obligation finds
expression in UK law in the concept of &#145;<I>Gillick</I>
competence&#146;, according to which a child should be treated as
legally competent to make their own decisions if they have
&#145;sufficient maturity and intelligence&#146; to understand the
nature and implications of their decision&#148;.</ul>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_724"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 724</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101773000032"></a>The document
continues:</p><ul><a name="06101773000047"></a>&#147;In our view
the current legal framework is incompatible with these obligations in
so far as it fails to guarantee a child of sufficient maturity,
intelligence and understanding the right to withdraw from both
compulsory religious education and collective worship. An amendment to
the Bill which gave pupils over the age of 16 the right to withdraw
from collective worship would therefore reduce the extent of the
incompatibility of the present law with the UK&#146;s human rights
obligations, but it would not remove that incompatibility
altogether.</ul><ul><a name="06101773000048"></a>To remove the
incompatibility, in our view, it would be necessary to go further in
two respects: first, by granting a right to withdraw from religious
education as well as collective worship; and, second, by affording the
right to withdraw from both religious education and collective worship
to any pupil of sufficient maturity, understanding and intelligence to
make an informed decision about whether or not to
withdraw&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101773000033"></a>This is a
sensible amendment to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Adonis. I
and my supporters believe that the way forward is to accept the
principle involved in Amendment No. 79, but to make these amendments,
which would bring it in line with the recommendations of the Joint
Committee on Human
Rights.</p><p><a name="06101773000034"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew135"></a><a name="06101773000059"></a>Lord
Avebury:</b> My Lords, it is a pity that the
Minister&#146;s amendment was not grouped separately so that we could
have a discussion on these matters without becoming involved in all the
other weighty discussions which have preceded it. The amendment in the
name of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, is distinct from all the
others in that it is concerned with a fundamental issue of human
rights, whereas whether you have 25 per cent of the places at a faith
school allocated to people who do not belong to that religion is a
matter of expediency. However, I agree with all those who have said
that we need to consider very carefully how to avoid the divisiveness
that may arise in our society through exclusive attendance at faith
schools of only members of that religion. However, that is another
argument. We are concerned here with the human rights of pupils whether
to attend acts of collective worship or lessons of religious
education.</p><p><a name="06101773000035"></a>I am delighted to see
the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth back with us,
although I, too, beg to differ with him on this matter. I say to him
that it is not a question of having no religious education at all. That
is not what the amendment says. It is proposed that only when the child
reaches 16, or attains the sixth form, should he or she have a right to
opt out of religious education. My youngest son took his GCSEs at 15.
He took religious education as part of that course. If this amendment
had been in force at the time, it would have made no difference
whatever to his appreciation of the religious education which that
school offered because he would already have received, in his opinion,
all that was necessary of such education by the time he took his GCSEs.
He did not go on to study RE at A-level, which was his absolute right.
It should be the right of any child, as the noble Baroness
said.</p><p><a name="06101773000036"></a>The noble Baroness is to
be particularly congratulated on her deployment of the case to which
the JCHR alerted us only at the end of last week. That in turn involved
some very rapid footwork by 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_725"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 725</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the committee working during the Recess to pick up the fact that the
Government&#146;s amendment, giving a sixth-form pupil the right to
be excused attendance at religious worship, is only a quarter of a
human rights loaf, as the noble Baroness has
explained.</p><p><a name="06101773000037"></a>Following
amendments by my noble friend Lady Walmsley in Committee, the
Government sent out a consultation document on 10 August asking
recipients to respond by 25 August, breaking the normal rule of
consultations that six weeks are allowed for reply. An explanation
should have been given for the shorter timescale, but was not, although
I understand from the Government that this was not a normal
consultation at all but simply a request for views to be expressed by
those immediately concerned. I should like to know who was immediately
concerned. On the previous amendment my noble friend mentioned the
right of children to express opinions. Did the Minister obtain the
opinions of any children, or of organisations representing children? We
should hear what they had to
say.</p><p><a name="06101773000038"></a>It was even more
unfortunate that although the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said in response
to my noble friend in Committee on 18 July that he would encapsulate
&#147;most of the spirit&#148; of my noble friend&#146;s
amendments in the amendment that he would propose, the consultation
document referred only to half of it, limiting itself to the question
of attendance at collective acts of worship and leaving out altogether
any reference to religious education. The noble Lord&#146;s
explanation for that in a letter to the executive director of the
National Secular Society
was,</p><ul><a name="06101773000050"></a>&#147;that there is a
proper distinction to be drawn between participation in religious
worship and attendance at religious education lessons on the grounds of
the nature of those
activities&#148;.</ul><a name="06101773000043"></a>He did
not go on to explain the difference in the nature of those two
activities. Even if there is such a distinction, as the noble Baroness,
Lady Turner, has explained, the rights of parents to opt out of both on
behalf of their children are the same, or they are similar if not
identical. If there is a proper distinction to be drawn in this
legislation, would it not have been right to explain in the
consultation document how the Government saw it and get the views of
the consultees rather than giving the impression that only the
attendance at religious worship had been entered into in Committee, and
that there had been no reference to the question of attendance at RE
lessons?<h5><a name="06101771000065"></a>8
pm</h5><p><a name="06101771000001"></a>I think that the Government
were at fault in not expanding the consultation to include all the
matters dealt with in the amendments in that group in Committee. The
Minister&#146;s excuse for not doing so was that my noble friend did
not actually refer to this issue in Committee. That is disingenuous. As
my noble friend explained, that was a monster group of amendments, and
she would have been unpopular if she had spoken to every single
one.</p><p><a name="06101771000002"></a>In tabling their
amendments, the Government concede that a sixth-form pupil of whatever
age is competent to decide whether to attend collective worship. As the
noble Baroness has explained, the 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_726"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 726</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>JCHR says that it is a denial of the rights of the child under both the
ECHR and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to
say that she can withdraw from collective worship but not from
compulsory RE if she is of sufficient maturity, intelligence and
understanding. If she is accepted as having reached that standard for
the first, it follows that she is for the second purpose as well. The
Government&#146;s position is illogical in arguing that the parents
ought to step aside on worship but to continue to decide for the child
on RE. The two must go together, and the test for both must be the
same.</p><p><a name="06101771000003"></a>The JCHR suggests that
schools should apply the Gillick test, under which the High Court ruled
that a girl of whatever age had the legal capacity to consent to
medical examination and treatment, including contraceptives, if she had
sufficient maturity and intelligence to understand the nature and
implications of the proposed treatment. It says that schools are
familiar with this concept and could be provided with guidance on how
to apply it in the case of religious worship and RE. However, to avoid
what I see as being unnecessary bureaucracy, and because the attainment
of the age of 16 and reaching sixth form are objective tests that the
Government recognise in their own amendment, it is appropriate to apply
them in this context but with the difference that if either of them is
satisfied the exercise of choice is triggered. Otherwise, 16 year-olds
will be divided into sheep and goats; those who go to a decent school
will qualify because they have reached sixth form by that time, while
the 44 per cent of pupils who do not achieve five good GCSEs by age 16,
as the noble Lord writes in an article in today&#146;s
<I>Guardian</I>, will be
disqualified.</p><p><a name="06101771000004"></a>I agree with the
JCHR that it is valuable for children to learn about spiritual and
moral issues but, as it adds, there is no guarantee that in a
particular school the way RE is taught may not infringe the
pupil&#146;s right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
With the growth of faith schools, about which our Prime Minister is so
enthusiastic even though it is an intrinsically divisive idea which is
likely to cause untold harm, it is vital that children should be able
to protect themselves. My noble friend and others have referred to the
UK Government&#146;s obligation to report to the UN Committee on the
Rights of the Child in 2007. They will be asked on that occasion
whether they have sought the views of children on these proposals and
why, if that is the case, they did not accept the weighty advice of the
JCHR.</p><p><a name="06101771000005"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew136"></a><a name="06101771000067"></a>Lord

high time the right reverend Prelate had a break from this, and he has
to be here until the end. My noble friend Lord Waddington drew
attention to one danger of my noble friend Lord Baker&#146;s
amendment: that it would not work. He left out another almost equally
important danger: that it has turned Amendment No. 104 into a sideshow.
It is actually a very important amendment. Not only does it address the
question of school assembly, breaking it up so that it no longer
becomes an assembly of the whole school, making it optional and taking
out the religious content, but it repeals Schedule 20 to the 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_727"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 727</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>1988 Act. The schedule embodies the phrase &#147;wholly or broadly
Christian&#148;, which was put on the statute book in 1988 after
lengthy deliberation by your Lordships in a campaign led by the noble
Baroness, Lady Cox, who alas is not here tonight. To reverse that with
a thinning House late at night would be a tragedy.</p><p><a name="06101771000006"></a>The only other comment that I will make
is to reinforce the remarks of those who say that the study of religion
is more important than it has been for a very long time. The age when
children are reaching maturity is probably the most important time for
them to become aware of it, look at it rationally and not be
brainwashed, and that is the role of RE in schools these
days.</p><p><a name="06101771000007"></a>I will not reply to
tirade of the noble Lord, Lord Taverne&#151;who is not in his place
but I shall address him in his absence&#151;though one came across
most of it teaching in the sixth form, and indeed the fifth form, but I
will say simply that those who have lived it are very grateful that
they learnt
it.</p><p><a name="06101771000008"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew137"></a><a name="06101771000068"></a>Baroness

give a practical welcome to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Portsmouth saying, &#147;Three cheers for Amendment No. 9&#148;. I
think it is the only non-controversial thing that has been said
tonight. I support it because I took a view earlier that it was
important that a school improvement partner should be <I>en rapport</I>
with the governing body.</p><p><a name="06101771000010"></a>Amendment No. 16, proposed by the noble
Lord, Lord Baker, is a very constructive, well intended approach to a
major issue: the well-being of society and its coherence. I do not
think that we can have this debate without hearing the Muslim voice,
and I have not heard it tonight. That is what underlies this debate. We
cannot bring it to a conclusion without listening respectfully to the
views of the Muslim
community.</p><p><a name="06101771000011"></a>If I may recall
history imperfectly, at one time Catholic schools were looked on with
considerable suspicion. I think I remember the opposition to Pope on
the rates. No one now thinks of Catholic schools as divisive in our
society. The right reverend Prelate said that church communities were
at different stages of development. It is right that the Church of
England as the national church should see itself as serving the whole
nation to an extent that I would not expect of other
churches.</p><p><a name="06101771000012"></a>As I read the letter
of the Most Reverend Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Birmingham, the
Roman Church accepts that it has an obligation to address this issue,
although it does not accept the noble Lord&#146;s approach. It is
saying that its inspections shall look at the contribution of Roman
Catholic schools to social cohesion and that the outcome should be
public. The archbishop lists a dozen criteria. That was what the

was making that contribution.</p><p><a name="06101771000013"></a>I
was quoted twice in this debate and I listened fearfully to what I had
said. This time I quote without fear. Speaking in a debate on
&#147;Churches and Cities&#148; on 19 May, I
said:</p><ul><a name="06101771000063"></a>&#147;Faith
schools have a special responsibility not to be isolationist but to
adopt an ethos of positive commitment, goodwill and respect towards
other faiths, and to proactively seek opportunities to engage with the
schools of other faiths or, where there are none locally, with
community schools, which serve a large number of other
faiths&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/5/06; col.
548.]</ul><a name="06101771000061"></a>So I believe that there
is an alternative route that addresses the major problem that the noble
Lord, Lord Baker, has in
mind.<p><a name="06101771000014"></a>I worry whether the
noble Lord&#146;s well intentioned amendment will be seen by some of
our absent Muslim community, perhaps many of them, as
ill-intentioned&#151;innocent but nevertheless interpreted in that
way. What matters is how people interpret things in the very sensitive
situation in which we find ourselves. I am fearful that the amendment
will be misinterpreted.</p><p><a name="06101771000015"></a>Once
upon a time, I led a large corporation. When negotiating with a guy
called Alan Johnson, now the Secretary of State for Education, who was
one of the trade union leaders, I learnt a little rule, although I did
not tell him about it at the time: never drive the other side into a
corner from which there is no escape, because all they can do is fight.
I am worried that we may be driving them. We want to hear what that
community have to say, because they know the problem and what
contribution they want to make to addressing it. We should find ways of
enabling them to make that contribution, perhaps in the way that the
Roman Catholic Church is doing so by being open to inspection and so
on.</p><p><a name="06101771000016"></a>I respect the noble
Lord&#146;s motives, but I fear that they could be misinterpreted and
do damage. There are other ways, and whichever way we go, we must not
drive people into a corner of antagonism and hostility. We have serious
problems enough.</p><p><a name="06101771000017"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew139"></a><a name="06101771000070"></a>Baroness

the House may be that we should move to a conclusion, so I venture to
make my contribution to this very important set of amendments. Not for
the first time, I very much agree with the common sense of the noble
Baroness, Lady Richardson.</p><p><a name="06101771000018"></a>I
thank the noble Lord, Lord Baker, for his efforts to do something about
an issue that is of great concern to us all. If I do not support his
amendment, it is not because I do not agree with many of his words

much of what he said about not dividing children on a religious basis
at the age of five, but where we differ is on how best to do
it.</p><p><a name="06101771000019"></a>We believe
social integration and tolerance and understanding between the
different social, cultural and religious groups in this country to be
one of the most important challenges we face&#151;not just for the
sake of peace and tackling terrorism, but for the more positive
objective of enriching all our lives. However, faith schools and the
contribution that they could 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_729"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 729</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>make to that desirable understanding and integration are only part of
the picture. We believe that schools should serve, and be accountable
to, communities. We are not happy with artificial quotas because they
generate artificial situations, encourage gerrymandering of admission
arrangements and the possibility of bussing children long distances to
school unnecessarily, and they have many other practical
difficulties.</p><p><a name="06101771000020"></a>Unfortunately,
today we have both voluntary and involuntary postcode segregation.
There is voluntary segregation because people choose to live in certain
places because of the quality and composition of the schools, and they
choose to move away from other areas for the same reason. There is
involuntary segregation because some people are forced to remain in
areas where the schools do not satisfy them and they cannot afford to
move elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06101771000021"></a>I do not
believe, therefore, that we should be addressing this very serious
matter at this stage of a Bill which is essentially about something
else. Instead, we should take a holistic look at the picture of social
and cultural segregation and address all the factors that affect it. We
should be doing that on a cross-party basis. I know that all parties
would take part most enthusiastically in such an exercise. I say to the
noble Lord, Lord Dearing, that I am sure that the Muslim community
would do so, too. I think that it would satisfy some of the noble
Lord&#146;s concerns if perhaps we had a special commission or royal
commission on this subject. It is a great pity that Ruth Kelly&#146;s
commission on social integration is not allowed to look at any barriers
that faith schools might put in the way of real understanding and
co-operation between the many groups that live in this country and the
very positive contribution that they could make to improve the
situation if they were genuinely
integrated.</p><h5><a name="06101771000066"></a>8.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06101771000022"></a>I am afraid I do not believe
that the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, would achieve
very much. We are living in a climate where school rolls are falling.
The number of genuinely new schools will be small. I understand that in
proposed subsection (2) of the amendment the noble Lord has
specifically excluded Muslim schools that are currently private but are
planning to come into the maintained sector. It would be desirable for
such schools to be caught up by his amendment, were it to be
practicable, and also that they should deliver the national curriculum,
including the information about other religions that we find in the RE
curriculum.</p><p><a name="06101771000023"></a>However, I do not think
that the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is practicable and workable. One
might say that it does not go far enough. It is not unreasonable for
one to suggest that, if the community or the state is paying for the
school, 100 per cent of its places should be available for any young
citizen of that state. But I should like to ask the noble Lord what he
thinks should be done if a school cannot attract 25 per cent of pupils
who are not of the faith. Surely he would not want to drive a coach and
horses through the parental choice agenda by coercing parents in any
way to send their children to these schools. The alternative is that 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_730"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 730</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they do not set up at all. That may well be his objective, but what will
he do about parents who want such a school? Does he prefer them to have
a private school, which is not subject to Ofsted and does not deliver
the national curriculum? A royal commission or some sort of cross-party
commission would give all parties an opportunity to have a voice in
this debate. It is a matter far too complex to be resolved by a
relatively simple amendment, even one proposed by the noble
Lord.</p><p><a name="06101771000024"></a>I understand that the
Government intend to table an amendment at Third Reading to allow for a
process of appeal to the Secretary of State if the admission
arrangements of a new school look as though they will produce less than
25 per cent non-faith pupils. Of course, we will look carefully at the
exact wording of that amendment when it comes before us and make up our
minds then about whether to support it. But, for the moment, before I
have had the opportunity of hearing what the Minister has to say, there
are many serious questions to ask&#151;not least, how long would a
ruling about 25 per cent non-faith pupils on the school roll last?
Would it be for the first year of the establishment of the school, or
for three years or five? What would happen if a few pupils left and the
school roll fell below the 25 per cent level? Would it have to
close?</p><p><a name="06101771000025"></a>The bottom line is that
these problems will occur unless the school wants to educate a range of
faiths within its ranks and unless parents want their children to go
there. Parents will want that if they are convinced of two things: the
first is that the child will get a good education; the second is that
the child will enjoy and benefit from mixing with a wide range of
children from different cultural and religious groups and have the
opportunity to get to know children of different backgrounds and make
friends with them.</p><p><a name="06101771000026"></a>People rarely
kill their friends. They do not usually bomb people whom they know,
like and understand. I make it clear that this comment does not imply
that I think that faith schools have any responsibility for terrorism.
It simply means that I think that they could make a valuable
contribution to preventing it if they were integrated and promoted
understanding. That is what we need to achieve, but I do not believe
that the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Baker, will do
it and I have severe reservations about whether the expected government
amendment will do it either. However, I wait to
see.</p><p><a name="06101771000027"></a>I turn to government
Amendment No. 79 and the new set of amendments from the noble Baroness,
Lady Turner, and others on my own Back Benches. I thank the Minister
for accepting the principle of the amendment I tabled in Committee to
allow older pupils to exempt themselves from collective worship if they
wish. I say to my noble friend Lord Avebury that that is all I ask for,
rather than them having to rely on their parents to do it for them. I
believe that is only right; it is their human right. I am still a
little concerned that we have to rely on the funding agreement to make
it apply to academies, but I shall keep a close eye on
that.</p><p><a name="06101771000028"></a>I was very interested to
read the report of the JCHR, published last Friday, which suggests that
the 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_731"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 731</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government should go further if they wish to fulfil a child&#146;s
rights under Article 9 of the human rights convention. The noble
Baroness, Lady Turner, and my noble friends clearly agree with them, as
they have laid Amendments Nos. 79A to 79K. Perhaps I should explain why
I do not support that group of amendments. In the climate that I
described earlier, where we have postcode segregation and where many
maintained schools are 98 per cent of one faith and culture, the
national curriculum religious education course is very important. It is
really the only way in which some children learn about other religions.
Until we sort out that situation I do not think that we should
encourage children to remove themselves from religious education.
Religious education is different from religious instruction and
indoctrination and, as I understand it, it is taught in a
comparative-religion way in most schools. Worship is quite
different.</p><p><a name="06101771000029"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew140"></a><a name="06101771000071"></a>Lord
Avebury:</b> My Lords, could my noble friend explain
why she does not think that religious education up to age 15, by which
time a child will have had four years of it, would be adequate to give
him or her an understanding of other
religions?</p><p><a name="06101771000030"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew141"></a><a name="06101771000072"></a>Baroness

me why I do not support the Gillick principle, I shall come to that
point in a
moment.</p><p><a name="06101771000031"></a>This
really is the only way in which some children learn about other
religions. As I was about to say, worship is entirely different. It
requires children to pray to a god in which they may not believe and
that is why I wanted the Government to give us Amendment No. 79, as
they have done. However, to extend that right down the age range to
those who can demonstrate their competence to decide is very messy. It
can easily be done in relation to an individual child by a court but,
practically speaking, to ask a school to take that on is asking a lot.
To extend that right to exemption from religious education is highly
undesirable.</p><p><a name="06101771000032"></a>Only last week a
young man whom I know told me that he went to a Catholic school but
learnt in his RE lessons a great deal about Islam, the Hindu religion
and many others. That is how it should be. We should be encouraging all
schools run by faiths to do that for all pupils. As the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth said, that is what many of them do. I
also add my welcome to him. To encourage pupils to absent themselves
from RE at any age is not a good idea and it presents serious practical
problems for
schools.</p><p><a name="06101771000033"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew142"></a><a name="06101771000073"></a>Baroness

Buscombe:</b> My Lords, this has been a fascinating,
wide-ranging and well informed debate that confirms the distinguished
reputation of your Lordships' House. I believe that the quality of the
debate in this House is at its highest when noble Lords contemplate
those issues that are the most
challenging.</p><p><a name="06101771000036"></a>I begin by
referring to the amendment tabled by the right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Portsmouth. I fear that it has been entirely forgotten
because of the other amendments. I remind noble Lords that it concerns
school improvement partners having to understand fully the religious
character of a school. I suggest that that is a modest amendment which
deserves support.</p><p><a name="06101771000037"></a>Turning to the
issue raised by my noble friend Lord Baker, this is a matter of great
importance, not only to many noble Lords, but also to those individuals
whose lives will be shaped by the choices that we make today. It is for
those individuals that the Bill has been created and it is for them
that these Benches support it. Our reasons have been much publicised in
your Lordships&#146; House and in another place. The most important
is our whole-hearted endorsement of the creation of greater choice of
schools for parents. The provision of a good choice of schools for
parents and children is the driving principle of the Bill, but I fear
that this amendment could have the opposite outcome.</p><p><a name="06101771000038"></a>I come from a standpoint that does not
fear the existence of strongly held faith or faith schools. I believe
that the moral principles and teachings of great religious faiths can
provide the moral compass that our society so often lacks. I feel
confident that many noble Lords on all Benches agree. I do not think
that the leaders of our faiths should feel that they have to apologise
for the existence of faith schools or underplay their many fantastic
achievements. We should encourage and support such schools, which our
education system has done since 1944.</p><p><a name="06101771000039"></a>I say that because in debating this
topic, there is a danger of overlooking the great contribution that so
many of our faith schools make to excellence in education in this
country. That has been touched on by many noble Lords. In recent days
and weeks, many members of faith groups have said that faith in schools
can be a great driver of the consideration, tolerance and positive
outlook that is so important to the success of social cohesion. All
noble Lords have agreed on the subject of inclusion, which was referred
to by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood. The real moral
hazard in our society is not the existence of teachers with faith and
principles; it is the existence of moral relativists for whom anything
is as valid as anything else.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_733"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 733</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101771000040"></a>The amendment tabled by my noble friend
Lord Baker would, I fear, require new schools with a religious
character to accept a centralised quota of25 per cent of
pupils from other faiths in order to receive state funding. I say,
&#147;I fear&#148;, because I am concerned that that quota would
not work. My noble friend said that his amendment follows on from the
Church of England&#146;s policy but applies it to other schools. The
Church of England reserves 25 per cent of pupil places for children of
a different faith, but it does not close those places off if they are
not applied for by pupils of a different faith. There is no compulsion
in the Church of England&#146;s position; rather, there is an
allowance for children of other faiths or none. As the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth explained, the places would not be
left empty.</p><p><a name="06101771000041"></a>In supporting the
Church of England&#146;s stance on this issue, I should add that the
right honourable David Cameron MP has made it clear that he wants to
see similar initiatives by other faith schools, not as a matter of
uniform national rules, but of social responsibility. I fear that the
top-down approach of the imposition of a quota would upset the careful
balance achieved by the Church of England and would dissuade other
faith communities from following suit.</p><p><a name="06101771000042"></a>Parents who want their children to go to
a school with a religious character could find their application being
turned away on the grounds of the quota. Equally, those who do not wish
for their children to attend such a school could find their choices
limited by the fact that such a quota would affect their applications
to other local schools, should they happen to live near a school with a
religious character. I do not believe that my noble friend seeks any
such effect. Indeed, I applaud the principle of his amendment. I
understand that its driving force is a sincere and strongly held desire
to achieve integration, inclusion and greater communication within
different community groups.</p><p><a name="06101771000043"></a>The
answer is not to create national rules that will discourage new
faith-based institutions as part of the state system; it is to draw
more of those institutions into the state system where they will teach
the broad span of the curriculum and be subject to the same controls as
all other schools. While I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Baker
for raising this issue, and I applaud his courage in doing so, I am
concerned about the methodology.</p><p><a name="06101771000044"></a>I am at an impasse. We have before us the
amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Baker, but I understand that
the Minister is proposing to table an alternative amendment at Third
Reading. I believe that there is a strong case for encouraging and
providing the pathways for local communities to embrace social cohesion
of their own volition and not imposing rigid central structures. But I
regret that such compromises are being introduced so late in the stages
of the Bill, and that there will be little opportunity to debate
them.</p><p><a name="06101771000045"></a>However, I understand the
pressures placed on the Minister by the re-tabling of my noble
friend&#146;s amendment, even after the debate in Committee. I 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_734"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 734</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>understand that he has felt the need to produce proposals with very
little time. I am sure that had he anticipated the great interest
surrounding the amendment, an alternative could have been available in
your Lordships' House today. I await with great interest the details of
the noble Lord's proposition.</p><p><a name="06101771000046"></a>I
hope that the Minister will strike the right balance; that he will
employ legislation that does not impose solutions from the top down,
but which enables local authorities to take responsibility from the
bottom up. I look forward to measures that instead of imposing one size
fits all legislation, will encourage local communities&#151;the
bedrock of society&#151;to use their commissioning role to foster
integration and interaction through legislation that gives them the
freedom to adapt to and grow with the people who make up those
communities.</p><p><a name="06101771000047"></a>In
speaking to other amendments, I will try to be extremely brief. These
amendments require some serious consideration. Given that the key
factor that drives extremism is isolation, we, as legislators, should
be searching for ways to develop a sense of belonging and a sense of
community in our young people. How do you promote leadership and
develop an ethos in a school unless you have opportunities to involve
each pupil on common ground and, if space allows, as one
group?</p><p><a name="06101771000048"></a>I
understand the arguments proposed this evening for why collective
worship should no longer be mandatory for sixth formers, and why pupils
should be allowed to opt out of religious education. But while I have
listened to the arguments, I do not accept them and do not support the
amendments. Indeed, I find the juxtaposition of the Government&#146;s
amendment and Amendment No. 104 with that of my noble friend Lord Baker
rather strange. On the one hand we are seeking to encourage integration
of children of different faiths, and then we have these other
amendments&#151;Amendment Nos. 79 and 104 <I>et al</I>&#151;that
would allow children to withdraw from worship and withdraw from
religious teaching. Surely, we should be encouraging teaching of
different faiths in order to support genuine integration. We should
listen to the wise words of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Portsmouth&#151;and how glad we are to hear from him
tonight.</p><p><a name="06101771000049"></a>I want to say something
that is extremely important regarding religious worship, and I think
that we should be grateful to the noble Baronesses, Lady Turner and
Lady Massey, for raising an issue which deserves our attention. The
noble Baroness, Lady Massey, said that a large percentage of children
do not actually take part in daily worship as required by the School
Standards and Framework Act 1998. Section 70 of the Act sets out the
requirements in relation to collective worship. I am not convinced that
that is happening. I ask the Minister to tell us whether each day
pupils take part in an act of collective worship.</p><p><a name="06101771000050"></a>I raise the matter
particularly because some of the wording of Amendment No. 104 deserves
our attention and, in spirit, our support. The amendment
states:</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_735"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 735</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="06101771000064"></a>&#147;Each pupil in attendance at a
community, foundation or voluntary school shall on each school day take
part in an assembly, which shall further his spiritual, moral, social
and cultural education&#148;.</ul><a name="06101771000062"></a>That is hugely important. It is about
bringing pupils together. I mentioned earlier the concern that
exclusion creates isolation. More than ever today I think that we
should continue with worship, and we should continue with educational
training up to the age of 18, whatever forms and manners that might
take. But as important is that schools should be encouraged to have an
assembly so that pupils are given a sense of
belonging.<p><a name="06101771000051"></a>I
have thought about this a great deal. Indeed, only this morning, I
asked a group of people in east Croydon, a number of whom are
ex-teachers and school inspectors, whether, in their experience, we
should expect our schools at all stages to have some form of regular
assembly. The answer was overwhelming. It was
unanimous.</p><p><a name="06101771000052"></a>Throughout all walks
of life, in all activities, people, whether working with children, in
the police or in business, have opportunities to come together as a
team, as one. The benefits are invaluable. Why not use the assembly as
an opportunity not only to inform but enthuse children and inspire them
in a moral and social education? That is something that we should all
support.</p><p><a name="06101771000053"></a>Although I do not
support government Amendment No. 79 or the amendments tabled by the
noble Baronesses, Lady Massey and Lady Turner, it is right to embrace
the need for a school assembly to further the spiritual, moral, social
and cultural education of our
children.</p><p><a name="06101771000054"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew145"></a><a name="06101771000076"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, this debate has covered such a
wide range of issues that, to do them all justice, I would need to
emulate the Reverend Marion Tugwood of New Mills, Derbyshire, who this
summer preached the longest sermon in history. It lasted 48 hours and
five minutes. In reply to the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, that may
constitute a genuine recorded miracle. I am happy for him to
investigate and report back to the
House.</p><p><a name="06101771000055"></a>Not having such powers
myself, I hope to be a great deal briefer. In that attempt to be brief,
let me proceed directly to collective worship. Government Amendments
Nos. 79 and 151 implement the change of policy that I announced in
Committee in response to an amendment tabled by the noble Baroness,
Lady Walmsley, supported by my noble friends, to give sixth-form pupils
the right to withdraw themselves from collective worship. I believe
that that change is supported across the House and I commend those
amendments to your Lordships.</p><p><a name="06101771000056"></a>I
also agree with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth,
who we are very glad to see in his place this evening, that the new
right of withdrawal should not be exercised casually. We will give
careful thought to how DfES guidelines can assist schools in achieving
that and we will consult with the faith communities. In response to the
JCHR report and the issue of Gillick competence, the report 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_736"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 736</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has only been recently issued, but I should say that our view on it is
as follows. Although Gillick competence is a relevant consideration,
this is a difficult and complex issue. As the noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley, said, competence does not necessarily arise all at once, nor
does each pupil become competent at the same time. Different people
develop at different rates. Therefore, we believe that we need to
balance the Gillick competence test with the need to deliver a
practicable and workable solution for schools so that schools can
function effectively. We believe that the government amendments strike
the right
balance.</p><p><a name="06101771000057"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew146"></a><a name="06101771000077"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> My Lords, I am loath to intervene, but,
perhaps because I was speaking at 90 miles an hour, I should like to
clarify that the truth is that we do not support the government
amendments to withdraw from
worship.</p><p><a name="06101771000058"></a><b><a name="61017-0002.htm_spnew147"></a><a name="06101771000078"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, I accept that the noble
Baroness does not, but I think that there is broad support from other
parts of the House.</p><p><a name="06101771000059"></a>My noble
friends Lady Massey and Lady Turner would like to go further still and
abolish collective worship altogether, putting in its place a new
requirement to take part in an assembly to further pupils&#146;
spiritual, moral, social and cultural education with no requirement, as
now, for that education to be wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian
character.</p><p><a name="06101771000060"></a>I deeply respect the
views of my noble friends, and I know that other Members of the House
share them, but the Government do not feel able to support those
further amendments. Assemblies and collective worship are important
elements of school life in establishing their ethos and collective
character. For those under 16, we believe it right that they should be
required to take part unless their parents specifically wish otherwise;
and it is in accordance with the values and traditions of the majority
in this country&#151;although I accept not by any means
all&#151;that such collective worship should be of a broadly
Christian character, allowing also for the proper celebration of other
faiths as
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06101772000001"></a>Section
394 of the Education Act 1996 allows community schools and foundation
schools without a religious character to lift the broadly Christian
requirements for some or all pupils when the local standing advisory
council on religious education judges it appropriate to do so, having
received an application from the head teacher. Before making such an
application, the head teacher must consult the governing body, which in
turn may want to seek the views of the parents. We believe this strikes
the right balance, and we do not intend to propose any further
changes.</p><p><a name="06101772000002"></a>In his Amendment No. 9,
the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth proposes that
school improvement partners play a role in assisting the governing body
to prepare and develop the religious character of a faith school. We
see an important role for the external validation and monitoring of the
faith aspect of a faith school&#146;s work&#151;a point made by the
noble Lords, Lord Dearing and Lord Sutherland. 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_737"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 737</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That is precisely why we have Section 48 inspections, which focus on
this aspect of the work of faith schools and for which largely the
Government pay. I pay tribute in this respect to the Catholic Church,
which recently announced that its Section 48 inspections will pay
particular attention to the community outreach and engagement of their
schools, in the way that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, described. I
believe the Church of England is minded to do the same. We think that
the Section 48 inspections are the right way in which to monitor this
work, whereas the role of school improvement partners is distinctly
different&#151;it is to monitor standards. That said, we expect
school improvement partners, as well as local authorities, to be
responsive to the individual character, including the religious
character, of schools with which they
work.</p><p><a name="06101772000003"></a>On staffing, government
Amendments Nos. 54, 146 and 149 follow the constructive dialogue that
we have had with faith communities. First, they allow the head teacher
of a religious foundation or voluntary controlled school in England and
Wales to be a reserved teacher, appointed specifically to guide
religious education in accordance with the tenets of the
school&#146;s specified religion. Almost all voluntary-controlled
schools are Church of England schools, and we agree with the Church of
England that it should not be necessary for a voluntary-controlled
school or a foundation school to convert to voluntary-aided status
simply to ensure that its head teacher is appointed with a view to
promoting the ethos of the school. We have therefore tabled these
amendments, which have their genesis with the Church of
England.</p><p><a name="06101772000004"></a>Secondly, the
amendments allow voluntary-aided faith schools in England to make a
case for extending the faith requirement to the appointment of any
employee who is not a teacher, where there is a genuine occupational
requirement. This, again, is a beneficial flexibility to reflect the
changes brought about by workforce reform, particularly the much wider
use of support staff in schools. It would be perverse if faith schools
were discouraged from appointing pastoral assistants rather than fully
qualified teachers, for example, simply because they cannot extend the
existing power in respect of a faith commitment for that particular
post.</p><p><a name="06101772000005"></a>On &#147;Lord
Baker&#146;s amendment&#148;, as it will for evermore be known, let
me first reaffirm the Government&#146;s commitment to support faith
schools when they provide good-quality education and are desired by
parents, as they so widely are; we have had many testaments to that
from all sides of the House this evening. We pay tribute to the immense
contribution that the faith communities make to our education system
and to supporting members of their own faith in developing their
talents to the full, and through education instilling a proper sense of
citizenship and social responsibility.</p><p><a name="06101772000006"></a>The issue is community
cohesion. A whole host of factors&#151;not least the existence of
good schools, including good faith schools, which serve communities

their pastoral standards, and are absolutely community-minded.
Admissions arrangements are, however, one obvious factor that governs
the relationship between a school and the communities that it serves,
and it is right that Government and Parliament should consider the
issue, as we have been doing this evening, given the current and
absolutely legitimate concern about community cohesion.</p><p><a name="06101772000007"></a>In doing so, we follow the Church of
England, which made a significant policy statement last month. In
response to clear parental demand and following one of many reports by
the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, the Church of England is seeking to
increase the number of its schools in areas where there are few or none
at present, particularly at secondary level. In doing so, the Church of
England has announced that all new C of E schools will offer at least
25 per cent of places on the basis of local preference, not faith
preference alone. The Government warmly welcome this
policy.</p><h5><a name="06101772000033"></a>8.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06101772000008"></a>The amendment of the noble
Lord, Lord Baker, would extend on a mandatory national basis
this25 per cent requirement to all new faith schools. My right
honourable friend the Secretary of State has considered this proposal
very carefully, and I am in a position to say that, subject to our
judging there to be a sufficient consensus for such a move, the
Government will bring forward an amendment on Third Reading along the
following lines. We do not believe it right for there to be a mandatory
national25 per cent requirement in respect of all new faith
schools. However, we wish to give local authorities, in their role as
guardians of community cohesion, a power to require that new faith
schools have admissions policies which include the offer of at least 25
per cent of places on the basis of local preference, not faith
preference alone.</p><p><a name="06101772000009"></a>We also wish
to confer a reserve power on the Secretary of State&#151;a power, not
a duty&#151;to act in this matter where a local authority&#146;s
decisions give rise to a sufficient body of local objections to oblige
him to consider the issue. We intend to consult on the precise way in
which these provisions will be
framed.</p><p><a name="06101772000010"></a>I hope that this will be
taken as a significant move by my right honourable friend and the
Government to meet the concerns which have given rise to the noble
Lord&#146;s amendment. But let me make clear four points which I know
are of concern within the faith communities, and which have been set
out eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and others, in the
debate.</p><p><a name="06101772000011"></a>First, there is no
question whatever of places being left unfilled where there is parental
demand for them. The requirement would simply be to offer a proportion
of places according to local preference, as opposed to faith
preference. If these places are not taken up, and if there are
faith-preference applicants who wish to take them, they will of course
be welcome to do so. Equally, there will be no obligation on anyone to
apply to or attend a faith school. There will be no quotas and there
will be no bussing.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_739"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 739</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101772000012"></a>Secondly, there is no
question of requiring this admission arrangement in respect of existing
faith schools where it does not already apply. However, I should stress
that it applies in a very large number of faith schools at the moment;
that is the answer to the points raised about practicability. This will
remain a matter for the faith communities and their schools to
determine. I give a categoric assurance on behalf of the Government
that this is not the thin end of a wedge which would affect existing
faith schools and faith communities against their wishes. Only brand
new schools offering additional places will be
affected.</p><p><a name="06101772000013"></a>Thirdly, in response
to the noble Baroness, Lady Richardson&#151;and I pay tribute to the
work of Methodist schools as well as other faith schools&#151;the
Government have no intention of obliging faith schools to insist that a
certain proportion of pupils profess the faith. Many existing faith
schools&#151;including Methodist schools, I believe&#151;do not,
and there is no obligation on new faith schools at present to have
faith-based oversubscription criteria. Indeed, a large number of new
faith schools have no faith-based oversubscription criteria whatever
now, including new schools currently being established.</p><p><a name="06101772000014"></a>Fourthly, local discretion will be for
real. If a local authority receives a proposal for a school where more
than 75 per cent of admissions would be based on a faith criterion, and
it believes that this would be consistent with community cohesion and
wishes to approve the new school to open on that basis, the Secretary
of State would exercise his reserve power only where he had well
founded concerns about such a policy in respect of the individual
school and community in question. Equally&#151;this is in response to
the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley&#151;any
admissions requirements would hold for only as long as the local
authority wished them to do so. The local authority could of course
change its view over time.</p><p><a name="06101772000015"></a>I
hope that the policy I have set out is able to secure a reasonable
consensus across the House. My right honourable friend and I will
continue to discuss it with noble Lords individually, the two
opposition parties and the faith communities before we table a precise
amendment. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord, Lord Baker, will
not feel that he needs to press his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06101772000016"></a><b><a name="61017-0003.htm_spnew148"></a><a name="06101772000034"></a>Lord
Baker of Dorking:</b> My Lords, I want to thank all
noble Lords who have spoken in this quite remarkable debate. We have
heard from Catholics and Protestants, from Methodists, atheists and
agnostics. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, that it is a
great pity we heard no voice from the Muslims, since there is no
question of driving them into a corner. A dialogue must start
somewhere, and it could perhaps start in your Lordships&#146;
House.</p><p><a name="06101772000017"></a>I want to thank the
Minister for his very significant statement tonight, which is a major
change in government policy from the position that was taken in July.
It is a thoughtful response to a difficult problem. There is no easy
answer to it&#151;as everybody has discovered in this
debate&#151;but if one is concerned 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_740"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 740</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with the cohesion of society, which the Minister put at the beginning of
his speech, that is a very important lodestar and guiding
light.</p><p><a name="06101772000018"></a>As I
understood it, taking in what the Minister said, there will be a power
for local authorities to establish a proportion or quota&#151;not a
duty&#151;and a power for the Secretary of State to intervene at some
stage under certain circumstances. Clearly, the House would like to
examine these amendments when they are tabled next week and to work out
their important consequences. At first sight, they seem to move very
close to my position, so all the barbs that have been made against me
tonight can be directed in future against the Government as well. I am
glad to have some allies in the target area.</p><p><a name="06101772000019"></a>In the light of the important statement
that the Minister has made tonight, it would be unreasonable to divide
the House. Let us come back to this matter at Third Reading on Monday
30 October.</p><p><a name="06101772000020"></a><b><a name="61017-0003.htm_spnew149"></a><a name="06101772000035"></a>The
Lord Bishop of Portsmouth:</b> My Lords, it is a
great pleasure for me to say that I had a good lunch, and look forward
to having a good dinner. I am grateful to your Lordships for your good
wishes on my temporary return during a gap in treatment. I assure your
Lordships that I will be back. I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord
Baker, for my poor maths. When I was a Guildford rector the treasurer
told me, after a few months, &#147;Don&#146;t bother to add up your
monthly expenses cheque, Kenneth&#151;you always get it
wrong&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101772000021"></a>This has been a
rich and varied debate that could go on and on for hours. I want to
touch very briefly on four aspects of it. First, I remain entirely
sceptical about the amendment in the names of the noble Lords, Lord
Baker, Lord Skidelsky and Lord Taverne, for reasons that I have already
given that are shared by other people around your Lordships&#146;
House, including the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Buscombe.
I hope that the kind of signals given by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis,
to other noble Lords who do not share that view will pacify them and
contribute to further debate.</p><p><a name="06101772000022"></a>I
echo the words used earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that
this is only part of the picture. Faith schools cannot possibly carry
the weight of all our social issues and problems. It was good to hear
from the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on Roman Catholic schools, and from
the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, in his knockabout speech. We may disagree
on faith and reason, but the Pope&#146;s speech in
Regensburg&#151;hijacked because he opened his mouth in a particular
Byzantine direction&#151;was really about a new deal on faith and
reason in the West. Whatever our religious views in the post-modern
world, that provides many of us with much food for thought.</p><p><a name="06101772000023"></a>When I was a small boy, I learned most of
my theology from an old priest who was a chaplain in the trenches, and
whose theology was formed by that experience. He once said to me,
&#147;The purpose of theology is to prevent religion degenerating
into superstition&#148;&#151;words that the noble Lord, Lord 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_741"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 741</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Sutherland, at whose feet I sat many years ago in Manchester University,
might welcome and even approve.</p><p><a name="06101772000024"></a>However, there has
been a slight air of unreality in parts of tonight&#146;s debate
about faith schools. There are 4,700 Church of England schools, while
there are 35 Jewish schools, six Muslim-maintained schools and 100
independent Muslim schools that could become maintained&#151;with
many of all those oversubscribed&#151;so we are not comparing like
with like. Perhaps I may say, without intending to be patronising, that
we need to handle minority faith communities with a bit of care and,
dare I say,
love.</p><p><a name="06101772000025"></a>Secondly,
I welcome the government amendment on staff at foundation or voluntary
schools with religious character&#151;that is easy. Thirdly,
collective worship has been the Aunt Sally of tonight&#146;s
discussion. As I think the Minister said, the current provision is to
have half Christian and half other faiths in community schools. What an
enrichment that would be. It would have been an enrichment for the
school that I attended if half the acts of worship had been of other
faiths. I would have learnt so much more than simply having
conversations with the little lad sitting next to me who was from the
local Jewish
community.</p><p><a name="06101772000026"></a>I
suppose that I would be slightly sceptical at this slip from worship to
spiritual, moral assembly. It seems that if you define worship in the
broadest sense, it is about contemplating the mystery of life and the
use of silence in a very noisy world. I find in liturgy that it is
children who can be quiet and parents who cannot. This spiritual, moral
assembly may become rather moralistic. We may have to come back to
collective worship in a proper debate. Perhaps I may stick my neck out
slightly and quote from a conversation that I had with the Secretary of
State in the summer. We talked about collective worship and I gave him
a gentle warning that if we do not grasp it, it runs the risk of
becoming like the blasphemy law: enshrined in statute, seldom invoked
and almost universally
misunderstood.</p><p><a name="06101772000027"></a>To gently answer
the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, yes, religion does not have exclusive
rights on the grammar of values, but it is remarkably alive and
kicking. To echo the words of my friend the right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Newcastle, I do not recognise the religious life of this
country portrayed in much public discussion. According to the
statistics of the 2001 census, more than 71 per cent of the population
signed up to Christianity in the broad sense and the second-largest
faith group are the Muslims at 3.9 per cent, which is not quite how it
is often portrayed. I am not using those statistics in a triumphalistic
way, but rather in a world where religion is back on the map and people
want to study it at schools and in universities. The old secularist
approach will not work any
more.</p><p><a name="06101772000028"></a>I cannot
quite believe that this debate began nearly three hours ago. I am
sometimes accused of innocence and this began with a very innocent
amendment on school improvement partners. Years ago, a group of us were
swapping epitaphs and the eyes of the group turned to me. I said that I
would like as my epitaph: be 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_742"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 742</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cunning as serpents, yet innocent as doves. The retired bishop said,
&#147;Well, Kenneth, you certainly passed the first
test&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101772000029"></a>Finally, I
welcome the reassurances given on school improvement partners. With all
the humility that I can muster just before nine o&#146;clock with a
rumbling stomach, I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06101772000030"></a>Amendment, by leave,

Government what progress has been made on implementing the Ministry of
Defence&#146;s defence industrial
strategy.</p><p><a name="06101776000003"></a>The noble Lord said:
My Lords, I should like to declare an interest as an associate fellow
of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security
Studies; however, I stress that I am of course not speaking on behalf
of the institute or representing its views in any way. I touched on
this subject during the Armed Forces debate in your Lordships&#146;
House last June, initiated by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge.
Nevertheless I believe that the timing, if not the hour, of this
Question is apposite, given that the anniversary of the publication of
the defence industrial strategy (DIS) White Paper will soon be upon us.
Much has happened since its publication last December, and I hope that
my noble friend on the Front Bench will welcome this opportunity to
update your Lordships on the progress made so far in implementing the
strategy. He has rightly been widely lauded as its
architect.</p><p><a name="06101776000004"></a>I do not wish to
rehearse the points I made in the debate last June. The MoD&#146;s
defence industrial strategy and its subsequent implementation strategy
have clearly set out a blueprint for delivering affordable defence
capability which will at the same time secure the future for the
UK&#146;s defence industrial base. The DIS recognises not only the
important role of the defence industry in delivering capability but
also that industry must change to meet the evolving demands of our
Armed Forces and the current&#163;16 billion procurement
budget. Britain&#146;s forces face a multitude of challenges in
today&#146;s world and are doing their job magnificently, but Her
Majesty&#146;s Government must ensure they have the equipment and
training to meet threats they may face in 20 to30
years&#146; time. It is a daunting and complex task.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_743"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 743</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101776000005"></a>My noble friend on the
Front Bench has made an impressive start with the DIS. The White Paper
and his personal commitment to its speedy implementation have received
warm praise from industry. As he said at Farnborough last July, there
have already been concrete, practical results following on from the
DIS. There has been the appointment of the MoD&#146;s commercial
director, which should enhance the ministry&#146;s commercial
awareness and understanding. The McKane review, Enabling Acquisition
Change, looking at through-life capability management, has been adopted
by Ministers. The DPA and DLO are to be merged to create one
procurement and support organisation, which incidentally will save
&#163;200 million. Implementation teams have been established, and a
&#163;1 billion strategic partnering arrangement has been signed with
Augusta Westland to produce the future Lynx helicopter. In the armoured
fighting vehicles sector, a partnering agreement has been agreed with
BAE Land Systems.</p><p><a name="06101776000006"></a>A
&#147;Team Complex Weapons&#148; has been created, with a number of
planned programmes in the pipeline. The upgraded Harrier GR9 aircraft
has entered service with the Royal Navy, on cost and on time. The MoD
has also signed a five-year support agreement with VT Shipbuilding to
maintain HMS &#147;Clyde&#148;, the first ship to be built at
Portsmouth&#146;s naval base in nearly four
decades.</p><p><a name="06101776000007"></a>These
are all impressive achievements, but like my noble friend we are
anxious to hear of yet more progress. The Minister has said that he
hopes for a memorandum of understanding signature by the end of the
year regarding the necessary transfer of technology before the purchase
of the Joint Strike Fighter goes ahead. Can he update your
Lordships&#146; House further on this point when he sums up the
debate
later?</p><p><a name="06101776000008"></a>Noble
Lords will be aware of the concerns expressed of late that the DIS is
perhaps overambitious in some respects, particularly in its
implementation timetable, the necessary change in behaviour required on
all sides and the question of affordability. I hope that the MoD will
be able to allay these fears when the Minister responds. To be
specific, I would like to refer to RUSI&#146;s recently published
report on industry responses to the DIS. Although the DIS is seen as a
very positive initiative, there was some scepticism about whether the
Treasury would make the necessary money available for the MoD&#146;s
desired capabilities and equipment plan. Her Majesty&#146;s
Government must ensure that the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review
supports the DIS&#146;s aims, especially since through-life
capability management requires the commitment of funds over long
periods, allowing for future
upgrades.</p><p><a name="06101776000009"></a>Retaining
appropriate sovereignty in vital sectors of the defence industrial base
may well involve a premium, and the MoD must be clear about what
capabilities and knowledge will be preserved onshore. More worryingly,
the Royal United Services Institute report identified that commitment
to the implementation of the DIS is not embedded at all levels and
across all organisations within the MoD.</p><p><a name="06101776000010"></a>There is a strong case for the
development of closer working relationships between civil servants in
the ministry and their industrial partners, for example by 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_744"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 744</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bringing industry and MoD IPT teams together at the beginning of a
programme and through joint training and more staff
exchanges.</p><p><a name="06101776000011"></a>Some disappointment has
been expressed about the slow pace of industrial consolidation in the
maritime sector and the development of the MoD&#146;s maritime
industrial strategy. Can the Minister comment on this&#151;he has
himself expressed disappointment&#151;and on the CVF future carriers
project, including how the maritime industrial strategy might impact on
the Type 45 and future Submarine programmes? I think we are entitled to
know whether the MoD has a workable plan for safeguarding this
country&#146;s maritime capability. Some fears have been expressed
that future hulls may be built abroad, a prospect alluded to in the DIS
White Paper.</p><p><a name="06101776000012"></a>The
issue of R&amp;T spending has been raised in a number of quarters,
including the Defence Select Committee in another place. The Minister
was kind enough to tell me in last June&#146;s debate that the MoD
planned for the research budget to rise in line with inflation over the
next four years. A recent study found that of 10 leading nations, the
UK is second only to the US on the military equipment quality curve.
But the fact remains that the MoD invested $4.7 billion on defence
R&amp;T in 2004 whereasthe United States research spending
alone reached $77.6 billion in the same year. UK private sector
aerospace and defence research investment has barely kept up with
inflation.</p><p><a name="06101776000013"></a>Today
we had the publication of a weighty document, the ministry&#146;s
defence technology strategy, which I have here&#151;I can see it on
the Benches opposite as well. It contains almost 200 pages of
interesting material, together with a list of 200 technologies and
2,000 sub-technologies which the MoD wants to nurture. I think some
questions arise from the publication of the strategy and, as we are
discussing the defence industrial strategy, perhaps the DTS would
require a debate of its own.</p><p><a name="06101776000014"></a>However, it will be
interesting to quote from one section of the report. On page 162, which
looks at the joint MoD and industry framework for investment, paragraph
C4.2 states:</p><ul><a name="06101776000024"></a>&#147;Against
this background, the DTS is affordable provided both MOD and industry
invest together, but there is much work needed on this ... The
next step is for MOD with industry to agree the principles of joint
funding via the National Defence Industry
Council&#148;.</ul><a name="06101776000023"></a>I
think we are entitled to ask the Minister how the MoD in practice will
achieve an increase in investment from industry in the defence
technology strategy, and how the technologies outlined in the strategy
will be developed. In short, where will the funding come from to
achieve the aims in the
strategy?<p><a name="06101776000015"></a>I
look forward to the Minister&#146;s response. I can assure him that I
for one stand full-square behind the aims of the defence industrial
strategy, which is designed to give our Armed Forces the best possible
kit, on time and at reasonable cost to British taxpayers, while
preserving appropriate technological sovereignty and a vital and
thriving UK industrial base.</p>

Levene of Portsoken:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful
to the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, for providing the opportunity of this
debate. I must declare an interest in this topic, apart from an
historical one, in so far as I am chairman of General Dynamics UK and
president of the Defence Manufacturers
Association.</p><p><a name="06101776000017"></a>The defence
industry has always been a crucial part of the UK industrial base, as
well as serving as the source of much of the material used by the UK
Armed Forces with great skill and success. The management and direction
of the industry has, however, seen many twists and turns, some
self-imposed, others imposed by the vagaries of successive Governments
and the pressures of international affairs. Overlaid upon this is the
way in which the industry has consolidated both domestically and
internationally.</p><p><a name="06101776000018"></a>None
of these elements can be properly considered or examined in isolation
from the others. Nevertheless, we are looking at the defence industrial
strategy, which needs to be considered primarily in a commercial
manner. By commercial, I mean on both sides&#151;by the Government as
purchaser and the industry as vendor. For this reason, I believe that
the appointment of the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, as a successful
industrialist, with experience of comparable issues, has been a real
success and the strategy which he has produced has the clear mark of
understanding. His task and that of his department is not easy, but
they must be allowed to carry it through without being diverted from
their clearly stated objectives. Such an outcome would certainly
benefit both the industry and the
Government.</p><p><a name="06101776000019"></a>The
UK industry has shrunk in recent years, both in absolute terms through
decreased demand and in the number of large companies present. For this
reason in particular, it is important to recognise that UK-based
subsidiaries of non-UK parents&#151;and here again I acknowledge an
interest in this area&#151;should be treated equally with purely
domestic participants. We do not discriminate against foreign-owned car
makers, which make up the majority of that industry in the UK. So,
provided that proper security safeguards are in place, we should behave
in the same way in the defence industry. In this way also, we can
benefit by not having to reinvent some very expensive wheels and by
optimising the use of available
technology.</p><p><a name="06101776000020"></a>The Ministry of
Defence has said that it is keen on partnering, but perhaps a word of
caution is needed here. Care must be taken to ensure that its potential
partnerships with a very small number of primes do not succeed in
excluding the smaller companies from the supply chain. In this country,
smaller companies have always played an important part in development
and production and must not be frozen out. They keep down cost,
encourage innovation and, by virtue of their size, can be much more
nimble than the major players. Coupled to the defence industrial
strategy, the Minister set out today his strategy for defence
technology. A quick r&#233;sum&#233; of that looks promising. If we
can end up with a UK-type DARPA, I hope that we can reap some of the
benefits that the United States has done in that area.</p>

producing what I thought was a compelling case to combine the
procurement and logistic functions. I have to say that at that time,
the then Defence Secretary, the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, and I found
ourselves in a minority of two and unusually, I must admit, we were
unable to proceed. I have always believed that thatis the
correct solution&#151;and so, again, I must congratulate the Minister
on successfully launching this
initiative.</p><p><a name="06101776000022"></a>Unhappily, today,
much of what is in production is needed in action almost immediately.
This is a phenomenon to which we have been unaccustomed for some years,
so it makes it even more important that we get it right the first time.
I believe that the approach of the Minister and his department gives us
a good chance of achieving that goal and his efforts deserve our
support. I look forward to hearing from him this evening on the further
progress that has been
made.</p><h5><a name="06101780000043"></a>9.14

Jones:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend
Lord Truscott for this timely debate and for his informed comments. I
am glad to follow the noble Lord, Lord Levene of Portsoken, who carries
to these subjects an immense authority that I cannot
match.</p><p><a name="06101780000002"></a>The
British economy needs the defence industrial strategy to succeed. There
is not much manufacturing industry remaining in our country, not least
those few manufacturing industries still awash with skills, training
and leading edge high technological achievement. Moreover, if our
defence industry prospers, then parallel, allied and dependent
commercial industrial projects will remain viable. A case in point is
EADS in Europe, a huge defence industry concern across Europe and the
parent company of the Airbus business which has nationally important
production centres in Britain, not least in my own country of
Wales.</p><p><a name="06101780000003"></a>Will my noble friend the
Minister indicate that the A400M military transport will go forward
into production with the UK order of 25 aircraft? Where does the A400M
stand now in EADS&#146; order of priority? I say that in the
knowledge that Airbus UK has a big interest in that. Will my noble
friend report on the prospects of EADS manufacturing the Future
Strategic Tanker Aircraft? This will be the largest ever MoD PFI
project should EADS carry the day with its Airbus A320 modified
aircraft.</p><p><a name="06101780000004"></a>But
tonight&#151;I declare my interest&#151;my great concern is for the
workforce at the Welsh production centre in Broughton, North Wales.
There in Flintshire there are 6,500 plane makers. Many have been
engaged in making the wings of the A380 superjumbo. They are just about
the finest aerospace workforce in the world. That is my belief although
I am biased as I still live there. That workforce wants EADS to move in
a direction where there is no political interference. They are not
responsible for the delays in A380 production. They know that Britain
is a multi million pound customer of EADS. They know that the British
aerospace industry is Britain&#146;s last remaining large-scale
skills-based manufacturing industry, employing tens of thousands. Our
industry earns annually billions of pounds for our 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_747"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 747</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nation through its exports. My own longstanding personal knowledge of
the 6,500 strong Broughton workforce is that they have delivered on
every challenge for EADS, BAE and Airbus. I want them to continue to
produce high tech, world class wings free of the pressures of EADS
boardroom crises. I want that for the prosperity of our nation and
particularly for my own country of
Wales.</p><p><a name="06101780000005"></a>In January 2005 I was
present at the A380 superjumbo rollout in Toulouse. I saw the President
of France, the Chancellor of Germany and the British and Spanish Prime
Ministers. Each spoke with pride and passionate conviction about one of
their biggest ever investments. That was a moment of European unity and
supreme optimism before 4,000 aerospace engineers, technicians and
managers. Those national European leaders hailed the most successful
aircraft manufacturer in the world. But some 20 months later the
company is in massive disarray and is apparently fighting, if not for
its life, certainly for its credibility. Tens of thousands of employees
throughout Europe, particularly in our country, have an interest in the
situation getting
better.</p><p><a name="06101780000006"></a>I ask
my noble friend the Minister to work hard, as he always does, to
dissipate the tensions between France and Germany and, as we are a big
customer of EADS, to seek to develop better corporate governance so as
to shore up its position in the heart of Europe as a global commercial
and defence company.</p><p><a name="06101780000007"></a>Another
look back; as long ago as 1973 I was present in Toulouse at the first
rollout of the first Airbus and the first Concorde on the very same
day. It was a magnificent and historic day in European aerospace
history. The British Minister, who spoke under a cloudless sky in sight
of the glistening snows of the Pyrenees, was the noble Lord, Lord
Heseltine, who has already been referred to. He spoke effectively, and
he represented all those hopes for aerospace and manufacturing in
Europe. But now, I ask my noble friend to help to knock EADS into
shape, to revitalise Airbus, and to give the Welsh wing-makers of
Broughton in Flintshire fresh heart and some certain
guarantees.</p><h5><a name="06101780000044"></a>9.20

Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde:</b> My Lords, I, too,
thank my noble friend Lord Truscott for securing this debate this
evening, on an issue that has had a lot of coverage over the past 12
months, including a report that attracted a lot of complimentary
statements. The Minister has been complimented this evening already,
and I will not add to that. I am sure that he is quite pleased at the
response that he has had. I will just say that when we had the defence
industrial strategy review last year, most of us recognised running
through it the thread of a real hard-nosed commercial management
approach, which was very welcome. It was a very important development
in our strategy. It is true, as other noble Lords have said, that this
sector has in it some of our most highly-skilled workers. It is a
sector that we are very good at, and which attracts good engineers and
good skills of different types. I say to my noble friend 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_748"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 748</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Jones that I have not been to Broughton, but I have been to Filton
in Bristol and seen the work that people are doing
there.</p><p><a name="06101780000009"></a>The aim of the industrial
strategy was an engagement with the industrial base of this country to
meet the Armed Forces equipment requirements on time and at best value.
That is a laudable aim, which has never been captured over many years
of seeking to do just that. I expect tonight, 10 months after the
strategy was published, that the Minister will probably report varying
progress. I would be amazed if there were not certain tensions in the
MoD and frustrations at perhaps not making some of the progress that
had been expected. That is life and that happens. The important thing
is that we do not let go of the intentions of the industrial
strategy.</p><p><a name="06101780000010"></a>One of the areas is
the consolidation of the naval sector, including the important
discussions that are taking place&#151;although the decision has been
taken&#151;on the new carrier for the Navy. We still have not got to
the gateway process on that. That is a very important step, and I am
sure that causes as much frustration in the MoD as it does to those of
us outside it who are following it very closely. I read in the press at
the weekend about talks between BAE and VT about possibly coming
together. It will be interesting to hear from the Minister if he has
any details on that.</p><p><a name="06101780000011"></a>I gather
that there is also some concern in the sector at the fragility of the
nuclear-powered submarine industrial base. Where are we going on that
and what is the future of it? The merger of the Defence Procurement
Agency and the Defence Logistics Organisation has already been welcomed
this evening, many years late though the noble Lord, Lord Levene, may
feel it is. It is welcome, and it is the right thing to happen, but
they are two very different organisations. They are culturally very
different indeed. I seek an assurance from the Minister that we will
not be faced with what I call decision blight in the period of the two
organisations coming together. That is the worst thing that could
happen.</p><p><a name="06101780000012"></a>The Joint Strike Fighter
is an issue that keeps coming up, and will rightly do so until the
issue of transfer of technology from the United States is concluded. I
am aware that the Minister put up a robust performance before the
Senate committee in the US, and that was very welcome. I just hope that
the outcome ensures that when we have the Joint Strike Fighter and it
needs attention, the work can be carried out by our technicians here
and that we get the transfer of the technology that we
need.</p><p><a name="06101780000013"></a>The defence industrial
strategy specifically mentions autonomous air vehicles. Earlier this
year, I and a number of noble Lords visited BAE Systems at Warton,
where we saw some of the innovative work being done there. This is
certainly an area of great innovation and has great promise. But will
the MoD will support that type of work and, if so, how? Both progress
on the Joint Strike Fighter and the autonomous air vehicle impact
directly on the ability to sustain a fixed-wing aerospace capability;
they are interdependent and we are looking at the next stages of
technology.</p>

industrial strategy. It has stalled over a number of years and if I was
talking in other circles, I would ask: does it still have legs? Is it
still a reality? It is there in the industrial strategy, but I am not
sure whether any progress has been made. Has the MoD yet reached a
decision on its requirement and acquisition strategy&#151;two
important aspects in regard to FRES? My noble friend the Minister will
be aware that the issue comes up regularly in questions asked at our
meetings with him at the House of Lords Defence Group, which I
chair.</p><p><a name="06101780000015"></a>It is good that we
actually have a strategy that we can discuss, because we did not have
one before last year. It is good that we have a robust strategy about
our country&#146;s industrial base, with our country&#146;s skills
and technologies involved in it. It is a mighty challenging exercise
that is at the forefront of technology in so many areas of our lives. I
wish the industrial strategy well and I thank the Minister for the work
that has taken place in the past 12 months, but it would be good to
hear an update on some of the issues that are exercising many
people&#146;s thinking.</p><h5><a name="06101780000045"></a>9.27

declare an interest. I am a consultant to Curtiss-Wright and Leafield
Engineering, a small British defence contractor. I have only a short
contribution to make to this
debate.</p><p><a name="06101780000017"></a>When the defence
industrial strategy was originally published, it was welcomed by Mike
Turner, the chief executive of BAES, who said that it was a very good
reason for BAES to stay in the United Kingdom. This came as a bit of a
surprise to those of us who thought that BAES was the biggest defence
contractor in the United Kingdom and we did not know that it ever had
any intention of going.</p><p><a name="06101780000018"></a>I have
two questions for the Minister. To what extent did the defence
industrial strategy change the relationship between BAES and the
Ministry of Defence and, if the rumours in the press are correct and
BAES is taken over by Boeing, does that relationship then change
again?</p><h5><a name="06101780000046"></a>9.29

Garden:</b> My Lords, I too thank the noble Lord,
Lord Truscott, for arranging this short debate on the important topic
of the defence industrial strategy. I declare an interest as a member
of a small group of defence specialists known as the RUSI Acquisition
Focus. We have taken as our task to follow the DIS and its
implementation closely. When we think it is helpful, we publish reports
on various aspects as they
happen.</p><p><a name="06101780000020"></a>The first report from
the RUSI Acquisition Focus
concluded:</p><ul><a name="06101780000039"></a>&#147;Implementation
is the key. It needs to change the fundamentals, particularly culture
and behaviours in both industry and MoD, but however worthy the aims of
the initiative, it will fail, as the promising Smart Acquisition
initiative failed, unless there is strong commitment and leadership
from the top over an extended period&#148;.</ul>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_750"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 750</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06101780000035"></a>As we have heard from your Lordships
tonight and in the past, we think that we have someone who can give
that commitment and leadership from the top. The question is whether it
can be over an extended
period.<p><a name="06101780000021"></a>As I opened the now 10
month-old defence industrial strategy White Paper, I turned again to
the photo gallery at the front of all the signatories from the Ministry
of Defence, the DTI and the Treasury&#151;all the Ministers who
signed up to the strategy. I have to tell the noble Lord that he is the
only one still in the same job 10 months later. That is more than a
cheap shot about turbulence in Government. It is important that there
is continuity for the introduction of this complex and long-term
initiative. The problem of turbulence in posts and keeping engaged
people who know what is going on is also true at the lower levels. Has
the Minister had any success in reducing the personnel turnover within
his area of management?</p><p><a name="06101780000022"></a>When I
responded in your Lordships' House on15 December 2005 to the
Statement which launched the defence industrial strategy, I said that I
welcomed,</p><ul><a name="06101780000041"></a>&#147;the
strategy&#146;s clear set of priorities; number one: the operational
capability and getting the technology to do the job; and number two:
value for money&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/12/05; col.
1411.]</ul><a name="06101780000036"></a>It is against those
criteria that we must keep judging progress. As the noble Baroness,
Lady Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde, said, it has been going only a fairly
short time in which to judge progress. We cannot expect to see great
changes and there will be undoubted tensions over how it develops.
Given that we are in a co-operative mood this evening, perhaps the
Minister will share with us in his reply the areas that he thinks are
moving less fast than he would have hoped. Where are the difficult
areas at the moment?<p><a name="06101780000023"></a>In that
first debate, I also highlighted the potential tension between the
desire to give industry long-term planning stability and, at the same
time, to meet the near-term operational demands. I happened to choose
section B5 on helicopters as my example. As I pointed out
then&#151;nearly a year ago&#151;we
needed,</p><ul><a name="06101780000042"></a>&#147;heavy-lift
helicopter capacity for Iraq, Afghanistan, for UN operations, for
conflict prevention and for humanitarian relief. We cannot provide it
if we are putting all our money into attack and maritime helicopters in
order to promote an industrial strategy. So what I see is that, even at
this early stage, we are shaping the future of our operational
requirements around an industrial strategy&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, 15/12/05; col.
1413.]</ul><a name="06101780000037"></a>The
Minister&#146;s response was to
say:<ul><a name="06101780000040"></a>&#147;We recognise
that we must address that within our overall rotor-craft strategy and
we are doing so. We are making the extra investment to enable us to do
so&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/12/05; col.
1416.]</ul><a name="06101780000038"></a>Yet,
as we know only too acutely, the near-term problem is still with us a
year later. I do not ask the Minister to rehearse again all the urgent
work that he is doing to get lift-helicopters for our current
operations. It is the wider point that I hope he will address. How does
he see a long-term strategy for stability for industry working when the
strategic context is changing so rapidly, and often
unpredictably?<p><a name="06101780000024"></a>Of
course, it is not just the security environment that is in a state of
flux; there is also the question of the industrial environment. Indeed,
the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, in the gap
highlighted one aspect of that. BAE Systems is very much favoured 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_751"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 751</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by the strategy as a repository of national defence and aerospace
capability, yet it is an international company. It now has as many
employees in the United States as in the United Kingdom. This week, the
<I>Sunday Times</I> was speculating, as the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton,
said, about the prospect of a takeover of BAE Systems at some stage by
Boeing, and there is also the possibility of Rolls-Royce being taken
over by an American company. I think that both are unlikely in the
short term but they are not impossible scenarios in the medium term. I
would be interested to hear how the Minister views his ability to
factor in those uncertainties into a defence industrial strategy which
has to project national capabilities into the long
term.</p><p><a name="06101780000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Levene, as always, with his great experience, made an important
contribution to this debate. I remember his time at the Ministry of
Defence, balancing how much we favour particular industries and what
that means in terms of their ability to develop into efficient
industries.</p><p><a name="06101780000026"></a>On the
implementation side, the Defence Select Committee identified some areas
for further work, some of which have been mentioned already. I am sure
that the Minister will update us on how they are progressing. The key
area that has been mentioned is research and technology. It has seen a
long-term decline in funding; something that everyone involved in this
business has worried about.</p><p><a name="06101780000027"></a>This afternoon, I was delighted to claim
the only copy of the defence technology strategy available in the House
of Lords. I went to the Library where I was told, &#147;You will be
careful with it, won't you? We have only one copy&#148;. I went to
the Printed Paper Office where the staff said &#147;That is very
interesting: it has no command number, no reference number and no date,
so we cannot order it&#148;. Actually, they said that they would try
to order it from the Ministry of Defence. Obviously, we have not had
time to absorb everything in this document but its status is a little
uncertain. It is not a White Paper; and it is not a dated document from
the Ministry of Defence. Is it a pamphlet giving us the thoughts of the
Minister or is it government policy? How are the companies that will
read this with great interest to take this document? Certainly those in
the Printed Paper Office have not seen a document come out in such an
anonymous format.</p><p><a name="06101780000028"></a>Nevertheless, we have
been asking for priorities in terms of research and the strategy gives
us that. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, for telling
me what I did not know: that we have a figure for the funding of the
R&amp;T side, which is going to rise in line with inflation. In other
words, it will not rise in real terms at all. The funding is too
little; it has declined; and we have a problem because we are not
investing anything like the amount invested in the United States. How
does the Minister think, at that kind of funding level, he will close
or stop the gap increasing in relation to United States technology?
What thoughts are there for doing more with our European colleagues, in
terms of pooling resources&#151;each nation spending little packets
of money and not achieving anything very
much?</p>

Committee also looked at small and medium-sized enterprises. They are a
vital part of the United Kingdom&#146;s defence industrial base, but
they have great problems in getting their voices heard in the Ministry
of Defence against the big companies. In my quick skim of the
technology strategy document, I saw mention of how SMEs will be
involved. But in terms of bidding for the main contracts and getting
involved, what has the Minister managed to do this year to try to bring
in the SMEs?</p><p><a name="06101780000030"></a>The
Select Committee also highlighted the further work required in the
maritime sector. The noble Lord, Lord Truscott, also mentioned that.
The press has suggested that the Minister has been applying pressure to
speed up developments in this area. I hope that this evening he will
share with us what progress he has
made.</p><p><a name="06101780000031"></a>Since we last debated the
DIS, as the noble Lord, Lord Levene, and the noble Baroness, Lady Dean,
highlighted, we have had the July announcement of the merger of the
Defence Procurement Agency and the Defence Logistics Organisation. That
is a massive amalgamation. I agree with the noble Lord and the noble
Baroness that it is right and overdue. However, we have only just
completed the creation of the DLO, where the savings that were assumed
were rather slower in coming than had been planned for. I would be
interested to hear whether the Minister is confident that the DLO is
ready for this next big step change and what assumptions have been made
about new savings. One of the problems is that one cannot get this done
if the savings are forced too
quickly.</p><p><a name="06101780000032"></a>Everyone
who looks at defence acquisition seems to agree that the key need is
for cultural change. Does the Minister agree that that is fundamental
and, if so, how does he think he is going to achieve
it?</p><p><a name="06101780000033"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord
Truscott, highlighted, looking ahead, the most important issue is
resources. At the moment, funds are needed for urgent operational
needs. We hear of them every day: operational bonus payments, vehicles
and helicopters. Yet funds are needed to make this strategy work. Is
the Minister confident that he will get the funding to support his
strategy?</p><p><a name="06101780000034"></a>Then
there is the balance of the equipment programme. I have avoided using
tonight as an occasion to debate progress on particular procurement
projects, but the noble Lord, Lord Jones, mentioned a number of them.
They are important, but I want to focus on strategic issues for the
future. As we look forward, we have the problem of a somewhat
unbalanced programme, which now focuses on maritime issues&#151;the
carrier programme and the possible replacement of Trident&#151;at a
time when all our current operational needs are on the land warfare
side. We are buying aircraft that do not have close air support
capabilities, but that is what we need. Does the Minister agree that we
are at a stage when his colleagues in the Ministry need to look at
reviewing defence policy so that they can better inform his defence
industrial
strategy?</p>

occasions, I have suggested to the Minister that we should have a
debate in government time on his important defence industrial strategy.
Therefore, I am moderately pleased that he has prevailed upon the noble
Lord, Lord Truscott, to pose the Question before us that will enable
the Minister to give an account of progress. This debate is not exactly
what we asked for, but it is better than nothing and I am grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, for sponsoring
it.</p><p><a name="06101782000002"></a>I echo the noble
Lord&#146;s praise of our Armed Forces and, as he said, they must
have the equipment to ensure that they do their job properly. I also
echo his point about the vital importance of safeguarding the
nation&#146;s maritime capacity, but, unlike him, I did not have the
luxury of sight of the defence technology strategy document before this
debate. I echo the protestations made by the noble Lord, Lord Garden,
and I look forward to hearing from the Minister the good reason why we
did not get a chance to consider that very important document before
this debate.</p><p><a name="06101782000003"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Levene, who has great experience in the defence procurement and
manufacturing industry, spoke with great eloquence, and I am looking
forward to reading closely his speech in <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow. I
also listened carefully to the important points made by the noble Lord,
Lord Jones, about the world-class high-tech defence industry in Wales.
Like him, I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response on
the future of the A400M and the future strategic tanker aircraft. The
noble Baroness, Lady Dean, welcomed the hardnosed, commercial approach
of the DIS. She is hoping for progress on the carrier project, as are
we. I look forward to the Minister touching on that subject and also on
the JSF and FRES. As the noble Baroness said, she chairs our defence
group, and I would like to put on record how much I appreciate her
outstanding leadership of that important group. My noble friend Lord
Hamilton asked two interesting questions on BAE Systems, and I look
forward to the Minister&#146;s response to
them.</p><p><a name="06101782000004"></a>I anticipate that the
Minister's response generally will refer in some detail both to the
McKane report, published by his department in June, and to the defence
research report similarly published at the start of October.</p><p><a name="06101782000005"></a>I hope, if with rather less confidence,
that the noble Lord will also address <I>The Defence Industrial

quote:</p><ul><a name="06101782000022"></a>&#147;An outcome of
the Defence Research Report is the &#145;wish list&#146; of
technologies which the MoD is said, in Press Reports today, to wish to
nurture&#148;.</ul><a name="06101782000016"></a>The most
significant outcome of the McKane report is, of course, the proposal to
amalgamate the roles of the Defence Procurement Agency and the Defence
Logistics Organisation.
<p><a name="06101782000006"></a>We accept the case for
big-ticket items such as tanks, ships and aircraft to be handled
seamlessly through their operational life by one authority.
Nevertheless, the creation of an enormous department

mobile phones threatens to create a completely unwieldy
operation.</p><p><a name="06101782000007"></a>It is a
superficially simple decision, but the scope for procedural
difficulties, and indeed for obstruction, is almost unlimited. We are
concerned that attention to the inevitable issues that will arise from
this extensive reorganisation will serve to distract attention from the
demanding work involved in bringing the core objectives of the DIS into
effect&#151;a concern of industry, as expressed in the RUSI report.
It would be disastrous if MoD officials devote the next two years to a
fixation with implementing this huge
merger.</p><p><a name="06101782000008"></a>The proof of success
will lie in an acceleration of the procurement cycle to bring it more
up to speed with the cycle of technological advance; a direct and
effective communication and understanding between the Armed Forces, as
users of the equipment, and industry, as the designers and
suppliers&#151;or, as the RUSI report which I have mentioned puts
it:</p><ul><a name="06101782000023"></a>&#147;Post-DIS the Front
Line must be able to influence acquisition more
directly&#148;.</ul><a name="06101782000017"></a>It will
also lie in a shorter, quicker and more reliable supply chain and a
significant reduction over time in the working capital tied up in the
procurement and logistics processes and
chain.<p><a name="06101782000009"></a>There is much else that
is interesting and welcome in and arising from the McKane report and
the report on<I> Maximising Benefits from Defence Research</I>. But the
very limited time available tonight does not allow me to dwell on them,
or on the hundreds of technologies identified as meriting nurture, as I
want to highlight some of the points in the third document, the RUSI
analysis of industry responses, and to invite the Minister&#146;s
response to them.</p><p><a name="06101782000010"></a>I have already
mentioned industry&#146;s reported concerns that the knock-on demands
of the DPA/DLO merger should not divert attention from the basic
objectives of the strategy, and that the avowed intention to bring
industry and the front line together to mutual advantage should indeed
be effected.</p><p><a name="06101782000011"></a>This will involve
very considerable culture changes by all concerned, the Armed Forces,
industry and the MoD itself as the clearing house. Industry&#146;s
current observation, as reported, is
that,</p><ul><a name="06101782000027"></a>&#147;commitment to
the implementation of DIS is not reflected at all levels and across all
organisations within
MoD&#148;.</ul><a name="06101782000018"></a>Does the
Minister accept that this is indeed the fact? If so, how is he and
those working with him, rather than those who may not support his
ideas, planning to change
this?<p><a name="06101782000012"></a>Industry also sounds a
series of warning notes about many of the implications, direct and
indirect, of &#147;partnering&#148; as described in the strategy.
This is probably the point in the original DIS which causes the most
difficulty to me and to my right honourable and honourable friends in
the other place.</p><p><a name="06101782000013"></a>As the report
says, and we
agree:</p><ul><a name="06101782000024"></a>&#147;Long-term
partnering with MoD should not be exclusive to a few
companies&#148;.</ul>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_755"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 755</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06101782000019"></a>So far, the Minister has concluded
agreements with Augusta Westland, in respect of helicopters, and MBDA,
in respect of missiles. Perhaps the Minister can tell the House with
what other companies he is in negotiation. The report
continues&#151;and again, we
agree:<ul><a name="06101782000025"></a>&#147;We must fully
understand the purposes of different partnering and alliancing models,
which may involve more than two
actors&#148;.</ul><a name="06101782000020"></a>Of course,
such is the case with the prototype allowance to take forward the
Carrier project. The report
continues:<ul><a name="06101782000026"></a>&#147;The
necessarily elaborate contractual arrangements may not be
feasible&#148;.</ul><a name="06101782000021"></a>We believe
that to be a valid cautionary
note.<p><a name="06101782000014"></a>In the
same context, the report is concerned about the position of small and
medium-sized enterprises&#151;the SMEs mentioned by the noble Lord,
Lord Garden. Again, we share that concern. SMEs are widely and
correctly seen as a source of innovation and a contributor to
flexibility. Those are qualities that we want to
cherish.</p><p><a name="06101782000015"></a>The
development of the DIS has a considerable way to go if it is to attract
our support on that point. When the Minister presented his strategy to
this House last December, I warmly congratulated him on producing the
document to time and gave a cautious and qualified welcome to its
content. In a similar sense, I congratulate him tonight on having
sustained the momentum as he has. I am sure that he understands to a
substantial extent&#151;not completely&#151;the problems that lie
ahead of him and I look forward with interest to hearing what he has to
say tonight. Although I cannot assure him of our wholehearted
endorsement on every point, I can say that, in general terms, we are,
and will show ourselves, broadly supportive of what he is trying to
do.</p><h5><a name="06101789000021"></a>9.52

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord
Drayson):</b> My Lords, I welcome the debate that we
have had this evening on the defence industrial strategy and thank my
noble friend Lord Truscott for securing it. I also thank all noble
Lords for the very constructive tone that they have taken this evening,
which they also take in our conversations outside the Chamber, and for
their work.</p><p><a name="06101789000003"></a>I
value the approach of constructive criticism which has described our
debate on the defence industrial strategy. That is also reflected in
the nature of the wider debate and conversation taking place between
industry and the Ministry of Defence in this area. Reports from ongoing
studies by organisations such as the RUSI further contribute to that. I
wholeheartedly welcome the work that the RUSI has done and note the
contribution that noble Lords make to it. It is very important, in
implementing something as complex and important as the defence
industrial strategy, that we maximise our opportunities to address the
challenges. I hope that I can help to move that forward this
evening.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_756"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 756</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101789000004"></a>The defence industrial strategy aimed to
set out a clear vision of the future for procurement to meet the needs
of the Armed Forces. For the first time, it gave clarity in terms of
putting the needs of the Armed Forces first and setting out a decision
structure for the Ministry of Defence to stick to in how we implement
procurement decisions. I have aimed in my role as Minister for Defence
Procurement to push the department to reform to drive these
improvements and, at the same time, to create a virtuous circle of
change with industry. Both sides must recognise that that change is
rewarded on both sides. Maintaining that momentum is at the heart of
what I aim to do.</p><p><a name="06101789000005"></a>Several noble
Lords, in particular the noble Lords, Lord Astor and Lord Garden, have
highlighted the vital importance of small and medium-sized companies;
the very largest primes are not the only ones that are important. It is
vital that we maintain companies that are global players in the defence
industry, but it is as important to ensure that we have the complete
value chain of companies&#151;a healthy defence industry&#151;and
that we in the Ministry of Defence ensure that we enter into long-term
partnering agreements in a way that does not prejudice the interests of
small and medium-sized companies. We are putting several initiatives in
place to ensure that that does not happen. I will touch on that in a
moment.</p><p><a name="06101789000006"></a>I shall give an overall
update on the implementation of the strategy. The noble Lord, Lord
Garden, has highlighted the difficult context in which we are
operating. There is no doubt about it. The pace of change is speeding
up. The noble Lord, Lord Levene, who has tremendous experience in this
area, has highlighted how we are using our defence equipment in an
operational context to a much greater extent than we have done for an
awfully long time. There has been no need in the recent past for speed
in introducing defence technology into current operations, but we need
that now to reflect the speed at which the threat changes in
operational theatres and the pace of change both industrially, as noble
Lords have mentioned, and
technologically.</p><p><a name="06101789000007"></a>The answer to
the challenge facing us is to ensure that we give structure to our
defence industrial strategy&#151;and to our defence technology
strategy today&#151;which the Ministry of Defence will stick to in
the medium term. That strategy should, however, be sufficiently
flexible to shift resources, as required, to reflect operational need.
To answer directly the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Garden, we
have an opportunity in that we are entering a phase with a spending
review that involves going through the usual process of rebalancing our
equipment programme. For the first time, however, we are doing that in
the context of a clear defence industrial strategy, as my noble friend
Lady Dean has mentioned, which sets out a framework that allows the
Ministry of Defence to look across projects and to look at industrial
capability and not simply at projects in isolated
silos.</p><p><a name="06101789000008"></a>The Ministry of Defence
has also developed the ability to look from a commercial standpoint at
how we trade off within a capability, and to take intelligent decisions
on individual equipment projects with our 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_757"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 757</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>eyes open to the extent of their impact on our industrial capability.
There is no doubt that we have to put defence needs first, but our
decisions must take into account the wider industrial context to ensure
that we have the strategic capability that we need in the
future.</p><p><a name="06101789000009"></a>I am grateful to my
noble friend Lord Truscott, who has gone over several of the important
areas of progress that we have already made this year. I want to
highlight the key challenges that remain, rather than the successes
achieved. We have shown that today with the publication of our defence
technology strategy. To be clear, it is a document of MoD policy that
sets out our delivery of a commitment, which we published in the
defence industrial strategy, to provide a defence technology strategy
this autumn. It clarifies to industry our research priorities and
recognises that a key driver of military capability is coming from
research. Today, we are living off the fruits of the investment made
about 20 years ago in defence research. It identifies the areas of
priority for the research community, and it clearly signals a shift in
balance. It says that we must move to a more mixed economy in how we
incentivise industry to carry out defence research, and we must
incentivise by engaging more widely&#151;that relates to the point
made by my noble friends and the noble Lord, Lord Levene. We must not
reinvent very expensive wheels. We must make sure that we leverage
research which is being undertaken in other countries and that our
defence technology strategy gives clarity on areas such as the priority
for research and the balance in funding that we need to see between
early stage research and later development. Frankly, we have put too
much emphasis on the late stage development; we have not invested
enough in some emerging technologies at the early stage.</p><p><a name="06101789000010"></a>Secondly, there is the issue of too much
of our defence research and technology being directed by the customer
only, with the Ministry of Defence telling industry and the academic
community, &#147;This is what we require for the future&#148;
without encouraging people to invest in taking risks. We incentivise
industry so that where it has taken risks and invested, we provide it
with a greater
return.</p><p><a name="06101789000011"></a>The
initiatives that we have announced today are taking us towards a
DARPA-like model. There is an awful lot we can learn from the successes
enjoyed by the United States with DARPA, given that we have a smaller
budget. We have announced three important initiatives. The challenge we
have announced is DARPA-like but in a completely different area, which
is really important for the Ministry of Defence. We have announced a
competition for ideas&#151;a &#163;10 million programme to
incentivise a wider engagement of the challenges in defence within the
scientific research community. We are trying to engage people who would
not normally be engaged in defence research.</p><p><a name="06101789000012"></a>These are practical
initiatives to change the culture. A number of noble Lords mentioned
the importance of changing the culture. That is about the long-term
process, and I recognise that whereas it is important
to 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_758"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 758</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have leadership from a ministerial team, the cultural change will come
about only as a result of being embedded throughout the Ministry of
Defence organisation. We are, I believe, achieving that.</p><p><a name="06101789000013"></a>We are implementing the
change that has resulted from the conclusions of the McKane study, and
we are meeting our schedule. My experience in business has made me
aware of the dangers of dropping the ball in a merger and not
delivering the organisation&#146;s performance. However, we have made
progress: we have approved and appointed a defence commercial director;
we have identified that the Permanent Secretary is the senior
responsible owner for the merged organisation; we have a dedicated
two-star programme director; we have identified the leader of the new
merged organisation; we are clear on the top-level management; and we
will, by April, have in place the support structures to ensure that
performance and accountability in the merged organisation is
delivered.</p><p><a name="06101789000014"></a>I will touch on some
of the questions about specific programmes. The matters raised by my
noble friend Lord Jones about the aerospace industry, particularly
relating to EADS and Airbus, have been mentioned in the press a lot
recently, and my noble friend needs a
response.</p><p><a name="06101789000015"></a>The A400M is an
important component of our future military capability. We expect the
company to provide those aircraft on time under the contract. Of
course, a company going through the turbulence that Airbus has gone
through leads to concerns about whether there are problems relating to
the A400M project itself. We have expressed our views clearly to the
management of the company. I have not visited Broughton but I have
visited the Filton facility and have seen for myself the work that is
going on there. It is important to stress that the Government&#146;s
policy is that we wish to see Airbus, as a part of EADS, develop as a
global aerospace and defence company with its heart and soul in Europe
but without political interference. We know that the future of that
company will depend upon it establishing good corporate
governance.</p><p><a name="06101789000016"></a>I am supporting my
right honourable friend the Secretary of State in discussions with the
company, and I know that its management is directed toward that end. We
are working hard to ensure that, in this time of turbulence for the
company, it has the support and clarity from the British Government to
help it through that transition. The indications are that it will, but
we need to monitor the situation very carefully.</p><p><a name="06101789000017"></a>There were specific questions from a
number of noble Lords relating to the maritime programme. In essence,
the maritime sector is the most challenging within the defence
programme. I am more optimistic because of the progress that I have
seen being made on the aircraft carrier programme, and the alliance
structure working well within it. However, I really need to see
progress before the end of this year.</p><p><a name="06101789000018"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, asked a
specific question relating to British Aerospace and Boeing. The latter
has said on the record that it is not interested in pursuing that
particular acquisition. It is interesting to see that Boeing has, in
response to the 


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_759"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 759</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>defence industrial strategy, taken a decision to build up its
intellectual property assets here in the United Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06101789000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Levene, asked whether we see a level playing field for companies whose
shareholders reside outside this country. Absolutely; we have the most
open defence market in the world and are committed to maintaining that.
We are concerned to see that we maintain the intellectual property and
skills in this country. That is why we believe the policy is starting
to bear fruit in that direction.</p>

other programmes, which I do not have the time to go into in detail
this evening. I will write to noble Lords to answer their questions. I
welcome and will encourage further debate on this important area, and
will look for future opportunities to further provide the discussion
that the noble Lord has requested. I am absolutely willing to engage
with him in future on those matters.</p><ul><ul><ul>House adjourned at seven minutes past

honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (John
Hutton) has made the following
Statement.</p><p><a name="06101751000013"></a>I am publishing today
the Opportunity for all&#151;Eighth Annual Report 2006 (CM 6915-i
and CM 6915-ii) of the Department for Work and Pensions. It
will provide a progress update on the department's seventh annual
report published in October 2005 (Cm 6673). The report sets out our
strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion, and reports on the
indicators used to monitor progress. Copies have been placed in the
Library.</p><p><a name="06101751000014"></a>We are committed to
achieving a fairer, more inclusive society where nobody is held back by
disadvantage or lack of opportunity. I am pleased to report that
significant and sustained progress has been made on a range of our
indicators. Forty of our 59 indicators now show an improving trend over
time.</p><p><a name="06101751000015"></a>Overall, there are now
700,000 fewer children living in relative low income than in 1998-99
(before housing costs) and around 440,000 fewer children in households
where no one works. There are 2.5 million more people in work, with
unemployment the lowest for 30 years. Ethnic minority groups and
disabled people have seen improvements in their employment rates since
last year.</p><p><a name="06101751000016"></a>One million fewer
people of state pension age are in relative low income and more than 2
million fewer are in absolute low income compared with
1997.</p><p><a name="06101751000017"></a>This year's Opportunity
for all report consists of two documents&#151;our strategy and the
indicators document. The strategy document presents an overview in the
&#147;life-cycle&#148; approach, clearly setting out our progress
to date. It draws on relevant departmental five-year strategies and
other key documents, setting out how we will achieve both our short and
longer term targets. A chapter on child poverty sets out the
cross-government strategy which will deliver on our aim to halve and
eradicate child poverty and to ensure that all children have the best
start in life. It outlines how many, and which, children experience
poverty, and its consequences. It describes the progress that has been
made so far to address child
poverty.</p><p><a name="06101751000018"></a>The indicators document
provides an important annual audit that monitors the progress of the
Government&#146;s strategy to tackle poverty and social exclusion.
These reflect the multidimensional nature of poverty and social
exclusion at different stages in people's lives, including health,
education, housing, income and financial
well-being.</p>

Poverty and social exclusion are deep-rooted problems that have built
up over many years. Tackling the root causes of poverty takes time as
well as commitment and investment. It also requires a partnership
across all sectors of society which recognises that rights and
responsibilities go hand in hand. However, this report shows that we
are now starting to see real signs of equally deep-rooted and lasting
change that will help individuals and communities take control of their
lives and break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and
deprivation.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61017-wms0001.htmstate_1"></a><a name="06101751000003"></a>Foreign

Minister for Europe (Geoff Hoon) has made the following Written
Ministerial Statement.</p><p><a name="06101751000023"></a>I wish to
make a Statement to the House on the Gibraltar trilateral
forum, following the successful ministerial meeting in
Cordoba, Spain on 18 September
2006.</p><p><a name="06101751000024"></a>In consultation with the
Government of Gibraltar, the trilateral forum was established in
December 2004 by my right honourable friend the former Foreign
Secretary (Jack Straw), and Spanish Foreign Minister (Miguel Angel
Moratinos). It was hailed at the time as a major breakthrough for
relations between the UK, Spain and Gibraltar. It gave rise to genuine
optimism that we could set our historic differences aside and discuss
practical issues that affect the people of Spain and
Gibraltar.</p><p><a name="06101751000025"></a>I am delighted that,
after almost two years of intense negotiations, the trilateral forum
has borne fruit. For the first time, the UK, Spain and Gibraltar have
negotiated together a three-way package of agreements. These
demonstrate that we can work together to make a real difference to the
quality of lives of people in the region despite our well-known
differences on the question of
sovereignty.</p><p><a name="06101751000026"></a>A key feature in
the forum is the full and equal role the Government of Gibraltar play.
Chief Minister Peter Caruana has shown considerable leadership and
vision and has shaped the direction of the talks and negotiated
constructively throughout, including on

remiss of me not to pay a particular tribute to Senor Moratinos and the
Spanish Government. He and Prime Minister Zapatero have, I believe,
shown courage and foresight in pursuing a more constructive policy
towards Gibraltar.</p><p><a name="06101751000027"></a>The substance
of the agreements we have reached in September is ground breaking. They
will deliver practical benefits to the people of Gibraltar and the
surrounding region in the short
term.</p><p><a name="06101751000028"></a>The airport agreement will
benefit the people and businesses of Gibraltar. Gibraltar&#146;s
exclusion from EU aviation legislation is to be lifted and Spanish
airspace restrictions will end; there will be a new terminal; and a
greater choice of flights from Gibraltar, including to Spain and other
European destinations. This will be a huge economic boost to Gibraltar.
All sides are agreed that the arrangements on the airport have no
implications for sovereignty, jurisdiction, or
control.</p><p><a name="06101751000029"></a>On the border crossing,
the introduction of red and green channels into Spain and two-lane
access into Gibraltar should improve pedestrian and traffic flows. This
is potentially a key development for the many people who cross the
frontier for work, business and leisure
reasons.</p><p><a name="06101751000030"></a>On telecoms,
Spain&#146;s recognition of Gibraltar&#146;s international dialling
code +350 will improve cross-border communications. And Gibraltarian
mobile phone users will shortly be able to use their mobiles to dial
home when travelling in
Spain.</p><p><a name="06101751000031"></a>Finally, a settlement to
the long-running question of pensions payments for former Spanish
workers in Gibraltar will, I believe, bring to an end a dispute which
has been a priority for the current Spanish Government. As part of this
settlement, Spain has agreed not to charge the pensioners&#146;
healthcare costs to the UK (as it was entitled to do under EC
Directives). This agreement therefore represents good value for money
to the UK taxpayer.</p><p><a name="06101751000032"></a>The next
step is of course to make the trilateral agreement work. The full and
timely implementation of the agreement is vital as people will not
judge the forum by its statements, but by what happens on the ground. I
can promise that the UK Government will spare no effort to deliver the
agreements we have reached. I am entirely confident that the
Governments of Spain and Gibraltar will also implement the Cordoba
agreements. They are a package and all sides are agreed that they must
be implemented as a whole: there can be no
cherry-picking.</p><p><a name="06101751000033"></a>We will now look
to build on these agreements to explore future areas of practical
co-operation. With continued commitment from all sides, I believe we
can make a thing of the past the tensions that have for far too long
characterised cross-border
relations.</p><p><a name="06101751000034"></a>I am placing copies
of the Cordoba ministerial trilateral forum communiqu&#233;, and the
annexes on the airport agreement and the pensions statement in the
Library of the House.</p>

Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06101751000036"></a>The Ministry of
Defence has today launched the Defence Technology Strategy (DTS)
setting out the technologies that are most important to the future
provision of military capability for our Armed Forces. The DTS builds
on the Defence Industrial Strategy White Paper published in December
last year and has been developed in close collaboration with industry
and academia. It outlines the research and development priorities on
which we must work together to encourage innovation in support of the
UK&#146;s front-line
forces.</p><p><a name="06101751000037"></a>This strategy will help
MoD and industry to plan future investment in research and development
(R&amp;D). It identifies clear R&amp;D priorities, including those
areas in which we believe it is important to maintain
sovereign control. It highlights opportunities for collaboration and
addresses long-term support to the UK's science and technology skill
base.</p><p><a name="06101751000038"></a>Included in the strategy
are several initiatives to support and encourage innovation and the
science and engineering skill base in the UK. These include a
competition of ideas, which will provide rapid funding for innovative
research proposals from industry and academia in areas of particular
importance to defence, and a grand challenge to produce an autonomous
or semi-autonomous system designed to detect, identify, monitor and
report a comprehensive range of physical threats in a complex urban
environment. Both have been designed to stimulate free-ranging
innovation from the widest possible science and technology
base.</p><p><a name="06101751000039"></a>The Defence Technology
Strategy sets clear direction for the future and is the foundation for
a vibrant and innovative research and development relationship between
MoD, industry and academia. It will ensure that the UK Armed Forces
continue to benefit from the highest level of technological research
and innovation.</p><p><a name="06101751000040"></a>Copies of the
Defence Technology Strategy have been placed in the Library of the

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS77"></a><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column WS77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101751000042"></a>The Ministry of Defence (MoD) welcomes the
court's judgment that the scheme's criteria do not directly
discriminate on the grounds of race and that it was legitimate to limit
payments to those with a close link to the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06101751000043"></a>The MoD accepts the
court's finding that theway the Government chose to define
that close link&#151;introducing the &#147;birthlink&#148;
criteria&#151;involved unjustified indirect discrimination against
those of non-United Kingdom national origins. We will not be seeking
leave to appeal.</p><p><a name="06101751000044"></a>The purpose of
the birthlink criteria was to provide an administratively manageable
way of paying more British subjects, not fewer. It wasnever
the MoD's intention to discriminate against Mrs Elias or anyone else on
grounds of race. Nonetheless, in the light of the court's judgment,
which the MoD accepts, the department recognises the hurt
unintentionally caused to Mrs Elias personally and will pay her the
compensation that the court ordered, plus interest. Mrs Elias had
already received an <I>ex gratia</I> payment of &#163;10,000 under
the scheme pursuant to changes to the scheme's eligibility criteria
that were announced in March of this year. Those changes meant that
those who have resided in the UK for at least 20 years between the end
of the Second World War and November 2000, when the scheme was
introduced, qualify for a
payment.</p><p><a name="06101751000045"></a>Civilian claims
submitted after the High Court judgment on 7 July 2005 have been, and
will continue to be, decided only on the basis of the other,
residence-based, criteria, based either on normal residence in the
United Kingdom before the war and return to United Kingdom shortly
afterwards, or at least 20 years&#146; residence in the United
Kingdom between 1945 and November
2000.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61017-wms0001.htmstate_5"></a><a name="06101751000007"></a>NHS

Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor (Lord
Falconer of Thoroton):</b> I wish to make a Statement
on the development of the Supreme Court for the UK in the light of
recent progress since the matter was last discussed in the House on 24
July 2006.</p><p><a name="06101751000052"></a>The Supreme Court
Implementation Programme is on target to deliver the Supreme Court at
Middlesex Guildhall in time for the start of the legal year in October
2009.</p><p><a name="06101751000053"></a>As the
House knows, we submitted an application for listed building consent
for the Middlesex Guildhall to Westminster City Council on 5 May 2006
and this application was considered at the council meeting on
7 September 2006. Throughout this process we have consulted widely with
Westminster City Council, English Heritage and with the local amenity
societies and local residents. Westminster City Council planning and
city development committee resolved unanimously to grant the
applications for planning and listed building consent, subject to
formal authorisation from English Heritage and the completion of the
Section 106 agreement.</p><p><a name="06101751000054"></a>We are
currently working with English Heritage and Westminster City Council to
finalise the terms of the s106
agreement.</p><p><a name="06101751000055"></a>In
parallel with the planning application, we have now appointed Kier
Group plc as our preferred bidder and we are in commercial discussions
with them prior to agreeing the final contract. We expect to reach
financial close with Kier Group early in the new
year.</p><p><a name="06101751000056"></a>The Middlesex Guildhall
construction project remains within the capital construction cost
estimate of &#163;30 million (at 2004 prices) as detailed in my
Statement of 14 December
2004.</p><p><a name="06101751000057"></a>The capital construction
costs involved in the refurbishment of the Middlesex Guildhall will be
met by regular charges over a 30-year period as part of the lease and
leaseback arrangement we are using and I will be in a position to make
a Statement on these annual charges when we have achieved financial
close. The asset value of the refurbished building, which may be
different from the capital construction costs, will be recorded in the
department&#146;s balance
sheet.</p><p><a name="06101751000058"></a>In addition to the
capital construction costs, the implementation of the UK Supreme Court
will incur other costs such as DCA professional adviser fees, the
project team costs and the non-capital element of the fit out costs
including loose furniture, IT services and library
books.</p><p><a name="06101751000059"></a>The Middlesex Crown Court
will cease sitting on 31 March 2007. We have developed detailed
transition plans in conjunction with the judiciary to manage the
relocation of court work, judges and staff. The intention is to create
extra courts at Isleworth Crown Court. On 21 March 2006, the planning
committee of the London Borough of Hounslow refused planning permission
for these extra courtrooms. On 25 May, an appeal was lodged against
this decision and our appeal is due to be heard on 15 and 16 November
2006. We expect to hear the outcome of our appeal early in the new
year.</p>

million people from their homes. Many of them now live in camps,
fearful to return home.</p><p><a name="06101751000064"></a>The UN
has called for a total of &#163;2.5 million for the fund. This will
help to pay for the running costs of the mediation secretariat in
overseeing the peace talks. The fund will also support the team that
was created to monitor the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, signed
between the Government of Uganda and the LRA on 26
August.</p><p><a name="06101751000065"></a>Since April 2005, the UK

holder to work in the United Kingdom to participate in the UK-China
Graduate Work Experience Programme otherwise than in accordance with
the Immigration Rules.</p><p><a name="06101751000068"></a>The
UK-China Graduate Work Experience Programme will enable Chinese
graduates up to the age of 30 to experience and develop a greater

benefit of the UK. China is the fastest growing major economy in the
world and is therefore a critically important country in terms of the
global economy and consequently in the UK's future position in the
global economy. It is in the UK's interest to do everything possible
now to develop links with the Chinese
economy.</p><p><a name="06101751000070"></a>I am placing copies of

possible for separate elections to be held on the same day for more
than one vacancy in the same ward or division of the same local
authority or parish council, as electoral law does not require that a
combined election be held in these circumstances. It would be for the
returning officer to decide how the elections are run. We have not
carried out a formal assessment of holding such elections separately.
An advantage might be that it would be clear to electors that there was
more than one vacancy to be filled. The disadvantages would be that
there would be duplication of election processes, such as printing of
separate ballot papers for each vacancy, which would add to the cost of
running the elections and make the procedure more complicated for
electoral administrators and electors. Information is not recorded on
cases where such elections have been held separately. The Government
have not issued any advice to local returning officers concerning this
procedure.</p>

continue to call on Israel to resume transfers of withheld Palestinian
tax and customs revenues which are essential in averting a crisis in
the Palestinian territories. Israel collects customs revenues for the
Palestinian Authority under the terms of the 1994 Paris protocols.
Israel suspended these payments after the opening of the Palestinian
Legislative Council on 18
February.</p><p><a name="06101756000035"></a>We also continue to
make representations to the Israeli Government regarding the closure of
the Gaza crossing points, in particular Karni. Our ambassador in Tel
Aviv last raised this issue with the Israeli Prime Minister's foreign
policy adviser on 5 October. The closure of the crossing points,
especially around the agricultural seasons, has a detrimental
effect on the Palestinian economy. We hope that both parties will act
on their commitments under the November 2005 movement and access
agreement.</p><p><a name="06101756000036"></a>We have no plans to
make representations to the Israeli Government regarding the legality
