I cannot exceed the eloquence with which tributes were paid in another place today by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Soldiers have lost their lives and our condolences and sympathies go to their families. They fought to make Afghanistan more secure and, above all, to make Britain a safer place from terrorism and extremism, which continues to threaten us from the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan. I pay tribute to their courage, skill and determination; they will never be forgotten. I believe the whole House would endorse those sentiments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="09110490000003"></a>President Karzai was the clear choice of the Afghan people and on 2 November he was formally declared the winner by the official Afghan election authorities. We now look to him to drive forward a programme that represents the interests of all Afghans. The international community is right to be in Afghanistan to ensure that that country continues on its forward path and never again becomes a safe haven for al-Qaeda. Our policy to achieve this remains consistent and firm.</p>

<a name="91104-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09110490000005"></a>I thank the Minister for his reply. I do not share his optimism, not least about President Karzai. Does he agree that against the corrupt and discredited background of President Karzai, we cannot have any confidence in him thwarting the fraud and corruption that has been so much a foot-mark and stigma of Afghanistan in recent years? Against that background, does not the Minister agree that we had a certain tune to play but we now need to change it? Is it not right that we should have a new policy on Afghanistan, possibly with the Americans, that will decide afresh how best to help the Afghans and to deal with al-Qaeda?</p>

We have the word of the newly elected leader of the choir&#151;the Government of Afghanistan, who in many eyes are inefficient and corrupt&#151;that he will remove the stain of corruption from Afghanistan. He has to appoint a Government with new Ministers and to carry forward to the country as a whole that commitment to the fight against corruption and terrorism. We need to assist him in that and guide him where possible. To abandon or change the policy would not necessarily do anything to help Afghanistan and could be damaging to the United Kingdom.</p>

However, we should not allow ourselves to be distracted from the fact that failure in Afghanistan&#151;and we are quite close to it, in my view&#151;or withdrawal would have baleful consequences, including abandoning the clear majority of Afghans who want us to be there while only 5 per cent support the Taliban. That would mean that al-Qaeda was able to expand from a small area of northern Pakistan where it is under pressure to a large area in the south of Afghanistan where it is not, the inevitable collapse of the Pakistan Government and jihadi hands far too close to a nuclear weapon. It would mean deepening the instability of the world&#146;s most unstable region, and a mortal blow both to NATO and to respect for it throughout the world, on which we depend. By the way, it would also mean a severe blow to our moderate Islamic friends who are courageously fighting a battle against jihadism and medievalism in their own religion in favour of its true values of tolerance and civilisation. These are consequences that ought to be in our mind at this moment, are they not?</p>

We are seeking to assist diversification from that crop and others. I am sure that knowledge of vast sums of money to be extracted from the ground in the form of minerals would be in the interests of the Afghan Government, the United Kingdom and others. We are not in this alone; there are 43 nations tasked with bringing normality to Afghanistan, as it has been put. That would be in its interests but&#151;do not forget&#151;in ours as well.</p>

Does the Minister agree that the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies have resulted in serious civilian casualties and the alienation of the population, producing angry recruits for terrorism, and that together with the Americans we should now, with development, using our military resources, provide security exclusively to protect the strategic rebuilding of the country that is urgently needed?</p>

There is broad support. They have been subject to coercion and intimidation by the Taliban and behind that, in its own way, by al-Qaeda. Those are the two enemies, and we need to bring along with us the majority of Afghans in government and in the public to appreciate that we are there to help that country. The end game that the right reverend Prelate seeks is one that we agree on, but I do not accept the first premise in his question.</p>

He said, &#147;If I was you, I wouldn&#146;t start from here&#148;. The truth is that we are starting from where we are: from a country which has been dominated by coercion and intimidation. We have had the first election in 30 years; we have corruption; but we have honest politicians, honest governors and honest Afghans&#151;we have a candidate who fought the election on tackling corruption. We therefore need to sustain and support the Government, and particularly those parts of Afghan society that want to change the country in the way in which we want it to change; that is, to a fully democratic state, with the rights of all its citizens protected.</p>

If it did, it would not be good for those farmers&#146; well-being or health. If tagging equipment fails on prisoners, those who use that equipment are never penalised in their pay, so why should the farmers be?</p>

I am grateful for his interest, which has occasioned letters to my highest authority&#151;namely, the Prime Minister, who is perhaps not the most reverend Primate&#146;s highest authority&#151;as well to my Secretary of State.

However, does the Minister not agree that it is a tragedy that we are debating the matter at all? Is it not a triumph of EU bureaucracy over our democracy and an example of the democratic deficit that lies at the heart of the EU experiment, which will surely lead to its downfall?</p>

Others have embraced the regulation more enthusiastically. The Spanish and the Italians, for example, are already implementing the system. However, the noble Lord will give credence to the fact that it is being introduced as an animal health measure, against a background where, in 2001, Britain in particular paid an enormous price for foot and mouth disease. Europe has pursued a strategy which is not fully consonant with what we would have wished. That is why we have worked so hard to effect the policy in a way that minimises its impact on farmers.</p>

Despite the very welcome concessions to this scheme that the Government have negotiated it will still be a modest, but important, financial imposition on these farmers.

As far as help is concerned, we are on the brink of major negotiations regarding reform of the CAP and, whatever their view of the European Community, I doubt whether there is a single noble Lord who does not agree that the CAP needs reformation&#151;if I can use that word in this context.

She said that the amount and range of activity offered to prisoners was described as outstanding, with almost all prisoners able to engage in education and work, which provides high-quality skills and some training related to employability. She did, indeed, make the comments that the noble Baroness mentions. However, the noble Baroness will know that we are implementing the recommendations of my noble friend Lord Carter in his review of value for money in the Prison Service, including a framework of costed specifications for all services delivered in prisons and probation. Benchmarking has highlighted the range of variation in cost and performance for the same service being delivered in different prisons. By encouraging expensive or underperforming services to improve, we think that we can deliver cash savings and, more importantly, improve the effectiveness of our work with offenders.</p>

That will free up resources for essential frontline work in prisons and probation. However, I have to throw the question back to the noble Lord to some extent. His party&#146;s schemes for prisons would add something like 15,000 prisoners overnight to the prison population and would cost more than &#163;2 billion. I also understand that this part of his party&#146;s policy is not one of those parts that it has said will not have cuts. I am not sure where his party stands on this issue.

That logjam has not been broken but simply transferred from local prisons to Garth. There are some 200 young men serving those sentences without any possibility of gaining parole from that prison. What does the Minister propose to do about that? And please do not ask me to give our answer.</p>

Of course, Her Majesty's inspector talked about various issues and problems at Garth, but I repeat that she said that the prison was doing extraordinarily well. It is a category B prison, which has in it a number of prisoners who could well be in high security prisons. It has a lot of pressures but has done extremely well. One difficulty with the system is that a number of prisons do not do so well, and the important thing is to bring the standards up from those prisons to that of Garth.</p>

We therefore intend to return government stakes in banks to the private sector at the earliest and most prudent opportunity. Any decision will consider value for money to taxpayers, financial stability and protecting depositors&#146; money. Mutualisation would be considered with other options on this basis.</p>

Does he recognise that this is a unique if not historic opportunity for remutualising or mutualising a number of the failed financial institutions that the Government now own? Does he agree with the Oxford Centre for Mutual and Employee-owned Business, which reported at length in September? It recommended that the creation of a number of mutuals would enhance competition in the high street and encourage diversity, at little net loss to the taxpayer, and that such mutuals would be less risk-based than those institutions that were there before.</p>

He will have appreciated from my reply that we are considering all these matters, but in due course. There is no question of decisions being taken in the very immediate future, because they are very important decisions to take. As I indicated in my original Answer, we take on board the arguments that he presents to the House.</p>

However, I accept her point. Among the calamities that we had during that dreadful period a year to 18 months ago was, in fact, a mutualised society, the Dunfermline, which showed that the sector is not entirely proofed against difficulties. Nevertheless, I think that the House will recognise that a number of the casualties involved institutions that had been demutualised in recent times.</p>

The existing mutuals&#151;the 50 building societies and the very many mutual insurance companies&#151;would be asked to put up some money for that mutuals&#146; mutual, which would also be backed by a government loan. That would then mean that the new mutual would, because of its size, be able to give services that the smaller mutuals cannot at present. Would the Government encourage that to happen?</p>

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="09110490000062"></a><b><a name="91104-0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09110490000606"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Lord Young of Norwood Green):</b> My Lords, Amendment 130 is a drafting correction to ensure consistency between Parts 3 and 4. In moving it, I will speak also to Amendments 131, 132 and 133. The latter amendments raise concerns about the timing and proposals around the new role for regional development agencies. I recognise these concerns and will explain the background.</p>

<a name="91104-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09110490000063"></a>At the point that we created the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which sponsors both regional development agencies and the LSC, there was opportunity to reflect on the landscape in which the Skills Funding Agency will sit. In particular, we wanted to address significant concerns from business and other sectors about the overlap in roles between RDAs and the Learning and Skills Council. This analysis identified a compelling case for simplifying the landscape by embedding skills within the single integrated regional strategies agreed by the joint local authority and RDA partnership boards. Not only would this remove any potential duplication, it would also place skills firmly within economic development strategies. I understand the possible issues that this proposal may have raised in the context of this Bill and I believe that it may be helpful for me to provide reassurance to the House on a number of points about which I know noble Lords are concerned.</p>

<a name="91104-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09110490000064"></a>First, why did we not announce this in the House? The main reason is that we wanted, before coming to a decision, to discuss the proposal with local authorities, regional development agencies, business sector organisations and other interested parties. That was the purpose of the letter from my noble friend Lord Mandelson to Jim Braithwaite in July. We are currently considering the responses we have received, most of which recognise the strong case for this change.</p>

<a name="91104-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09110490000065"></a>Secondly, why does this change not require any amendment to the Bill currently before the House? The Bill is intended to establish the chief executive for the Skills Funding Agency as a statutory post-holder with specific funding responsibilities. It does not try to set out in detail every single function of the chief executive. So in the case of strategy setting, these functions are not described in this Bill, and because my department sponsors the regional development agencies, we can require them to take on this new role in respect of skills through administrative means. However, the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill is putting in place the legislative framework for the single integrated regional strategies, which will now include skills. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will sign off these strategies and will ask the Skills Funding Agency to contract accordingly, ensuring that the agreed sectoral, regional and sub-regional priorities are met.</p>

<a name="91104-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09110490000066"></a>I recognise that this is important context to the work of the Skills Funding Agency and, therefore, I welcome the opportunity for a full debate about it now. I know some have argued for a more sectoral approach. I would like to reassure the House that we are committed to ensuring that sectoral priorities are met under these arrangements. Our proposals will ensure that regional, local and sectoral needs are

As I said earlier, we have written to a range of organisations about the proposals, including sectoral organisations such as the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils. Through the formal signing-off arrangements with the Secretary of State, we will make sure that the regional strategies include the sectoral priorities relevant to each region. We will be holding an event with the sector skills councils and other relevant organisations to make sure there is an effective system in place which meets the needs of the sector skills councils and others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09110490000067"></a>On Monday, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, raised the issue of the importance of a bottom-up approach to strategy setting, with the involvement of all key partners. I would like to assure her that partnership is essential to the new system and I recognise the importance of involving local authorities. Partnership working is already happening in practice on the ground. The RDA and the local authority leader board in the West Midlands have recently written to Ministers emphasising how they are already working closely together to develop the single integrated strategy for their region and the importance they place on this as they build skills into those strategies. I am sure this good practice will be reflected across the rest of the country.</p>

<a name="91104-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09110490000068"></a>I understand that the intention behind Amendment 132 is to probe how these arrangements will work with city regions, such as London. Let me first give reassurance that these changes will not affect the powers which currently exist for Greater London. The mayor will have the same relationship with the Skills Funding Agency as he does with the Learning and Skills Council. Similarly, Manchester is currently undergoing an assessment of its employment and skills board proposal, and we expect it to be awarded equivalent powers to London in relation to the Skills Funding Agency in due course. Leeds has not yet established its employment and skills board, but we have committed to help it do that and to consider it for the award of the same powers, probably in spring 2010.</p>

<a name="91104-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09110490000069"></a>Leeds and Manchester are, of course, more complex than London because they sit within broader regions. In these cases it will be vital for the city and regional strategies to be fully aligned, so that the Skills Funding Agency has a clear and unambiguous statement of the skills needs on which to base its funding and contracting decisions. Manchester and Leeds city regions are putting protocols and agreements in place with their RDAs to make sure that their strategies align, and neither sees any difficulty in making this work. The Government will look at these arrangements and offer guidance to other areas which might in the fullness of time have similar issues.</p>

<a name="91104-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09110490000070"></a>I hope this provides reassurance to the noble Baronesses and that they will not press their amendments.</p>

As the noble Lord indicated, they relate to the role of regional development agencies in the development of skills strategy and were stimulated by the letter of 31 July from the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, to Jim Braithwaite of SEEDA, which I quoted extensively in Committee.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_259"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 259</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91104-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09110490000072"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Young, has to some extent pre-empted some of the questions that I had intended to ask. We are particularly concerned about two issues. One is, as he rightly indicated, that when the Bill was conceived, the role of regional development agencies was not written into it. The briefings that we received about the role of the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency and the Skills Funding Agency stated that each was to play a part in developing a skills strategy. The YPLA in particular was to work with local authorities and sub-regional authorities and look at the skills gaps at a local level. A lot of work has gone into creating these sub-regional authorities and the shadow administrations that have been set up. Having talked to local authority members who have been working on this, they are, on the whole, happy with the sub-regional authorities. Suddenly, out of the blue, comes the notion that all of this will not only be part of a regional skills strategy but that the lead will be taken by the RDA, that the skills strategy will be formulated at a regional level, and be binding&#151;certainly on the Skills Funding Agency. Whether it will be binding on the YPLA is left obscure.</p>

<a name="91104-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09110490000073"></a>As the noble Lord indicated, that eviscerates the notion of a bottom-up development of skills strategies. That depends a little on the size of a region. I was talking to my noble friend Lady Maddock, who comes from Northumbria. She said that her sub-region was, in truth, the same as the region, which was very small and the plan would work well. However, as the Minister knows, I come from the south-east which is a huge region of 11 million people. There are huge differences between Thanet and Milton Keynes. To suggest that you can formulate a regional skills strategy for the whole of that area is an absolutely absurd, top-down notion.</p>

<a name="91104-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09110490000074"></a>I do not know how many Members have had a chance to look at the publication by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills,<I> Towards Ambition 2020: Skills, Jobs, Growth&#151;</I>expert advice to the Government from one of the many organisations that litter this area of responsibility of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. It was about a simplification agenda. It is quite interesting. I shall read a paragraph concerned with all the areas that we have been looking at, in which the commission recommends:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09110490000233"></a>&#147;Reviewing and clarifying the future roles (if any) of, and relationships between, Regional Development Agencies, Regional Skills Partnerships, Multi-Area Agreements, Employment and Skills Boards, Neighbourhood Renewal Programmes arrangements and Local Authorities, in relation to skills provision and funding&#151;simplifying the range of organisations involved in shaping skills provision, removing duplication in the system, eliminating unnecessary structures, and unifying funding and contractual requirements&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110490000075"></a>One of the recommendations is for a review and a clarification of their roles. It is very carefully phrased. It refers to &#147;future roles (if any)&#148; of all these organisations, including the regional development agencies, so we remain extremely sceptical about their role.</p>

<a name="91104-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09110490000076"></a>We also think, as do other Members of the House, that these issues have been brought into the game late. They are not mentioned in the Bill, and the House feels that it has been slightly ignored with this new proposal just being brought in and swept through. The Minister said that we do not need legislation for this  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_260"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 260</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and that they can do it by diktat, in a sense. Fine, it can be done by diktat, but my Amendments 131 and 132 are designed to try to stop that. There is something to be said for limiting that.</p>

<a name="91104-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09110490000077"></a>My other amendment relates rather more specifically to a question that I raised in Committee about the overlap between this Bill and the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill, which envisages the development of integrated regional strategies with statutory economic prosperity boards&#151;not one economic prosperity board has been mentioned by UKCES&#151;allowing local authorities to come together to form multiple area agreements. In addition, the Budget 2009 announced that Greater Manchester and Leeds would become core cities. The questions that I was going to pose to the Minister, but which he has answered, are: will Greater London and the Mayor of London retain the powers of direction over adult skills and will the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction legislation be used to enable Greater Manchester and Leeds to create economic prosperity boards linked to their multiple area agreement, following London in creating statutory employment and skills boards, and giving them powers to direct the Skills Funding Agency?</p>

<a name="91104-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09110490000078"></a>This does pose questions. Can the Government reconcile regional skill strategies agreed between the Northwest Regional Development Agency of West Yorkshire and Humber and the relevant leaders boards if they are to be binding on the SFA, and any powers of direction over SFA funding which might be granted to Greater London and Leeds? The RDAs&#146; skills strategy decisions will be binding on the SFA, yet what will be the relationship between the SFA and core cities? To some extent the Minister has answered that with a straightforward yes, and that they will be just as in London. My question comes back to the central issue of the role of the RDAs. How far is it a top-down, labour-planning role? I wonder whether it is appropriate that the RDAs have that role or whether the original conception, as in the Bill, of a much more bottom-up process is more appropriate and should be retained.</p>

I also listened carefully to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, who, as always, put her finger on some of the key issues. I have to say to the House, as I have said before, that I am deeply concerned about this Bill because of what it is storing up for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09110490000080"></a>I mentioned the other day the words, &#147;Auftragstaktik&#148;, &#147;Fingerspitzengefuehl&#148; and &#147;simplification&#148; and I fear that we are once again in those three areas. We are seeing two separate agendas being played out in parallel. One is being played out in this House, based on the Bill: the Ministers and we are engaged in a debate on what is or might be on the face of that Bill. Outside this House, another and totally separate agenda is being conducted within ministries, initiated, I believe, in the new Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, from where a document has been sent to us all saying that there is no need for a legal framework for the dissolution of the Learning and Skills Council and transfer of functions and staff because it is provided  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_261"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 261</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill currently going through the Lords and expected to receive Royal Assent in the autumn of 2009. In other words, it does not matter a damn what we are doing in this House on this Bill because the Bill is going to pass and we are going ahead with it anyway; indeed, we have already started to make a lot of the provisions that are in the Bill for discussion.</p>

<a name="91104-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09110490000081"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, put her finger on the fact that, when we started discussing this Bill in Committee in June, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills was adopting a bottom-up approach. That ministry no longer exists and the new Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has inserted a top-down approach. Indeed, all the RDAs appear to have been gathered together into one department in the BIS where they sit together with the funding agencies under one empire, which is run by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="91104-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09110490000082"></a>We are told that RDAs are responsible for the skills strategy and are required to produce regional plans. We are also told that regional plans are subsidiary to national plans. By regional plans, we are talking about the nine produced by the regional development agencies, each of which has a different strategy, because their areas are different, complicated by the multi-agency area agreements, with sub-regional strategies for places such as Manchester, Leeds and now London. These regional plans, including those of the sector skills councils, are meant to be approved by the Secretary of State to ensure&#151;these are the words that I was given&#151;that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09110490000234"></a>&#147;there are no competing objectives&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110490000083"></a>Now, I am sorry, but that is an absurd objective because each of the regions has different capabilities, different perspectives and different strategies. Because of these regional differences, it is impossible to issue one coherent instruction without being involved in a compromise that may well damage all those strategies and sub-strategies that have been worked out to be appropriate for the regions.</p>

<a name="91104-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09110490000084"></a>To complicate this, I understand that there is another area of committees, which are not mentioned in the Bill. There is another organisation, which I did not know about until earlier this week, called the Regional Economic Council. The Regional Economic Council is chaired jointly by the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, and the Chancellor and consists of the regional Ministers, the RDAs and the regional economic forums plus the chambers of commerce. They are responsible for reviewing what is happening around the country and how successful the Government have been at combating recession. At a recent meeting of the council, the chambers of commerce were extremely concerned that the RDAs were representing a very different picture of what was happening, and particularly the employers&#146; point of view, from what the chambers of commerce, which are in touch with the employers, felt to be accurate. In other words, there is a definite feeling that people are going to that forum and representing to Ministers what they think Ministers want to hear rather than what is actually happening. That is very dangerous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09110490000085"></a>In the context of the Bill, there is also a new notion that, again, I had never heard of, called the NINJA, which stands for the new industry, new jobs agenda. We are talking about looking at the future of Britain and at the jobs that will be needed to take Britain out of the recession. In other words, we are looking at technologies 10 to 15 years ahead. If we were looking seriously at NINJA, surely to goodness we would be planning to make certain that not only are those technologies there and ready to go but the people to operate those technologies are trained and ready to go. If we think it through, that means that we ought to start influencing our 10 and 11 year-olds now to show an interest in all these activities. Those will not be the same in every region, so what is the point of having all this centralised, top-down direction when we know that each part of the country is different?</p>

<a name="91104-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09110490000086"></a>All I can detect in what is going on is confusion. I am seriously worried. While I do not in any way disparage all the work that a lot of people are doing, I detect that it is not clearly directed, starting from the basic premise that the one raw material that every country has in common is its people and woe betide it if it does not identify, nurture and develop the talents of all its people; if it does not, it has only itself to blame if it fails. I fear that this enormously complex situation, with two separate agendas being run at the same time, is likely to make the situation worse, which will damage the future of our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09110490000088"></a>It is difficult to believe&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, referred to this&#151;that over the summer such a dramatic change in policy could take place without due consideration for the process of scrutiny that was occurring in your Lordships&#146; House. I share the frustration of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, on this. It appears that the Government think that no amendments are required to the legislation, but does the Minister acknowledge that such a change in approach impacts materially and substantially on the operation and implementation of the proposals in the Bill? There should be proper time for assessment and analysis of this new approach.</p>

<p><a name="09110490000216"></a>He also tried to mollify my colleagues on these Benches, stating:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09110490000236"></a>&#147;In developing its skills strategy the RDA will be required to take account of the national priorities identified by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills and sector skills councils&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110490000217"></a>He went on to say that the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="09110490000283"></a>&#147;are not ignoring the vital role of sector skills councils&#151;as well as the skill requirements of local areas and any sub-regional multi-area agreement partnerships or employment and skills boards&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/10/09; cols. 330-31.]</ul>
<p><a name="09110490000218"></a>Nevertheless, that is hardly reassuring when taken in context with the fact that, we are told:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09110490000237"></a>&#147;Under this scenario, RDAs would be assigned the lead role in identifying, as part of their wider responsibilities for regional economic development, demand-side needs for skills in their regions. Those needs will be expressed in a regional skills strategy, led by the RDA, which will constitute an investment plan which would become binding on the SFA&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110490000219"></a>We are very concerned that this is an entirely different approach and an entirely new policy direction&#151;one with which we are very unhappy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09110490000090"></a>The job of the chief executive of the SFA, with all the different interest groups, has all the hallmarks of being almost impossibly complicated and frustrating.

I can only congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, on her assiduous reading of publications including the recent one from the UKCES.</p>

<a name="91104-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09110490000094"></a>The concern seems to be about the establishment of a giant, overarching RDA control, which would undermine the ability of local authorities to shape the requirements and&#151;according to those on the side of the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley&#151;somehow undermine and ignore the requirements of the sector skills councils. We do not believe that to be the case. Let me try to put it into context.</p>

<a name="91104-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09110490000095"></a>The skills strategies developed by the RDAs will be an integrated part of single integrated regional strategies agreed by joint local authority and RDA partnership boards, consistent with the sub-national review approach to devolution agreed across Government. The RDAs&#151;and I think this is a really important point&#151;will work closely with sub-regional and local partners. That is a point that I know greatly concerns the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. This includes local authorities, which will co-chair 16 to 19 regional planning groups, form an integral part of the sub-regional multiagency area partnerships, and the employment and skills boards. I stress that they will be required to sign off final strategies through their leaders&#146; board. Therefore, there is absolutely no point in RDAs seeking somehow to impose their analysis on sector skills councils or the local authorities. It has to be a partnership, and I agree that it has to be a bottom-up process. They have to be aware of the requirements of local authorities, and the requirements of employers represented on, for example, sector skills councils or other bodies such as chambers of commerce. This role is completely consistent with empowering sub-regions and local authorities.</p>

<a name="91104-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09110490000096"></a>I am not quite sure how to deal with the elaborately constructed conspiracy theory of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. There are two theories of history, as I am sure he knows. The conspiracy theory is one, but I tend to favour the other theory of history. I am not sure whether the language is parliamentary, but I am sure he is familiar with it. It is not a totally separate agenda., There is no question of having created a bottom-up approach that was suddenly destroyed on the creation of BIS; I speak as a former Minister in DIUS. I am sorry to disappoint him in what I see as almost a conspiracy-theory approach.</p>

<a name="91104-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09110490000097"></a>As for the new industry, new jobs agenda, of course we are committed to identifying people&#146;s talents, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, required us to be. Why does he think we commissioned the Leitch review? It was precisely for that reason. We recognised the paramount need to identify the skills required right across UK plc. We had to identify the programmes and policies that we needed to introduce&#151;hence the huge investment in training and apprenticeship programmes. I agree wholeheartedly with him that if we are going to develop the new industries in a low-carbon, green economy, we will need the talents of people, will need to start those training programmes and will need to capture the imagination of young people at the age he talked about. In some areas I agree with him, but not, if he does not mind me saying so, on what I felt was verging on the conspiracy-theory approach.</p>

I do not, and the department does not, want to see large regional bodies coming up with strategies which have not involved employers at grass-roots level. Certainly, I tried to make clear in my opening contribution the importance of involving the sector skills councils&#151;something I can remember from the early stages of this debate. We were led by the Sharp amendment to see the error of our ways in that area, so I genuinely recognise those concerns.</p>

<a name="91104-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09110490000099"></a>We were told that the House feels it has been ignored. That was certainly not our intention in the decision to make RDAs responsible for regional skills strategy. We have not yet taken the decision and we want to take account of the views expressed, including those from today&#146;s debate, so this is by no means a fait accompli. It is important to get this right. When decisions are made, we will ensure that the House is informed and has an opportunity to comment.</p>

<a name="91104-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09110490000100"></a>One of the major concerns was whether local authorities would have real input and influence. The answer is yes, they will have. The employment and skills boards will be required to sign off final strategies through their leaders&#146; board. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked whether the sector skills councils will be involved. Yes, they will be. As regards the idea that somehow RDAs will override the employment and skills boards, we have always been clear that employment and skills board strategies will need to be consistent with an overall regional strategy. However, it does not mean that they will have to forgo their role in shaping the overall strategy.</p>

<a name="91104-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09110490000101"></a>I think I have answered the concerns raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. I have come to respect the forensic ability of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, but he has now moved on to the syntactical analysis. Far be it from me to argue with him or the parliamentary draftsmen. However, I share his view that we want to remove any solecisms and to get the syntax right. Therefore we will send that proposal back to ensure that it makes sense.</p>

<a name="91104-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09110490000102"></a>I conclude on the important point. Will this be a bottom-up approach? Will we ensure that local authorities have a real voice and that it is heard? Will we ensure that the sector skills councils are involved? The answer is yes, we will and the views expressed today will be taken into account. We have not yet reached a conclusion in this area. I hope that with those genuine assurances the noble Baronesses will feel able to reconsider their amendment. We have an opportunity for further dialogue, if necessary, to reinforce those assurances, because I understand the crucial importance of this area. I commend Amendment 130 to the House.</p>

I am also left with many doubts about whether the old fashioned, top-down labour market planning with our single integrated strategies, our NINJA boards and all the rest of it, is the right way to do it.

<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_269"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>much improved one that would bring together the capital funding of the Skills Funding Agency and the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency into the necessity of creating a single capital building strategy.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09110490000107"></a>I do not wish to repeat the arguments that I made in Committee and weary the House with that. Nevertheless it is as well to remind ourselves that capital funding is vital for the growth of this sector and in order to bring to fruition many of the aspirations expressed from time to time in the jungle that the Bill represents. Unless we have a single strategy between the two agencies, it will make life almost impossible for the many institutions that have to deal with both.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09110490000108"></a>The first paragraph of my amendment is an attempt to bring both agencies together in the formulation of a single strategy for England, leaving out the universities. Paragraph 2 would require the chief executive of both agencies to consult local education authorities and the providers of education, which would immediately bring it back down to a local level so that local authorities would have an opportunity to take an overall view of the building needs of the institutions within their authority and the institutions would be able to input their own strategies.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09110490000109"></a>To ensure that everything was kept on an even course, paragraph 3 would require that the strategy, as revised by the consultation with the institutions and the local authorities, should be approved by the Secretary of State and a copy laid before each House of Parliament. The Secretary of State, of course, would be free to engage in dialogue again should she or he so wish in order to ensure that the national strategy could be approved by the two government departments.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09110490000110"></a>I am not arguing for precisely where the clause should be located. It would probably be better slightly earlier on, not after Clause 121, but that is a minor point. However, I commend to the House that we have in the Bill something that deals with a strategy for capital building. It is vital to development, as I have said, it has gone badly wrong in the past and, after the discussion we had in Committee where the concept of having some kind of provision to deal with capital funding received approval from all sides of the House, I am frankly disappointed that the Government have not brought something forward themselves. I beg to move.</p>

She is quite right that the question of who controls the capital budget has been left floating. The amendment has the great advantage that it sets up the joint committee, brings the two agencies together and provides a structure through which capital funding can be allocated. The mess that the Learning and Skills Council got into, even when there was one body, illustrates how difficult it is to keep control of the capital budget. If two or three agencies are involved with the capital budget, the ease with which it could fall between all those three stools is obvious.</p>

I hope that the Minister will see the relevance of it. As the noble Baroness said, it may not be in the right place, but the important thing is that it sets up the agency, so I warmly support it.</p>

I do not doubt that the draftsmen will find many faults as to where it is placed and how it links in, but I hope that the Minister will accept the principle that there must be one tap through which the money comes and one hand on it which turns it in an agreed direction at an agreed time. Otherwise, we will get into the kind of horrendous and expensive muddle that we have seen in the past. This is a simple, non-political, practical plea for seeing that our money is properly spent.</p>

<a name="09110490000114"></a><b><a name="91104-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09110490000624"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My Lords, when my noble friend Lady Perry raised this issue in Committee, it received strong support from around the Chamber. It is clear that something must be done to ensure that the two agencies work competently and effectively together.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09110490000115"></a>Two major issues are raised here which deserve consideration. The first, as raised with us by the Association of Colleges, is that the Learning and Skills Council has been criticised for its poor handling of the college capital programming and funding for sixth-formers. The Government hope with this Bill to replace the LSC with a series of interacting bodies which they hope will do a better job. In this context, therefore, it is important to consider what could be done to avoid future problems with the college capital funding programmes.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09110490000116"></a>The amendment tabled by my noble friend may well be an appropriate way of addressing the problem. It was suggested in Committee that a committee be formed to oversee capital funding as a single and coherent body. The Minister pointed out that the LSC had been charged with this responsibility and had not managed to oversee it successfully. A single committee structure alone, therefore, was not enough to solve the problem. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09110490000248"></a>&#147;We need to ensure that the YPLA, once it begins operating, has learnt from the problems with FE capital and has devised appropriate arrangements that minimise the risk to their capital resources&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110490000220"></a>Does he not agree that the amendment tabled by my noble friend might help to solve this problem? It merely asks that the chief executive of the SFA and the YPLA join together to form a single capital buildings strategy. This is more than just the creation of a committee; it asks for the agencies to have learnt from the problems and to work together to create appropriate arrangements which would allow capital funding to operate effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09110490000117"></a>The second concern is to do with the division of responsibility between the YPLA on one hand, which is responsible for the 16 to 19 capital funding, and the SFA on the other, which is responsible for the FE capital fund. The Minister stated that the YPLA will,</p>
<ul><a name="09110490000284"></a>&#147;need to have arrangements for working with the Skills Funding Agency where it has an interest in how the FE capital fund supports colleges&#146; 16 to 19 provision. We all agree about that&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/10/09; col. 97.]</ul>

<p><a name="09110490000221"></a>In other words, he, too, is concerned to ensure that the divide between these two agencies does not stop them operating effectively together. In light of this, we look forward to his response.</p>

I welcome that and hope that she sees what I say as a constructive assessment of the amendment, because there is no gap between us on the problem. It is a question of how we address it. I hope that I shall go a long way towards reassuring her on capital funding and the importance of a coherent approach.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09110490000119"></a>With regard to Amendment 138, I agree that it is critical that the capital investment plans are coherent across areas so that investment decisions for FE capital and 16 to 19 capital are able to support development of the infrastructure necessary to deliver increased participation, the full curriculum and qualification entitlement and the skills required by employers in our changing economy.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09110490000120"></a>However, the setting of overarching strategy is actually the responsibility of the two departments in consultation with the two agencies which in turn will instruct the two respective agencies to implement that strategy. In practice this will be done by the remit letter to the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency and the framework agreement between the Skills Funding Agency and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. We will require the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency and the Skills Funding Agency to work together and with local authorities to ensure that capital funding decisions take account of commissioning plans and regional skills strategies and that providers of post-16 education and training are consulted on the development of those plans.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09110490000121"></a>I appreciate the noble Lord&#146;s desire for statutory provision to be made for a single capital strategy and for this to be produced by the two respective bodies, not least by way of addressing previously debated concerns about the future administration of capital programmes and the recognised need for a joint approach between the two new bodies, as identified by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry. However, I do not consider it necessary to enshrine that in the Bill, particularly as the proposed amendment would impinge on the responsibilities of the respective departments for setting strategies. In asking the noble Baroness to consider withdrawing the amendment I will make this further commitment. I am happy to commit that the Government will produce an overarching, single capital strategy for post-16 education and training in England, excluding the higher education sector, and that we will consult both the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency and the Skills Funding Agency when doing so.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09110490000122"></a>There are some technical problems with the amendment but I do not want to focus on them. My concern is the same as the noble Baroness&#146;s concern: we need a coherent strategy and we need to give an explicit assurance that consultation with both the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency and the Skills Funding Agency will be required in deriving this single capital strategy for post-16 education and training in England, excluding the higher education sector.</p>

The amendment, for all its drafting faults, would not have overridden the responsibilities of the two Secretaries of State to be in charge of the strategy. It gives them the right of final approval of the strategies and indeed, on the model that the Minister has just outlined, the two Secretaries of State would have to turn to the two agencies in order to formulate their overarching strategy. I am grateful to the Minister for having come so far along the way and for his assurance of what will be the way things work. In the light of that I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This reflects concerns raised by noble Lords, and in particular the noble Lords opposite, in Committee. I hope the House will agree that it is a sensible safeguard to the exercise of this power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09110490000125"></a>On Amendment 142, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, we do not agree that local authorities will engage in costly and difficult interventions in sixth-form colleges in the way that he suggested in Committee. We do not believe that it would be in their interests to do so or that they would want to do so. Local authorities and sixth-form colleges have been working very closely in anticipation of the change before us. Both the Association of Colleges and the Sixth Form Colleges' Forum have agreed protocols with the local authority sector on how they plan to work together. These protocols include performance management. I hope that that offers the noble Lord some reassurance in dealing with his concerns.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09110490000126"></a>Schedule 8 also contains the safeguard of requiring local authorities to have regard to the YPLA&#146;s guidance on sixth-form intervention. This is a strong duty; local authorities cannot simply ignore the YPLA&#146;s guidance but must have strong reasons for acting against it, or they will expose themselves to potential judicial review. At the same time, &#147;have regard to&#148; gives the local authority an ability to tailor its response to specific circumstances of a particular sixth-form college. By contrast, the duty to &#147;act in accordance with&#148; in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment would force authorities and colleges to go through a rigid, inflexible procedure that may not be appropriate in all circumstances.

The Minister talked about &#147;have regard to&#148;. In the briefing provided by her department on Clause 128(6), which looks at &#147;have regard to&#148; from the other point of view&#151;the pressure put on Ofqual by the Secretary of State&#151;her officials quote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="09110490000250"></a>&#147;The phrase &#145;to have regard to&#146; means take into account. It does not connote slavish obedience or deference on every occasion. It is perfectly possible to have regard to a provision but not to follow that provision in a particular situation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110490000222"></a>That is exactly the trouble that I have with this clause.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09110490000128"></a>We are looking for the right balance of power between a local authority and a sixth-form college or further education college. It is in many ways an unequal balance, in that the local education authority has a great deal of influence over funding and the sixth-form college may, as many have in their years of independence, have grown not so much out of as way beyond the local authority in which they happen to be situated. They may provide services that do not accord with what the local authority thinks should be done locally or may provide them in a way that the local authority does not agree with. There are lots of reasons why a local authority might want to bring a sixth-form college to heel and to make it conform more closely to the local authority&#146;s view of how education should be provided in its area. I want the sixth-from college to be able to resist that.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09110490000129"></a>What the Government have done in drafting this section of the Bill is to bring over verbatim, or close to verbatim, the arrangements that existed between sixth-form colleges and the LSC. In those circumstances, there was not a great deal to worry about. The LSC did not have an agenda of bending sixth-form colleges to its will, and there was no basis on which it should have done. It was a national body with a national agenda and no reason to get involved in the detailed decisions of an individual sixth-form college, so the triggers that were put in place to allow intervention by a local authority are extraordinarily light. It is anything that the sixth-form college does to transgress any law or regulation.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09110490000130"></a>The department tried to give me comfort on this, by saying that it thought most sixth-form colleges were, at all times, perfectly law-abiding. If even Ministers cannot keep to regulations, how should we expect sixth-form colleges to do it all the time? The complexity does not just apply to educational legislation&#151;which I am sure that they keep a close eye on&#151;but to health and safety, discrimination and other any aspect of national legislation. As soon as the college transgresses in any way, the trigger is tripped and the local authority has the right to intervene. It has not just the right to stand there and say, &#147;Ah, you&#146;ve got to get yourself in order&#148;, but to take over the college, and the barriers  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_274"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that have been put in place for that are very slim. Yes, there is a convention between local authorities and sixth-form colleges at their organising bodies&#146; level, but that has no binding effect on local authorities or colleges in any individual case. Yes, there are provisions in administrative law, where I do not pretend to be an expert but, from reading the extensive and helpful advice provided by the noble Baroness&#146;s department, those appear to be pretty weak in practice.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09110490000131"></a>This will result in individual cases&#151;not, obviously, in every case, or in most cases&#151;where the local authority will be able to take effective control of a sixth-form college because it has the power to take actual control whenever it wants. That is a very undesirable state of affairs and will lead, over time, to some very undesirable outcomes in the independence of sixth-form colleges and their ability to do the best by their students. I am not comforted by what the noble Baroness has said, and if I receive appropriate comfort from my Front Bench then I shall certainly want to test the opinion of the House.</p>

Many of the amendments that we have been making in the course of this Bill have been toward simplification and clarity in administration. We hope that these will move in that direction. We certainly have sympathy with the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and note that it has the support of the Association of Colleges, which can see that the amendment would ensure that each local authority uses the same rules of intervention, rather than each interpreting the legislation in a slightly different way. On those grounds, we certainly have sympathy with the noble Lord&#146;s amendment and we welcome the Government&#146;s amendments.</p>

Those of us who have lived through the last couple of generations will remember times when political parties in local authorities have been very keen to intervene in that way.

I do not have much to say in response to the government amendments on sixth-form colleges, other than to thank the Minister very much for taking on board the concerns we expressed in Committee;

We are particularly grateful not only that the Minister has accepted the amendment that requires local authorities to consult sixth-form colleges before appointing any governor to the board, but that&#151;in line with our thinking&#151;the power has also been extended to the YPLA. We welcome the Government&#146;s commitment to our intentions here, and are grateful for the fruitful discussions that we have had with the Minister and her team.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09110490000136"></a>However, we now move on to the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Lucas. His Amendment 142 seems most appropriate and sensible. I found very interesting not only the arguments that he adduced, which brought us into the real world, but the support that they received from the noble Baroness, Lady Garden, my noble friend Lord Elton and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote. If the YPLA must publish a statement of policy about intervention in sixth-form colleges, which then has to be approved by the Secretary of State, where is the sense in asking the local education authority only to &#147;have regard to&#148; it, rather than &#147;act in accordance with&#148; it?</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09110490000137"></a>In her opening remarks, the Minister sought to meet the points that she anticipated would be made by saying that no local authority would engage in costly intervention. It would have to have strong reasons. As my noble friend Lord Lucas said, it is all about the balance of power and the balance of influence. That summarises some very important arguments which were put forward. I assume that most local education authorities will indeed automatically act in accordance with such a statement. I have faith that they will operate in this manner.</p>

<a name="91104-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09110490000138"></a>Nevertheless, we are dealing here with legislation. Sometimes&#151;I speak with some scars on this&#151;it is just not enough to have faith. If the intention is that local education authorities should comply with the statement, which has, after all, been approved by the Secretary of State and the YPLA, why on earth is it not in the Bill? Does the Minister not accept, as has been pointed out in this short debate, that this would provide more security for sixth-form colleges, while one would not expect it to place further burdens on local education authorities which will be complying with the statement anyway?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09110490000140"></a>I want to be clear on the critical point of what might trigger an intervention by a local authority in a college. As with the Learning and Skills Council now, local authorities can intervene only on the grounds currently set out in Section 56A(2) of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. These include mismanagement by the governing body, failure to

Those are quite significant triggers. The local authority will have to notify the YPLA and the Secretary of State of the decision to intervene and the grounds for intervention and then inform the college. Just to be clear, we expect intervention to be proportionate and to follow reasoned triggers&#151;it is helpful, perhaps, to put these on the record&#151;such as underperformance where there has been serious misuse of public funds, where there have been previous attempts to intervene that have failed, where there has been fraud and where there have been significant failures in management that would put learners&#146; health and safety at risk. So these are very significant triggers.</p>

The one exception to this in education law relates to the schools admissions code, with which LEAs and school governing bodies must strictly act in accordance. The duty was changed by the Education and Inspections Act 2006. Noble Lords will be interested to learn more detail about that. It enables certain important matters to be given statutory force. For example, governing bodies and local education authorities are prohibited from taking children&#146;s or parents&#146; behaviour into account when considering whether to offer a school place. There is a detailed set of circumstances. Therefore, Parliament decided that a duty to act in accordance was necessary in order to be specific about admissions policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09110490000150"></a>The intervention policy of the YPLA&#151;and currently that of the Learning and Skills Council&#151;is not of that order of specificity. It will deal with the processes and triggers for local authorities to use and for governing bodies, clerks and senior managers to understand. As with the Learning and Skills Council, we intend that the YPLA will set out in its guidance a public and transparent policy statement that is kept under review. That guidance will be consulted on before it is published.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09110490000151"></a>I return to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Elton: what will the Secretary of State do when he is notified of a potential intervention? The Secretary of State would consider the case and direct the YPLA, if necessary, under his powers under Clause 75, but would do that on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09110490000154"></a>Perhaps I can help the House by summing up and sitting down; that might be the useful thing to do at this point. We listened to the views expressed in Committee and have tabled government amendments that will require local authorities and the YPLA to consult the governing body of a sixth-form college before exercising the powers to appoint governors. That is extremely important. I believe that local authorities and sixth-form

There are strong safeguards in place. In the extremely unlikely case, which we would want to avoid, where intervention powers were used, the strong safeguards set out in the Bill should give sixth-form colleges the comfort that they seek. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, will not press his amendment and that noble Lords can support the government amendments.</p>

<a name="09110490000156"></a><b><a name="91104-0005.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09110490000648"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I shall also speak to the other amendments standing in my name. I have been delighted, but not surprised at the level of support from all sides of the House for the establishment of an independent qualifications regulator. The Bill provides for Ofqual to be a robust, independent regulator. It will enable Ofqual to ensure that standards of qualifications and assessments are maintained. Like Ofsted, it will report to Parliament, not Ministers. It has a critical role to play in developing and improving the qualifications that are central to the success of education and training in this country. It will improve confidence in those qualifications&#151;because confidence is the currency of qualifications. That will be good, above all, for children and learners. Their achievements will be properly recognised and valued.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09110490000157"></a>We shall start by looking at Schedule 9 and Ofqual&#146;s governance. There has understandably been a lot of interest in governance in parliamentary debates. We need to make sure that the process for appointing members of Ofqual reinforces its independence. We have therefore laid two further sets of amendments to put this independence beyond doubt. First, it will now be for Ofqual rather than the Secretary of State to choose the deputy chair from among its members&#151;members of the board. Ofqual will also be able to remove the deputy from office.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09110490000158"></a>Secondly, the Secretary of State will now be required to consult the chief regulator before appointing or dismissing a member of Ofqual. This also responds to the points made in Committee about the need for the chief regulator to have a formal role in appointing Ofqual members. There are also provisions allowing for a situation where the chief regulator or the deputy chair is unable to be consulted. Those amendments are rather long and detailed, but we are advised that the safeguards are necessary. There are also some consequential, tidying-up amendments to make Schedule 9 easier to read.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09110490000159"></a>Let me move on to Amendment 164, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and to the other amendments. I am committed, and said so in Committee, to publishing any directions made to Ofqual under Clause 128 because we would risk undermining confidence if the Secretary of State were making directions in secret. I do not believe that it is necessary for this provision to be in the Bill, but I give an absolute commitment that this is going to happen.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09110490000160"></a>On Amendment 150, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, and the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, of course it is important that members of Ofqual should not be subject to a conflict of interest. Noble Lords opposite are rightly concerned about that. It would be counter to the strict requirements of the Treasury, the Cabinet Office and the Commissioner for Public Appointments. In particular, no one with a direct and current connection with an awarding body could ever be appointed to Ofqual. However, almost anyone who has something to contribute to Ofqual, who has an interest in or experience relevant to Ofqual&#146;s work, could be regarded as having some conflict of interest, if we take it to extremes. It was suggested in Committee in the other place that a head teacher, for example,  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_280"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 280</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>might be so regarded if the performance of their school were measured by the qualifications that Ofqual regulates. I do not agree with that view. We need to have one or two head teachers as members of Ofqual to bring direct and current experience of qualifications delivery. Head teachers, like all of us, need a robust system in which standards are maintained and confidence is high. We do not, however, need too many head teachers in Ofqual. We must make sure that Ofqual has a balanced membership and a range of perspectives.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09110490000161"></a>I move on to Amendment 155 and the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, about the appointment of the chief executive. The Secretary of State&#146;s approval of a chief executive, which is normal for Civil Service posts at this level, must be in line with the Civil Service recruitment code. I hope that that will reassure noble Lords. It would be unusual for a parliamentary committee to report on something as detailed as the appointment of a position in this way, or on the terms and conditions of a particular civil servant, but should it choose to do so, I would expect that the Secretary of State would want to take its views into account. I am not sure that it is necessary to put this in the Bill.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09110490000162"></a>On the appointment of the first chief executive, I am happy to repeat the commitment I made in Committee that we will work with interim Ofqual over the appointment of the first&#151;interim&#151;chief executive of Ofqual. Thereafter Ofqual will appoint its own chief executives, so I hope the House will feel that this amendment is not necessary. I hope that I have given the House the comfort that it is looking for, and I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09110490000163"></a><b><a name="91104-0005.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09110490000649"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> We now begin discussions about Ofqual and I have no doubt that sighs of relief are being heaved around the Chamber, not only because it means we are about halfway through Report stage, but also, much more importantly, because of the large number of government amendments which have taken on board certain of the concerns expressed in Committee by a large number of your Lordships. I am afraid that we cannot join in, however, with all the expressions of relief, because we remain concerned about the provisions being made for those on the board of Ofqual. The Government appear to be advocating independence. They have decided that they no longer believe it necessary for the deputy chairman to be appointed by the Secretary of State, or for the Secretary of State to have the power to dismiss him. Instead, they now seem to have decided that Ofqual should retain this power. This is despite what we took to be very clear assurances to the contrary expressed in Committee. The Minister said that people should not be nervous that a board was appointed by the Secretary of State because a board appointed by the Secretary of State was,</p>
<ul><a name="09110490000285"></a>&#147;entirely consistent with a reputation for fierce independence&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/10/09; col. 377.]</ul>
<p><a name="09110490000224"></a>She said that it would be regulated by the Commissioner for Public Appointments and the appointees would be in no way answerable to the Secretary of State. Perhaps since then she has had a change of heart.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09110490000164"></a>We agree that Ofqual needs to be independent. That is the reason for our Amendment 150 which would ensure that a member of the Ofqual board cannot have a financial or occupational interest that  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_281"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 281</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would constitute a conflict of interest with Ofqual. Despite what the Minister said a moment ago, we still believe that it would not be helpful to have serving on that board anyone with any sort of conflict of interest with the objectives of that regulator. Surely we should ensure that the board of Ofqual is free of those currently involved, by occupation or financially, in education. We suggest that we should bend over backwards to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest in the regulation of standards. Instead, it should be composed of those with the necessary expertise to help form a rigorous and effective regulator. We cannot believe that our amendment would mean that such people were impossible to find. Katherine Tattersall, the chairman of Ofqual, wrote in her letter to Mr Chope and Mrs Humble that,</p>
<ul><a name="09110490000286"></a>&#147;as a regulator of qualifications in England, I can assure you that I am quite clear about the importance of maintaining standards over time and across awarding bodies so that learners and the public can have confidence in the integrity of the qualifications system&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09110490000225"></a>The Minister also referred to the importance of confidence in the system when she moved her amendment. In order to achieve this objective, we believe that it is necessary to have a board composed of people who cannot have or be thought to have in any way a vested interest in creating the perception that standards have risen regardless of the facts.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09110490000165"></a>We are pleased to note that in Committee we received support for the principle behind this amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, said that he fully supported the emphasis behind Amendment 220A&#151;as it then was&#151;but expressed reservations that it might be difficult to apply. The Minister said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="09110490000261"></a>&#147;It is important that members of Ofqual should not be subject to conflicts of interest&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09110490000226"></a>and that,</p>
<ul><a name="09110490000287"></a>&#147;it would clearly be inappropriate to appoint to Ofqual anyone with a direct and current connection with an awarding body which Ofqual might regulate&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/10/09; col. 378.]</ul>
<p><a name="09110490000227"></a>I heard what she said today on this.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09110490000166"></a>We acknowledge that there may be some technical difficulties with our amendment. There have also been expressions of concern that it may preclude those with expertise in assessments and academia. That is not the intention. We wish to exclude only those who have a current vested interest. They should have no reputational or other interest in demonstrating that the United Kingdom&#146;s examination system has maintained standards over the years. In the quest for independent regulation, this seems only sensible and necessary.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09110490000167"></a>We cannot express much support for the government amendments in this group or for Amendment 154, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. I am interested to hear the Government&#146;s response on Amendment 155. Amendment 164 was tabled by my noble friend Lord Lucas and appears to us to be very sensible. We may have had some disagreements about the role of the Secretary of State with regard to Ofqual, but we are in agreement on this. It is important that government policy and directives that are sent to Ofqual with the purpose of direction should be available and published. This will add to the transparent nature of Ofqual. The body has an important function to  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_282"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 282</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fulfil. It must regulate standards but, in consequence, should reassure the public that standards are being upheld and are improving. Any published document of government policy that Ofqual has had to take into account should help to ensure that trust is maintained between the public and the regulator.</p>

<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="09110490000168"></a><b><a name="91104-0005.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09110490000650"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> My Lords, this group contains Amendments 154 and 155, which are tabled in my name. I shall speak to them in a moment. First, I welcome government Amendments 146, 148 and 152, which were laid at our instigation. Amendments 146 and 152 relate to the appointment or removal of the deputy chair, and we are delighted that the Government have accepted that this person should be elected or removed by the members of Ofqual rather than by the Secretary of State. This goes a small way towards reducing the power of the Secretary of State over Ofqual and thereby increases Ofqual&#146;s independence.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09110490000169"></a>Government Amendments 148 and 153 concern the Secretary of State consulting with the chair or deputy before appointing ordinary members. Again, that consultation is at our instigation and we welcome it. However&#151;here comes the but&#151;we do not like the last part of each of these amendments, which enable the Secretary of State to appoint or remove a person without consultation if he or she thinks that it is &#147;not practicable&#148; to consult. These appointments usually take weeks or even months and the idea that it would not be practicable to consult during that period is ridiculous. The Government say that this paragraph is only there to take care of rare situations where perhaps both the chair and the deputy are ill or have been killed in an accident. In these situations, the Secretary of State will deal with the matter without legislation.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09110490000170"></a>The Lord Chancellor endorses the appointment of lots of people, but the statutes are not full of clauses about what happens if he cannot consult or if he himself lands under a bus. It is over the top to legislate for a highly unlikely occurrence such as this. The problem is that it makes me suspect that the Government want it there to allow the Secretary of State to appoint without consulting if he feels like it. If the amendments are carried, I will seek some means or another of removing those paragraphs at a later stage.</p>

<a name="91104-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09110490000171"></a>I am afraid that we do not support the Opposition Benches on Amendment 150 because we have confidence in the fact that the public appointments procedure is now moving in the right direction and would ensure that nothing inappropriate happens in relation to conflicts of interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09110490000172"></a>I now turn to my own amendments. The first chief executive of Ofqual will have an enormous influence on the way that it starts its new duties, so this is an important appointment. Amendment 154 would ensure that the first chief executive is an interim appointment whose confirmation as a permanent employee or replacement by somebody different as the first permanent CEO will be done by Ofqual itself. The Minister has been quite clear about that today and I thank her for it. I am also grateful to the Bill team for confirming it in a letter dated 2 November&#151;it arrived five minutes before we started Report on Monday&#151;so I am quite happy about that. I will not pursue the matter further, but will the Minister say how long the interim appointment

<a name="91104-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09110490000173"></a>Amendment 155 would simply give Parliament a role in the appointment of the first and subsequent permanent chief executives. Because this post is such an important one, Parliament&#146;s voice should be heard about the suitability of the people appointed and the terms and conditions of their appointment. I was somewhat reassured by the Minister saying that if Parliament expresses a view about these things that will be taken into account, so I will not be pressing that matter.</p>

I cannot support the amendment as it stands, because it would rule out quite a number of immensely helpful and able people who have, in one way or another, a financial interest in education&#151;they are employed in schools or whatever. That being said, I am interested to hear the response to the question relating to Amendment 154 about the expected length of period of office for the first chief executive of the regulatory body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09110490000179"></a>I turn to the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, particularly in regard to her concerns about Amendments 148 and 153 and the question about consultation following extremely unlikely events. I understand her concerns, but the Secretary of State cannot consult if it is necessary to act before it is practicable to consult. This is a legal duty set out in proposed new sub-paragraph (5B)(b) in Amendment 153. We will have to discuss this further, because we do not want to get into a situation where there needs to be an appointment, but because of an extremely unlikely set of events it cannot be made. However, the noble Baroness has very generously agreed to move forward and deal with this in a very practical way.</p>

<a name="91104-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09110490000180"></a>Moving on to Amendment 150, I appreciate the concerns around conflict of interest; of course it is right to ensure that Ofqual has a board that is independent of any undue influence. That is why we have a really strong public appointments process: it is there to make sure that the board has the right skills, and that the people appointed have the right qualities and are free from undue influence. Amendment 150 would simply go too far.</p>

<a name="91104-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09110490000181"></a>We have listened very carefully to what noble Lords said in Committee. For example, we have ensured that Ofqual will choose its deputy; we are now delivering on that. We said we would do that in Committee, and that is what we are doing now. We also wanted to make sure that the chief regulator was consulted, and that is what we are delivering on now. Noble Lords can be reassured that we are setting in place the necessary safeguards to ensure that Ofqual is truly independent.</p>

<a name="91104-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09110490000182"></a>Finally, as regards the interim appointments becoming permanent, Ofqual will set procedures running for the permanent appointments on the day it comes into existence. All being well, that will be 1 April. Bill permitting, the interim appointment will end when the permanent appointment is made. We expect that process to begin on the day Ofqual comes into existence. I hope that I have answered the questions and that noble Lords opposite will not move their amendment and will support the Government&#146;s amendment.</p>

Through the passage of this Bill, we have been setting up, it is hoped, a second independent regulator which will influence and report on the standard of education in this country. That is Ofqual, which will be able to monitor standards only through the  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_286"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 286</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>medium of current qualifications. The other one is Ofsted, which was set up quite a few years ago, with many fewer powers than it has now. It was initially set up to inspect the standards of education in schools, but now it deals with young offender institutions, early years&#146; settings, children&#146;s homes and several other things.</p>

<a name="91104-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09110490000184"></a>Ofsted has also looked into examinations, with its recent report published in August about the 14 to 19 reorganisation and the new diplomas. Here, I believe it impinges slightly on the role which Ofqual might have if that role were to be extended in the way my amendments suggest. In the situation here, where we have two regulators, we need to be clear about the role of each. We in the Liberal Democrats would have no such problem, were we to be in government. Our vision is of a single unified education standards authority whose role is to monitor and report on the whole breadth of education standards in England and compare them over time and with other countries, and which would oversee Ofsted as part of its remit.</p>

<a name="91104-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09110490000185"></a>Without Ofqual having the power to investigate beyond the boundaries of qualifications, we will not really know what success in any particular exam really means. With the system that the Government are setting up, the demarcation between Ofqual and Ofsted is blurred, and we are concerned that no one will have either the power or the duty to let us all know how we are really doing compared to 10 years ago, or to other similar developed countries. Perhaps the Minister will tell me who is supposed to do that under her system.</p>

<a name="91104-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09110490000186"></a>We believe that the role of Ofqual has been designed too narrowly in assessing standards, and that therefore its success in restoring public confidence in qualifications is put at risk. We may continue to have the annual debate about falling standards and dumbing down, which is what the Government are trying to avoid. We on these Benches are committed to Ofqual&#146;s success, which is why we have put so much time and energy into making it more independent and fair in its operations through this Bill, and that is why we would like its powers extended through these amendments.</p>

<a name="91104-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09110490000187"></a>The CFS Select Committee, in its report, <I>Testing and Assessment</I>, clearly agreed with us. It was clear about the potential for a discrepancy between the apparent education standards revealed by regulated qualifications and the underlying measures of educational performance, standards and effectiveness. In paragraph 250, it said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="09110490000279"></a>&#147;Until the Government allows for standardised sample testing for monitoring purposes, the regulator will be left without the tools required to fulfil its primary function&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110490000228"></a>The committee essentially argued that because examination standards and the nature of examinations had changed so much over time, and because of the difficulty of comparability brought about by test reform, the targets set by the Government and the different assessment standards used at different times, it was impossible to use one or even a number of examinations to form an objective assessment of standards over time&#151;or even at any point in time. In their response to the committee report, the Government said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="09110490000280"></a>&#147;Ofqual&#146;s role is not to monitor education standards as a whole; it is to regulate the qualifications and assessments which are one of the means by which those standards are measured&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09110490000188"></a>Parliament&#146;s voice was ignored yet again.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_287"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 287</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09110490000189"></a>If not Ofqual, then who? When this matter was debated in another place, Ministers contradicted each other as to whether Ofqual could conduct sampling. In the end they came down on the side of Ofqual being able to do so only in pursuit of its current powers as expressed in the Bill. Yet Kathleen Tattersall in her evidence to the Public Bill Committee on 3 March said she did not believe this legislation precluded Ofqual over time pursuing the type of strategy I have outlined. However, the Minister, Jim Knight, said he did not think it appropriate for Ofqual to simply take such powers of its own accord. It is time we sorted this out. Before the Bill leaves your Lordships&#146; House, I would like the matter clarified.</p>

<a name="91104-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09110490000190"></a>If Ofqual is to have these powers, they should be put on the face of the Bill. Then no one could argue if the chair of Ofqual sought at some future time, when the organisation has bedded in, to provide this valuable service and information which could inform policy in such an important way. Do the Government not want to base their policy on evidence any more? After the way the Cambridge Primary Review and the expert committee on drugs have been treated recently, I suspect not. We on these Benches seek evidence-based policy not policy-based evidence.</p>

<a name="91104-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09110490000191"></a>We have tinkered with this Bill. Thanks to our listening Ministers and the hard work of the Bill team we have improved it a lot, but we were never going to be in a position to revise the whole architecture of the thing, as we on these Benches would have liked, based on the alternative vision I have outlined. At the least, can we please allow Ofqual to do what the public is crying out for&#151;to really tell us what is happening to standards? For it to do so, we need unequivocal clarity about whether it can sample, research, study and report on the underlying standards of education, not just those that are measured by examinations. I beg to move.</p>

We have been through painful periods of public lack of confidence in standards&#151;the creep in A-levels, GCSEs and so on. Some device, whether via Ofqual or some other agency, is badly needed to assure the public that standards are not falling and that examinations are kept up to the mark.</p>

Year on year, using properly validated item banks, they could tell us whether and where the performance in schools is rising or falling. However, I am not sure that Ofqual is necessarily the right agency to take this on. In default of any other agency I support the concept of Ofqual as the place where it should happen.</p>

That cannot be done without evidence. It must be done, over a long time, on the basis of a regular series of relatively standard assessments that are not affected by changes in the national curriculum or by changes in emphasis that rightly come from Ministers. These cause examinations to evolve and change over time and make it hard to pin down what is happening on standards. It is difficult to do&#151;it is not a perfect science&#151;and Ofqual needs all the help that it can get to get it right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09110490000197"></a>Amendments 156 and 160 would require standards to be monitored across England as a whole and for it to be reported how standards and education are changing over time. This would be very useful and help to ensure that standards were consistently maintained across the country. It is appropriate that Ofqual should produce a report on these matters that will, as we go forward, allow comparisons to be made between years. This would help to provide Ofqual with the information that it requires in order to regulate standards and to reassure the public that those standards are being maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09110490000198"></a>As my noble friend Lady Perry said, year on year we see headlines proclaiming that standards have fallen and that our qualifications are being undermined.

<p><a name="09110490000230"></a>We pay tribute to the hard work and achievements of young people, teachers and the education system. One of the best ways in which we can do this is by securing a qualifications system worthy of them&#151;one that challenges them sufficiently and ensures that their qualifications truly reflect the hard work that they have put in and the achievements that they have attained.</p>

<a name="91104-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09110490000200"></a>It is important to allow a comparison with earlier years. For example, Duncan Lawson from the University of Coventry has found that students entering university

This may be hard to accept, but it does not necessarily reflect on the young people, teachers and the education system; it reflects on the standards of qualifications.</p>

<a name="91104-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09110490000201"></a>We sympathise with the desire to see a comparison made between standards in this country and those in other OECD countries. This reflects a concern that we raised in Committee in Amendment 316, which called for an international benchmark to be instituted. The PISA studies on advanced economies and their educational performance show that we have dropped from fourth to 14th place for science, seventh to 17th place for literacy and eighth to 24th place for mathematics. These figures are no doubt familiar to the Minister, but they deserve repetition. They underline the fact that, while we are constantly being told that standards in this country are rising, in reality we are falling behind the international field. That is why we on these Benches have commissioned a review by Sir Richard Sykes, the former rector of Imperial College, of assessment and qualifications in this country with the aim, again, of making them internationally competitive.</p>

A recent Cambridge review of primary education, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, alluded, praised the Government for their investment in education in primary schools and for many of the innovations that they have introduced, but also commented critically&#151;I am paraphrasing what it said&#151;that the top-down culture of edicts in children&#146;s education and the attempt to overly control what children learn at a particular time have been to the detriment of our children&#146;s education. If we had a benchmark, we could see over a number of years, when we have put a lot of investment into children&#146;s education, how they are performing against similar states with similar sorts of investment.</p>

If Ofqual wants to do sample testing&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked this as well&#151;the Secretary of State can do nothing to stop it; it will be an independent regulator.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09110490000205"></a>Ofqual can perform sample testing but, as the noble Baroness suggested in her opening remarks, not for the purposes set out in the amendments. It can do so as part of fulfilling its objectives&#151;to check the consistency year on year, if it so wishes, under the standards objective. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, spoke eloquently just now, although I do not agree with his analysis, making the case for why we need this independent organisation, Ofqual.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09110490000206"></a>This is set out in paragraph 14 of Schedule 9, where it is clear that Ofqual can perform sample testing as part of fulfilling its objectives. There are supplementary  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_290"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 290</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>powers in Schedule 9, while Clause 164 gives Ofqual the ability to undertake research. As the noble Lord reminded us, he talked in Committee about the importance of Ofqual undertaking research and providing a strong evidence base for its work. We must, and do, support that.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09110490000207"></a>On several occasions we have used the analogy of the height of the hurdle and the number of children who jump over it. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has asked whose job it is to ensure that as many children jump over it as possible. That is an important question. It is a policy responsibility of Ministers to work to increase performance standards in our schools, and Ministers must be and are held to account by Parliament. There are a number of sources of evidence about whether standards are improving; qualifications and assessments are one way of measuring that, but by no means the only one.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09110490000208"></a>As the noble Baroness knows, Ofsted looks at standards through its inspection judgments. Those judgments will be brought together in the new school report card, which, I hope, we will enjoy debating at length in a few weeks. We do not think, however, that there is much value in seeking to come to a single judgment on standards, as it is a complex issue. Even if that were possible, rather than combining the variety of measures across all ages, subjects and areas, it would be much better to focus our efforts.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09110490000209"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked about the Ofsted report on 14 to 19 delivery. Ofsted was reporting on the teaching of 14 to 19 qualifications; Ofqual will regulate them. The noble Baroness has expressed her party&#146;s vision eloquently, but her amendments would turn Ofqual into a kind of super-regulator, which would have to come to a view on the performance of the education system as a whole, from young children right through to adults. There is a debate to be had on whether there would be value in establishing a body to try to come to such a view; indeed, such a debate, as the noble Baroness suggested, was held in another place in March. The Government disagreed then with the view underlying the amendments and we do so now.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09110490000210"></a>We are discussing what Ofqual is for. Ofqual&#146;s role, as set out in the Bill, should be to maintain standards of qualifications and assessments. That is a challenging but vital job, as the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, stressed. We firmly believe that Ofqual should be allowed to have real focus. Others share that view. In their evidence to the Bill Committee in another place, both the chair of interim Ofqual and the director-general of the AQA awarding body were very clear, saying that for Ofqual to take on the job of looking at performance standards as a whole would give it too wide a remit and would create enormous challenges for it.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09110490000211"></a>There are some issues of principle, too. The amendments suggest that the single most important role of qualifications is to test the performance of the system&#151;the number of children and young people who jump over the hurdle. While that is one purpose, as we shall discuss when we reach Amendment 185, it is not the most important. The single most important reason for having qualifications is to recognise and reflect the achievements of learners&#151;to make sure  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_291"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 291</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the skills and knowledge that they have gained can be understood by employers and higher education institutions and that we as a society can recognise their achievements. If Ofqual were to focus on the performance of the system, it would risk losing sight of the needs of learners, which could be very damaging.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09110490000212"></a>Moreover, this objective would add significantly to Ofqual&#146;s costs. Conducting proper annual sample tests in different subjects across all age ranges and making meaningful international comparisons would not be inexpensive. We are not convinced that it would be a good use of Ofqual&#146;s resources as it starts out. It would be better to focus those resources on improving the quality of education.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09110490000213"></a>Finally, the amendment would leave Ofqual conflicted. If Ofqual ran sample tests, who would check, and provide assurance, that those tests were being organised fairly and that standards were being maintained? We want Ofqual to be the regulator. Let us leave it to do that critical job.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="091104111000001"></a>With regard to Amendment 160, it has been suggested to me by my officials that we could look at amending the Bill at Third Reading to require Ofqual to report its view on standards overall in its annual report. I am not sure how the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, or other Members of the House would feel about that. We discussed the relationship between Ofqual and Parliament in Committee. The Committee was keen that there should be a comprehensive exchange of information between Ofqual and Parliament, so I am prepared to think about that carefully.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="091104111000002"></a>I ask noble Lords to think about the hurdle picture. We are keen to ensure that we can be clear in this country that, when our young people leap over a hurdle, they can be really sure that we will all recognise how high they have achieved.</p>

She has made two things very clear. First, Ofqual can do sampling but only against the objectives that it has in the Bill. That is why I have added another in Amendment 156, which covers the educational standard and performance objective so that Ofqual could do sampling in pursuit of that. If it tried to do so unless we put the objective in, I suspect that it would be held to account for doing something that was not consistent with the objectives it had in the Bill. Secondly, the Minister made it clear that if standards fall it is Ministers who should be held to account. However, how can Ministers adjust policy to ensure that standards do not fall if they do not have the information? Somebody has to collect it. I feel that Ofqual&#151;</p>

Ofqual will have a very significant role in ensuring that those assessments are of the appropriate and expected standard. Ofqual will have a view about how the contribution of a qualification contributes towards the standing of a school in school league tables, for example. Ofqual will have a very important analysis that will help to hold Ministers to account, which is why we are doing this.</p>

Ofqual will be able to undertake research and will have a regular programme of research looking at comparisons over time. It will be empowered to do the assessments we are talking about. However, we are not asking Ofqual to assess the performance of the whole education system. We are asking it to assess the quality of the qualifications and the standards. If you have a GCSE today and you gain a GCSE in five years&#146; time or 10 years&#146; time, do they have the same value? This is the problem. When all our young people do so well at school and get their As at A-level and so on&#151;there is huge concern that they have not done as well, as standards of A-levels are perceived to have fallen&#151;we will have a mechanism, an independent body, that will be able to advise us on whether this is the case.</p>

I only have one more major point. The Minister suggests that to do what I propose would mean that we had a super-regulator. I do not expect that this sort of thing could be done by Ofqual right at the beginning. Ofsted started off as a fairly small, limited-powers organisation and its responsibilities have grown. I envisage a day when Ofqual will be asked by whichever Government are in power at the time to collect that sort of information, on which policy can then be based. I hardly think that I need to answer the question that the noble Baroness posed about what would regulate Ofqual; we could just go on and ask what would regulate it as well. However, I welcomed her suggestion that something might be added to go some way towards addressing my concerns at Third Reading, and I look forward to a conversation with her about that.

In doing so, I will refer to a number of government amendments in this group which, while welcome as a step in the right direction, do not go far enough. The issues are the level and conditions of fee capping, the review of fee-capping  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_293"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decisions and the fairness of appeals against them, and the fairness of reviews of decisions to withdraw recognition from an awarding body. It is important that any decision on fee capping does not put undue burdens on colleges, which currently spend &#163;170 million a year on exam entrance fees&#151;for example, Leyton Sixth Form College in east London has 1,900 students and last year paid &#163;284,000 in exam fees. Schools too pay very large sums. This is an enormous amount of public money and it should not be allowed to rise exponentially. That is why we have tabled Amendment 158. Can the Government assure us that this enormous financial burden will not get any further out of hand, and how Ofqual will ensure that that happens?</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="091104111000009"></a>Amendment 162 recognises that Ofqual will not be able to delivers its aims unless it is given the remit of regulating the qualifications system as a whole, rather than the narrow remit of regulating qualifications providers. In Committee the Minister&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Young&#151;said that our earlier amendment on this matter, Amendment 233, would give Ofqual the responsibility of regulating the efficiency of the qualifications system without having the power to do so. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="091104111000076"></a>&#147;It would not be able to do anything to secure the efficiency of the wider system&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/10/09; col. 404.]</p>

<p><a name="091104111000070"></a>However, there are things that Ofqual can do to assist the efficiency of the market within its powers as currently drafted. For example, it can require awarding bodies to provide certain types of information to schools and colleges to assist them to make efficient purchasing decisions. Our understanding is that Ofqual is already considering this. We understand the Government&#146;s concerns, so we have proposed a good middle ground in Amendment 162. This would require Ofqual in performing its functions to have regard to the,</p>
<ul><a name="091104111000078"></a>&#147;efficiency of relevant markets for regulated qualifications&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="091104111000071"></a>It would no longer be an objective&#151;something Ofqual must aim to achieve&#151;but simply something Ofqual were required to take into account. I hope the noble Baroness will be able to accept this.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="091104111000010"></a>Amendment 166 is about the fair operation of the fee-capping powers. It was tabled in the same form in Committee and I am afraid that the Government&#146;s attempt in Amendment 165 to come some way towards us on this matter is just not good enough. In replying, the Minister suggested that it would not be practicable for Ofqual to carry out a market review before imposing a fee cap. But all the other regulators do this and Ofqual, if it is doing its job well, will probably have all the relevant information immediately to hand. We on these Benches feel it is important, in the interests of fairness and to protect innovation and choice, that Ofqual does not impose a fee cap unless it has taken the right precautions and assembled all the relevant facts. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the need for this, so that Ofqual can be seen to be operating fairly.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="091104111000011"></a>That brings me nicely to Amendments 168 and 184, both of which relate to an independent appeals process. Amendment 168 relates to decisions on fee capping and Amendment 184 to decisions to withdraw recognition from an awarding body. A body whose main objective is to restore public confidence in qualifications should  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_294"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have the fairness of its own operations right at the top of its priorities. In setting it up in legislation, it is our duty to ensure that its procedures are fair. I do not think that it is fair, in Clause 135(5)(a) and Clause 148(9). For the person to be a senior member of Ofqual staff who is not involved in the original decision is just not independent enough.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="091104111000012"></a>I welcome government Amendments 167 and 183 as an attempt to make the reviewer someone outside Ofqual. The Government have accepted that any member of Ofqual staff would be compromised in that situation, which is why my two amendments seek to take the matter right away and put it in the hands of someone competent outside Ofqual&#151;or outside the DCSF and government as a whole. Surely, there are competent people other than civil servants, bless them, who could do this job and in whose judgment both sides could have confidence. It would be even better if that person&#146;s competence and independence could be accepted by both sides in the dispute. I hope that the Government will continue to demonstrate their willingness to listen to reason and accept at least the principle of the amendments, if they cannot accept the amendments as such.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="091104111000013"></a>I shall say a word about Amendment 180, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, to which I have added my name. He will say more but, following the Minister&#146;s explanation about connected activities in Committee, the impact on the credibility of UK qualifications or the fair operation of the system are the only legitimate reasons for Ofqual to have the right to look into other activities of the awarding bodies. Other than this, it is none of its business. If that is the reason for the connected activities reference, it should be put clearly and transparently in the Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, suggested. I also support the amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, on timeliness. I beg to move.</p>

In Amendment 170, as I made clear in Committee, I would like to see the power of Ofqual to intervene in fee capping removed altogether. I do not believe that it is necessary; it is really not a proper part of a regulator concerned with the academic and educational standards to be involved in the pricing and costing. I still believe, although the Minister teased me about a perfect market, that the market works perfectly well and needs no intervention from anyone. The Secretary of State at any moment in time can always intervene with a heavy hand by simply declaring his or her displeasure. Awarding bodies would probably jump very quickly to that. I accept that the Government have come a long way in their amendments to meet my concerns and those of many other noble Lords.

If Ofqual is to impose various kinds of draconian sanctions on any awarding body, it is vital that it should do so in a timely manner. In Committee, the Minister seemed to think that timeliness simply meant quickness or speed. Of course, it does not. You can be slow but timely; what matters about timeliness is that the time is appropriate and takes into consideration all the factors involved, not least the concerns of the young people who will follow the qualifications that may be removed or drastically altered by this. Will the Minister consider again the importance of putting in the Bill something that ensures that, when Ofqual moves in this fashion&#151;to sanction or to close down an operation, or part of an operation, of an awarding body&#151;it pays attention to doing so in a timely way?</p>

That amendment is to do with the exercise of powers by Ministers and not by Ofqual and, since I want to say a fair bit on it, I would rather say it separately.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="091104111000018"></a>I start by welcoming Amendment 185, a perfectly drafted amendment, which absolutely meets the point that I made in Committee. I am extremely chuffed to see it on the Marshalled List.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="091104111000019"></a>Amendments 163 and 180 also come back to discussions in Committee. Amendment 163, which amends Clause 128, looks at the powers that Ofqual has to limit the number of different regulated qualifications in similar subject areas or serving similar functions. We had a good explanation of that power from the Minister in Committee. What I hope that I have done in Amendment 163 is to reflect the way in which he thought that that power should be used, clearing up confusion to make it plain that when you have a number of different awarding bodies, particularly in the vocational area, offering qualifications that are essentially the same, they must be brought under one banner. It does not matter whether it is the institution of this or the association of that offering it, but it must all have the same name at the end of the day, so that the pattern of qualifications is clear to those who have to evaluate them&#151;principally, I imagine, employers.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="091104111000020"></a>That is an objective that I share, but as the clause stands it could be read much more widely than that and that Ofqual could go about striking out entire qualifications because it thought that there were enough of them. That is an activity that the Government are fond of; they are determined to limit the number of qualifications available for school use and not to allow any proliferation or variety. That is their present attitude. I very much hope that it will not be the attitude of the next Government. However, I do not think that it should be Ofqual's attitude under any circumstances. Ofqual ought to be there to judge the quality. Under

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="091104111000021"></a>My Amendment 180 is very much on a similar theme. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has already said, Clause 145(1) allows Ofqual to,</p>
<ul><a name="091104111000079"></a>&#147;keep under review any connected activities of a recognised body&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="091104111000072"></a>My amendment aims to limit that power to the area where such powers are necessary and justified, by adding,</p>
<ul><a name="091104111000080"></a>&#147;where it has reasonable grounds to believe these may impact on the credibility of the qualifications offered or the effective or fair operation of the system&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="091104111000073"></a>Awarding bodies are large businesses with many activities outside the scope of Ofqual. In particular, they have succeeded in establishing throughout the world a system of British qualifications that is well known and extremely well respected. That is one of the main reasons why people from overseas wish to come here and study at British universities, and why our qualifications are respected throughout the world. They have a high degree of probity in doing that, and should not be subject to a degree of control by Ofqual beyond that which is necessary.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="091104111000022"></a>In the context of their general activities, it seems to me that awarding bodies may want to brief parliamentarians or to research problems with existing qualifications and propose remedies. They may want to have particular marketing plans for qualifications which are the same as or equivalent to our own domestic qualifications; they may want to have quite a strong media presence. All of those are things that Ofqual should not have any ability to stick its nose into, so the objective of my amendment is not in any way to keep Ofqual out of the area in which it should be involved, but just to say that it should not stray.</p>

<a name="91104-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="091104111000023"></a>If one looks back at the history of the QCA, which was set up with a fine set of objectives, over time it reached and stretched out to see how much control it could exert over the whole educational system. At the point where it was put to death by this Government it had become a sprawling and invasive quango with all sorts of influences, most of them malign, in areas where it should never have had them. I would not like to see that happen to Ofqual which is, at its heart, an immensely useful body that should be set up to survive with a clear focus for many generations.</p>

My initial inclination is to follow the line proposed by my noble friend and colleague Lady Perry to the effect that we should minimise, as far as possible, reference to fee-capping powers and so on in the legislation. If we were to go for one or other of those, I prefer government Amendment 165 because it does not mention specific sums of money. My reason is that, as was shown to be the case in what went wrong with SATs 18 months ago, efficiency, effectiveness and value for money do not necessarily line up with price. I would wish to leave a freedom with those responsible for ensuring value for money that precludes naming specific sums and setting very specific limits.</p>

<a name="091104111000025"></a><b><a name="91104-0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="091104111000097"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My Lords, there are a large number of amendments in this group, and I start by recognising with gratitude&#151;even admiration&#151;that a great deal of work by Ministers and their officials, and, indeed, by noble Lords all around the House has gone into seeking consensus. Yet the sheer number of non-government amendments here suggests that we are still some way short of complete agreement, so I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response to those.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="091104111000026"></a>I turn first to the amendments tabled by the Government. In this group, we see a number of concessions to the strength of opinion that Ofqual&#146;s fee-capping powers should be constrained. In Committee, we expressed a desire to ensure that the market was not interfered with unduly, while ensuring that fees to exam boards should not be extortionate. Groups such as Edexcel had expressed concern that Ofqual&#146;s power to cap fees might also have the potential artificially to alter the market and, in this way, could restrict the breadth of qualifications offered. Like my noble friend Lady Perry, we on these Benches strongly support diversity and choice. The power to cap fees must not be abused so as to risk smaller and more specialised qualifications being driven out of the market.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="091104111000027"></a>We recognise that the Bill brings in further safeguards, and so effectively limits further the fee-capping powers which were available to Ofqual under the Education Act 1997. Nevertheless, we welcome the fact that the Government have responded so positively to the issues raised in Committee. The power to cap fees will, assuming the amendment is accepted, be restricted to when it is necessary to ensure value for money. It is to be hoped that this will allow smaller and perhaps less overtly economic qualifications to survive, because the cap will be triggered only when it is necessary to restrict the cost to ensure that fees are not disproportionately high. That seems appropriate.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="091104111000028"></a>While we accept that it is often better to let the market have control of these situations, there are also occasions when schools and colleges are put in a position where exam fees are too high. In 2004-05, for example, my information&#151;which I think is similar to that of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley&#151;is that secondary schools spent &#163;197 million on exam fees compared with &#163;150 million on books for both primary and secondary schools. The Minister might like to consider those rather startling figures. Can she also provide your Lordships with some information about the use of powers to cap fees under the status quo ante? What impact does she feel that the changes and safeguards contained in the Bill will have on the market, and on the expenditure which schools have to make? We also support the need for an independent person to review decisions. The review must certainly be external and impartial if it is to be a transparent process and to have any real teeth. I will be interested to hear whether the Government have given any thought to Amendment 184, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="091104111000029"></a>However, I am afraid I find myself unable to support her Amendment 166, which requires Ofqual to review the market and to impose a cap on fees only if it seems that the market is being distorted. While we see the rationale, we are worried that it could involve a great  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_298"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deal of extra work every time an issue arose where a fee was considered too high. It seems to follow that if Ofqual should be awarded the powers to cap fees, it should also be allowed to exercise its own judgment here. For the times when that breaks down, there is already to be an independent review process. I look forward to the response from the Minister to my noble friend Lord Lucas&#146;s amendments. Regarding Amendment 171, can the Minister give us the Government&#146;s assessment of the cost of doing that?</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="091104111000030"></a>I turn to the amendments tabled by my noble friend Lady Perry. Amendments 181 and 182 refer to the fact that Ofqual must operate &#147;in a timely manner&#148;, whether recognising a body or withdrawing recognition. We accept the Government&#146;s response that Ofqual already has an efficiency objective. Nevertheless, the powers to recognise and withdraw recognition are of paramount importance to Ofqual&#146;s remit. The timeliness objective deserves to be underlined. Timeliness with regard to recognising an exam can be critical. It is simply not the same as efficiency&#151;or even, as my noble friend said, as speed&#151;as much as one might like it to be. We want to ensure that standards rise and that the public are reassured on this point. How can Ofqual hope to achieve that if it does not act in a timely manner?</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="091104111000031"></a>Finally, we support and welcome the Government&#146;s intentions in Amendment 185, but we rather hoped that they might have been a little braver. We on these Benches believe firmly in the rigour that examinations should have in ensuring that students enjoy the complete confidence of the receiving educational institution&#151;or, indeed, the employer&#151;after the exam has been taken. The meddling in, and micromanagement of, exams has, as my honourable friend Michael Gove said recently, dumbed the system down. There should be a distinction between what are seen as hard and soft subjects. We should not just measure, as the Government currently do, the GCSE performance of a school by the proportion of pupils who gain five A* to C grades, without taking into account which subjects have been taken. The argument that vocational subjects will be seen as less important is redundant. It is crucial to put an appropriate value on both academic and vocational subjects so that potential higher education institutions and employers can rightly distinguish the level of attainment. I very much look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

I hope I can respond to noble Lords with the courtesy and attention that all the amendments require.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="091104111000033"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, said that choice and innovation in the system are essential. I completely agree. I sense that we are all champing at the bit to have the debate about report cards, which will come to this House in the next Session; we are all looking forward to that. Of course, Ofqual has duties to have regard to reasonable levels of choice for learners and the desirability of facilitating innovation. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, should feel encouraged and reassured by that. He was particularly concerned that fee capping could limit innovation in the market and  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_299"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>stop small qualification organisations from thriving. Ofqual will have to make sure that it does not do this; I am happy to say so on the record. It would risk not meeting its duty to have regard to the needs of learners if that were to happen.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="091104111000034"></a>I detected a concern in the noble Lord&#146;s remarks about the potential impact on the market of the fee-capping provisions, and the kind of research that we have done to look at that. The QCA does not have an efficiency objective at the moment. As the noble Lord knows, its main focus has been on standards. It has only recently begun to investigate the efficiency of the market, as concern has grown in recent years. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred to this. There is a great deal more work to be done before the regulator could seriously consider a cap on fees. I think we will all agree that this work will become increasingly important as pressures on the public purse grow.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="091104111000035"></a>Turning to the amendments relating to efficiency, it is important that Ofqual has an efficiency objective. I think we all agree on that. As the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, reminded us, hundreds of millions of pounds of public money are spent on qualifications each year, and the taxpayer would rightly expect us to make sure that expenditure provides good value. I think we are as one on that. The ability to cap fees is a key power, needed to deliver the efficiency objective. The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, has argued that qualifications offer value for money. I am sure that she is right. The Association of Colleges argues equally forcefully, however, that they do not always offer value for money. There is a balance in here somewhere. If the association is right, Ofqual must be able to act. Given the debate in Committee, we have tabled amendments to place further constraints around the power.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="091104111000036"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, was concerned to stop spiralling qualification fees in schools and colleges. A key part of the answer here is for Ofqual to have an effective but proportionate fee-capping power to meet its efficiency objective. The question of whether Ofqual can ensure that awarding bodies provide good information to help schools in efficient decision-making is, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, extremely important. Yes, Ofqual will be able to do this, and it would be appropriate for it to do so. We very much hope that it will provide such information.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="091104111000037"></a>Amendment 165 sets a stiff test before Ofqual could impose a fee-capping condition. It must be necessary to cap fees to ensure value for money. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, seeks to do something similar in her amendment. I am disappointed that she was not happy with our amendment because I think we are driving at the same thing. I am not sure how we can go forward on this; I hope that she will be able to support the government amendment because we have similar objectives.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="091104111000038"></a>Amendment 167, alongside Amendment 168 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, looks at an independent review of fee capping. This would change the review arrangements for the fee-capping decisions, so that they must be carried out by someone independent of Ofqual. As the noble Lord, Lord  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_300"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>De Mauley, said, we are inching in the right direction. I am glad that he was able to support us. Again, I hope the noble Baroness will accept this in place of her amendment. The &#147;independent of government&#148; restriction in Amendment 168 is unnecessary. If Ofqual established new arrangements which were not independent of government, the arrangements would not be considered sufficiently credible and impartial. I would expect Ofqual to publish details of the review arrangements.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="091104111000039"></a>Government Amendment 183, which looks at independent review of the withdrawal of recognition from an awarding body, is important. It makes the same changes to the review arrangements for withdrawal of recognition. Again, I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, will accept this amendment in place of hers. We are attempting to achieve what the Committee flagged up as being extremely important. The final government amendment puts in the Bill our commitment to publish any guidance given by the Secretary of State on fee capping. This is a very important point, which noble Lords were concerned about.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="091104111000040"></a>Index-linking fee increases would add to Ofqual&#146;s objectives that fees should not increase above the rate of inflation. It would push Ofqual to use its fee-capping powers even where there was no problem with value for money. That is not the right way to go. It would risk stifling innovation and investment, which are extremely important. We should instead trust Ofqual to come to the right judgments about whether and when fee caps should be used. I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that Ofqual would have to assess the efficiency of relevant markets to deliver its efficiency objective. Before it could consider fee capping, I would expect it to have to move quickly in doing so. I will come to timeliness shortly.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="091104111000041"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, for her generous remarks. If qualifications are value for money, with the amendments tabled today, Ofqual would not be able to cap. So she should have nothing to fear and I hope that I am reassuring her slightly. I was pleased that she made the point about timely not always being quick. I completely agree with her analysis. Timeliness does not always mean speed; it means &#147;at an appropriate time&#148;. Ofqual has to perform all its functions in a reasonable, timely and efficient way. I have rather a legalese line to give here, but I hope the noble Baroness will be generous in listening. My advice is that Amendments 181 and 182 would make the legislation inconsistent. They imply that these words add something which would not be there if they were left out. I had to warn noble Lords that that was coming. The serious point is that Ofqual would have to act in a timely manner when carrying out all its obligations under the Bill. If the noble Baroness wishes me to, I will certainly consider how we can tackle this question of timeliness, but rationally, the efficiency objective should cover timeliness.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="091104111000042"></a>If the House will forgive me, I will speak now to the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. Amendment 163 is about changing the names of qualifications. The noble Lord was also generous in his remarks. The amendment relates to the duty on Ofqual to seek to ensure that the number of titles for qualifications in similar subject areas, or serving similar  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_301"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 301</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>functions, is not excessive. This provision, as the noble Lord reminded us, was debated at some length in Committee, and the noble Lord concluded by saying that our policy seemed to be immensely sensible. I welcome his support of our approach and I know that this amendment is trying to help us. I remain convinced, however, that the Bill delivers the policy intent and that this amendment would not work in practice.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="091104111000043"></a>I will say how we envisage that the duty might be implemented in the hope that this can be equally helpful. Ofqual is required to have regard to the reasonable requirements of employers and will, in particular, have to have regard to information provided by sector skills councils. So we expect that Ofqual will require any awarding body that wished to offer, say, an engineering qualification to do two things&#151;first, to reflect in the design of the qualification the expectations of engineering employers and secondly, to call the qualification by a specified name, such as &#147;Level 3 Engineering&#148;. Provided that these requirements are met, Ofqual would not need to change the name of the qualification. If an awarding body wanted to put forward a qualification which did not meet the needs of employers and did not use the expected title, Ofqual would not need to consider whether it was, none the less, appropriate to regulate the qualification. If it did so, it would not be right for Ofqual to change the name of the qualification to &#147;Level 3 Engineering&#148;. That title would mean that the qualification met the needs of engineering employers and so should not be used for a qualification that was not approved by the sector skills council. So in that way the amendment would not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="091104111000044"></a>On Amendment 180, it has been suggested that this clause would give Ofqual a free rein to investigate the activities of any awarding body. I want to reassure noble Lords that this would not be the case. Ofqual, like any statutory body, can only use any of its powers to meet its objectives in ways that are consistent with its general duties. Before investigating a connected activity, Ofqual would have to be satisfied that doing so would support those objectives. It is hard to see how investigating an awarding body&#146;s parliamentary briefings would help to meet Ofqual&#146;s objectives. So this amendment is unnecessary. If Ofqual could not show that it was acting in a way that is consistent with its objectives and duties, it would be at risk of a successful challenge. I hope that my putting this on the record is helpful.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="091104111000045"></a>I will close by saying how pleased I am that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, was delighted by government Amendment 185. I, too, am delighted to be able to finish on a positive note. This amendment follows a commitment I made in Committee after hearing the debate on the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. It gives Ofqual a role reviewing the allocation of points to qualifications for the purposes of achievement and attainment tables and, in future, the school report card. As with national curriculum tests, Ofqual will have a duty to review the delivery of government policies. This amendment allows Ofqual to require the Secretary of State to provide it with relevant information. I hope my reassurances will persuade noble Lords.</p>

On my own amendments on fee capping, I have not tried to set any particular price. As the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, rightly said, you would not want anything like that. But I have tried to set some sort of hurdle before the fee-capping power could be used. I am a little concerned about the phrase &#147;value for money&#148; in government Amendment 165. I am mainly concerned here about innovation and competition. I can envisage a situation where a new qualification is introduced and, without the economies of scale that might come later if it becomes popular, the awarding body may have to charge quite a high fee at first. I would not want innovation of that sort stifled by Ofqual jumping in right away and saying that the fee is too high, thereby causing the awarding body to withdraw the qualification because it is not profitable. We on these Benches accept that Ofqual should have the ability to cap but we want to ensure that it does so judiciously. I was reassured by the Minister saying that they would have to review the efficiency of the market before fee capping and that it would all be published.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="091104111000047"></a>On the two different kinds of reviews, the Minister said that the independence of the people doing the review would be assured because their names would have to be published. That would be all right for fee-capping decisions but it may not be all right for decisions relating to the possible withdrawal of recognition of an awarding body. The awarding body may not want the whole world to know that it is being reviewed because that might affect its reputation. Indeed, if it comes out that the decision to withdraw recognition was not justified, then the awarding body would go out into the world again with its reputation damaged. So we need to be very careful about publishing something like that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="091104111000048"></a>On fee capping I am not so worried. The noble Baroness is right that publication of who is doing the review would certainly help, because Ofqual would not want to have its reputation damaged by publishing the fact that it is having a review done by somebody who is not independent. I accept what the noble Baroness said about that and would trust Ofqual. I am also reassured that government guidance on fee capping will be published and that those decisions will be in the public domain.</p>

<a name="091104111000050"></a><b><a name="91104-0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="091104111000101"></a>Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve:</b> My Lords, I shall comment also on other amendments in the group. It is a somewhat complicated situation given that this is entirely new material which was not discussed in Committee, let alone earlier, although Ministers have been generous in sharing some of their thinking.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="091104111000051"></a>We are all conscious that it is most important that Ofqual should be independent and perceived as being independent. Those are the two benchmarks against which we need to judge the amendments in this group. The amendment simply sets out the crucial responsibilities that Ofqual must discharge if it is to be held to account by the Secretary of State when making a determination. The idea is surely that the Secretary of State may wish to make not just any old determination but specific determinations when Ofqual fails in certain duties. Hence, those duties need to be set out, and they are fairly set out&#151;although one may disagree with the wording&#151;in the two subsections of the amendment. Those should provide the hook for the appropriate way in which the focus on permissible determinations is to be formulated. For example, it would be perfectly reasonable to say that if Ofqual fails in these duties, then&#151;but only then&#151;the Secretary of State may instruct it to perform those duties. That is a limited and restricted reach-in power. It is not a general power to reach in and make determinations on the requirements of examinations.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="091104111000052"></a>However, that approach has been superseded by government Amendments 172 to 175. Noble Lords will remember a nice little rant by the noble Lord, Lord Baker of Dorking, who I am sorry is not in his seat, on 14 October, in which he pointed out that the Bill contained many different requirements with which it would not be possible for the bodies that have to act to comply. This is the sort of legislative pretence that we sometimes get into.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="091104111000053"></a>We might be into a similar pretence in Amendments 172, 173, 174 and 175. These are extremely complicated, but one of the crucial changes&#151;I confess that I do not fully understand it, which gives me some pause, because I have tried to understand it&#151;is in subsection (2) in Amendment 172, which, after all, provides a power to determine minimum requirements in examinations or assessments. It is a power to make determinations to which Ofqual must have regard in securing the provision of assessments for regulated qualifications. Amendment 172 states that the Secretary of State may do this under subsection (1),</p>
<ul><a name="091104111000081"></a>&#147;only if satisfied that it is necessary to do so for the purpose of ensuring that the curriculum studied by persons taking a course leading to the qualification, or a qualification of the description, is appropriate, having regard to the likely ages of those persons&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="091104111000074"></a>We seem to have wandered into QCDA territory and to have left Ofqual territory behind. I hope that this can be clarified but, if not, this is an extension which is in one respect unnecessary because the Secretary of State in any case, rightly, can make determinations on what the QCDA does. However, this was meant to be a determination on what Ofqual does. I do not see how, as drafted, that amendment achieves that objective.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="091104111000054"></a>I might raise many other difficulties about the elaborate construction of Amendments 173 to 175, but in many cases they simply fall under the heading   


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_304"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of regulatory excess, with the following effect. Ministers&#146; proposals may have to some extent converged with some Lib Dem amendments, but they may fail to hit the nail on the head for everyone. I do not know whether that is the case, because even after a lot of consideration I am not certain how the amendments&#151;in particular, subsection (2) in Amendment 172&#151;would actually work.</p>

<a name="91104-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="091104111000055"></a>I shall speak briefly to Amendments 176 to 179. This is a curious situation. Clause 140&#151;formerly Clause 138&#151;caused us so many problems previously that the Government, the Lib Dems and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, think that it should not stand part of the Bill. Therefore, I am a loss to understand the two amendments that have been tabled by the Lib Dem Front Bench and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. Those amendments invoke a principle that needs clarifying if we are to understand the accountabilities that they introduce. The idea is that Ofqual should be independent and accountable to Parliament for its overall work, not that it should be accountable for particular requirements in particular examinations. Yet Amendments 177 and 178, unfortunately, if they were agreed, would introduce shared accountability between the Secretary of State and Parliament for particular determinations. Is this the way that we want to go? It would not just party-politicise the governance of Ofqual as a whole&#151;because it is, appropriately, accountable to Parliament&#151;but risk party-politicising particular requirements in particular examinations. My understanding was that everyone would wish to avoid that. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="091104111000057"></a>We are all agreed that it crucial to protect as far as possible the independence of Ofqual. The problem with standards in this country will never be resolved if the public believe that these questions are subject to political intervention. That would inevitably raise doubts, so there has to be an independent body, in so far as we can achieve that. I accept that in the course of the debate the Government have moved to meet the concerns of Members of the House who want to protect the independence of Ofqual. Today we have been offered, in effect, a new solution to that problem.</p>

<a name="91104-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="091104111000058"></a>Amendment 161, on which my noble friend Lady O&#146;Neill has expanded, is none the less a calm and precise way of dealing with and modulating the problem by accepting that there are circumstances in which the Secretary of State may intervene. She has put context around that, whereby an intervention would be practical, pragmatic and have proper objectives.</p>

<a name="91104-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="091104111000059"></a>The difficulty with the solution proposed in Amendment 172 is that it is profoundly messy. To put it simply, the best argument&#151;and it is a very good one&#151;to be made for Amendment 172 is that, given the requirement to go before Parliament, the Secretary of State will avoid intervening in this area because it will be such a time-consuming and controversial activity. I can well accept that the news within any government Whips&#146; office that the Secretary of State wanted to devote parliamentary time to a determination in this area would be greeted with some disfavour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="091104111000060"></a>I understand that the Government are proposing an inhibition; to that extent, there is greater protection for Ofqual. I value the attempt to do that, but there is a difficulty. Ministers may be of a more excited and interventionist disposition in this matter than perhaps they ought to be. Even today, the decision by the Minister responsible for schools, Ian Wright, on the Cambridge international certificates suggests that there is a degree of an interventionist disposition. It may be stronger than we suspect; it may be that Ministers are drawn like a moth to this particular flame.</p>

<a name="91104-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="091104111000061"></a>When this matter reaches the Floor of the House of Commons, there is a danger of petty, partisan wrangling and, in particular, on historical questions&#151;I speak as a practising academic historian&#151;of non-productive debate in which people strike poses.

<a name="91104-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="091104111000062"></a>We respect the Government&#146;s intention. We have to concede that there is serious enough logic behind the proposal, but even at this last moment I would be grateful if the Minister might consider that Amendment 161 is a quieter and calmer way of achieving the same type of compromise.</p>

I also agree with her that the solution to our disputes about Clause 140 that the Government have proposed is far from elegant. Compromises are often messy. Indeed, they are a complex spider&#146;s web, which commentators and Secretaries of State will have difficulty penetrating. Perhaps that is quite a good thing, as it might dissuade them from trying to use the power at all.</p>

<a name="91104-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="091104111000064"></a>However, I thank the Minister for listening to us about this and for coming up with some sort of compromise, imperfect though it may be. It may be complex and inelegant, but with one caveat I think that it will serve our purpose. My caveat is my Amendment 177, through which I would have any Secretary of State who was unwise enough to try to reach into Ofqual by making an appropriate determination subjected to the full glare of publicity by having to justify himself in Parliament prior to making that determination, which Parliament could vote against if it saw fit. I have been led to expect that the Government may well accept the principle of this amendment. That, of course, would then have to be drafted into the new replacement clause rather than into Clause 140, which I hope will be well and truly deleted and go into the history books as a result of Amendment 177, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, to which I put my name.</p>

However, if the Government accept the principle of my amendment, I would like to

I agree with the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Bew, that that sort of debate is not desirable. In Parliament, the Secretary of State would be subject to forensic scrutiny, certainly at this end of the building.</p>

<a name="91104-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="091104111000066"></a>Let me be clear. Most of all I would like to see this power removed completely. I would like to vote for Amendment 179 and leave it at that. Indeed, that is what we argued for in Committee. I simply do not accept that we need to legislate for the rare and improbable situation of a total breakdown of relations between Ofqual and the QCDA. If that was what the clause was for, the Government should have said so in the Bill. However, we now have a considerable narrowing of the door through which a meddling Secretary of State can slip&#151;indeed, to Alice in Wonderland dimensions. Mr Ed Balls will need to be a white rabbit if he is to get through it. He would also need to be a very persuasive white rabbit if my Amendment 177 is accepted in principle and drafted in at Third Reading. He would have to convince Parliament that it was necessary and appropriate to interfere. It is inconceivable that Parliament would sanction such a thing if it were not unavoidably necessary.</p>

<a name="91104-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="091104111000067"></a>This power of determination is the linchpin in the perception of the independence of Ofqual. I have already said how important we think that is. The public will not have confidence in Ofqual if they think that the Secretary of State can tell it what to do if he disagrees with it. There has been far too much of that. That is why we have negotiated long and hard with the Government on this matter. As long as we can have parliamentary scrutiny, we can now back the government amendments as a reasonable second best to the annihilation of the whole sorry thing.</p>

I refer to the comments that she and the noble Lord, Lord Bew, made about government Amendment 172. Perhaps overnaively I simply read this, first, as a partial compromise but, secondly, as a way of ensuring that we know the relative powers of the Secretary of State and Ofqual. That is essential if we are to ensure the independence of Ofqual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="091104111000069"></a>The one way of being assured that these powers are limited is to demand that there are public statements and scrutiny in both Houses. The temptation to which Ministers and Secretaries of State&#151;present company excepted, I am sure&#151;are subject often leads to meddling behind the scenes. There have been difficulties in the past over the work of QCA and its predecessor. The whole drive of many of us has been to bring all such comment into the public arena so that the Secretary of State or any other Minister must say publicly what the advice and activity are and, particularly through these amendments, must be subject to the scrutiny of Parliament. It may be that party politics occasionally breaks out down the Corridor, but I am sure that in the cooler and more temperate discussions that we

The Government have demonstrated today that JACQA gives them all the power that they need by demolishing the possibility of the IGCSE in English state schools. That is a terminal enough decision to give the Secretary of State all the power that he wanted over the qualifications system. People will pay attention to that. They will say, &#147;We will not produce qualifications that the Secretary of State will blow out of the water at the last moment when we have spent a great deal of money trying to get them through the system&#148;. I think that the Secretary of State will find himself consulted at a fairly early stage. I really do not think that the powers that the Government are retaining for themselves in their new amendments are necessary, but at least, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, says, they are restricted and public and I think that I can live with them.</p>

We also feel that it is essential that the Secretary of State is able to issue minimum standards. After all, it is the Secretary of State who is accountable to the public and will need to answer to concerns if standards are seen to be declining.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="091104120000003"></a>Throughout the passage of the Bill, we on these Benches have asked for greater transparency and clarity on the role of the independent regulator, so we are able to support Amendment 175 in its reinforcement of the Secretary of State being held to account before Parliament. In ensuring that Ofqual meets all the requirements laid down, we think it absolutely right that it reports to Parliament. We ask the Minister this: if Ofqual were to identify quality assurance issues in the context of qualification content, what action would the Government take to respond to that and would that response be publicly available?</p>

I stress that our willingness to listen comes from the power and thoughtfulness of the arguments presented in this House. Our discussions around Ofqual and the powers of the Secretary of State to reach in to Ofqual, as the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Neill, said in Committee, are at the heart of what Ofqual is about, but what we are discussing now is also testament to the power of scrutiny in this House. I did promise in Committee, in the light of concerns expressed, that we would review these provisions and come back on Report and we  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_308"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have, as noble Lords know, done that. I accept that the provisions are not elegant. I appreciate that it is not always easy to craft beautiful prose in legislation, but I assure noble Lords that we have been working hard to meet their concerns.</p>

<a name="91104-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="091104120000006"></a>I start by reminding the House of the need for this power&#151;I know that it feels as though we are going back a bit. We expect that QCDA will draft the qualifications criteria for qualifications such as GCSEs and A-levels that assess the national curriculum and the curriculum for 16 to 18 year-olds. The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Neill, was very clear about the importance of that job and the role of the Government in doing that. These regulatory criteria do not just cover regulatory issues. They also set out the curriculum and what is being assessed. Ofqual will then decide whether it is content to adopt those criteria as its own and to regulate against them. It will need to be satisfied that the criteria are appropriate and that they allow standards to be maintained. If Ofqual decides that it cannot accept the criteria, for regulatory reasons, there is nothing Ministers can do about it. Ofqual must and will have absolute control of standards and other regulatory issues, such as grading, assessment and standards.</p>

<a name="91104-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="091104120000007"></a>The position is different, however, if Ofqual decides that it does not like some aspects of the criteria that relate to the curriculum. Ofqual is not answerable for the curriculum; that is a policy issue for Ministers, advised by QCDA. If the national curriculum changed a book by Greene or Waugh, for example, there would be no reason for Ofqual to object to that. It is perfectly possible to set exams and grade those exams in a way that maintains standards, so it would not be right for Ofqual to object to such a change. All that this power does is to make that clear. If Ofqual did object to a change in the curriculum, Ministers could make a determination requiring the implementation of specified minimum requirements. Put another way, these provisions let Ofqual off the hook over the curriculum. They make it clear that Ministers are accountable for the curriculum, even though the criteria are Ofqual&#146;s. It is not a reach-in power, as was suggested in Committee. In practice, of course, I do not expect that a determination would ever be needed, because Ofqual is unlikely to reject a determination. However, it is important that the Bill reflects proper accountability for the curriculum.</p>

<a name="91104-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="091104120000008"></a>We have laid nine amendments to replace Clause 140 with four new clauses and to make various consequential amendments. These changes reflect what we have said in this House and elsewhere about how the power would be used. The net effect is that it would be difficult for Ministers to use the power. That is not to say that the power is not there, but it will be very difficult for Ministers to use. The amendments introduce a number of new checks and balances, of which two are particularly important. The first prevents a Secretary of State&#146;s determination from being made unless there is a good reason for doing so&#151;that is, unless there is a risk that the curriculum would not be appropriate for people who are at an age likely to take that qualification. So that is about the curriculum. By &#147;appropriate&#148;, we mean the national curriculum for people under the age of 16 and the Secretary of State&#146;s policies for post-16 learning for people over the age of 16.</p>

As ever, she is being extremely forensic. As I said at the beginning, the qualifications criteria, in part, implement the national curriculum. That is for Ministers. This subsection requires Ministers to worry about any damage to the curriculum before making a determination. In that, it reflects Ministers&#146; proper accountability. If Ofqual were acting&#151;this is an extremely unlikely event&#151;in a way that meant that an appropriate curriculum could not be delivered, a determination could be made to remedy that, but not otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="091104120000010"></a>The second key safeguard in the amendments addresses the concern that has been expressed about standards. Amendment 174 gives Ofqual a veto over any determination that would affect the depth of knowledge, skills or understanding required to pass the qualification&#151;in other words, that would make it no longer consistent with the level of comparable qualifications. Standards are, of course, determined substantially by assessment and grading, which remain in Ofqual&#146;s control. But this safeguard would allow Ofqual not to implement a determination if the minimum requirements were completely inappropriate for the standard of the qualification. I used the example in Committee of a determination that required the Mr Men to be studied at A-level. Ofqual could now throw that out, as I am sure it would, unless there was an unusual publication in the Mr Men series.</p>

<a name="91104-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="091104120000011"></a>There are three further safeguards. The first is to make it clear that determinations can apply only to qualifications delivered to young people in maintained schools and colleges. That makes it clear that the Secretary of State can make determinations in areas where he has important concerns. The second is to require the Secretary of State to consult Ofqual and others before making a determination and to publish a document justifying the proposed determination. This reflects the fact that a determination would in practice be issued only where QCDA and Ofqual had not been able to agree on criteria. A determination would not come out of the blue for Ofqual; Ofqual would know that it was coming. The final safeguard is to make it explicit that determinations should be laid before Parliament. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, suggested, this is a very important safeguard. With these changes, I hope that the House is reassured about this power. It is important, but it is constrained in a way that is entirely appropriate and there are hurdles&#151;if we keep that analogy&#151;that would test that if it had not been properly thought through.</p>

<a name="91104-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="091104120000012"></a>I shall speak briefly on Amendment 161. We had something similar to this amendment in Committee. I welcome the thinking behind it, which is to establish the principle that Ofqual is not responsible for the curriculum. However, the curriculum is what qualifications assess, and what qualifications assess is set out in the qualifications criteria, which are Ofqual&#146;s. Therefore, this amendment would still put Ofqual formally in the lead in defining curriculum requirements. It could not replace Clause 140, and I do not think it would add anything if the government amendments I have just discussed are accepted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="091104120000013"></a>Amendment 176 seeks to do something very similar to subsection (3) of the clause to be inserted by Amendment 174. Indeed, the Government&#146;s amendment was inspired by an earlier version of this amendment tabled by the noble Baroness in Committee, and I am very grateful to her. I acknowledge that the Government&#146;s clause is not easy to follow, and I appreciate the difficulty we are creating, but we believe it is the best way of achieving a standards veto for Ofqual.</p>

I listened with interest to the alternative arguments put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Neill, whose contributions to these debates on this clause have been most incisive and thought-provoking for me and for others, but on balance I am persuaded that the affirmative resolution procedure is reasonable and reflects Parliament&#146;s oversight. My note says &#147;oversight of Ofqual&#148;, but I think it is actually oversight of the Secretary of State that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, is looking for.

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="091104120000020"></a>We are returning to the question of JACQA and the control that the Secretary of State has on what qualifications are provided in English schools. JACQA is explained at some length in a 45-page document that I had the pleasure of browsing through. It was not drafted with the same skill as the Bill, if I can put it that way, but the intent is quite clear. On page 6, it shows where the Government are heading, which is towards a very limited range of qualifications to be available in English schools: either GCSEs and A-levels  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_312"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or diplomas, apprenticeships, and, beyond that, foundation learning and some specialist qualifications. We have had the first taste of that today with the decision by the Government not to approve IGCSEs for use in English mainstream schools.</p>

<a name="91104-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="091104120000021"></a>Not so long ago, the Minister was praising diversity and innovation&#151;indeed, that is embedded in the Bill in the requirements for Ofqual&#151;but that is not where her colleagues in another place are headed. To quote from today&#146;s press announcement:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="091104120000092"></a>&#147;Our qualifications strategy is securing real choice for young people with different learning needs&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104120000078"></a>That lines up with what the Minister said. It continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="091104120000093"></a>&#147;GCSE is robust, rigorous and proven ... It ... allows plenty of opportunity for pupils to be stretched&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104120000079"></a>Many people have disagreed with that for many years. The main way in which that has expressed itself has been the growth of the IGCSE. The GCSE has never gained any currency internationally. The IGCSE has become increasingly popular in schools that are free to choose between it and GCSE because of the stretch that it provides&#151;the way in which, for instance, in languages, it provides a real qualification rather than a pretend one&#151;and many other aspects of the way in which it is better fitted to pupils with a degree of ambition who are likely to want to take the subject further.</p>

<a name="91104-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="091104120000022"></a>The Commons Minister concludes:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="091104120000094"></a>&#147;We don't want to go back to where qualifications served the needs only of a tiny few&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104120000080"></a>What the Minister is doing is making sure that qualifications serve only the majority and that those who would be fitted by something different&#151;by a minority qualification&#151;are not to be allowed that qualification. What is to come after this? Presumably the international baccalaureate&#151;I can see no mention here of the words in any context&#151; which so recently was promoted by the noble Baroness&#146;s department, is to be wiped off the face of state education. We are to have a system where the particular needs of pupils are subjugated to the wish of the Government for conformity and a system of examinations that is plain vanilla and simple and does not allow for variations. In particular, it does not allow for other qualifications to, I suppose the Minister would argue, show up the weaknesses in the qualifications that the department has chosen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="091104120000023"></a>This is an immensely regrettable state of affairs. I do not have much hope that the Government will change their mind&#151;in fact I have no hope&#151;but I very much hope that my noble friends on the Front Bench and my colleagues in another place will continue to share my view about the iniquity of this. Qualifications ought, at the ultimate, to suit the people who are doing the learning. That ought to be what we care about. It is reasonable to wish to impose some structure on this and make it sensible, but it ought not to be done at the expense of the learners. Here we are, disadvantaging the whole of the state sector compared with independent schools, equipping them with a qualification that in many instances is a worse preparation for A-level than the IGCSE.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="091104120000024"></a>I presume that the Bill is looking to deprive those schools of the international baccalaureate&#151;a qualification which for breadth stands over and above anything offered in the UK pantheon. It restricts vocational qualifications to diplomas, which are as yet untried and unproven; as with any innovation, they will clunk and squeak and need oiling, repairing and reassessing. Yet we are looking at destroying vocational qualifications, which have achieved a wide currency and respect, all in the name of conformity and of not allowing the best to succeed where the mediocre can be universal. I really hope that we will not find ourselves going in that direction.</p>

<a name="91104-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="091104120000025"></a>I have a suggestion for how to deal with this&#151;I am mainly talking to my noble friends. If we do not have flexibility generally and we want to be able to keep control of what is happening in the majority of schools, at least we should allow the best&#151;those who we are absolutely certain are capable of taking decisions in the interests of their pupils&#151;to vary from the government line and strike out to find qualifications that suit their learners. They will be approved by Ofqual and that whole process will be gone through to obtain a proper level of funding for them, which will be reflected in the determination, as we have seen elsewhere in this Bill, of the learning hours involved. This is looking at where the balance should be between schools and the Secretary of State and what qualifications should be delivered, and saying that the best schools should be allowed to choose the best qualifications for their pupils and should not be subject to the blanket blindness of the Secretary of State. I beg to move.</p>

There is plenty of opportunity for diversity and innovation within the four national routes that the Government have identified. As noble Lords are aware, in time, we will undertake a review of the qualification system. The Secretary of State quite rightly has powers to ensure that public funding cannot be used to fund courses leading to qualifications that are not approved by him, even where they are regulated by Ofqual. Maintained schools can only offer courses that have been approved by the Secretary of State in practice.

It would be open to the Secretary of State to approve such proposals and agree an appropriate variation in the funding agreement. He might do so when he felt that it would raise standards or secure educational transformation in the circumstances that the academy is operating in.</p>

<a name="91104-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="091104120000029"></a>There is flexibility for academies that wish to offer unapproved qualifications. In considering such approvals from academies, Ministers will need to take into account the views of parents, the impact on other local schools and the effect on pupils who may transfer out of an academy to another school.

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="091104120000030"></a>With regard to the international baccalaureate, as we all know, young people are motivated by different types of learning. Some may prefer the IB and the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, spoke about the IB very passionately in Committee. They may prefer the new diplomas to A-levels and it is right that they have the choice. Entries for the IB are a fraction of those for A-level. A-level remains the overwhelming choice for students, schools, colleges and higher education. More than 200,000 people take A-levels each year, which is 100 times more than the IB. But we recognise that many HE institutions like the international baccalaureate for its broad base of study and we take heed of that view. The amendment would create an unnecessary requirement within the Bill. I hear the conversation between the Benches opposite and listen with great interest, but hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

To do so when they have little or no legal advice, and for periods of unknown length, is doubly bad. Those affected are mainly asylum applicants who have not succeeded in being recognised as refugees. They also include people who have overstayed their leave to remain. All of them may already have been here for years and have married here and produced children. All may have very real fears of what might happen to them if they are removed to their countries of origin, whatever the Government may say about memoranda of understanding.</p>

UKBA should also screen out from the detention process pregnant women, all mental health cases, as well as torture survivors.</p>

<a name="91104-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="091104120000034"></a>In the second quarter of this year, 235 children were detained. About 7,000 persons entered detention in each quarter of this year, almost balanced by those leaving. Two hundred and fifty-five had been detained for between six and 12 months, and 225 for over a year.</p>

<a name="91104-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="091104120000035"></a>The detention of children is contrary to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. That fact compels the Government to derogate from the convention. This is a great shame on the 20th anniversary of the convention, which we as a country helped to draft. Detention of children and parents, together with the workings of the system, have been strongly criticised by the UK children&#146;s commissioners, the chief inspectors of prisons, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights and international and non-governmental organisations. In 2006, 13,500 members of the public backed the campaign called &#147;No Place for a Child&#148;. In addition, 137 Members of another place signed an Early Day Motion and 19 Scottish parliamentarians added their concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="091104120000036"></a>In 2006, an all-party group made up of the honourable Member who is now the Speaker of another place, the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and the honourable Member for Oxford West and Abingdon published a paper on alternatives to detention. What, I ask, has happened since then? Have the Government studied the non-custodial methods used in Sweden, Canada, Australia and the United States? Have they reflected sufficiently on the problems that constantly arise when we wish to return individuals and families to such countries as Somalia, Zimbabwe Sudan and Iraq? Will they start granting indefinite leave to remain on compassionate grounds? Will they provide casework and legal advice to vulnerable people, especially those with children, all of whom can readily be identified? I believe that a casework and advice approach would be vastly cheaper than the present expensive detention system. It would not make families more likely to abscond, because they would wish to remain in contact with essential services, including health and education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="091104120000037"></a>In 2006, the then Minister admitted that the average direct cost of keeping one person in detention was &#163;812 per week. The budget for Yarlswood alone at that time was &#163;120 million per year. Both figures must have risen substantially; they would be reduced by more enlightened policies.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="091104120000038"></a>The text of this Question includes a time limit for the length of detention. Will the Government respond to that, if only by way of non-binding guidance? Will they release detainees immediately when deportations are cancelled or postponed, as often happens? It also refers to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning respect for private and family life. It covers non-nationals as well as citizens. I suggest that our Government, by their detention and deportation policies are regularly in breach of the convention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="091104120000039"></a>Of course there are six exceptions to the right under Article 8, but I cannot see that any of them is likely to affect the parents and children we are discussing. I deeply regret there being so little change or improvement since the 2006 parliamentary discussion paper that I mentioned.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="091104120000040"></a>I turn now to my visit to Yarlswood centre last month. I noticed that it was on an industrial estate, almost half an hour&#146;s drive from the centre of Bedford. It must therefore be difficult for friends and relatives to visit. I heard complaints from two families held there, one of whom was detained on the same day that they received their asylum refusal. Rule 35 is being breached because detainees are not always asked at the reception interview whether they have previously suffered torture. Medical care is poor and pregnant women are not given the dietary supplements they need. Those facing deportation to malarial countries are not always offered prophylaxis. The reception for mobile telephones is poor at the site. In order to get bail, the surety is obliged to travel to Birmingham to appear in person, while the bail demanded is never less than &#163;500, and sometimes much more. It is hardly surprising that so few applicants achieve bail. In some cases, detainees are frequently transferred between centres and suffer physical abuse while in transit. Will the Government attend immediately to such complaints and find out whether they also arise from other detention centres? Will they appoint an independent reviewer to look at the need for continued detention in individual cases? This is my proposal, which I have not so far heard elsewhere. The reviewer could start on those held longest, whom I mentioned earlier.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="091104120000041"></a>I suggest that successive Governments have failed over many years to balance their duty to protect vulnerable people with the need for asylum and immigration control. Detention of parents and children should be ended and the total of detainees should be much reduced. Better casework would increase the numbers who now take voluntary repatriation, or resettlement through the International Organization for Migration. I argue that successive Governments have acted incompetently and with a cruel lack of humanity. By contrast, English volunteers have rallied round each detention centre, forming support, welfare and befriending groups. The Government should therefore follow their lead by excluding parents with children and other vulnerable people and by treating other detainees humanely. This would help to improve the reputation of this country overseas.</p>

The detention and treatment of asylum seekers is an area of major contention. Asylum and immigration are often treated as a single issue. It is important to distinguish between those who have a genuine motive for seeking asylum and those who simply want to enter Britain for emigration purposes. We have a duty to genuine asylum seekers but not to those who wish to enter Britain on dubious grounds.</p>

This situation does not sit well with many asylum applicants and could be perceived as breaching Article 8.2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="091104120000047"></a>It has been reported that the average length of stay in an immigration removal centre varies between 16 to 61 days. However, research produced earlier this year revealed a case of an asylum seeker who was detained in a centre for approximately eight years prior to deportation. There is a genuine risk that those held in detention centres for longer periods are more likely to abscond or enter illegal employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="091104120000048"></a>Britain and Denmark are the only European Union members who have chosen to opt out of the EU returns directive, which implements a time limit of 18 months for detaining individuals. This decision has not proven to be effective. The varied periods of detention reported to date reflect the failures inherent in the decision not to set a detention limit. Several other EU countries successfully deport applicants while adhering to the requirements of the ECHR. Will the Minister give due consideration to enforcing a maximum period of detention for asylum seekers and migrants?</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="091104120000049"></a>It is not in the best interests of asylum seekers or our communities to detain citizens for such long periods of time. The average cost to the taxpayer for each individual held in a detention centre for a week is estimated to be &#163;812. I welcome the decision to introduce fast-track and super-fast-track systems at Oakington, Harmondsworth and Yarl&#146;s Wood for detainees where claims are decided within three to seven days. My only caveat is that the process for these accelerated applications should be subjected to thorough investigations, where the complexity of cases is taken into account prior to reaching a decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="091104120000050"></a>Centrally held data on detainees should also provide details of the number of asylum seekers in the criminal justice system. It is a shocking indictment of the current scheme that accurate data for the number of offenders without leave to remain in this country are not available. It is right that asylum seekers or immigrants

We must not convey the message that we will give residency to those who show a flagrant disregard for our laws.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="091104120000051"></a>The mental health of asylum seekers must be taken into account when deciding on whether they are suitable for detention. Genuine asylum seekers, by their nature, have been subjected to sustained torture, violence and persecution. We therefore have a duty to ensure that if we decide to place applicants in detention centres, this does not compromise their mental and emotional health.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="091104120000052"></a>The British Medical Journal has reported that a majority of detainees who are held for long periods are more likely to acquire mental health problems and has also implied that lengthy detention can aggravate existing difficulties. In extreme cases, some detainees have engaged in self-harming or, in tragic circumstances, a number have committed suicide. These are wholly undesirable outcomes which serve as a reminder that we must honour our commitment to vulnerable citizens. It is also essential to provide staff in detention centres with adequate training as these establishments often house both asylum seekers and migrants. Can the Minister say whether this is implemented?</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="091104120000053"></a>An effective border security system is the only way to prevent people from illegally entering Britain. Immigration benefits our country. However, it also places a strain on our population and resources. Economic migrants played an important part in developing a number of our industries, such as the National Health Service. Despite the socio-economic benefits of immigration, it is important for us to implement a system that is both prudent and fair.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="091104120000054"></a>It is clear that Britain was not prepared for the influx of citizens resulting from the 2004 enlargement of the European Union. It is only sensible that an annual limit is thus placed on the number of non-EU migrants. It is vital to enforce such restrictions as we consider the impact of the rising population on our infrastructure and local communities.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="091104120000055"></a>I have come across a few cases of people who have been granted asylum in Britain from countries which do not have a history of persecuting their citizens. I was particularly surprised by the details of a case I read as the grounds for asylum were, in my opinion, unfounded. This relates to a request for asylum from a Jamaican citizen. What are the grounds on which the application was approved?</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="091104120000056"></a>It is worth stating that we have a duty to our citizens to grant asylum only to those in genuine need of sanctuary. Asylum and immigration share similarities in that they both require compromise and understanding from our citizens. It is crucial that governments do not abuse this responsibility.</p>

The Minister announced some enhancements to the package of assistance to Zimbabweans who return voluntarily. This will aid those taking their skills back to help rebuild the country. However, alongside the changes to the voluntary returns package, the Minister also announced that he was considering the position of enforced returns to Zimbabwe&#151;an issue under review since the Home Office deferred enforced returns to Zimbabwe in September 2006, following a moratorium enforced through the courts.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="091104120000059"></a>Research undertaken in March 2009 by the Phoenix Fund for Zimbabwe and published in a report, <I>Zimbabwe: Rebuilding a Nation</I>, found:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_100"></a><a name="091104120000128"></a>&#147;The relationship between the Zimbabwean community in the UK and the UK Border Agency is extremely tense and the high levels of suspicion and mistrust could undermine any initiatives that are linked to return&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104120000060"></a>The report quotes the United Kingdom Border Agency&#146;s January 2009 estimates for Zimbabweans in the UK, which suggest that there may be living here as many as 70,000 failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers or Zimbabweans without valid leave to remain. This figure suggests those potentially eligible for removal to Zimbabwe could present the UKBA with a huge task, with concomitant strain on pre-removal detention centres. If the so-called normalisation of returns policy to Zimbabwe is pursued, I suspect there will be prolonged legal battles in many cases.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="091104120000061"></a>I detect an inconsistency between the approach of the Home Office and the UK Borders Agency, and that of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development. The latter organisations&#146; approach to Zimbabwe suggests that the political reforms are not yet sufficiently embedded for the Department for International Development to normalise development aid. Support is restricted to humanitarian assistance and through channels not susceptible to abuse by ZANU-PF. It would seem premature to normalise enforced returns of vulnerable asylum seekers while the political atmosphere remains highly charged and human rights organisations report a resurgence in politically motivated violence.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="091104120000062"></a>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office judges that it is not yet time for the EU to consider lifting the restrictive measures&#151;the travel ban and assets freeze&#151;imposed on 203 named Zimbabwean Ministers and others associated with the abuse of human rights. This would certainly suggest that the Home Office is acting hastily in considering it is time to normalise enforced returns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="091104120000064"></a>Only last week, the UN Rapporteur on Torture who had been invited to visit Zimbabwe by Prime Minister Tsvangirai, was refused entry when he arrived at Harare airport and sent back to South Africa. This gives some indication of the continuing state of political confusion and volatility in the country.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="091104120000065"></a>While there has been a moratorium on enforced returns to Zimbabwe, quite a number of Zimbabweans entered the UK on Malawian passports, even though they have never lived in Malawi. There have been several occasions when UKBA has attempted to carry out the enforced removal of these individuals, often preceded by lengthy detention. There is great concern within the Zimbabwean community in the UK for the safety of Zimbabweans sent to Malawi by the Home Office. They have no family or friends in the country and have never lived there. They fear they will be expelled by the Malawian authorities as having no right of abode and returned to Zimbabwe.</p>

Can he also make a statement on Zimbabwe that would help regain the confidence and co-operation of the Zimbabwean in the UK? That co-operation is an essential precursor to a positive engagement in preparing individuals for voluntary return to participate in rebuilding Zimbabwe when the time is right.</p>

At the end, the children, who ranged from six to 13 years of age, were asked what they would like to be when they grow up. One said, &#147;I want to be an airline pilot&#148;; another said, &#147;I want to be a lawyer&#148;. A little lad of 10 said, &#147;I want to be President of Uganda&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="091104120000071"></a>The Refugee Council has done a tremendous amount of work, which I welcome. The council is opposed to the detention of asylum seekers and believes that the current use of detention during and at the end of the asylum process is disproportionate and unnecessary. As has already been mentioned, it is wrong that there is no time limit on how long an asylum seeker can be detained and that administrative detention on such a scale can happen without scrutiny by an independent body. I hope the Minister will be able to comment on that.</p>

<a name="91104-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="091104120000072"></a>I have already mentioned my unhappiness at the detention of children: I believe that children should never be detained. Would we ever subject our own children to the conditions and the hopelessness that we allow other people&#146;s children&#151;asylum seekers&#146; children&#151;to be subjected to? It is alleged that in Yarl&#146;s Wood&#151;the Minister may say that my figure is not correct&#151;83 children last year were detained for 28 days or more. That is horrific. The Children&#146;s Commissioner for England said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_102"></a><a name="091104120000130"></a>&#147;The UK should not be detaining any child who has had an unsuccessful asylum claim . Not only is there no reason to continue the administrative detention of children, we present evidence in this report to demonstrate that it may be harmful to their health and well-being&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104120000081"></a>The commissioner went on to outline a range of concerns about the experiences of children during detention and removal, such as their feelings of loss and anxiety. Imagine a little child whose whole life is dark and hopeless, and then consider that we are adding to that through their detention in our centres. The commissioner says that there is a lack of counselling and emotional support and that there are issues related to healthcare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="091104120000073"></a>When the UKBA revises the fast-track process, I hope that it will look at the evidence of the past two years. A promise has been given that it will be revised; when will that happen?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="091104120000074"></a>Those who suffer particularly when they are detained include youngsters whose age is in dispute: they are asked, &#147;Are you an adult?&#148; &#147;Are you a child?&#148; Pregnant women, survivors of torture, people with serious health problems and those whose removal from the UK is not imminent continue to be detained. Here I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Avebury&#151;unfortunately he is in hospital&#151;who has led the way on many of these concerns over the past few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="091104120000075"></a>We are concerned that when people are detained they cannot access legal representation or exercise their right to apply for bail to be let out of detention.

The latest snapshot figure for detention shows that 225 people have been detained for one year. This is unacceptable. Detention should be used only as an exceptional measure at the end of the asylum process, and for a limited time in order to effect removal.</p>

That has gone and now there are returns to countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka where such returns are not sustainable. About a year ago I invited the Minister to come with me to Heathrow Airport, where the first deportations to Zimbabwe were to take place.

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="091104127000002"></a>There are serious problems with holding asylum seekers in detention. There is the huge cost&#151;around &#163;10 million a year; there does not seem to be suitable accommodation; there are concerns that those held are not receiving adequate legal advice and information; and when they are required to leave there do not seem to be any of the necessary arrangements in place to prepare them to go home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="091104127000003"></a>The Government are well aware that they have a problem on their hands and they have identified the need for better organisation to prevent delays in the asylum system. In 1997 the Government created the new asylum model; more than 10 years later, although there have been some improvements, the system is still too slow. The evidence speaks for itself: the Government figures fall far short of their own targets. For example, the target for processing cases within 30 days in 2007 was 50 per cent; the figure completed was 16 per cent. The Government hoped to resolve 75 per cent of cases in 2009 in six months; currently only 65 per cent of cases are achieving that goal.</p>

<p><a name="091104127000039"></a>That at least was frank.

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="091104127000005"></a>The Minister also needs to address himself to the grave matter of children in detention, which has been such a theme during this debate. Children should not be behind bars for any reason unless it really cannot be avoided. Children are detained in the immigration estate in two circumstances, either because they are part of a family that is being detained or, if they are unaccompanied, while alternative care arrangements are made.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="091104127000006"></a>I am well aware that that is contrary to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, though I am also aware that the interpretation of the Strasbourg court is that our Human Rights Act blocks deportation where it might infringe on family life. As my honourable friend Dominic Grieve has said, that goes further than either the convention or the Strasbourg court and risks fettering our ability to deport some criminals or those who pose a risk to our security. These difficulties are recognised by the Government; I quote another Answer by Mr Phil Woolas, the immigration Minister, to a Written Question in June this year:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103"></a><a name="091104127000043"></a>&#147;The UK Border Agency would always prefer that those whose applications to stay in the United Kingdom have failed, leave the country voluntarily. This is particularly so of families with children. However, detention is regrettable where individuals fail to leave and where removal therefore has to be enforced&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons; 1/6/09; col. 167W.]</p>

<p><a name="091104127000040"></a>We have sympathy with that statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="091104127000007"></a>My honourable friend Dominic Grieve has said that a future Conservative Government would intend to produce a new Bill of Rights, possibly replacing the Human Rights Act or at least amending it to remedy its shortcomings, not the least of which being that it has not provided adequate protection on our core freedoms, but also to free the various courts in the United Kingdom of Strasbourg jurisprudence and enable them to use their own interpretations.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="091104127000008"></a>The three immigration removal centres in the United Kingdom that can accommodate families with children&#151;Dungavel House, Tinsley House and Yarl&#146;s Wood&#151;have been referred to. The first two centres accommodate family groups for approximately 72 hours. When detention is likely to go beyond that, families are often transferred to Yarl&#146;s Wood, and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, for sharing his experience of a visit to that centre. Does the Minister feel that that is an adequate and satisfactory arrangement? To quote my honourable friend Damian Green:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_104"></a><a name="091104127000044"></a>&#147;Gordon Brown promised &#145;automatic deportation&#146; of foreign criminals, but we have nearly 1,200 of them locked up very expensively in centres not designed to hold hardened criminals&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104127000041"></a>Not only is this a waste of money, it is dangerous. The riots and fires that we have seen at detention centres in recent years often come about because criminals become the dominant group inside the centre, a point that my

Ministers try to talk tough on immigration but they are still, after all this time, acting weakly.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="091104127000009"></a>Ministers claim to be looking at alternatives to detaining children and families, although I am afraid that little progress has been made. I would, however, be grateful for an update on the Glasgow experiment, which I gather is building on the Ashford system that did not meet with great success, with, I believe, only one family going back under the voluntary repatriation scheme.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="091104127000010"></a>Until recently the Government did not even hold data on the number of children held in detention. However, thanks to pressure from my honourable friend Chris Grayling, the Government were pushed into collecting data on the detention of children, which have recently been published for the first time. The figures revealed that 470 minors were being detained with their families in June 2009, with most being under five years of age. I am sure that the Minister will agree that the provision of this essential statistical information will enable all those with an interest to monitor how effective government policy is in this area.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="091104127000011"></a>It is thanks to pressure from the Opposition and other groups, for example, that the Government finally announced their intention to change the law to require the UK Border Agency to safeguard children by making it subject to Section 11 of the Children Act. Quite simply, the Government have been left playing catch-up. This country needs an effective and humane asylum and deportation system. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister what his Government are doing to make sure that we get one.</p>

I am well aware of the interest that he takes in matters relating to immigration detention, especially relating to families with children, and I acknowledge the important work that he has done in this area. I also send my best wishes and, I am sure, those of the House to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and hope that he rapidly gets out of hospital; he has done a lot in this area as well.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="091104127000013"></a>I have listened carefully to the important issues that have been raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and other noble Lords, and I will try to deal with the comments as we go through. If I miss anything specific, then if I am asked afterwards, I shall get back to noble Lords in writing.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="091104127000014"></a>Our policy as a Government on detention is clear. Although there is a presumption in favour of granting temporary admission, detention may be appropriate in several circumstances. It may be appropriate in order to effect removal, or while a person&#146;s identity and claim are being established, which, my goodness me, is sometimes extremely difficult. I am not sure if it was the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, or the noble Lord, Lord Best, who talked about Malawi passports, but it is sometimes difficult and long-winded to establish someone&#146;s identity; you have to remember that these  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_328"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 328</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people are fighting not to be identified. Detention may be appropriate where a person presents a risk of abscond&#151;some people have done that in the past when being held&#151;or where an asylum application is capable of being done very quickly, which has been touched on as well.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="091104127000015"></a>Detention should be used sparingly and for the shortest period necessary. We believe that that is especially true in the case of families with children, and that is reflected in our practice of not detaining families with children until close to their planned removal from the UK; they are usually detained just a few days before removal. There are some exceptions, but that is normally the case.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="091104127000016"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, correctly says, the procedures for dealing with possible asylum seekers need to be comprehensive. The process is inevitably very complex, but we have quite a good system in place. The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, mentioned the importance of statistics, and I agree entirely. Until you know some of these statistics, you cannot tell how well you are doing. It has been a good step forward that we now have some of those data; indeed, it was people in this House putting on pressure that made that happen.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="091104127000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, asked if staff at detention centres were properly trained to deal with failed asylum seekers. I assure him that before custody staff are accredited as detainee custody officers they all receive full training, which includes issues such as diversity awareness and cultural and religious awareness, and then more practical issues such as first aid, control and restraint, and suicide and self-harm prevention. The training programmes are comprehensive and approved by the UKBA.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="091104127000018"></a>I think the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, claimed that we are in breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and that we derogate from it. That is not the case; we withdrew our reservation to the convention last November. We have no intention of enforcing immigration laws in a manner that is inconsistent with our treaty obligations. However, the best interests of the child, as contained in Article 3, are not paramount and can be outweighed on occasion by other factors.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="091104127000019"></a>It is worth saying that children are most usually detained under immigration Act powers as part of a family group whose detention is considered necessary. We consider that it is normally better to have those children with their family, rather than taking the family and keeping the children somewhere else; we think that that would have more impact on the children. So this is by no means straightforward.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="091104127000020"></a>Noble Lords will also be aware&#151;I think the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, mentioned this&#151;of the new duty placed on the Secretary of State to make arrangements for ensuring that immigration functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in the UK. That duty came into force on Monday, again because of work done in this Chamber.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="091104127000021"></a>I was asked about legal advice. On arrival at an immigration removal centre, all detainees are required to be informed of their right to legal representation. If they do not have representation already, information  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_329"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is made available so that they can make arrangements to access it. To facilitate this, the Legal Services Commission runs on-site legal advice surgeries.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="091104127000022"></a>Reference was made by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and others to vulnerable groups. Pregnant women are not normally detained, except where removal is imminent, and medical advice does not suggest confinement before then or, for women pregnant for less than 24 weeks, at Yarl&#146;s Wood as part of the fast-track asylum process&#151;which was commended by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh; we have moved a long way forward on that.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="091104127000023"></a>A couple of speakers touched on mental health issues. Noble Lords will be aware that issues of this kind can be wide ranging. A blanket policy that rules out detention in all such circumstances is wholly inappropriate. However, where medical advice is that a person&#146;s detention is harming his or her health, this will be brought to the attention of the caseworker so that the detention can be reviewed. In some cases, it may be that the condition can be treated satisfactorily in detention or other action might have to be taken.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="091104127000024"></a>Where there is independent evidence that supports a detainee&#146;s claim to have been tortured, such an individual would not normally be detained, but we cannot have a position where a claim to have been tortured would prevent a person being detained. We have to have some clarity on that.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="091104127000025"></a>A time limit on detention was raised by a number of speakers, including the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, who has urged us a number of times to establish one. I am afraid that the Government&#146;s position on this is unchanged and we do not have plans to introduce a time limit. It remains our view that time limits on detention would simply serve the needs of those who, for example, made it very difficult to establish their true identity and country of origin and wished to frustrate us. If they knew that they had to keep doing this only for a certain time, it would make the situation more complicated. They would do that to reach a position to secure their release. The Government&#146;s position is fully in line with Article 5 of the ECHR, which does not require time limits to be applied to immigration detention, and we have no plans to change that.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="091104127000026"></a>A number of speakers raised the important issue of independent oversight. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said there was a need for an independent reviewer. As we have said on a number of occasions, we are satisfied with the mechanisms that already exist for those who wish to challenge the lawfulness of their detention, either through judicial review or habeas corpus. They get legal advice, and we have no plans to alter those arrangements.</p>

We have taken forward some of the lessons learnt there to the project in Glasgow. We still do not have the full read-out from there; I do not think that it is going as well as we might have hoped. We also promote assisted voluntary returns, which, as the noble Viscount said, is our much preferred option. We would like to assist everyone in going back. We keep looking for some other way of doing it, but, at the moment, we have not identified a better, sounder method.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="091104127000030"></a>Reference was made to healthcare. I am afraid that I cannot respond to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, about Yarl&#146;s Wood because it had an outbreak of chicken pox and I was not allowed to go. However, my noble colleague Lord Brett has been there and said that he did not recognise what was being said about it. He thought that it was rather pleasant. I need to go myself and have a look, so that I can make sensible comments about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="091104127000031"></a>On childcare, there is clear guidance on the offer of prophylactic medicines for people who are being sent back to their countries.

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="091104127000032"></a>The European Convention on Human Rights was mentioned by a number of speakers. Article 8 is fully reflected in UK Border Agency&#146;s policies and procedures. Article 8 is a &#147;qualified right&#148;, which means that state interference with the right is permissible in certain specific situations. The guidance issued to caseworkers relating to Article 8 was recently updated to take account of important judgments by this House and the Court of Appeal and we are satisfied that it is appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="091104127000033"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, mentioned the difficulty of getting to Yarl&#146;s Wood. As I have said, I have not visited it, but I am told that a free minibus service is available from the railway station for visiting family and friends. I know that it is on the outskirts of Bedford, but that does not sound like a bad facility to lay on for people who wish to visit.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="091104127000034"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, mentioned concerns about the efficiency of our system. I think that our system is not bad at all. The UK is receiving far fewer asylum applications per head of population than many of its European counterparts. We rank 15th; we have transformed the asylum system; we are introducing end-to-end management; and we concluded more than 60 per cent of new asylum cases within six months. So we are making some huge improvements.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="091104127000035"></a>We take seriously the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Best, on Zimbabwe. The situation there, we believe, is improving under the new, inclusive Government. We will continue to provide assistance. Perhaps I may write to the noble Lord on the Malawi passports, because I do not know what the position is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="091104127000036"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, spoke about the treatment of people trying to come into our wonderful country. I think that we treat people with respect, so I am not surprised that there are millions, if not billions, of people who would love to be here. I do not blame them; I would rather be here than anywhere else,

However, we need a system that is proportionate in handling the demand. We have to remember always, as I have said previously, that each case, even if the person concerned is not meant to be here, is a personal tragedy, and we have to try to deal with it like that. In general, bearing in mind what we have to achieve, I think that the Government do that.</p>

I have tried to fashion the QCDA&#146;s objective to what I think it is supposed to be. I do not think the QCDA has sovereignty over the whole of education and training in England. It is to do with the curriculum, which is why it is called the QCDA. I would like to see its ambit confined to the curriculum. I also think&#151;although it is not in the amendment&#151;that &#147;cohesion&#148; would be a better word than &#147;coherence&#148;. I beg to move.</p>

I have two concerns about this amendment. First, the reference to &#147;curriculum and accompanying qualifications&#148; does not reflect the full span of QCDA&#146;s responsibilities. For example, QCDA will also have responsibility for early learning goals, the national curriculum and other assessments and for reviewing qualifications for over-16s which are not covered by the national curriculum. Even if we were to draft a lengthy objective that reflected all of QCDA&#146;s functions we would still risk QCDA not having the flexibility to advise and support Ministers as priorities change. Secondly, and more importantly perhaps, the point of this clause is to set the QCDA&#146;s objectives. It is about what the agency will be trying to achieve, not what it is going to do to achieve that. As it goes about its work, its objectives  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_332"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should require QCDA to consider the wider context within which it is working and Ministers&#146; overall objectives for education and training. We would not want QCDA to come up with a curriculum that looked narrowly&#151;one that was of high quality but did not support these wider objectives.</p>

<a name="91104-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="091104134000003"></a>I argued in Committee that there was a strong case for coherence in the curriculum. The same point applies more widely; the opposite of coherence is not diversity, but incoherence. We do not want a system that is incoherent or confusing or lets the needs of some people slip through the gaps. We want an education and training system that is diverse, but within a coherent framework and which, through that diversity, can help everyone to achieve their potential. QCDA, through its work on curriculum, assessment and qualifications, has an important role to play on that. With that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

They are designed, once again, to raise our concerns regarding the imposition on the autonomy and independence of academy schools. We have raised this issue again because the response from the Minister in our last discussion was rather unsatisfactory. We have argued that we wish to reinforce the independence of academies by not demanding that they have a duty to be considered a relevant partner in the new children&#146;s trusts and safeguarding boards. We are fully in agreement with the Minister that academies will, in all likelihood, want to be on these boards. Academies are often

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="091104134000006"></a>Amendment 192 would increase the bodies that should be relevant partners and so will be represented on the statutory children&#146;s trust board. This membership would include short-stay schools in the area of the authority, a Sure Start children&#146;s centre in the area of the authority, a representative of extended school providers in the area of the authority and general medical practitioners in the area of the authority. We have tabled this amendment to raise concerns that simply making children&#146;s trust boards statutory will not in itself address any problems. We must also ensure that the membership of the board is expanded to include the most helpful and most relevant. I am fully aware that the Minister will say that it is very difficult to represent, for example, general medical practitioners in this way. I acknowledge that the drafting may need some attention for this reason. Nevertheless, surely, noble Lords would agree that it is important instead to find a way to make this possible, rather than just citing that it may be complex. I cannot believe that it is impossible.</p>

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="091104134000007"></a>The Government&#146;s own paper, <I>Every Child Matters: Change for Children</I>, states, through consultation, that they have discovered that better outcomes will be secured by services working together more effectively on the front line to meet the needs of children, young people and their families. Paragraph 3.2 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_113"></a><a name="091104134000059"></a>&#147;Co-operative arrangements need to involve among others, schools, GPs, culture, sports and play organisations and the voluntary and community sector&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104134000048"></a>Yet the partners in the Bill do not include all these agencies. To create an integrated and fully functional board, we think it important to include all these bodies. We welcome the new statutory arrangements, but to create a really effective and operational children&#146;s trust board, we must address the issue of membership. The often-quoted report by the Audit Commission in 2008, entitled, <I>Are We There Yet?</I>, demonstrated that, in terms of children&#146;s trust boards, we markedly are not. It said that there was,</p>
<ul><a name="091104134000065"></a>&#147;little evidence that children&#146;s trusts, as required by the government, have improved outcomes for children and young people or delivered better value for money, over and above locally agreed cooperation&#148;.</ul>
<a name="91104-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="091104134000008"></a>To change this we must not just make boards statutory; we must ensure that they have the right members to provide a force that will truly get us there. Amendment 194, suggested by Diabetes UK, is intended to address those problems. Diabetes UK is concerned by the lack of involvement from the private and voluntary sectors. We, too, are concerned by this; we desire an integrated approach, and it seems nonsensical that the private and voluntary sectors, despite their large contribution to children&#146;s services, are not involved. Does the Minister accept the need for bringing in these vital bodies? Diabetes UK raised the concern that it receives approximately 100 complaints a month from families who have children with diabetes, who are then excluded from school activities, made to eat alone or have to have their parents come into school every day to administer their insulin injections. It fears that if the voluntary sector does not have sufficient input into the work of children&#146;s trusts, they will not be fully addressed.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_334"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 334</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="091104134000009"></a>Children&#146;s trust boards will also be charged with drawing up the children and young people&#146;s plan. We believe it is important that the views of the voluntary sector are taken into account here. Diabetes UK has raised this issue because vulnerable groups of children, such as those with diabetes, may not automatically be included as there is no designated list of who must be consulted in its preparation. Can the Minister confirm which bodies will be consulted, or how that will be decided?</p>

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="091104134000010"></a>Amendment 195 raises a concern expressed by the National Association of Head Teachers. Subsection (5) of the proposed new Clause 12A states that there is no need for a children&#146;s trust board to have &#147;a separate representative&#148; from each body. This highlights a problem which schools and other organisations may have; the NAHT states that it would be difficult for a separate representative of each school to attend meetings of the children&#146;s trust board. That may result in a system whereby the schools that are able to attend every meeting will have a disproportionate impact on that board. The alternative is that a system of representation might be established among schools. The association worries that the second option will be favoured, bringing in another layer of bureaucracy as schools have to meet outside the children&#146;s trust board meetings to discuss representations, positions and responses. Can the Minister offer any reassurances there?</p>

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="091104134000011"></a>Amendments 196 and 198 draw attention to monitoring the operation of children&#146;s trust boards. The report by the Audit Commission lists a number of bodies who currently monitor children&#146;s trusts. Further, it argues that there should be a mechanism in order to monitor performance if standards are not being met, so can the Minister confirm that this will be put into place, and can she give us more detail on how that will operate?</p>

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="091104134000012"></a>Noble Lords will be pleased to note that Amendment 197 is the final one which we address in this group. It introduces a power for the Secretary of State to bring in regulations which would allow,</p>
<ul><a name="091104134000066"></a>&#147;monitoring the implementation of the children and young people&#146;s plan&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="091104134000049"></a>We have drawn specific attention to this because Diabetes UK is concerned that we are seeing a real conflict of interest here that could affect accountability. After all, partners implementing the children and young people&#146;s plan are appointed by the children&#146;s trust boards, which are then responsible for monitoring the implementation of those plans. Is the Minister concerned that this risks making those boards effectively self-appointing, and then self-regulating? I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response. I beg to move.</p>

It is a bit like a curate&#146;s egg as far as I am concerned, as I support some and not others. On Amendment 191, I am frankly shocked and horrified that the noble Baroness thinks that academies should not have a duty to co-operate as a relevant partner on child safeguarding, which is a responsibility and duty on all of us&#151;particularly, on every single school. However, I support Amendment 192. Although, as the noble Baroness says, it ought to be a representative of general

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="091104134000014"></a>I am afraid that we do not agree with Amendment 193. Should every single academy be represented on the children&#146;s trust board? In some areas, that would skew the board completely, because there are several academies, so they should not have a right. However, a good CTB would certainly have at least a representative of the local academies on the board. On Amendment 194, I think that they do that anyway. I would oppose Amendment 195 as being unworkable; you would have an enormous board if you did that. I have considerable sympathies with Amendments 196 and 198, and I look forward to hearing what the Minister says about the inspection of children&#146;s trust boards, and how that will be done. I also support Amendment 197. It is important that when we set such things up there is a proper system for monitoring the implementation of what they are doing. If the children&#146;s trust board is not going to do it, who is? I am afraid I have a mixed response to this group of amendments.</p>

<a name="091104134000015"></a><b><a name="91104-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="091104134000079"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> My Lords, I am delighted to have the opportunity to respond to the curate&#146;s egg before us. Amendments 191 and 193 would prevent academies from becoming new children&#146;s trust relevant partners, as the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, described them, and would instead give them a right to representation on the board. I am going to rehearse what we said in Committee: these clauses do not diminish academies&#146; independence but empower them to go further in their work. It is unimaginable that the schools with some of England&#146;s most vulnerable children should not be fully engaged in the most important partnerships in children&#146;s services. It is vital that academies are able to influence local strategic decision-making. That means having automatic, rather than voluntary, representation on the children&#146;s trust board.</p>

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="091104134000016"></a>Amendment 192 was discussed in another place. All those listed could and should be involved in the work of the children&#146;s trusts. Short-stay schools will be made statutory relevant partners through a different route. I know that that is slightly confusing. It will be done through the regulations under the Education Act 1996. Regulations will require children&#146;s trust boards to consult children&#146;s centre advisory boards when preparing their children and young people&#146;s plan. Through statutory guidance we will expect children&#146;s trust partners to consider the provision of services through children&#146;s centres as they develop and implement the plan. There should be a children&#146;s centre representative on every children&#146;s trust board.</p>

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="091104134000017"></a>The extended school provider landscape is, of course, complex and varies locally. It includes existing relevant partners who are already represented on the board, as well as third sector providers. We recognise the vital role that the third sector plays here. We must therefore allow flexibility to ensure that the local delivery infrastructure is properly reflected in the composition of the board. That is why new Section 12A(3) will allow third sector providers to join the children&#146;s trust board by local agreement. I hope that that will give the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, the reassurance that she is looking for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="091104134000018"></a>GPs have an important role to play, as Diabetes UK has no doubt stressed to the Members opposite. It is interesting to hear about these inspired amendments. It is sometimes helpful if organisations also let the Government know what they want, because they might then find that they get more recognition in our speaking notes at the Dispatch Box. Placing a statutory duty on GPs, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, pointed out, would not be an effective means of securing their engagement. Statutory guidance will clearly set out that the director of children&#146;s services should consult the PCT to ensure that there is a lead GP on the children&#146;s trust board to provide their professional expertise and offer advice on how to involve the wider GP community, which is obviously quite diverse.</p>

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="091104134000019"></a>On Amendment 194, we agree that the involvement of parents and carers in the voluntary sector in the work of children&#146;s trust boards is essential. That is absolutely without question. I am happy to reassure the House that the children and young people&#146;s plan regulations will require the board to consult both groups on the plan. Moreover, statutory guidance&#151;and this is strong&#151;will require that both groups be included on the board, with a clear expectation that the voluntary sector is always represented. It is not acceptable for a situation to arise where the voluntary sector is not represented. That would include organisations that support children and young people, such as Diabetes UK and other organisations that support children with special needs, learning difficulties and other concerns.</p>

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="091104134000020"></a>Amendment 195 would require the local authority and its relevant partners to have a separate representative each on the children&#146;s trust board. Representation is a key issue, but we must retain the flexibility of subsection (5) to prevent children&#146;s trust boards from becoming unwieldy and therefore less effective. We recognise the importance of all partners having a voice and will use statutory guidance to set out how joint representation can happen, because we do not want that to be unclear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="091104134000021"></a>On Amendment 197, we agree that the function of children&#146;s trust boards to monitor implementation is of great importance. I note the concern around the House about that. I am happy to reassure the noble Baronesses, Lady Verma and Lady Walmsley, that this is already specified in new Section 17A(3) and will be further amplified in statutory guidance.</p>

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="091104134000022"></a>Amendment 196 would require inspectors to inspect the children&#146;s trust board and to be consulted in its establishment. I understand the drive behind this amendment. How is inspection going to work? I can confirm that the contributions of children&#146;s trust partners, such as the local authority and the police, are within the scope of the comprehensive area assessment, or CAA. Should inspectorates consider that priority outcomes for an area are at risk due to poor co-operation between partners, two or more of them can inspect a children&#146;s trust board under Section 20 of the Children Act 2004. It would be unnecessary and wasteful to assess or inspect the workings of every board, but provision is already in place to allow for an inspection where it would be appropriate. We do not agree that inspectorates should be consulted in the establishment of the board. &#147;Otiose&#148; was a word used in Committee  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_337"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in other areas, but I think that it applies here. This would compromise the inspectorates&#146; independence from bodies that they might later inspect, because they would be marking their own homework.</p>

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="091104134000023"></a>On Amendment 198, accountability for delivering the children and young people&#146;s plan remains with individual board partners&#151;the PCT and the local authority. The Bill adds extra public accountability, with the board publishing an annual report on partners&#146; implementation. Again, I can confirm that delivery by partners is within the scope of the CAA and relevant inspections. So there is a process. The activities of the children&#146;s trust board and the plan, as a description of what has been achieved, are within the sight of the CAA.</p>

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="091104134000024"></a>Government Amendment 199 is minor and technical. Through this amendment, Section 21 of the Education Act 2002, under which maintained schools must have regard to the children and young people&#146;s plan, will not anticipate a scenario in which a children&#146;s trust board does not produce a plan. I am assured that this is a very minor and technical amendment.</p>

<a name="91104-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="091104134000025"></a>I hope, particularly with the reassurance that I have offered on inspection and on the voluntary sector, that the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, will consider withdrawing her amendment.</p>

I am sure that they will both agree that academies most likely will want to be partners. I still feel slightly concerned that it will be a duty rather than their right to do it. However, the Minister clearly understands the reasons behind my amendments and, given her strong reassurances, I feel that the Government will ensure that guidance is full and detailed. I am disappointed that the Minister insists on academies having the duty to be a partner on CTBs, but I will read carefully what she has said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

In Committee, the Minister agreed with the spirit of my amendment that the proposed targets should be appropriately considered and consulted on. However, she rejected the suggestion that Parliament should have the opportunity to debate and vote on the matter. Although the Government have moved towards us on many matters, this is one on which we have had no movement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="091104134000028"></a>The Minister outlined the range of the consultation. It will include the subject matter of targets, the indicators against which they would have to be set, the periods to which they should relate and the procedures for setting them. She explained that the National Safeguarding Delivery Unit held stakeholder workshops during the summer to work on this and that the process is ongoing, comprehensive and inclusive. I think that I have summarised the noble Baroness&#146;s case. However, she did not really say why she objects to Parliament having its fivepenny-worth.</p>

It is a matter of enormous public concern and, therefore, a matter for our elected representatives. Of course we must consult the experts and listen to their advice. However, just as government Ministers have been quick to emphasise over the past week that &#147;advisers advise and Ministers decide&#148;, in matters such as this it should also be true to say that &#147;advisers advise, Governments propose and Parliament approves&#148;&#151;or not as the case may be.</p>

Is this matter not important enough to be heard within these hallowed walls? If Parliament can debate the status of the banks, university tuition fees, tranquilisers and anti-depressants, voting at the weekend, the political activities of former generals and the management of water resources, as your Lordships&#146; House did yesterday&#151;and even sheep farmers, as it did today&#151;why can it not debate the protection of its children? Of course that is a matter for experts and stakeholders to advise on, but the protection of children is the responsibility of every one of us. We are all stakeholders in this matter. Parliament represents the biggest stakeholder workshop of the lot. Parliament represents us&#151;the public&#151;and we care about child protection, so Parliament must have a say.</p>

We support the intentions of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. As she said, the clauses in the Bill enable the Secretary of State to set statutory targets for children&#146;s services authorities in England for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children. We fully support the intention to make these regulations subject to the affirmative, not negative, procedure. It is right and proper that they should be subject to the express approval of Parliament. This will increase transparency. Moreover, the attention and scrutiny of Parliament may draw much-needed attention to this area. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

We had a meeting last week, when I took her through the process. In Committee in this House, I was very happy to go through at length the consultations and so on around the targets. As the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Verma, are aware, we are looking to introduce these targets in 2011, so there is a time pressure on that process of consultation. We have to develop the targets in consultation with stakeholders and then do a technical consultation. As the noble Baroness said, I am absolutely committed to getting these targets right. I do not have an issue with her on debating these important targets in relation to safeguarding. I am advised that I cannot accept the amendment, because it is defective. If it were not so, I would happily accept it. Technically, I have to say that I will consider it. I have not accepted it, but I will bring it back.</p>

I do not expect that, after all the consultation, Parliament would turn down the advice of all the professionals who by that time will have advised on these targets, but Parliament would like to give these targets a fair wind and its support in a real way.

We very much support Sure Start children&#146;s centres which fulfil a fundamentally important role in the local community. We recognise that there are certain advantages that will come from their being designated on a statutory basis, particularly because they place new duties on local authorities to respond to the local need of parents, prospective parents and young children in the local authority&#146;s area.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="091104134000036"></a>Nevertheless, we have some reservations. The benefit of putting children&#146;s centres on a statutory footing could arguably be negated, or at least there could be some serious disadvantages. One of the great advantages of these centres is that they are so flexible. Sure Start centres can adapt their services to the varying needs of each local community. They grow in size and scope depending on the needs of the area in which they operate. We very much applaud this approach and hope that that will not be damaged by the inflexibility that will come from being enshrined in legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="091104134000037"></a>Amendment 202 would place a duty on the local authority not to provide any early childhood services unless it was satisfied that no other person could provide these services or when it would be more appropriate for the local authority itself to do so. Amendment 204 follows a similar line of reasoning because it argues that in the Childcare Act 2006, under the provision of specific duties of the local authority in relation to childhood services, there should be a restriction that an English local authority must have regard to the desirability of maintaining a different range of services and protecting the PVI sector. I very much hope that the Minister will be able to offer us some reassurance on this count. We wish most earnestly to guard against the duplication of services where it is not necessary. We believe that it is important to make the best use of the private, voluntary and independent sector wherever possible.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="091104134000039"></a>Our Amendment 203 raises a further consideration. This alters new Section 5E, which is being added to the Childcare Act 2006. This amendment was tabled in another place and since then, changes have indeed been made to this section, including that &#147;local need of services&#148; means the needs of parents, prospective parents and young children in the authority&#146;s area, rather than the inflexible notion of just what a local authority considers should be provided. For this we are grateful. We have tabled this amendment here once again in order to raise concerns about the emphasis being placed on extending these services to disadvantaged families.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="091104134000040"></a>Sure Start children&#146;s centres are described as &#147;service hubs&#148; where families can gather and receive seamless, integrated services and information. We welcome these for all families. Nevertheless, we believe that efforts should be made to ensure that no families are left out. Can the Minister assure us of any outreach efforts that will be made in order to secure services for those disadvantaged families? I am sure that we will receive assurance on this matter. It would be interesting to hear why there is no specific provision for that in the Bill, but perhaps I have missed it.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="091104134000041"></a>Finally, our amendment also serves to underline the fundamental importance of health visitor services within the local area. This is a specific mention of only one of the services which we expect to be provided in children&#146;s centres. It demonstrates, however, our longstanding commitment to the provision of health services through Sure Start. Does the Minister expect health services to play a pivotal role here? Do the Government now agree with our longstanding plea for health visitors to be provided as part of Sure Start? I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response. I beg to move.</p>

They are invariably rated as good or outstanding and many of them cater for some of the most disadvantaged children in the community. It was a concern to read yesterday that nursery schools are coming under quite such pressure through funding being spread between government and private nursery providers. There are some excellent private providers too, but it seems they are all running the risk of being underfunded and indeed, many face closure.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="091104134000043"></a>We do not agree with the emphasis in Amendment 202. Mainstream provision by local authorities should, we feel, be a matter for each local authority to determine. They are already required to take account of other provision in their area, but this amendment seems unnecessarily to restrict their capacity to respond to local needs. On Amendment 203, the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, stated the need for health visitors and their position in children&#146;s services, but we note the Government&#146;s statutory guidance, which says that the intention is,</p>
<ul><a name="091104134000067"></a>&#147;to ensure that the best use is made of Sure Start Children&#146;s Centres as accessible local outlets for services for families while not requiring that these services be delivered exclusively through children&#146;s centres&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="091104134000050"></a>New Section 5E seems to encapsulate that and we agree with that drift. We favour diversity of provision enabling parents to make the best choices for children. Amendment 204 adds more detail to the sorts of diverse provision that might be available. We have sympathy with the inclusion of the private and voluntary sector providers, but we would hope that local authorities would already be looking to those different types of provision and so do not necessarily want to see the amendment in the Bill.</p>

There are some difficulties, perhaps particularly in some of the poorer areas where voluntary centres and voluntary nursery provision have been set up and have been going for some time. I declare an interest in one of those centres, the Peckham Settlement. Schools in other parts of the country have supported the settlement and the nursery provision over many years.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="091104134000045"></a>A huge amount of government funding has rightly gone into such areas to ensure that there is adequate provision throughout the country and to even out uneven provision. In those circumstances, some of the providers of the past have been disadvantaged. I support the ideas behind these amendments, but I realise that the governance of these bodies and the involvement of parents in what is provided are crucial. Sure Start has been, from the beginning, the exemplar. There were equal numbers of local people, volunteers and professionals. In some areas, it got a little distorted with perhaps too many professionals. We need to keep an eye on the importance of having local people aware of and involved in providing for local needs, which will differ from area to area. I have a great deal of sympathy with these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="091104142000003"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, was particularly concerned about provision for outreach work. I remind the House that we know that parents value the support that children&#146;s centres give through outreach work and outreach workers who do home visiting from children's centres. Effective outreach services can make a real difference, as the noble Baroness suggested, to families who cannot access services, providing important information and access to services such as childcare and family support. All Sure Start children&#146;s centres are expected to provide outreach services. It is important that there are effective supervision and escalation routes in the context of multi-agency working.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="091104142000004"></a>The important point is that the Children&#146;s Plan is committed to establishing core principles and standards for an effective and comprehensive outreach service supported by appropriate materials and courses to enable some 5,000 practitioners to take up new training opportunities. The DCSF is looking at the development of this work with the Children&#146;s Workforce Development Council, and is working with Sure Start children&#146;s centres as an important hub for that work.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="091104142000005"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asked why Sure Start centres are being put on a statutory footing. I believe that that was the thrust of her speech. She asked whether that would limit local flexibility. We want children's centres to be an integral part of the local infrastructure to support children. The provision in the Bill would ensure that that happens, while ensuring that the local flexibility that we all agree is so important is maintained, particularly with regard to health services. We know that children's centres offer significant opportunities for improving children's health. They are a key vehicle for delivering the Healthy Child programme. National evaluation of Sure Start has found that many successful Sure Start programmes were led by the health sector with health visitors reaching and engaging with families who then willingly accessed children's centre services. There are many examples of good practice. One that would be great to name would be the John Smith Children&#146;s Centre in Tower Hamlets, which has been working successfully with breast-feeding co-ordinators from the PCT. It has initiation rates of 81 per cent, which is a great example of the success of that intervention.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="091104142000006"></a>We share noble Lords&#146; desire to maintain a good mix of quality provision. I can confirm that our existing planning guidance for children's centres is clear that local authorities should not duplicate existing provision when they establish children's centres. Therefore, they need to consult private, voluntary and independent sector organisations in developing their local service offer. I hope that I can offer the reassurance that noble Lords are looking for. It is already a condition of the Sure Start early years and childcare grants that local authorities should consult private, voluntary and independent sector organisations when planning children&#146;s centres.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="091104142000007"></a>We expect them to keep evidence that they have met that condition. We do not expect local authorities to favour one type of provider over another. I understand the desire behind Amendment 203 to ensure that proper consideration is given to ensuring that best possible use is made of children's centres by all statutory partners, but I would not want to constrain local

The Childcare Act 2006 already requires local authorities, the NHS and Jobcentre Plus to work together to provide integrated early childhood services, and our proposed new Section 5E inserted by Clause 193 would require relevant partners to consider providing their services through children's centres. This would include health services, of course, and health visitors in particular.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="091104142000008"></a>We are committed to increasing the health visitor workforce and to clarifying key aspects of their role. The first phase of the Action on Health Visiting programme launched on 14 October spells out the health visitor&#146;s role in leading the delivery of the Healthy Child programme and in relation to children's centres. It also sets out the next steps to be taken on increasing workforce capacity and capability, which is something that the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, has been concerned about. It is right that local decisions should determine where and how these services would best be delivered and I would expect partners to consider carefully and review regularly how services are delivered according to local circumstances and local need. Despite that rather faulty start to my contribution, but with the reassurances that followed, I hope that noble Lords will not press their amendments.</p>

It carried out a survey of 138 heads and teachers in maintained nursery school provision between 26 June and 24 July this year. It found that only one in five of maintained nursery schools and children&#146;s centres had yet been advised of their single funding formula base rate. It found that almost all of those maintained nursery schools that responded to the survey did not believe that the single funding formula would create a level playing field in the early education and care market through raising qualifications and training staff.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="091104142000014"></a>The survey found that less than a third believed that they would also be in receipt of a quality supplement, and many said that they would not be able to maintain the level of quality and effective practice that their schools and centres deliver now. Few respondents&#151;17.6 per cent&#151;know how or if the local authority will manage any adjustment of the single funding formula once it has been implemented. The majority of local authorities&#151;74 per cent&#151;have yet to say whether there will be any transitional arrangements to manage the significant cuts in funding that the implementation of the single funding formula will bring. My noble friend Lady Garden of Frognal mentioned the press coverage yesterday: there is considerable concern out there and, although the single funding formula has not yet been implemented, things are going wrong already. I hope there is still time to put things right before too much damage is done.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="091104142000015"></a>While I accept that the Government&#146;s aim is to improve the fairness and transparency of the way the funding is allocated to providers who deliver the free entitlement, and thereby support its extension to 15 hours, I have serious concerns that it is being implemented in such a way as to throw out the most important baby with the unfairness bathwater.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="091104142000016"></a>Many of those working in the maintained sector report that they are increasingly being threatened with closure or significant budget cuts with immediate effect. Others working in the private, voluntary and independent sectors report that many of the rates currently being proposed by local authorities under the early years single funding formula amount to little more than pennies, and are not enough to support them to deliver  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_346"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 346</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their aims. Many are also noting that the proposed rate will leave them unable to comply fully with the draft code of practice on provision of the free education entitlement.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="091104142000017"></a>As the implementation of the funding formula enters its final phase of consultation, there is increasing evidence that many local authority proposals will have significant adverse consequences for services to the most disadvantaged children and families. It will especially affect the most vulnerable and at-risk children, and those with special educational needs&#151;in other words, those who need the highest quality provision.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="091104142000018"></a>So local authorities must be both supported and rigorously monitored to ensure that the aims of the single funding formula are genuinely achieved across all sectors. Can the Minister say how this is being done? I am particularly concerned about the maintained sector, as there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates its good outcomes for children. Results from the Effective Provision of Pre-School Education project showed that combined centres, described as similar to nursery schools, which have developed their provision of extended care to include full day-care and parental involvement, ranked in the good to excellent range in regard to quality of provision. EPPE concluded that well-resourced pre-school centres with a history of integrating education are more successful at providing care in education than centres from the care tradition.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="091104142000019"></a>The effectiveness of maintained nursery schools is also confirmed by Ofsted reports. The 2007-08 annual report of the Chief Inspector of Schools noted that nursery schools are particularly effective, with 96 per cent of those inspected being good or outstanding and, of those, 47 per cent fell into the outstanding category. By comparison, Ofsted&#146;s 2005-08 review of all childcare and early education settings, excluding maintained nursery schools, revealed that only 3 per cent were judged outstanding and 57 per cent were good. Ofsted was also concerned as to the ineffectiveness of early education settings outside the maintained nursery sector in disadvantaged areas.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="091104142000020"></a>Any discussion of maintained nursery provision should include their value as a quality provider, as demonstrated by Ofsted and the EPPE research. Maintained nursery schools are often copied by the private, voluntary and independent settings as models of effective practice and as a resource to improve the leadership, pedagogy and practice across all sectors. They play a significant role in the provision of training qualified teachers for other early learning and childcare providers. Maintained nursery school head teachers and their management teams also facilitate a significant leadership within their local areas, and in some cases regionally and even nationally.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="091104142000021"></a>Over the past 10 years, there has been significant investment in early education and care, and we must give the Government credit for that. But if the single funding formula is implemented in its current state, a decade of investment benefiting the most disadvantaged children and their families is at risk and the highest quality and most effective early education provision will be lost. Your Lordships know the long-term costs of not investing in early years: lower education achievement; poor physical and mental health; crime  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_347"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and delinquency; and so forth. The economic benefits of investment far exceed the costs. High quality programmes are necessary for large economic returns but where the quality is meagre, they are likely to be less effective.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="091104142000022"></a>As it is presently proposed, the implementation of the single funding formula risks undoing all those benefits of the significant investment that the present Government have made. Any levelling of the playing field must take into consideration differences in the quality of the early learning experiences on offer as well as the impact on poverty, ill health and other adversities. These disadvantages are beyond the control of the individual child and their family, and social justice therefore demands that adequate provision should be made.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="091104142000023"></a>That is why I feel it is so important to put in the Bill that one of the things each local authority must take into account when devising its formula is the need to protect centres of excellence. Without them, all settings will suffer since they are in the vanguard and have pulled up the whole sector to a higher standard than ever before over recent years. Please do not let us destroy that. I beg to move.</p>

In February 2006, the Government introduced the code of practice which meant that there would be provision of free nursery education places for three- and four-year-olds. At the moment, maintained sector early years education providers are funded by the local authority through the individual school&#146;s budget. Most local authorities base funding for maintained early years education provision on the number of places offered, not on the take-up of places. In contrast, funding for PVI authorities is nearly always based on participation rates. In 2009, this was true for participation in all but one local authority. This leads to unreasonable disparities.</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="091104142000025"></a>In June 2007, the Government announced that local authorities would finally have to use a single funding formula for funding early years provision in the maintained and PVI sectors from 2010-11. This would mean that funding across maintained and PVI providers would be transparent and based on the same factors. We believe this is an important transition to make. What progress has been made with these changes?</p>

<a name="91104-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="091104142000026"></a>As will be obvious, ours is a probing amendment at this time. We look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="091104142000028"></a>This amendment was tabled in Committee. I again reassure the House that this clause is not a threat to maintained nursery schools. We share the view about their excellence. The presumption against closure remains the same and is clearly set out in statutory guidance. We are aware of the concerns that maintained nursery schools and others have about these reforms. I stress that we want to create a system where all providers are funded on a more equitable basis that reflects the costs of different types of providers in delivering high quality early education and care.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_348"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 348</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91104-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="091104142000029"></a>We are supporting local authorities to achieve this aim. I am pleased to announce that on 29 October the Minister for Children wrote to every director of children&#146;s services with a maintained nursery school to reaffirm our expectations on the single funding formula. She made it clear that an equitable funding system should not mean that the future of high-quality provision, such as that found in many maintained nursery schools and private providers, is put at risk.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="091104142000030"></a>Amendment 206 seeks to disapply the code of practice on the provision of free nursery education for three- and four-year-olds in a local authority area until that local authority has produced a single funding formula. While we understand the intention that if local authorities fail to implement a single funding formula then PVI providers should be free to charge top-up fees, we disagree with it. We are asking local authorities to implement their funding formula from April 2010. To disapply the code until then would mean that some 143 local authorities would not be covered by the code between January and April 2010. This would remove vital safeguards for children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds whose parents rely on their free entitlement.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="091104142000031"></a>Allowing early years providers to charge top-up fees would be in contradiction to the Childcare Act, which says that free early years provision must be exactly that&#151;free. We do not want to restrict access to this vital early education and care to children in any way, especially those from poor and disadvantaged families. We accept that there are concerns locally about the implementation of the single funding formula. Local authorities around the country are working with their providers to solve them.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="091104142000032"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, made a couple of points on the survey of maintained nurseries and the delay in implementation. The implementation is proceeding to plan, and subject to the Bill will take place in April 2010. The early education survey was undertaken in June last year while local authorities were still working on their formula for public consultation, which took place in September/October 2009; it was probably a little early.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="091104142000033"></a>On the point about the rates being too low, rates should be calculated using the cost analysis undertaken by local authorities. Local authorities are still out to consultation on their rates. We are collecting data on the rates being proposed by local authorities so that we can challenge them where necessary.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="091104142000034"></a>I hope that I have covered all the points raised. We want to see what the noble Baroness describes as centres of excellence. These are not defined but I understand what she means&#151;high-quality provision. We are all at one on that. I hope that we have demonstrated our commitment to it and to the progress of the process. Given what I have said, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="091104142000036"></a>I am pleased that she emphasised that high-quality provision should not be threatened by the way in which the directors of children services implement this new formula. I hope that it will be borne in mind that high quality usually costs more. I agree with the Government that top-up fees should not be allowed because that would get in the way of equity and some families could not afford to pay them. It is important that the high-quality specialist provision being offered to the most vulnerable children can be afforded. It would be disastrous if some of these centres had to close.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="091104142000037"></a>How will this be monitored? I accept that the survey to which I referred was about four months ago, which is not a long time&#151;and, yes, things have moved on a little since then&#151;but there is enormous worry among some of the very best early year settings about their ability to carry on delivering for the most needy children. It would be disastrous if local authorities went off at a tangent and did not do what the Government think they are going to do. How will the Government monitor that the system is working in the way that they clearly intend it to work? I am sure the Government&#146;s intentions are right in this matter but the proof of the pudding is in how many high-quality nurseries have to close and how many children with special needs do not get that vital early intervention that can prevent so many problems later.</p>

We now come to the proposed new school complaints system. We on these Benches are still not fully convinced that this system is going to be any better than the previous one. It introduces another layer of accountability for schools rather than letting complaints go to the Secretary of State, if they have exhausted the local complaints process. We understand that 2,200 of those went to him last year.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="091104142000044"></a>Schools are now answerable to a plethora of bodies: the independent appeals council for permanent exclusions, the LGO for fixed-term exclusions, the first-tier tribunal&#151;formerly SENDIST&#151;for special needs and a schools adjudicator on admissions. Now we are to add the LGO on complaints. The practical effect of formalising the complaints system like this will be an increase in record-keeping and a reduction in teaching time. Schools feel that they will need to keep records of any expressions of concern about the school, in case they should turn into complaints at some future date. That has serious workload implications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="091104142000045"></a>Let us consider the amendments. Amendment 208 specifies that the prescribed functions referred to in Clause 201 should be specified in regulations. That would prevent the local commissioner from merely substituting his judgment for that of the head teacher. We need to be clear what those functions are, otherwise the head teacher is undermined and, worse, the school does not really know where it stands. In Committee, the Minister uncharacteristically told me next to nothing; I hope that she will be able to tell me a little more today. She said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_123"></a><a name="091104142000087"></a>&#147;The functions for which a head teacher may be the subject of a complaint will be set out in regulations under Clause 199(2).

<p><a name="091104142000080"></a>So that is OK then. No, in fact, it tells me nothing. I have relaid the amendment to give her the opportunity to tell me a little more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="091104142000046"></a>Amendment 211 is about the power of the commissioner to consider complaints from pupils who are no longer in the school. They should do so only when that is in the public interest. In response to this amendment in Committee, the Minister said that this was to take care of a situation where, for example, there is a complaint against a school about the handling of the exams that a pupil took just before he left the school, making him therefore an ex-pupil. Consultations are continuing on this provision, but how would the commissioner judge whether a complaint by a parent who had taken their child away from the school fell within these provisions?</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="091104142000047"></a>If we cannot be clear about this, schools will have an eternal sword of Damocles hanging over their heads whenever a pupil is removed by a dissatisfied parent. For how long should a school keep the paperwork about pupils? How will they know which former pupils are going to complain about the conduct of their exams after they have left? Is there to be a time limit? We need to know more about these measures.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="091104142000048"></a>Amendment 212 is similar to the amendment that I laid in Committee about the provision of advocacy, but it limits the provision to those children who want it from the following groups: children in care, or who have recently been in care; children with disabilities or special educational needs; or any other child who is considered by the commissioner to need such help.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="091104142000049"></a>The current system of complaints has produced only 2,200 complaints to the Secretary of State a year. Few of those, if any, have been from children or young people themselves; most have been from parents. It is likely that, as now, most cases referred to the local commissioner will be from parents. For these provisions to have meaning, however, we must ensure that children can access the LGO without having to rely on parental support to do so.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="091104142000050"></a>The amendment makes it clear that the advocate should provide confidential information, advice, representation and support to the child. They would not make decisions but support the child to understand the process. There is growing evidence that advocacy not only improves decision-making for children but also safeguards their well-being. It would also be beneficial to the school, because the advocate could be provided before a formal referral had been made who could help the child to pursue the school-based system. Local resolution and conciliation would be better all round, which might be achieved with the help of an advocate. It would also help the Local Government Ombudsman for the advocate to help the child to provide correct information as to the grounds of complaint and in the format required. It would save him from dealing with the early stages of a complaint that turned out to be beyond the bounds of his remit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="091104142000051"></a>I realise that there is a small cost implication to the amendment, even though a very small number of children would fall into the categories set out in it. However, I hope that the Minister will give me some assurance that the system will at least be trialled, piloted or publicised in its early months. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="091104142000052"></a><b><a name="91104-0015.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="091104142000107"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> My Lords, we return to issues that we covered in Committee. I hope that the Minister will feel able to offer some further response, as we remain very concerned about them.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="091104142000053"></a>Our amendments in this group are designed to restrict the complaints that can be brought against a school and then taken up for consideration by the local commissioner. We on these Benches are not too worried by the complaints structure introduced by the Bill as a whole. It is important for parents and pupils to have a channel through which they can communicate complaints and, as many noble Lords said in Committee, it is clearly unsuitable for this to be the Secretary of State. He should be a last port of call, not the first above the board of governors.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="091104142000054"></a>However, we have some reservations about the scope of the powers. In Committee, we were happy to receive a concession from the Government that allowed the local commissioner discretion not to commence, or to stop, investigating any complaint that he deemed to be vexatious. We welcomed the Government&#146;s agreement in this matter.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="091104142000055"></a>Here, we would like to limit the scope still further. Our Amendment 209 would restrict complaints so that those relating to temporary exclusions could not be reviewed through this channel. Amendment 210 would exclude complaints relating to enforcing any decision that would come under the published rules of the school.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="091104142000056"></a>We thank the Minister for her responses in Committee. We are glad that she does not intend the provisions to be draconian, that it is intended for teachers to have the right,</p>
<ul><a name="091104142000088"></a>&#147;to agree their own behaviour policies and rules&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="091104142000081"></a>and that they should be able to apply them as they wish, as long, of course, as it is in a &#147;reasonable and lawful&#148; manner. She assured us that she did not consider that the provisions would be,</p>
<ul><a name="091104142000089"></a>&#147;asking good schools to do anything that they are not already doing&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/10/09; col. 523.]</ul>
<p><a name="091104142000082"></a>We accept all those reassurances and are grateful for them. Nevertheless, our concerns remain. It is possible for the provisions to have a damaging impact on teachers&#146; morale and on school discipline. The Minister said that she would not demand anything more of good schools than was already happening. Yet a wide-ranging complaints procedure may cause damage regardless of a school&#146;s implementation procedure. If pupils feel that they have been unfairly treated and it is all too easy to complain, they may take too much advantage of it. The process of external investigation by the local commissioner may be very damaging to teacher morale, even if the complaint is not upheld. Furthermore, it may discourage teachers from using disciplinary measures open to them, such as temporary exclusion, out of fear of investigation and all the embarrassment that it might entail.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="091104142000057"></a>We received some reassurances from the Minister relating to the ability of the local commissioner to disapply the time limit to listen to complaints. She assured us that she would work with teaching unions and others to make sure that all involved knew exactly what the restrictions of the service might be. I wonder if there are any further updates on discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="091104142000058"></a>I am sure that the Minister is entirely honest in her reassurance that the intention is not to open the door for long-gone pupils to resurrect grievances from bad schooldays; I do not doubt that that is the case. Nevertheless, we are concerned that, while this may not be the intention, there is a possibility that this may be the effect. Can the Minister offer us any more reassurances?</p>

It is essential that there is a route for complaints for parents and particularly for children. Under the rights of the child, this side needs to be taken much more seriously than it has been previously. In particular, the advocacy clause needs thorough endorsement, because children in care who have special needs, for example, must be properly represented when there is a complaint. I emphasise that those with a genuine complaint&#151;nobody is advocating the encouragement of vexatious complaints&#151;must have the right to go down the route, albeit not directly, to the Secretary of State. I support the amendment.</p>

<a name="091104142000060"></a><b><a name="91104-0015.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="091104142000109"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> My Lords, can I remind the House that it is vital that there continue to be strong, effective relationships between schools and parents. The introduction of this new scheme is not about undermining that in any way. It is not about undermining the professionalism and the strength of leadership in schools. We made strong commitments in the children&#146;s plan to support parents to become partners in their children&#146;s learning. This includes enhancing the dialogue and the partnership working between schools and parents. This scheme is actually about that too.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="091104142000061"></a>Schools already have to consider complaints. This will continue to be the case. There are systems in place already. This is not about formalising a complaints system; it is about streamlining and improving a complaints system for all concerned. The principles of good complaint-handling must already include a degree of record keeping and we would expect schools to be doing this already. We do not expect the new arrangements to require new form-filling. I think that is a really important point to reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. The LGA service will support schools where their decisions have been correctly reached. In practice, this means that the service would not uphold a complaint or overturn a governing body decision where that decision was sensible and lawful and had been reached in a proper and timely way, as the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, has already said. To be clear, we are not asking schools to do anything, or keep records, that they do not do already.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="091104142000062"></a>Having a really good system for dealing with complaints, in my experience, does help to relieve a burden on the staff if they know, and parents know, that these things are being dealt with professionally and appropriately. This helps morale. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, talked about advocacy, which is very important. Access to advocacy will be offered during the testing phase, which I will come to in a minute, and  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_354"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 354</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be closely monitored. This will give us very important evidence for understanding how it can be rolled out more widely through the scheme. It will allow us to assess the costs and the likely demand before the scheme is rolled out nationally. In the testing phase we will be working with the local commissioner and we will ensure that the service is tested, which is very important. We intend to do this on a small scale next year. It is intended that the initial testing phase will be carried out across selected local authorities. During that period, schools in other local authorities will continue to use their current complaints processes. We want to ensure that we have a robust system, which is easy to use and offers schools value for money. We will look at the effectiveness of the new system compared with the current practices and how the service has investigated complaints. That will include looking at transparency, speed of resolution, how schools and complainants are kept involved, disadvantaged groups&#146; involvement and cost per complaint. We will also look at processes and practices at school and complaint service level. A key objective of the service is to streamline and provide clarity around complaints processes for schools and parents&#151;so it needs to be better and a benefit for all those involved. We intend an inclusive system that does not exclude parents from more disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="091104142000063"></a>Both noble Baronesses, Lady Verma and Lady Walmsley, asked how long the period would be within which pupils can complain. We will need to consult on this, but the anticipated time limit would be 12 months. I hope that that gives more background. The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asked for more assurances that the service will not encourage people to complain against schools from&#151;I am sorry, but I cannot read my officials&#146; writing. I shall move on gracefully.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="091104142000064"></a>I assure noble Lords that we must ensure that people whose complaints are not resolved at school level have an effective and independent route of redress. At the same time, I reiterate the assurance that I gave noble Lords in Committee that this service will not undermine schools&#146; authority or place any additional burdens on them. I should like to provide more information than I gave in Committee. I think that there is a misconception that Clause 201 is saying that all existing functions of a head teacher are going to be within the scope. That is not the case; in practice, we will need to choose, in consultation with teaching unions and other stakeholders, which functions it is appropriate to include, and will then use regulations&#151;that is what is meant by prescribed functions in the clause&#151;to set those out. Effectively, the functions that can be complained about will always be a subset of the total head teacher functions. The functions that we expect to include are their general duties, including discipline, the school&#146;s behaviour policy, fixed-term exclusions and the curriculum. We will consult on and draw up the regulations.</p>

<a name="91104-0015.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="091104142000065"></a>We have briefly debated during Committee whether discipline and the published school rules should be excluded from the service, for all the reasons that the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, talked about again. I still believe that they should be included. Schools are best placed to agree and enforce their policies and rules; indeed, schools are under a duty to consult

That is an important element of pupil and parent engagement&#151;the dialogue that I mentioned earlier. However, when schools have not applied the rules as intended, pupils must have a route of redress. I want to reassure noble Lords that when those rules and their application are reasonable and lawful, there would be absolutely no reason why those decisions should be changed.</p>

<a name="91104-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="091104142000066"></a>These amendments would mean that parents and young people would not be able to complain about, for example, the school&#146;s behaviour policy, including its discipline policy. That would leave parents with the current route of redress, whereby they must approach the Secretary of State if they feel that their school has not dealt with a complaint about their child being bullied, for example. That is a really important aspect of this scheme. It is clearly not right; we cannot have a situation whereby some parents of young people are able to ask the commissioner to look at their complaint while others&#146; only redress is the present unsatisfactory route, which will also create confusion for parents and schools. That is a complexity and burden that none of us wants to see.</p>

<a name="91104-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="091104142000067"></a>With regard to complaints from former pupils, I can similarly reassure noble Lords that the intention behind Clause 202(6) is to allow for some flexibility. I gave an example in Committee of where a pupil may have left the school, and noble Lords are well versed in that. I am happy to reassure the noble Baroness that in consulting and formulating such regulation&#151;</p>

I used to work for a very good marketing director of a large hotel chain, who turned every complainant who came her way into a customer for life, because she dealt with them so well. She would get on the phone to the complainant, find out what their grievance was and pay them back in bucket-loads&#151;with free weekends, bottles of champagne or whatever&#151;to put things right. She got customers for life out of that, and that is the way to do it, not that I am suggesting that parents who are complaining should get bottles of champagne.</p>

We tabled these amendments at the request of the Association of School and College Leaders, which wishes to allow there to be times when a search can take place without the pupil concerned being present. Does the Minister accept that there may be times when it is entirely impracticable for a search of lockers to take place if it is required that every pupil who has a locker or desk must be present? This would be time-consuming, difficult to organise, impossible to police and potentially embarrassing for the young people concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0911051000002"></a>What would be the situation, for example, if a locker search were to take place and no one noticed that the child was not present? Would that then cause great difficulties for the teacher concerned? What would be the fall-out? Would there be a case for action against the teacher? We accept that the provisions in the Bill deal with searches without consent, and not simply general searches. Can the Minister clarify a couple of issues? First, what would be the situation if a teacher asked a pupil for permission to search their desk and the pupil refused but was still present? Could that desk be searched?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0911051000003"></a>Secondly, does the Minister accept that there may be situations where it would be useful and more appropriate to carry out a general locker search without the presence of all pupils? What if the teachers would like to search for an article stolen from another pupil? It could be more appropriate to search lockers and desks without the presence of all pupils. It might be inappropriate to expose the culprit to the whole school or class who are being searched before disciplinary measures are decided on.</p>

Following our debate in Committee, I drafted Amendments 213A and 213B to protect any teacher who seizes drugs or alcohol during an authorised search. It is important to protect teachers from any possible allegations that they had used the drugs or alcohol themselves, or even sold them or given them to someone else. It is important that disposal occurs before a witness. Since then, I have had a letter from the Minister, dated 28 October, telling me that the current guidance says that where drugs are being disposed of, rather than handed to the police, a witness should be present. This seems sensible, since that is almost exactly what is in my amendment. However, there is a difference. My witness is not just any witness, but one authorised by the head teacher. This is important, because otherwise the teacher may just ask a friend to witness the disposal, thereby laying himself open to allegations anyway.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0911051000006"></a>In her letter the Minister said that the department will be issuing revised guidance on the extended search powers. I ask her seriously to consider that in the revised guidance the witness must be someone authorised by the head teacher. That would tighten up the provisions a little and protect teachers just that bit more. It does not have to be in the Bill, but could we have it in guidance? Amendments 215 and 216 make the same provision in the clause relating to searches in colleges. Can the Minister confirm that similar new guidance will also be issued to colleges, and will she say whether she will insist in that guidance that the witness is authorised by the principal?</p>

<p><a name="0911051000044"></a>On the matter of lockers and desks, I do not think there is a problem. My understanding is that they are the property of the school and can be searched by the staff without any consent, but I am sure the Minister knows better than I do.</p>

On Amendments 213 and 214, I can reassure noble Lords that the new powers do not remove existing common law powers to search for any item with consent. This is stated explicitly in the clauses so there can be no doubt on this issue. Under common law powers, schools and colleges are already able to search lockers and desks, provided the learner agrees, as we have established. Furthermore, it could be made a condition of having a locker or a desk that the learner consents to future searches at which they are not present. In order to reduce the risk of any false allegations that staff have planted evidence or confiscated items they are not permitted to take, the new powers of search without consent require that these searches should be conducted in the learner&#146;s presence and witnessed by a second person. We also consider it advisable that the learner and a witness be present during the with-consent searches of lockers and desks or other possessions, even though this is not a requirement but advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0911051000008"></a>On Amendments 213A, 213B, 215 and 216 and the disposal of alcohol found as a result of a search, my department&#146;s current guidance for schools regarding drugs recommends that where alcohol is found, parents  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_359"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column 359</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or carers should normally be informed and given the opportunity to collect the alcohol, unless this would jeopardise the safety of the learner. The clause, as currently drafted, allows the alcohol to be retained until the member of staff can properly dispose of it. There is a requirement that searches without consent for alcohol be witnessed by a second member of staff, as the noble Baroness knows. We think it would be good practice for the witness to the search also to witness the disposal of the alcohol and we will ensure that our revised guidance on the search powers is clear on this. The noble Baroness talked about the person being designated by the head teacher. That seems like a sensible suggestion and I do not see any good reason why that should not be the case. The idea of it just being a friend does not seem to be a sensible solution.</p>

<a name="91104-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0911051000009"></a>Finally, on Amendments 213B and 216, I appreciate that noble Lords may be concerned that suspicion may fall on a member of staff in a school or college who has seized alcohol or who has chosen to dispose of controlled drugs. The difficulty is that unfounded allegations may be made whatever the law says about these items and how they should be disposed of, but we think it is right that staff should have discretion in relation to the disposal of alcohol and controlled drugs. The clause provides protection for members of staff who seize, retain or dispose of alcohol or controlled drugs by providing that they are not liable in any legal proceedings for loss or damage arising from their actions. I agree that it is good practice to have a second person present during the disposal, as the noble Baroness suggests. Our current guidance already recommends this and we will reinforce it in revised guidance. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked whether the guidance will be for colleges, too. The answer is that it will cover both.</p>

<a name="91104-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0911051000010"></a>I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, will agree that the Bill as drafted, together with our commitment to develop further guidance in response to these discussions, will protect teachers and give them the flexibility that they need to do their jobs.</p>

This group of amendments and the next are about behaviour in one way or another. A similar amendment to this was tabled by us in Committee to ensure that the head teacher who knows the child and his family may use his discretion as to whether to report the use of force on every occasion to the parent or carer. Having studied the current guidance since then, I have added Amendment 217A to ensure that, when using that discretion, the head teacher&#151;as well as the governors, who are already included in the Bill&#151;have regard to the guidance. I understand from the Minister that the guidance will be revised following the passage of this Bill.</p>

<a name="91104-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="0911051000013"></a>Having read the guidance, I think it is very sensible, but I accept that some further development of the concept of the term &#147;significant&#148; will be needed. It might be argued that the head teacher&#146;s interpretation of &#147;significant&#148; will give him or her sufficient discretion in the matter, but I am afraid that I must tell the Government that head teachers out there in the real world do not think so. They are concerned that they, who know the child better than anyone in Whitehall writing guidance, will be put into some sort of one-size-fits-all straitjacket which may have unforeseen adverse consequences. For example, a child from a violent home may be so used to violence that it is the norm for him. He gets into fights in the playground frequently. The incidents are recorded and reported to the violent father who beats the child as a consequence. One can easily envisage it happening. Even worse, a child who displays challenging behaviour may have to be restrained by staff, quite properly. However, if this is reported to the parents and they do not understand the underlying cause of the child&#146;s distress, they may punish the child, when in fact they should be co-operating with the school to help the child.</p>

<a name="91104-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="0911051000014"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for her letter of two weeks ago in which she explained the background to this part of the Bill. It goes back to a child with a learning disability who was properly restrained 25 times but the parents were not told. We do not need this legislative sledgehammer to crack that particular nut. In so many cases with this Government we have, &#147;Here is the nut; on the one side we have a nutcracker, on the other a sledgehammer&#148;&#151;guess which one the Government choose. The case I refer to was simply bad practice under the current guidance and should never have happened. That is why I have tabled Amendment 217A, which emphasises that the head teacher must have regard to the guidance when using his or her discretion. Those parents should have had a thorough discussion with the school about the child&#146;s needs and an appropriate protocol agreed long before the number of restraints reached double figures. That was not even in line with the current guidance and best practice on how to deal with children with learning difficulties who sometimes display challenging behaviour.</p>

<a name="91104-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="0911051000015"></a>The Government often tell us that hard cases make bad law. They are making the mistake of reacting to a hard case by making bad law and I hope that they will think again. It is extremely important and I really hope that we can get some movement on it. I beg to move.</p>

We agree with the intentions behind them and hope that the Minister will see sense in them. We understand the necessity for recording and reporting the use of force, as parents have a right to know what is going on in their children&#146;s school life, and we would not wish to remove that right. Nevertheless, it is sadly the case, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, that there may be instances when the child would be put in greater danger if parents were informed that disciplinary action involving some force had been required while a child was at school. In these circumstances it may be more appropriate for the head teacher to exercise some discretion and make a suitable judgment about how to act in a particular situation.</p>

<a name="91104-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="0911051000017"></a>The Bill legislates only for a general circumstance; the head teacher will know the pupil and be aware of any particular situation. Head teachers will therefore be able to act with discretion and with a child&#146;s best interests at heart, which will not be the case if a blanket requirement, which is stated in the Bill, is imposed. In Committee the Minister stated that it might be possible for head teachers to exercise discretion and report the use of force and send to social services if it were deemed that the child&#146;s parents would react violently to the news that some degree of disciplinary force had to be used. We would welcome regulations that stated that fact. We think that it would be appropriate for the head teacher to decide whether the duty to report should be to the parents or to social services if it were thought necessary for the safety of the child. I wonder if we might hope to see something along those lines at Third Reading.</p>

The Government would never want to precipitate that situation. To guard against that eventuality, I commit to returning at Third Reading with a compromise that the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, could consider, giving head teachers the discretion to making a report to social services rather than to the parents. We agree and make it clear that we intend to consult teaching unions, head teachers and children&#146;s rights groups to get this right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="0911051000022"></a>Under the Bill, schools are required to join together into behaviour partnerships to work together to promote good behaviour. I am sure that the Minister is aware that the vast majority of good schools do this already, but I suppose it was felt that making it a statutory requirement will force the not-so-good schools to do it too. That is all well and good and I do not disagree with it. That is why I do not support Amendment 221 in this group, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Verma.</p>

<a name="91104-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="0911051000023"></a>Co-operative working has produced some excellent results. No one has a monopoly of the best ideas and it makes sense for schools in a locality to work together on this, particularly since some of the bad behaviour that they want to tackle happens out on the streets of their town or village and is a problem common to all the local schools. However, it is going over the top to require the partnership to have to send an annual report to the children&#146;s trust board. Surely that board has quite enough to do with child safeguarding apart from reading such reports. I would question whether the children&#146;s trust board has any levers that it could use anyway against the schools if it is dissatisfied with the contents of that report. Let the partnership send a report to the CTB by all means, if it wants to, for information, but please do not impose further bureaucracy by forcing it to do so.</p>

<a name="91104-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="0911051000024"></a>When I looked into the rationale for this, I discovered that it was an attempt to put pressure on schools to form proper partnerships and not just allow a bad school to link up with another bad school in a nominal partnership that does not do anything. I can understand that concern&#151;there is a loophole in the Bill. That is why I have tabled Amendment 218, which changes the wording of subsection (2) to say that it has to be a partnership with a group of relevant partners, rather than a minimum of one, as it says in the Bill. One other school cannot be regarded as a group, by any stretch of the imagination, so I hope I have proposed something that would close that loophole. Let us use a nutcracker to crack this nut, not a sledgehammer which would impose an unnecessary time penalty on all good-behaviour partnerships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="0911051000025"></a>I should have thought that the Ofsted inspection was a much better lever than any annual report sent to an already busy CTB. Ofsted should be looking at how the school tackles its behaviour problems overall and once the duty to be part of a partnership becomes statutory, that will go further up Ofsted&#146;s checklist. We all know that schools and Ofsted inspectors look at what a school has to do first before then looking at

I seem to have caught the late spot for the second time this week, but not quite as late as the Minister, I have no doubt. I am a bit worried about deleting subsections (3) and (4), because, if we delete those, I fear that we will be giving behaviour and attendance partnerships a responsibility without accountability. I have a raft of statistics here to demonstrate the link between special educational needs, poor behaviour and exclusions, but I imagine the House would be glad to be spared these and take the matter on trust at this stage of the evening. Placing a responsibility on school behaviour and attendance partnerships through statutory guidance to address the disproportionate exclusion of children with SEN and disability is a simple and sensible step to help address this problem. In the first place, improving behaviour and reducing exclusions are intimately linked and both can easily be accommodated within the partnership framework.</p>

<a name="91104-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="0911051000027"></a>Requiring reports to be made to children&#146;s trust boards seems only right from the point of view of providing an essential accountability mechanism for behaviour and attendance partnerships. Such reports should certainly not be seen as a means of naming and shaming individual schools or areas, but rather as a way of ensuring accountability and providing schools with a further collective incentive to ensure that they are focusing on steps they can take to avoid the exclusion of children with SEN and disabilities. So I am sorry to say it to the noble Baroness, but it does seem to me that the Government have got it right on this.</p>

There is already evidence that 98 per cent of maintained secondary schools enter into voluntary partnerships, therefore this duty seems unnecessary. To carry on with the theme of sledgehammers and nuts, I believe that this is a sledgehammer-to-crack-a-nut approach and that the Government would be well advised to rethink this. Surely it would be far more appropriate and responsive to put what is already happening voluntarily between schools and partners into guidance, rather than enact a blunt piece of legislation that has no sanctions for non-compliance.</p>

We feel that, under this Government, our schools have had to bear the addiction to bureaucracy, diktat and interference that has so obsessed the Government. Yet again, when schools are playing an active role in ensuring school behaviour partnerships, the Government do not need to interfere. Is the Minister able to give us details of the Government&#146;s impact assessment of the time it would take schools to produce annual reports to children&#146;s trusts and how much it would cost them? Is she able to say what that information will be used for? I look forward to her response.</p>

Amendment 221 removes the duty for schools to be part of behaviour and attendance partnerships. Amendments 218 to 220 remove the requirement for behaviour partnerships to report annually to their children&#146;s trust board. I am grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Low. I am sorry that he has caught the late shift again, but I am delighted that he is here.</p>

<a name="91104-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="0911051000031"></a>We have talked about the Secretary of State reaching into Ofqual. I see behaviour partnerships being able to reach into children&#146;s trusts. Schools want to work together to improve the commissioning of support services to improve behaviour, particularly for children with special educational needs. The reach in to children&#146;s trust boards and the careful prioritisation and planning that goes on in them is a very good contribution, and the Bill is very helpful. Behaviour partnerships are extremely valuable. Early evidence from pathfinder pilots has been very positive, with local authorities, such as North Tyneside, North Lancashire, Lincolnshire and St Helens reducing permanent exclusions to zero or near zero through effective partnership working. Furthermore, a report by the National Audit Office that was published in July found that 80 per cent of head teachers felt that partnerships had improved attainment and behaviour. They deliver results.</p>

<a name="91104-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="0911051000032"></a>However, the same report found that while the vast majority of schools were working in behaviour partnerships, a significant minority were not working together effectively. We want all pupils and schools to benefit from successful partnerships. This is why it is vital to have a statutory duty and why guidance, which has been in place since 2005, does not go far enough. The annual report to the children&#146;s trust board is a light-touch accountability requirement designed to encourage all schools to play a full role in partnerships. The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, could not achieve this. A group of schools could fail to work together effectively, and more than two schools might not be practical in rural areas. We prefer to leave the composition of partnerships to local decision-making. The report is also an opportunity for partnerships to take stock of what they have achieved. For example, statutory guidance will ensure that partnerships with disproportionate levels of exclusions among certain groups, such as children with SEN, can address that as a priority. The annual report will enable schools to assess their progress in this area.</p>

<a name="91104-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="0911051000033"></a>I understand the concerns of some teachers, and they will be an important consideration. We do not intend this to be an additional burden. We listen very carefully to teachers, but that is not the view of all teachers. The NASUWT has described the requirement to report to children&#146;s trusts as an important necessity, and we are working to ensure that any information schools have to provide is aligned with existing data streams to avoid extra bureaucracy.

<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="0911051000034"></a>This is also an opportunity to set out what contributions other partners can make to support the behaviour and attendance strategy that we expect to be included in the children and young people&#146;s plan. It is important that children&#146;s trusts take this strategic interest because behaviour and attendance impact on the delivery of a number of wider local outcomes relating to anti-social behaviour and narrowing the gaps in educational attainment. We know how important it is. I hope that with the reassurances that I have offered and the views from across the House in support of this the noble Baroness will consider withdrawing her amendment.</p>

I am afraid that I disagree with the Minister when she suggests that this is an opportunity for the partnership to reach into the children's trust. I think that it is the opposite: it is an opportunity for the children's trust to reach into the partnership. Frankly, it has better things to do. Although I share the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Low, I do not agree with him about the best way to address them. Ofsted is the better agency to monitor this. It is much better than the CTB. I fear that this will be seen as a very peripheral duty by the CTB, which is already burdened by the life and death responsibility of children's safeguarding. Why on earth should it pay too much attention to something like this? This would be much better inspected by Ofsted.</p>

I am saying that this will work and the NASUWT says that it will work. The NUT says that it will not work. Should we look at how this works over a period of time and then take a view? Should we be considering some kind of a review? Would that be a way forward?</p>

Let me make it quite clear that we on these Benches are not against making behaviour partnerships statutory, but we still disagree about the best way to make sure that that happens. I still think that it is not appropriate to give this to the CTB and I do not think that that will work very well. Once it is statutory it will go right up the list of those things that Ofsted will inspect, and so it should. Ofsted is very concerned about what schools do&#151;about ensuring that children with SEN are not unnecessarily or unjustly excluded. I know that Ofsted takes that very seriously. It would look very carefully at how schools address these issues and how they work with other schools to do so.</p>

<p>To ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government what measures they are taking to encourage the government of Sudan to increase their efforts to resolve the disputed census and referendum law and to develop plans for the 2010 elections, in the light of violence and rearming in the south of the country</p>

I hope that by the electronic wizardry before us noble Lords will be able to hear what I have to say on this important matter.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000004"></a>The comprehensive peace agreement signed in 2005 between the north and south put an end to the civil war that had left nearly 2 million dead since 1983. It gave the Sudanese nation an opportunity for what was referred to as &#147;attractive unity&#148;. The CPA laid out an interim period between 9 July 2005 and 8 July 2011 during which all citizens of the Sudan, both northerners and southerners, were to be afforded equal rights politically, legally, economically and religiously.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000005"></a>In the comprehensive peace agreement, there are six protocols: a protocol setting out a transition process; a security arrangement agreement; a wealth sharing agreement; a power sharing agreement; a resolution process for the conflict in southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states and a resolution process for the conflict in Abyei area.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000006"></a>If the CPA had been fully implemented from the outset, a peaceful, attractive unity might have had a chance in Sudan. But what has happened is that not one protocol has been fully implemented; and some are under discussion for less than full implementation. This stalling in the process means that unity between north and south is no longer an attractive goal&#151;even if it were believed to be possible&#151;especially to southern Sudanese.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000007"></a>Crucial to the implementation of the CPA is the national census. On its basis constituencies will be decided, the internal border drawn, and any referendum about secession taken. Yet this census was conducted a year late in 2008 and the results, released in June this  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>year, were rejected outright by the Government of Southern Sudan, all the state governors and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, following its claims that south Sudanese make up only 21 per cent of the population. SPLM officials have said that they estimate Southern Sudan to account for a third of Sudan's population and that they will not accept figures less than that. The 92 per cent increase in south Darfur's population is also considered fraudulent.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000008"></a>The national general elections, which were to give Sudan a chance to see what a democratic and united Sudan could look like, were to have been conducted by the end of 2008. These have now been postponed twice and are due to be held in April 2010. If the elections fail to occur in a manner acceptable to all parties, the possibility of a peaceful referendum process becomes even more unlikely.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000009"></a>The referendum Bill, which will govern the process whereby southern Sudanese are to exercise their right of self-determination under the CPA, was supposed to be enacted by 9 July last year, along with those to govern the popular consultations in the Nuba mountains and southern Blue Nile, as well as the Abyei area referendum. But these Bills have not been promulgated to date and indeed agreement has still not been reached over the major referendum, with the south now rejecting the two-thirds quorum agreed with the north by its own negotiator on the grounds that that is too high a percentage to expect for such an underdeveloped region. If no deal is reached before the parliament closes its current and last session before Christmas, there will be no legal basis for the referendum until after the elections next year, when a differently constituted parliament in Khartoum may come to a different decision.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000010"></a>A further source of deterioration of trust between the north and south is that the northern Government have not been transparent with the national oil revenue figures, of which a vast amount has gone to the northern Sudan.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000011"></a>Consequently, there is a widespread lack of confidence, signalled by the SPLM parliamentary bloc walking out of parliament for an indefinite period. It is now evident, according to a statement last month by the leaders of all the churches in Sudan, that the vast majority of the southern Sudanese people no longer trust any talk of confederation or attractive unity and want an independent Southern Sudan. The six years given to prepare for the referendum have now been whittled down to just 14 months. The time to make unity attractive is fast running out.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000012"></a>Meanwhile there are significant crises in Southern Sudan: a surge of ethnic clashes in the south have killed more than 1,200 people this year, many of them women and children. According to the UN, the rate of violent deaths in the south now surpasses that in Darfur. Recently, the UN deputy resident co-ordinator in Southern Sudan said that more than 2,000 people had died and 250,000 had been displaced by inter-ethnic violence across the region this year alone. Much of the recent violence has taken place in Jonglei, Unity and Lakes states, which are on what the south sees as its border with the north, if voters were to choose independence in 2011. The Archdeacon of Wernyol was shot dead during a church service and Archbishop

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000013"></a>The Church leaders of all denominations believe that these are not isolated incidents, but a co-ordinated campaign to destabilise the south in the run-up to the elections and the referendum. Nor has the UN peacekeeping force been effective: during the violence in Ezo, there were calls for UNMIS troops to be sent. The response was to send a planeload of Bangladeshi troops from Juba to Yambio, a day's journey from Ezo, and back again the same day, according to the UNHAS-WFP manifest.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000014"></a>In the first half of this year in Ezo, Western Equatorial State, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) attacked the town and the county commissioner's headquarters, killing tens and displacing thousands. None the less, John, the Bishop of Ezo, has pushed ahead with his school-building programme, gaining with the DfID funders a significant reputation for the Episcopal Church in Sudan, as almost the only body that sticks with people when other NGOs have pulled back to Yambio.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000015"></a>On 20 September, Duk Padiet village in Twich was attacked and at least 167 people were killed, and many more wounded. In Bentiu, fighting has recently broken out between rival factions of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, and between rival factions of the Joint Integrated Unit in Malakal. UNMIS, the Government of Southern Sudan and the SPLA are seemingly unable to protect their own population from attacks by other southern Sudanese. Indeed the SPLA has recently attacked UN peacekeepers.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000016"></a>The escalation of this destabilising violence, specifically targeting civilians and the Government, will make registration and voting in the elections and referendum very difficult if not impossible. There are also grave UN-African Union concerns at the build-up of rebel and government forces in north Darfur, which might signal a new cycle of fighting in that area also.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000017"></a>Military forces in north and south Sudan are engaged in an arms race that risks plunging the nation back into civil war. Church leaders and the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey report significant rearming of northern and southern troops and militias. The report said that China and Iran continued to be the main source of weapons, adding that the SPLA had been stockpiling light and heavy weapons, mostly from Ukraine, for the past two years, including Soviet-era T-72 tanks and BM-21 multiple rocket launch systems.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000018"></a>The situation in Sudan is very grave, yet there is no alternative on the table to the comprehensive peace agreement. In this brief debate, I call for further efforts by Her Majesty&#146;s Government as a guarantor of the CPA to avert an unimaginable disaster among our friends and neighbours.</p>

As the right reverend Prelate has mentioned, very little of this has progressed. It is essential at this stage that a clear picture is maintained of how vital issues need to be resolved. The first remaining deadline occurs in five months when the postponed nationwide elections are due to take place. At this point, the Governments of both parts of Sudan should be seeking a new mandate.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000020"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that the governing National Congress Party in the north is in serious constitutional dispute with the opposition parties, such as the Umma, who have withdrawn, perhaps temporarily, from the national parliament. We must hope that these issues in the north can be resolved as the election approaches, as well as all the others. Even more comes one&#146;s way in the news emanating from the south, of which the right reverend Prelate has given a fairly extensive example. I have heard it said that the northern Government, through their intelligence arm, are sending weapons to opposing tribal leaders in the south. Then again, the military commanders in the south are supposedly illegally passing weapons to their relatives who are in conflict with rival clans of their own tribe. I have been told about the Dinka people of Warab state. It gives the appearance of a lack of leadership. Will the Minister tell us the Government's evaluation of whether those responsible in Southern Sudan have the resolve or resources to establish a better level of law and order, and what could be done to encourage or assist them in this?</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000021"></a>The CPA brought to an end 22 years of civil and inter-regional war. It is always easier to play on people's fears and promote hostility than it is to create unity. Here in Europe, 50 years after a five-year war, today's headlines tell us that we are still hesitant to say that we can or should adopt all the philosophies of our European neighbours. How much more difficult it is when quantities of people in an area are unaccountable and armed to the teeth.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000022"></a>For those watching the faltering way in which the CPA is progressing there was great encouragement to see that one issue of agreement had been reached between the two vice-presidents representing the different ethnic interests. As the right reverend Prelate has just informed us, this has been rejected. The proposal of a simple majority of two-thirds would have given some reassurance that the referendum would be acceptable. Can the Government tell the House what steps are still required to complete the framework for the referendum which has, as the right reverend Prelate has mentioned, not been agreed?</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000023"></a>As the question of actual numbers voting rises up the agenda, could we get some idea of how the registration of voters is progressing? Further, when the referendum comes, how will the wishes of southerners living in the north of Sudan be assessed? Without a certifiable process, there could be an unfortunate polarisation between ethnic elements, and even a mass return of those in the north who wish to emphasise their new allegiance to the south, which will serve only to drive the different elements further apart. Whichever way the 2011 referendum goes&#151;presuming that it takes place&#151;Arabs and Africans will have to learn to co-operate just as much as the Russians, Poles, Germans, French,

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000025"></a>The coming elections in Sudan have been very uncertain because of the census return and so on over the past two years. Some 20 political parties are threatening a new boycott of next year&#146;s elections. The elections were supposed to be a milestone in the democratic transformation of Sudan, but the considerable challenges that it faces could very well destabilise the country and further undermine an already shaky peace deal between the north and the south.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000026"></a>The London-based African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies said that there had been an,</p>
<ul><a name="091104107000098"></a>&#147;increasing crackdown on freedom of expression in Sudan, targeting public discussion of, and preparation for, the elections. Since the beginning of August, Sudanese authorities have systematically targeted any activities, symposia, public rallies or lectures related to the elections&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="091104107000087"></a>The 20 discontented parties are demanding changes to laws on civil liberties, press freedom, democracy and transparency. The prime problem is the unfairness of the distribution of the oil revenue. Some 95 per cent of the oil revenue comes from the south, while 65 per cent comes from the Khartoum area. Some 50 per cent is supposed to go to the south; yet today&#146;s news is that Southern Sudan&#146;s semi-autonomous Government have received nearly &#163;4.2 billion in oil revenue since they took over after the 2005 peace deal. The question is whether they are doing enough with the revenue for the people there.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000027"></a>A report issued this morning tells us that in a village half-way up a steep mountain slope in Southern Sudan, a woman is grinding up leaves plucked from a tree. The drab green powder added to some water will have to do for her lunch. She says, &#147;Every day we eat these leaves&#148;&#151;they are convinced that this very unhealthy diet might at least serve for the present. We have known of this dreadful situation in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan for many years, and the present distribution of income is doing nothing at all to alleviate it. The corruption in Khartoum&#151;indeed, the whole situation&#151;is very uncertain indeed.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000028"></a>Signatories to the Juba declaration include the Sudan People&#146;s Liberation Army/Movement, which governs semi-autonomous Southern Sudan and has been a partner in the fragile national Government since 2005. The comprehensive peace agreement put an end to 20 years of the north-south war. In the Juba declaration, the parties have said that they will stay away from presidential, parliamentary and local polls unless the row over the results of the census, which affects electoral constituencies, is resolved. The President says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="091104107000093"></a>&#147;I believe that the general elections, if properly conducted, shall be a critical impetus for change and empowerment of our people to choose their political leaders and elect their democratic institutions&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104107000088"></a>But his concern is that the results of the population census are,</p>
<ul><a name="091104107000099"></a>&#147;too flawed and lack the minimum acceptable level of credibility&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="091104107000089"></a>He added:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="091104107000094"></a>&#147;Without the resolution of this issue ... the election process, despite our preparedness for it, may be put in jeopardy&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104107000090"></a>Most of the people facing a poll have never voted in their lives. It is a very complex poll and it is in jeopardy because of the flaky census results. The stakes are very high. If the election should lack credibility, it is hard to see how the comprehensive peace agreement can survive.</p>

<p><a name="091104107000029"></a><b><a name="91104-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="091104107000118"></a>Lord Luce:</b> My Lords, the right reverend Prelate has done a great service in raising the Sudan prior to the election and the referendum. My interest goes back a very long time, to 1947. I was the son of a British civil servant in the Sudan and I recall witnessing the 1953 elections which led to internal self-government in the Sudan. Those elections were very successful and were backed up by a good governance system in the Sudan in those days. I retain a picture of very decent people in both the north and south. But since then they have faced two prolonged civil wars, which have caused absolute devastation, enormous loss of life&#151;2.5 million people&#151;and the displacement of more than 4 million people. The Sudanese deserve better than that. Sudan is now on the verge of disintegration and faces interrelated issues, the north/south issue being the central one; the Darfur issue and other issues in the Blue Nile province and the Abyei area.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000030"></a>Our hope has to lie in the comprehensive peace agreement. There is no option, it seems to me. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s assessment of the prospects for making at least some progress in that area. There needs to be confidence in this process on the part of all the parties if this whole venture is to succeed. The right reverend Prelate and others have mentioned the conditions that need to be satisfied if this problem is to be resolved; for example, as regards boundary demarcation in areas such as Abyei, which will become like Kashmir in the future if that is not resolved and the questions of security, the militias, the training of the police and dealing with displaced people. There needs to be adequate governance and the rule of law. Previous speakers have referred to the sharing of wealth, particularly that derived from oil. The census question needs to be addressed, as do the electoral arrangements. At the moment, they are very complex and people have to vote several times, employing several voting methods, in both the north and the south. We need to put aside preconceived views because only one thing matters; namely, that the people of Sudan are confident that the arrangements are trustworthy and will be honoured. If that does not happen, the whole thing will disintegrate and there will be violence all over again.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000031"></a>It seems to me that we have to take a view of the two main parties&#151;the National Congress Party in the north and the SPLM in the south. Both sides must feel that they have a self-interest in the success of the elections. If one party feels cornered, it will lash out, as we are seeing now in Zimbabwe. There is a lesson to  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC57"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be learnt from that. Therefore, to reassure people, there needs to be contingency planning for not only the electoral period and the referendum but for what happens after the referendum. That seems to be the key thing. People need to know that there will be a stable transition. Whether people vote for complete independence, a confederal arrangement, or whatever, they need to be assured that they can trust that arrangement and that adequate reconstruction plans in which many international Governments and multilateral bodies will participate are in place.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000032"></a>Britain&#146;s role is limited compared with our position 50 years ago. Nevertheless, we have a position. We have an envoy to Sudan. We have a role as a guarantor of the 2005 agreement. We must work with our colleagues in Egypt, China and the United States as closely as possible to try to move this forward satisfactorily.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000033"></a>Sudan is at yet another crossroads. Failure would lead to disaster, disintegration and military conflict. Our interest is to do whatever we can, however limited our influence, to help the long-suffering people of Sudan.</p>

His diocese and the diocese of Bradford have shared links with the Episcopal Church of Sudan over many years, and we have many friends in that vast and troubled country.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000035"></a>I was privileged to be in Juba 18 months ago for the enthronement of Daniel Deng as the Archbishop of the Episcopal Church. It seemed to me that it was a case of &#147;cometh the hour, cometh the man&#148;. At his enthronement, the archbishop committed the Church to work for peace both in the north and south. Other denominations share that commitment. The archbishop is living by his word. He has been criss-crossing the country since his enthronement, witnessing at first hand the suffering that the people are experiencing, especially in the south. At Easter he visited the Nuer area of Ayod. He was one of a group of Dinkas. He spoke of love and peace between the tribes and discovered, after he had returned to Juba, that the trouble between the two tribes&#151;the cattle rustling and the violence&#151;had stopped.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000036"></a>Across Sudan, the Church is determined to work for peace. The archbishop said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="091104107000095"></a>&#147;The church is one of the most effective ground-level players in the peace process, and is proof that our message of love and reconciliation is one that is most effective in the peace building among the tribes of southern Sudan&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104107000091"></a>The Church is present in nearly every small village in Southern Sudan. Its presence is unmatched by either the military or government. The Church does not run away when the NGOs run away. My noble colleague has already referred to the Lord&#146;s Resistance Army attacking over the border. Whereas all the NGOs fled, the Church has remained there, doing its work in schools.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>

I worry that sometimes we might imagine that there could be a neat tear across Sudan from Darfur to the Red Sea. It would not be a neat tear at all. Some of our links are with the diocese of Kadugli in the Nuba mountains. That is right on the boundary&#151;the area is technically in the north, but its heart is in the south. During most of the country&#146;s life, Muslims and Christians have got on happily side by side. That is not the case now. Many people from the region, along with others, have fled to Khartoum. There are something like 3 million internally displaced people, many of them from the south. Some of them are now fairly well established, but others are living in desperate poverty.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000038"></a>It is a hopeless situation. I visited Jabarona. The people there had been forcibly moved from the desert on one side of Khartoum to the desert on the other. They named their new settlement &#147;Jabarona&#148;, which means, &#147;We were forced&#148;. That illustrates how so many people in Sudan feel at the moment&#151;forced hither and thither, with no say over their destiny. Our Government, as has been said, are one of the guarantors of the peace agreement.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000039"></a>I believe for myself that the elections should not take place until after the referendum, but it seems that no one can dare say that because they would be accused of undermining democracy and it was used as an argument by their opponents. But it is necessary to have the referendum and then to work beyond it, whether in one state or two states.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000040"></a>On behalf of the Church in Sudan and its friends in this country, I offer the Government our wholehearted support in working for peace, whether it be the Church on the ground over there or the Church here represented by the two right reverend Prelates.</p>

The political situation in Sudan is a major cause for concern both to its citizens and those in the African diaspora. There is an obvious and persistent threat that the unrest in Sudan will permeate its borders.</p>

<p><a name="091104107000042"></a>The political and social unrest in Sudan is far more complex than simply a case of the predominantly Muslim north locking heads with the Christian majority in the south. Peace in Sudan has been challenged by disputes over mineral resources and tensions among ethnic groups coupled with the conflict in Darfur and cross-border violence from rebel militias. Under the terms of the comprehensive peace agreement, the south of Sudan is eligible for a secession referendum. I strongly welcome the decision of the National Congress Party to abandon the disputed results of the 2008 census. I am also pleased that the party has decided against its initial proposal of 90 per cent to 66 per cent respectively for the elections. The decision made by the Sudanese People&#146;s Liberation Movement to end the stalemate with the National Congress Party and recognise the referendum law by agreeing to a 50 per cent plus 1 per cent majority is encouraging. These developments reveal a willingness in both parties to adhere to the spirit of the comprehensive peace agreement. Measures must now be put in place by the international community to

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000043"></a>Reports have estimated that there are up to 4.5 million displaced refugees as a result of the north-south feud. Eastern Sudan is also experiencing a surge in refugees from Somalia and Eritrea due to their respective political challenges. Approximately 2,000 people have been killed in Southern Sudan this year, a startling figure as the death toll now surpasses that in Darfur. Greater dialogue is needed between the African Union and the United Nations peacekeeping forces under the terms of the Darfur peace agreement to address the reported lack of resources that has affected progress in the region. A stronger commitment to achieving a ceasefire in the Darfuri states must coincide with a regime change that should result in making the perpetrators of heinous crimes committed in the region accountable for their actions.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000044"></a>The British Government were an active member of the peace negotiations and the Darfur peace accords, and therefore have an obligation to work towards a favourable outcome for all Sudanese citizens. The international community has a responsibility to strive towards achieving peace and stability in Sudan through building a multinational coalition that produces tangible results. The potential for the precarious situation in Sudan to escalate and jeopardise stability in other parts of the region and in Africa as a whole must not be underestimated. We should recognise the recent progress made in Sudan, but we must also acknowledge and reiterate our commitment to achieving peace in the region.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000047"></a>First, in Southern Sudan and the Nuba mountains earlier this year, we found widespread fear that the Government in the north would try to undermine the peace agreement, as they do not wish the south to gain independence. There was deep suspicion that the north was arming surrogate militias to destabilise the south, to create terror and to undermine confidence in the Government of Southern Sudan&#151;for example, supporting the infamous Lord&#146;s Resistance Army&#146;s activities in Sudan. It was a not unreasonable fear, as Khartoum had allowed the LRA to run its horrific training camps for thousands of Ugandan child soldiers in Khartoum-administered territory for many years. Will Her Majesty&#146;s Government urge the Assessment and Evaluation Commission to ensure that no arms are being supplied to any militias from any source?</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC60"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000048"></a>Secondly, there is a dire humanitarian situation in many parts of Southern Sudan, Southern Blue Nile, the Nuba mountains and the Beja lands. Darfur has inevitably been a priority for many major aid organisations, leaving immense areas of unmet need elsewhere. I give just two shocking statistics: in Southern Sudan, only 19 per cent of the population receive immunisation, leaving the majority of children vulnerable to diseases such as TB, tetanus and polio; and one in eight mothers will die in childbirth. Does DfID&#146;s funding policy adequately address these critical situations, including consideration of the appropriateness of the shift from relief to development priorities?</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000049"></a>Thirdly, many leaders in the south feel under pressure from the international community not to secede, but many feel that they have suffered too long from being part of a united Sudan and their only hope for freedom and justice lies in independence. The Roman Catholic Archbishop in Juba told us earlier this year that it would be helpful if the international community understood the fundamental differences in motives between the north and the south: the north wishes to maintain unity for reasons of wealth- and power-sharing, while motives influencing the peoples of the south are passion for religious freedom and the preservation of their African identity. Remember that the war which broke out in the early 1980s, resulting in 2 million dead and 4 million displaced, was in response to an attempt by the north to impose Sharia law in Bor; and that African southerners&#151;Muslims, Christians and traditional believers&#151;have long felt victims of perceived Arab domination, racism, slavery and attempts to destroy African culture.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000050"></a>Fourthly, there was the abduction into slavery of tens of thousands of Africans, especially from Bahr-el-Ghazal and the Nuba mountains, during the last war. I met many who had escaped and whom we had helped to freedom, and we heard their heartbreaking stories. Many thousands are still in captivity. Two days ago, an Anglican priest told us that members of his own family are still enslaved, but it is too dangerous to try to rescue them. Will Her Majesty's Government put great pressure on the Government in Khartoum to ensure that all remaining abductees are identified and returned to their homes as a matter of urgency?</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000051"></a>Finally, given the recent unfortunate cancellation of a visit by the President of Southern Sudan, will Her Majesty&#146;s Government undertake to reinstate a visit as soon as possible?</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000052"></a>The comprehensive peace agreement is the only hope on the horizon for peace and alleviation of suffering for the people of Sudan who have suffered too much, too long. But it is fragile and inevitably some do not wish it to proceed. The Sudanese look to the United Kingdom as a special friend, but also as the nation which has a historic responsibility to help them in these critical times. I trust that history will show that we fulfil that responsibility honourably.</p>

<p><a name="091104107000054"></a>The right reverend Prelate referred to the recent statement from seven church leaders condemning the failure of the north and of our international guarantors to make progress with the CPA. In their words:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="091104107000096"></a>&#147;There is a widespread lack of confidence by Southerners ... in the fairness or true democracy of the upcoming elections and referendum because of a general lack of trustworthiness and transparency from the Northern government ... If the CPA is to be made to work, it must be fully implemented by both signatories and fully supported by those guarantor governments who promised to do so in 2005.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="091104107000097"></a>The Southern Sudanese people will now no longer accept any renegotiation of the CPA. If such a thing happens ... the Southern Sudanese people will feel betrayed by the rest of the world as in 1956 and 1972&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104107000092"></a>That is the southern perspective, and politicians from Khartoum must recognise that unity is drifting away from them. The stakes are high. The National Democratic Institute in Washington estimates that 90 per cent of southerners would vote for independence in a referendum. We should welcome the new US initiative, led by the special envoy. The State Department argues that it is now time to act with a sense of urgency.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000055"></a>I am sure that the Minister will explain what is delaying the agreement and how the US can assist the guarantors at this critical time. The most urgent area may be the JIUs, which are looking flaky at certain points, although they must provide security in some key areas, such as Malakal. That is a vital part of the CPA. Pre-election assessment is too slow. More work must go into the detailed legal framework, as others have said, to provide for credible elections&#151;including voter education and monitoring&#151;and to prepare for the referendum.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000056"></a>Despite outbreaks of violence, October seems to have been a month of reconciliation. For example, more than 7,000 ex-combatants were disarmed in southern Kordofan. Opposition parties from north and south have met in Juba. In Abyei, the Dinka, Ngok and Misseriya seem to have sunk their differences, following the Permanent Court of Arbitration&#146;s decision. Here, again, the US has had some impact, but I am sorry to hear that development funds are being held up for lack of United Nations and NGO support on the ground.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000057"></a>Many humanitarian problems persist, and parts of the south face severe food insecurity. I hope that we shall continue to be the largest European humanitarian donor and continue our assistance through non-governmental organisations, where they are allowed to operate. The work of churches and NGOs has been impressive when we consider the lack of infrastructure and the conditions in which they have to work.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000058"></a>Finally, I declare my interest as the treasurer of the All-Party Group on Sudan. I am pleased to say that we will publish a report early in the new year and have requested evidence from the Government and many other organisations. I trust that that will help to provide greater awareness of the urgent situation in Sudan.</p>

<p><a name="091104107000059"></a><b><a name="91104-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="091104107000124"></a>Baroness Tonge:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the right reverend Prelate on securing this debate on the hugely important topic of the biggest country in Africa. Perhaps it should not be one country, but it is. He pointed out clearly the problems with the elections and, in particular, the census, which has gone so badly and about which there are so many quarrels. That leads me to reflect often concerning Sudan and, indeed, Afghanistan, whether we are right to push our form of democracy on to people that we know little about. Sometimes, we should reflect on that.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000060"></a>My noble friend mentioned the problem of oil revenues, as did many noble Lords. It is interesting to reflect that Global Witness recently produced a report that stated that Khartoum&#146;s official figures on the volume of oil produced do not match official Chinese National Petroleum Corporation figures. Specifically, the volumes reported by Khartoum are smaller than those reported by the Chinese by up to 26 per cent. The one productive oil block located entirely in the north&#151;and therefore not subject to revenue sharing&#151;was the only block where the volumes tallied. That is an interesting snippet.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000061"></a>Sadly, as my noble friend pointed out, in the south, the SPLM Government are not declaring how much they are getting from oil revenues either, although people have made estimates. In my view, as a former shadow international development Minister in the other place, this is key. There is no evidence that much development has taken place in Southern Sudan since the comprehensive peace agreement.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000062"></a>Nine years ago I was in Bahr-el-Ghazal just when the famine was easing during the civil war. The only thing those people had were cartridge cases which were melted down and made into jewellery. I see that the noble Baroness is nodding in agreement. That was all that was left for those people. They had no food, no nothing, but they did have plenty of cartridge cases. Indeed, this necklace was given to me to remember Southern Sudan and not to take it off until there was peace. I have not taken it off yet, and I wonder how many more years I will be wearing it.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000063"></a>Development is key to Sudan. People will be happier, they will not rebel or join rebel groups if they have healthcare and education as well as the basic amenities for living. But we see little of that, despite the oil revenues and the amount of aid being pumped into the country. In those days, the Janjaweed were known as the Murahaleen. They are willing recruits to join in the pillage, burn and rape of the population of Southern Sudan and in Darfur because they have nothing either. Their lands are gone due to climate change. It is getting drier and they have to move south to access more resources for their cattle. I repeat: development is the key here, but even if the oil revenues were used properly and development were to take place, we doubt whether there would be the capacity in Southern Sudan to govern, a point made by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose. What plans do the Government have to increase that capacity so as to ensure that the administration will be a proper one after the election?</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000064"></a>I reiterate, as a vice-chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Sudan, that we are holding a series of hearings to look at the implementation of the CPA and its implications in the run-up to the elections. I hope that many noble Lords will join in and give evidence to those hearings.</p>
<h5><a name="091104107000110"></a>4.42 pm</h5>

<p><a name="091104107000065"></a><b><a name="91104-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="091104107000125"></a>Baroness Rawlings:</b> Like other noble Lords who have spoken I, too, deplore the recent bursts of violence that have brought Sudan back into the news. It is a grim reminder that the underlying problems in that country have never been fully resolved, and that sadly, nor is the trouble confined to Darfur. The bubbling tensions between south Sudan and the Government in the north have a history of decades ridden with strife as their backdrop, and I fear that as the country gears up towards the elections in 2010 followed by the referendum on the possible secession of the south the following year, we may hear yet more unfortunate news from that part of the world. The Question posed by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury is timely and I thank him for asking it today.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000066"></a>The demarcation of the border is likely to continue to be a fraught, difficult exercise and it should not be left until it is too late to have any chance of success. Like other noble Lords, I question how satisfactorily the internal border can be demarcated without the full participation of the Sudanese themselves. One of the biggest stumbling blocks to demarcating the border is continuing disputes, as we have heard, over the rights to the oil reserves. What assessment has the noble Lord made of the recent Global Witness report which argues that the existing rules on the sharing of oil reserves by Khartoum with the south are not being followed?</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000067"></a>We on this side believe that however imperfect the comprehensive peace agreement of 2005, it remains the best way forward for Sudan, and I support the noble Lord, Lord Luce, in what he said about that. Implementing it will involve much hard work and frustration, and we believe that while the situation remains so fragile, the insecurity of the south Sudanese is harming the development of the area. Despite the boost in oil revenues, the infrastructure there is pitiful and, as we have heard, food shortages are exacerbating the plight of the people&#151;this in a country with great agricultural potential.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000068"></a>The United States has refocused its policy towards Sudan to prod the Khartoum Government to make progress on preparing for the elections, for the referendum and for finalising the boundary. There are rewards on offer if the Sudanese Government engage. However, the US has renewed sanctions in order to show that it is serious when it insists that progress must be made. Will the Minister say whether this policy is in accordance with that of Her Majesty&#146;s Government; and has the FCO been working with its US counterparts on the issue?</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000069"></a>Given the increasing economic input of China into the region, what have the Government been doing to co-ordinate their approach with those of other members of the Security Council and of our European Union partners? Noble Lords will be aware that the presence  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC64"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the Lord&#146;s Resistance Army in the south has caused considerable disturbance in recent years, and that in the past two weeks it has reportedly attacked Darfur&#146;s citizens for the first time. Will the Minister update the Committee on the presence of the LRA, which threatens to destabilise this already volatile country?</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000070"></a>We are the second largest bilateral donor to Sudan. What progress can the Minister report on government efforts to seek an agreement with all parties on wealth sharing and citizenship rights ahead of the referendum? With recent developments in a region where&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, said&#151;we have a historic responsibility as a special friend, it is crucial that the Government make it clear what their policy is.</p>
<h5><a name="091104107000111"></a>4.46 pm</h5>

<p><a name="091104107000071"></a><b><a name="91104-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="091104107000126"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this constructive and stimulating debate on a country with great problems. In particular I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury for prompting the discussion. The right reverend Prelate has identified some of the core issues and considerable difficulties that we face in Sudan. Noble Lords analysed all the problems that we recognise and for which we have great difficulty seeing immediate solutions. I also have great difficulty believing that in the eight minutes that remain I will be able to answer all the questions. We are due to finish at 4.55 pm and I did not rise to my feet until a minute ago. However, I will write to all noble Lords.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000072"></a>I agree with the comment made by the noble Lord, Lord Luce, and others, that the comprehensive peace agreement remains the foundation for the future peace and stability that one needs to ensure that any development can take place. As the right reverend Prelate also said in his introductory remarks, we are approaching the end of the interim period in 2011 and face a series of problems that have been identified by noble Lords concerning issues such as the referendum. There is a deep urgency to resolve the impasse that exists between both main parties over the census and election arrangements&#151;we are within six months of the election and 15 months of the referendum.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000073"></a>High-level discussions on these issues are under way between Vice-President Ali Osman Taha and the Vice-President of South Sudan, Riek Machar. The discussions seek to bridge the disagreement over the census results and reach agreement on the election arrangements, which depend on the census for constituency demarcation. Both parties are also debating the content of the referendum Bill in order that it should meet its parliamentary timetable and we can move forward.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000074"></a>We welcome indications in recent weeks that the parties are moving closer to agreement on these issues, and we are supporting efforts to encourage this. My ministerial colleague Gareth Thomas visited Khartoum and Juba on 14-15 October for this purpose and met senior members of the NCP and SPLM. Our ministerial team in DfID and the FCO is closely engaged on the issue, and I welcome the extensive experience of development issues that my noble friend Lady Kinnock is able to bring to Sudan in her new role as Minister for Africa.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC65"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000075"></a>We share noble Lords&#146; concerns about the slow progress of preparations for the elections. There are significant political and technical challenges to be overcome. We are closely engaged to ensure that these issues are addressed by the National Elections Commission. We are also working with partners in Khartoum on a robust mechanism to assess progress towards free and fair elections. We have committed &#163;11 million in support of the elections so far, which is focused on the technical preparation, voter education and conflict management. We also are pressing the European Commission to deploy an EU election observation mission.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000076"></a>Across all the areas that I have mentioned, Her Majesty&#146;s Government are actively engaged with the Government of National Unity and other partners in seeking progress. We are working particularly closely with the United States and its special envoy General Gration, and with Norway, as part of the troika. We are also in close contact with the Assessment and Evaluation Commission, chaired by Sir Derek Plumbly. Finally, we are pressing both parties to address outstanding Abyei milestones, to complete the north-south border demarcation and to give serious consideration to oil revenues and the sharing of them, to which a number of noble Lords referred.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000077"></a>On the insecurity and violence in Southern Sudan, we are deeply concerned by the ongoing tribal fighting and by attacks by the Lord&#146;s Resistance Army. The violence is having a terrible impact on the ordinary lives of the Sudanese, as has been said, which risks undermining the implementation of the CPA. The UK is providing significant support to Southern Sudan to help to address this insecurity, to provide emergency relief and to support broader development issues. I will return to the latter when I deal with noble Lords&#146; questions. A significant focus of our assistance is on helping strengthen the capacity of the Government of Southern Sudan&#151;GoSS&#151;to address the challenges. We are also supporting community-led conflict resolution and arms-control programmes.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000078"></a>At a political level, we have raised the issue of insecurity at very senior levels with GoSS, including with President Salva Kiir. GoSS also have a critical role to play in seeking proactively to prevent the violence and to address root causes by promoting dialogue and reconciliation with the affected communities. The UN mission in Sudan&#151;UNMIS&#151;also has a key role to play in supporting GoSS.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000079"></a>I also highlight the UK&#146;s leading contribution to demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration&#151;DDR&#151;in Sudan. DDR is a key component of the security arrangements of the CPA and critical in the support of stability and recovery across Sudan. The DDR programme was launched in February. So far, it has demobilised more than 12,000 ex-combatants, and we have committed some &#163;20 million between 2009 and 2011 to that cause.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000080"></a>Finally, I draw attention to the value of involving senior figures in the faith communities, which have been highlighted, in addressing the current insecurity. The head of the British embassy office in Juba recently met local Anglican and Catholic archbishops to discuss  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC66"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the insecurity. On this note, I should say how much we welcome our regular dialogue with the diocese of Salisbury, which has strong links to the Episcopal Church of Sudan, as well as to other church groups and many other actively engaged NGOs. I echo the point that in many cases faith groups have the closest contact, see the hardship, and seek to alleviate it on the ground.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000081"></a>I hope that I have been able to outline some of the challenges that we face. Your Lordships have certainly done a tremendous job in filling in the detail, particularly of the elections, the referendum, security in the south, and what we need to do to address these questions. I will try to deal with some of the points that were made in the debate.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000082"></a>The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, asked about our assessment of the insecurity in Southern Sudan. Other noble Lords made the point that more people have died this year in Southern Sudan as a result of tribal fighting in Darfur, and the LRA has forced more than 300,000 people from their homes&#151;more than double the number in 2008. We are urging the Government of Southern Sudan and UNMIS to respond proactively, and are supporting a range of programmes to strengthen law enforcement and community-led security work to promote reconciliation.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000083"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, talked about the Juba compact, which was signed this June and which we welcome. It is an important response to the crisis in Southern Sudan and is now the key to ensuring robust implementation. Donors are taking forward their commitments under the compact, and we are urging GoSS to do the same.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000084"></a>A number of noble Lords referred to arms transfers from the Government of Sudan to groups in the south. We have no hard evidence of this being the case, but there are anecdotal reports of it happening. Until we have evidence suggesting that this is actually happening, we have to continue to press both parts of the divided community in that regard.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000085"></a>Registration for voting started this week. Our embassy in Khartoum and the mission in Juba are monitoring the registration of voters and we have urged the EU to deploy a mission, as I have said. As regards assistance to Southern Sudan for humanitarian purposes, &#163;28 million is being provided for basic research services, helping some 300,000 children. The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, raised the question of our co-operation with the United States review. We are co-operating with that review. It is important that we co-operate simultaneously in Darfur and with the implementation of the CPA.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="091104107000086"></a>I shall answer in writing other questions that were raised, particularly those asked by the noble Baroness at the end of the debate. We have had a stimulating debate. We need to keep this issue in the public arena. Long-term issues are involved. We have a commitment and responsibility to that part of the world. I believe that the Government are doing everything they can and, with the support of your Lordships, will continue to do everything they can, to bring peace and stability to that troubled country.</p>

<p align="center"><i><a name="091104114000035"></a>Tabled By <b><a name="91104-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="091104114000030"></a>Lord Hameed</b></i></p>

<ul><a name="091104114000029"></a>
<p>To ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government what measures they have taken to prevent cerebral palsy.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="091104114000001"></a><b><a name="91104-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="091104114000031"></a>Lord Hameed:</b> My Lords, I hope that this Motion today, which refers specifically to cerebral palsy, will highlight the issues which are directly relevant to prevention of this condition. It is often said by Members in their opening remarks, &#147;This debate is long overdue&#148;, when introducing a topic close to their hearts. However, the paramount issues of health and prevention have been repeatedly raised since the Black report in 1980, the Winterton Select Committee on maternity services in 1990 and the Wanless report in 2002. It is therefore all the more astonishing that constructive action to reduce cerebral palsy's prevalence remains overdue.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000002"></a>Our duty to act has been intensified since the Little Foundation funded a European-wide programme revealing significant results, the outcome of which was that, despite popular perceptions, this condition is preventable. I should at this point declare an interest as president and trustee of the Little Foundation. Although it is widely believed that cerebral palsy results from obstetric complications, the research undertaken by the Little Foundation indicated that infection and poor maternal foetal nutrition before birth significantly increase the risk of damage to the brain's development. There are startling statistics for everyone to see; for example, cerebral palsy costs the National Health Service a staggering &#163;4 billion per year, with 50 per cent of cases associated with low birth weight. This prevalence rises from one or two per 1,000 live births to more than 200 cases of cerebral palsy per 1,000 live births when birth weights are below 1.5 kilograms. The most severely affected may require 24-hour nursing care. Very low birth weights are not only associated with cerebral palsy but also with diffuse brain injury and disordered brain development leading to poor cognitive abilities and learning difficulties in general.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000003"></a>It is astonishing to think that so clear an association, which costs the already over-stretched NHS &#163;4 billion per annum, has not dictated a clear and proactive policy in favour of preventing or reducing further instances of cerebral palsy. This condition varies in its severity with problems including motor disabilities, visual difficulties, hearing problems and trouble with writing, eating, talking and walking. Epilepsy, autism and behavioural pathology are only a few of the many difficult conditions associated with cerebral palsy.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000004"></a>Because of the lifelong impact of cerebral palsy, the financial and social costs are disproportionately high, which should provide a sharp and prompt action. Furthermore, just as we currently have campaigns to prevent obesity in children and to educate the public about the dangers of smoking, there is a clear moral obligation to take serious action in preventing cerebral palsy and allied brain disorders from further escalation.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC68"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000005"></a>However, when we look at how seriously we take the issue of prevention influencing good health in the United Kingdom, the results are disturbing. According to Sir David Cooksey's report to the Treasury on medical research in this country, only 2 per cent of the research budget was spent on prevention. One year later, Dr Jo Nurse of the mental health division at the Department of Health revealed that the cost of brain disorders has now overtaken all other burdens of ill health at &#163;77 billion in 2007. This cost is now greater than the cost of heart disease and cancer combined. That clearly is a major priority for action on what we already know and for research on the means of prevention.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000006"></a>What is the problem and what exactly can provide a solution? The fundamental problem directly relevant to cerebral palsy and allied developmental disorders is quite clearly related to the prevalence of low birth weights in the UK. Britain now has the highest rate of low birth weights in western Europe, with a record close to that of Romania, and twice that of Finland and Samoa.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000007"></a>Contributing factors to this alarming prevalence include a lack of education across the board, including academics and professionals, on the value of nutrition and hygiene, which were removed from the school curriculum in the 1970s. Their value is not emphasised in medical schools, despite its vast importance. In short, leaders in government and industry, and even within the medical profession itself, are largely ignorant of the power of nutrition in accelerating and sustaining a cycle of good health.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000008"></a>I deliberately select the term &#147;cycle&#148; in this context, because the impact of nutrition is circular and multi-generational. Despite numerous reports and recommendations on this topic, we have failed to grasp the nexus of preventing low birth weights and its severe consequences; namely, we have neglected the health of the mother. The mother's health remains pivotal prior to conception, throughout pregnancy and lactation, towards the health of her child.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000009"></a>Further practical solutions to protecting and improving women's health during pregnancy might include incentives through the benefit system to ensure that a nutritious diet is maintained, with the appropriate types and amounts of nutrients. For example, in order to tackle this problem in France, women had to attend antenatal appointments to secure their maternity benefits. Exposure to the advantages of nutrition, channelled through the education system, as I have previously outlined, would provide a double incentive for women to be proactive in ensuring that they are maintaining an appropriate diet and hygiene during pregnancy.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000010"></a>In conclusion, I seek to emphasise how fundamental prevention is when aiming to address serious health concerns within the United Kingdom. I have outlined the impact of cerebral palsy on individuals and on the rest of society in terms of financial and human cost. But cerebral palsy is only the tip of the iceberg. It constitutes only one ripple in the rising tide of mental illness, as a result of the increasing problem of impaired brain development. I focus on cerebral palsy to demonstrate how this condition is one of many that we can and should work harder to prevent, due to its clear medical severity. Finally, to reiterate my earlier

I hope, therefore, that we are moved to enhance this debate in the very near future on a much wider and deeper level.</p>

<p><a name="091104114000011"></a><b><a name="91104-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="091104114000032"></a>Lord Rea:</b> My Lords, in a seven minute slot, it is impossible to do justice to this subject, which is as important now as it ever was. It places a heavy burden on families, the health service and social services, as the noble Lord, Lord Hameed, has just pointed out. The incidence of cerebral palsy&#151;from now on, I shall just use the initials CP to avoid getting tongue-tied and to save time&#151;at just two per thousand births, has not changed very much in recent years, although the prevalence in the population may be increasing, because of better survival rates, especially among premature babies.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000012"></a>I shall mainly consider the topic of prematurity and possible ways of reducing it, as it is strongly related to the risk of developing CP. The figures are striking. For instance, in a recent Australian study of 6,399 babies with very low birth weight&#151;that is, under 1,500 grammes&#151;who were followed up for three years, it was found that the incidence of CP was 77 per thousand births, compared to 2.5 in the population as a whole, a rate 30 times as high. Other studies have had comparable findings.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000013"></a>One possible reason for that is that immature tissues are more likely to be damaged during delivery, with the resultant intracerebral haemorrhage, although that can also occur before delivery. There may be asphyxia&#151;oxygen lack&#151;due to immature lungs. The maintenance of adequate oxygenation is perhaps the most important part of intensive care for premature babies. Low birth weight is strongly associated with CP, but as only about one in eight deliveries result in a baby with low birth weight&#151;that is at the higher 2,500 grammes cut-off point&#151;they contribute only about one half of all cases of CP. The rest occur in children of normal birth weight. Some of those cases are presumably of genetic origin, but the cause of many of them is not fully understood.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000014"></a>In recent decades, there has been great improvement in antenatal and obstetric care, so that birth trauma and asphyxia are now not significant causes of CP. However, there are some possible causative factors that can occur during pregnancy or delivery, which may well be amenable to treatment or prevention. For example, a recent paper by Dr Martin Bax, describing a large European study on cerebral palsy&#151;to give it its full name&#151;showed, rather surprisingly, that infection, especially urinary infection, in pregnant mothers is significantly associated with cerebral palsy. Therefore, it is essential that antenatal care includes detection and treatment of maternal infections. However, one hypothesis is that the infection is not causal but is related to a common factor which reduces a pregnant mother&#146;s resistance to infection and, at the same time, predisposes the foetus to neurological damage.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000015"></a>To return to the association of prematurity and low birth weight with cerebral palsy, there is a social class gradient in the incidence of low birth weight, as there  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC70"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is in almost all measures of ill health. Some of that is due to the class gradient in smoking and alcohol consumption, which both, independently, have an association with low birth weight, but the social class gradient persists even when those factors are taken into account. The incidence of CP is, however, independent of social class according to several studies. That is surprising to me, and I intend to look into that further. More research is needed to determine which aspects of social deprivation are most important and how they affect the foetus.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000016"></a>There is evidence from studies in the East End of London, for example, that inadequate maternal nutrition may play a role. Low birth weight is much more common in the developing world. The worst figures are in the Indian subcontinent where the calorie intake and nutrition of poor women is particularly poor. The basic structure of the brain and cardiovascular system&#151;the heart, the arteries and the veins&#151;is laid down early in the first trimester of pregnancy. The intrauterine environment, including the nutrient supply to the foetus, is very important at that stage. The brain increases in size and complexity most rapidly in the final trimester. A premature infant misses out on this important developmental stage and comes into the world in a vulnerable state. The infant is more likely to suffer damage during delivery and it is at this stage that intracerebral bleeding may occur, often leading to permanent damage if the child survives.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000017"></a>Nervous tissue and blood vessels require good supplies of nutrients to develop normally. The foetus is a very efficient parasite and will rob the mother to obtain what it needs. But if the mother is depleted in important nutrients, the foetus may not obtain enough to develop optimally. Maternal nutrition is thus of great importance in reducing the incidence of premature birth. Omega 3 essential fatty acids are in the public eye at the moment. They are important in foetal development since they form a large part of the structure of brain cell membranes and the lining of arteries. The diet commonly found in deprived communities is often lacking in these essential nutrients. Even when overt cerebral damage does not occur, there is some evidence that brain function may be affected if a mother&#146;s diet is deficient.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000018"></a>Here, I declare an interest as chairman of the All-Party Food and Health Group. Last year, we published a report on an inquiry into the links between diet and mental health. It confirmed the importance of essential fatty acids in pregnancy, early childhood and, in some areas, in adult mental health, but recognised that Omega 3 is not a panacea. We recommended that the Government should fund further urgently needed research into the whole area of diet and brain function. The same should apply to prematurity and cerebral palsy. More basic research is urgently needed to guide measures to reduce the distress of parents and children, and the heavy cost to the health and social services that they cause.</p>

Fortunately, on this occasion, for me, that  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC71"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is not the case. I have to declare an interest: I have been an obstetrician for nearly 39 years. I have particularly looked after women in premature labour and those whose problem was foetal growth retardation.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000020"></a>Cerebral palsy is a major issue. It causes a lot of heartache for those families of children who suffer from it. It covers a whole spectrum, from minimal motor and intellectual deficit to considerable severe intellectual and motor deficit. The cost to the families and the state is enormous, as has been mentioned. Anything that can be done to prevent or reduce the incidence of cerebral palsy would be nothing but beneficial.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000021"></a>There are lots of causes. Anything which tends to produce a low birth weight baby will increase the likelihood of cerebral palsy. That will include multiple births; for example, twins and triplets. Being the father of twins, you can imagine, with my interest in pre-term labour, how concerned I was at the time. Fortunately, they did not have any problems. It also includes a damaged placenta which may interfere with foetal growth; infections, particularly rubella; poor nutrition; exposure to toxic substances, including alcohol and nicotine; maternal diabetes, hyperthyroidism, hypertension and other maternal diseases; biochemical genetic disorders or disorders of metabolism; chance malformation of the developing brain; rhesus incompatibility; enduring intrapartum period; premature labour and delivery; and, in the neo-natal period, jaundice and intrapartum hypoxia. The incidence of cerebral palsy is two per 1,000 births, and 10 per cent of that figure is related to intrapartum hypoxia. As has already been mentioned, 50 to 60 per cent of children with cerebral palsy are born prematurely; the lower the gestational age, the higher the incidence of cerebral palsy.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000022"></a>What this tells us is that any strategy to prevent cerebral palsy has to address all these causes because no single treatment is likely to succeed. That is the case for any medical condition where there are multifactorial causes of the disease. Pre-term labour, for instance, is increasing in this country and is now reported in 8 to 9 per cent of all births. The number of babies being born between 20 and 28 weeks is increasing. Eighty per cent of these children will suffer some form of cerebral palsy compared with around 2 per cent of babies born at term between 37 and 40 weeks. Not just prematurity itself increases the risk, rather it is the way labour is managed and what facilities and trained staff are available for the care of very premature babies that influences the incidence of all complications for extremely pre-term babies, not only that of cerebral palsy. There is also a risk of infection if the membranes are ruptured prematurely. Such infection can cause abnormalities to the blood supply which results in an increase in the incidence of cerebral palsy.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000023"></a>I turn to birth asphyxia. We should set out in guidance for our hospital maternity units that any mother going into labour with a normally formed baby over 32 weeks&#146; gestation should not have a birth that results in asphyxia; it should be an event that never occurs. We have the facilities to diagnosis intrapartum hypoxia. While that will reduce or prevent only a small percentage of children being born with cerebral palsy, nonetheless it would make a significant  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC72"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>contribution. These incidents do arise, unfortunately because the only way of diagnosing birth asphyxia is through the interpretation of foetal heart rate patterns. It is not an easy thing to do and requires a lot of training. The lawyers use this as if it is a case of cause and effect, and litigation mostly relates to children with cerebral palsy whose aetiology is not intrapartum hypoxia, but may be prenatal. However, these cases are based on the association between abnormal foetal heart rate tracings with the subsequent development of cerebral palsy. The issue is not as simple as that because we need to discuss acid-base balance; that is, acid levels in the baby&#146;s blood at birth and so forth. However, I shall not go into that.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="091104114000024"></a>The question of nutrition is difficult. It is easy to cite nutritional factors, but in my view, in the developed world the nutrition even of people whose diet is not healthy is unlikely to be a major cause of large numbers of children being born with cerebral palsy. The figure is not zero and it may be avoided, but nutrition is not likely to make a major contribution because of multifactorial causes. Restriction in growth may occur due to dietary deficiencies, but some factors might cause both cerebral palsy and poor growth, with poor growth being the epiphenomenon, not the causal pathway. Is growth restriction irrespective of aetiology causally linked to cerebral palsy, and the more severe it is, the higher the risk of cerebral palsy? Does intrauterine growth restriction cause conditions such as hypoglycaemia in the baby, which then leads to poor brain development? We have to understand all these phenomena to be able to say that a particular diet or remedying a certain nutritional deficiency will lower the incidence of cerebral palsy. However, it is true that rectifying iodine deficiency, which is not a major cause of nutritional deficiency in this country but is in some other parts of the world, will significantly reduce the incidence of cerebral palsy.</p>

<p><a name="091104114000025"></a>My time is up, but noble Lords can tell that I could go on for quite some time.</p>
<h5><a name="091104119000024"></a>5.20 pm</h5>

<p><a name="091104119000001"></a><b><a name="91104-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="091104119000027"></a>Lord Macdonald of Tradeston:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hameed, for initiating this debate about a condition which causes suffering in so many and for his very informative contribution. In the company of the noble Lords, Lord Rea, Lord Patel and Lord McColl, with all their medical expertise, I speak with some humility. From what we have heard, it is clear that cerebral palsy, in all its forms, is a major healthcare issue in the UK. As we have heard, it afflicts about two in every 1,000 babies. Assuming 600,000 births per year in Britain, that will mean about 1,500 new cases a year. Given a lifespan averaging 70 years, that means around 100,000 people with cerebral palsy in total. That makes it the most common motor disorder, one often accompanied by epilepsy, learning and behavioural difficulties and dystonia, each bringing additional problems in need of solutions.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000002"></a>I am told that it is not easy to predict which babies will develop cerebral palsy. As the noble Lord, Lord Rea, has said, we know that it is much more common in premature babies and that more babies are surviving evermore premature births because of medical advances. However, about half of all cases are not evident at  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC73"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>birth and are detected only in the first year of life, often without a maternal or perinatal disorder being evident. Clearly, that makes the detection and prevention of these cases very difficult. We know that perhaps up to 10 per cent of cases follow a conspicuous episode of birth asphyxia. Another 10 per cent may have suffered a stroke in utero and a similar proportion might be due to genetic causes. We should note that in up to 20 per cent of cerebral palsy cases, no structural brain damage can be detected even with the best available imaging equipment. We have been told that the last trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time for the foetal brain.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000003"></a>A dilemma for doctors must be that the damage found in the first year following normal term deliveries is often very similar to the brain damage in premature babies; namely, what appears to be a wasting away of the cabling linking neurons within the brain which is found in some 40 per cent of cases of cerebral palsy. Therefore, I suggest that research should try to find common factors at work. The priority might be to concentrate on that 40 per cent category, which shows the wasting away of cabling in the white brain matter linking neurons. I am told that that damage pattern is known as periventricular leucomalacia or PVL.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000004"></a>Many factors may contribute to this early brain damage known as PVL&#151;some genetic and some environmental. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, gave us a very strong sense of the complexity of it all. Clearly, a major concern is maternal infection or inflammation of placental structures. However, it can be very difficult for doctors to identify those pregnancies at risk, except by watching very closely for clinical symptoms or previous complications in pregnancy. Indeed, it can be very difficult to find guiding patterns among the complexity.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000005"></a>Does the Minister agree with those consultants who believe that more comprehensive national registers and databases linking maternal and child health records are a necessary basis for future research strategies? At present, the collection of data on cerebral palsy is said to be ad hoc and patchy. Might there not be some kind of legal requirement to collect such data? Good data on foetal and neonatal brain damage and neurological dysfunction is seen by some specialists in this area as essential for progress, alongside appropriate epidemiological clinical and scientific input, to identify national strategies and interventions, including new imaging methods.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000006"></a>I declare an interest in the prevention of cerebral palsy as patron of the Dystonia Society. Dystonia is a general term used to describe a range of movement disorders that cause involuntary muscle spasm and contraction. A recent study indicates that dystonia is present in up to 20 per cent of all types of cerebral palsy. On the basis of my earlier calculation, that means 300 new cases of dystonia per year, and a UK total of about 20,000 cases related just to cerebral palsy.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000007"></a>Many young people with cerebral palsy and dystonia are treated in the excellent Evelina Children&#146;s Hospital, just across the river from your Lordships&#146; House in   


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>St Thomas&#146;s Hospital. I have leaned extensively tonight on the specialist knowledge of the Evelina&#146;s consultant paediatric neurologist, Dr Jean-Pierre Lin. I hope that he will forgive any errors in translation. Dr Lin believes that dystonia in cerebral palsy cases is of particular concern as it can result in continuous muscular spasms and twisting that are both painful and disabling. The child with dystonic cerebral palsy can be helped by medication such as botulinum toxin injections to relax muscles and, as appropriate, intrathecal baclofen pumps injecting another muscle relaxant into the spinal canal. Specialists are also encouraged by the results of deep brain stimulation in specific circumstances, although the treatment is relatively recent. The specialists also believe that care for these children is best delivered through multidisciplinary teams within approved frameworks, working in close liaison with children and their families.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000008"></a>In order to support children with cerebral palsy and their families, the Government should prioritise more training and education of healthcare professionals on cerebral palsy and dystonia; better co-operation between health, education and social services in the interests of the children; nationwide resources for data collection and the development of national protocols and studies; and greater support for organisations such as Scope, HemiHelp and the Dystonia Society to develop strategies within communities to help children with cerebral palsy and dystonia. I trust that these groups, with the health professionals and medical researchers, can count on enhanced support from government in working towards the ultimate goal of preventing cerebral palsy blighting so many young lives.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000010"></a>I start by paying tribute to organisations such as Scope, the Dystonia Society and the numerous local charities that do so much to support parents and children, raise awareness of the issues throughout society and provide the practical help and support that is needed. What strikes me about my two friends is that their children were born 17 years apart and yet have had very similar experiences. This demonstrates that, while we have invested a huge amount in research, we have not kept our response up to date in terms of what happens after birth. That is what I will focus on.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000011"></a>It is strange that, despite the consensus that early diagnosis is extremely helpful, too often it does not happen unless there has been a crisis at birth. Often one hears from parents that they sense that something is not right about their child, but cannot get the health professionals to take them seriously. Having listened to the debate this evening, it seems that if we could understand more about the causes&#151;the poor nutrition

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000012"></a>A friend of mine has a toddler with CP. He was diagnosed fairly early because his parents were articulate people who knew their way around the system and would not take no for an answer. When they eventually received the diagnosis, they were told that there would be a seven-month waiting list for physiotherapy and then their son would receive one hour a week. They have done what other parents have done and have turned to the Peto Institute in Hungary for help for their son.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000013"></a>I recognise that there is controversy about the methods of the Peto Institute, and that the jury is still out. Nevertheless, for many people, that has provided the only hope, because the Peto Institute offers an essentially optimistic way forward for parents and children who are suffering very badly from low morale and a sense of hopelessness. The work that the institute does through its conductive education programme, working to improve social, emotional, cognitive and communicative skills, as well as motor problems, is enormously powerful for the parents and the young people. I am told by parents that the conventional approach that they receive in this country fails to educate them about how much they can do, even about simple things, such as massage.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000014"></a>Few parents have access to conductive education. When they do, they often find that it comes to an end when the child reaches school age. Then, the child usually regresses. That is very demoralising for the child and for the parents. That points to, to use the clich&#233;, a lack of joined-up thinking between the healthcare professionals, the social care professionals and education professionals, many of whom do not really understand that a child with CP will often have multiple problems. They often find that the specific programmes aimed at people with learning difficulties assume that the child has no other impairments, while the programmes aimed at people with physical problems often ignore the fact that they may also have learning difficulties. There are some harrowing stories about the failure of health services to understand the special needs of some individuals. Scope gave evidence to the Human Rights Committee in another place and talked about how a student from one of its residential schools was unfed in hospital for three days because no one knew how to do it.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000015"></a>Although it is clear that the reduction of cerebral palsy is the ultimate aim, the fact is that over the years, we have not been able to achieve that. Therefore, I hope that the Government will continue to invest as much as is needed to make the lives of those children who have it better.</p>

Secondly, there is neonatal jaundice. Kernicterus is a condition of very severe jaundice which is largely preventable. Thirdly, there is premature birth, which has been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hameed, and others. Fourthly, hemiplegic CP and tetraplegic CP have multiple causes.</p>

<p><a name="091104119000018"></a>A key part of primary prevention is, therefore, high-quality paediatric neurological services. Currently, those are underprovided, especially at district level. The additional impairments should include psychiatric and behavioural impairments, which are very common in early-onset brain impairments, especially when there is cognitive impairment. These include ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, confrontational behaviour and depression. There are currently major problems in providing psychiatric and behavioural diagnosis and care for children with early brain damage. This is a major problem in childhood disability and epilepsy spheres, and a lot is being done to try to remedy this.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000019"></a>As has been mentioned, one primary-prevention priority might be adequate pre-pregnancy care, including persuading mothers to desist from alcohol and smoking, to attend antenatal care, to take regular exercise, to have a healthy diet, and to ensure that their vaccinations are up to date. Ten per cent of CP is genetic, so families need to be investigated carefully, especially those who have had one affected child, and given genetic counselling. I am not clear that vulnerable potential parents are being identified and supported. Pregnancy decisions asked of young people might be better rehearsed when they are in their early teens at school. They are interested in themselves as parents at that time, but have time to consider the major issues that may arise in the future.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000020"></a>Others develop more severe problems. In addition to alcohol and smoking, they take addictive drugs and are at risk of infection, including HIV. They take up crime and in effect drop out. There is a great deal of evidence that the failure to identify and manage childhood cognitive and behavioural problems, especially ADHD, underlies many of these troubles. They are in turn a potent associate of early unplanned and high-risk pregnancy. Pre-term birth is a major preventable cause of cerebral palsy in rich countries, as has been mentioned, and despite better management the survival of more immature babies tends to balance these improvements. Although high standards of antenatal care contribute to prevention, a major issue remains that requires research and funding.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000021"></a>Secondary prevention is of great importance, especially in preventing contractures and maximising the potential of children with established impairments. This involves the community-based child development centres, which should provide ongoing medical and therapeutic input. In the case of CP, there is also a need for specialist referral centres, usually at tertiary paediatric neurological

These services have severe problems and lack appropriately trained therapists.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000022"></a>Community-based services often concentrate on those under five, so the provision for school-age children is often rather patchy, and access to specialist medical services is very difficult. The solution is to set standards for these services. There have been a number of contributions in this direction, but there are no NICE guidelines except on highly specialised interventions. Will Her Majesty&#146;s Government alert NICE to this omission? These disorders are complex and multifaceted and show many individual changes that are characteristic of developing children. The medicine is thus very complex, and it is essential that able professionals are attracted to the subject. Long-term complex disorders require the integration of health, education and social services, for which there are no clear guidelines. Charities and NGOs have traditionally provided many of the services for childhood disability, but there is an unwillingness to engage in long-term contracts with them. This is quite an omission.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="091104119000023"></a>As has been mentioned, perinatal brain damage has markedly reduced in rich countries but is still a very serious problem in resource-poor areas of the world. A lot needs to be done in this area. Could we suggest that Her Majesty&#146;s Government consider setting up a five-year research project&#151;with obstetrics, paediatric neurology, neonatology and the legal profession as partners&#151;to investigate the science underlying claims for compensation? It could investigate the evidence for perinatal damage and build up a body of case law. The five-year introduction of such a service would cost no more than one legal settlement. I would be grateful for the noble Baroness&#146;s reaction.</p>

<p><a name="091104124000001"></a><b><a name="91104-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="091104124000016"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I congratulate and thank the noble Lord, Lord Hameed, for picking up this debate from the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay. I knew that I might find myself, at least with the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, as the least qualified person in the debate, and indeed that has proved to be the case. However, I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss what the Government are doing to reduce the incidence of this disabling neurological condition which affects approximately two per 1,000 live born children. As has been mentioned, it is the largest cause of childhood physical disability in the developed world.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000002"></a>Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders of movement and/or posture and motor function that are permanent. This is due to a non-progressive abnormality of the developing brain. There are several types of cerebral palsy. While some people are severely affected, others have only minor impairment, and that depends on the part of brain that has been damaged. I am not going to go into the detail of the different types of disorder because other noble Lords have done so more adequately than I could, including my noble friend Lord Macdonald. However, many children and young people have combinations of the different sorts of palsy, and may have epilepsy and visual impairment as well.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000003"></a>Before relating what we are doing towards trying to reduce the incidence and effects of cerebral palsy, perhaps I could also touch on the causes, although I have to say that the noble Lord, Lord Patel, has, as they say, written the book on this and gave us a brief masterclass. It is worth pointing out, however, that many people still think of cerebral palsy as primarily a condition caused by problems resulting in a lack of oxygen during labour and birth. These account for 10 per cent of cases, a proportion of which are definitely avoidable. Another 10 per cent are due to postnatal factors, but the 80 per cent majority have pre-pregnancy and antenatal causes. Children born prematurely with low birth weight or as one of a multiple birth have an increased risk of cerebral palsy. The condition may be due to congenital malformations of the brain and may be associated with genetic defects.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000004"></a>It would be wrong to consider action to reduce the incidence of cerebral palsy in isolation since it is one of the outcomes of maternity care. Action must aim to improve all outcomes. Causes of cerebral palsy during pregnancy can include infections caught by the mother such as German measles or pelvic inflammatory disease, by abnormally low or high blood pressure, or trauma to the unborn baby&#146;s head. Better research is required to understand the causes, which is why the Government have funded the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit to produce high quality research relevant to maternal and neonatal care. Since 1999, the Collaborative Network of Cerebral Palsy Databases, Registers and Surveys in the UK has monitored the prevalence of cerebral palsy, vision loss and hearing loss in children. In relation to the potential to reduce the incidence of damage to a baby occurring during labour, a major new government-funded study called INFANT is about to start. It is a multi-centre randomised control trial to compare the effect of an intelligent system to support decision-making in the management of labour using the cardiotocogram. The study has received funding of almost &#163;6 million and is due to report in mid-2015. In response to the noble Lord, Lord McColl, we take very seriously the need both to count and carry out research. The Government have also funded a study called TOBY, and emerging evidence from this suggests there is a decrease in the risk of cerebral palsy diagnosed by 18 months in the at-risk children who received cooling treatment following birth.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000005"></a>We continue to expand our knowledge of the causes of this condition. In the mean time, we are taking action to reduce the incidence of prematurity and babies that are small for gestational age. That means that women need to be in the best possible health before conceiving. The Government have undertaken a range of public health initiatives towards improving maternal health, such as reducing smoking in pregnancy, the sexual health strategy, reducing obesity and diabetes and improving nutrition; for example Change4Life, the Sure Start maternity grant, Healthy Start vouchers and the health in pregnancy grant. That is prevention work. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hameed, that this Government have understood the need for prevention work and its importance. At the risk of making a political point&#151;I do not make this to the noble Lord&#151;it was a Conservative Government which removed the nutritional guidelines for school meals, which we have  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC79"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>now replaced. The point is that we absolutely accept the need for prevention. Only in the past year, we have introduced legislation to link maternity grant to the advice that women expecting babies should receive about their diet and health during pregnancy. That grant is not available and is not given unless that advice has been given to the mother.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000006"></a>It is important to improve our maternity services so that women have easy access to supportive, high quality maternity services designed around their individual needs and those of their babies. Identifying and managing risks early in pregnancy provides the best chance to reduce premature births and low birth weights. The national service framework for children, young people and maternity establishes clear standards for promoting health and well-being. To support clinicians, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#151;NICE&#151;provides a comprehensive suite of evidence-based clinical guidelines designed to improve outcomes for mothers and babies.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000007"></a>As I said earlier, cerebral palsy is more common in multiple pregnancies. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has developed a national programme to transfer one embryo at a time so that more births are singletons and the risk of cerebral palsy is reduced.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000008"></a>Uncommon, but potentially catastrophic causes of cerebral palsy are prevented by the administration of vitamin K to reduce the risk of intracerebral bleeding in the newborn baby. Appropriate management of jaundice in the newborn also prevents cerebral palsy.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000009"></a>There is no doubt that improved neonatal care of premature babies has improved outcomes and one factor contributing to the reduction of cerebral palsy is the increased use of steroids given to women in threatened premature labour which significantly reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. Just today, my honourable friend has launched a toolkit for a high quality neonatal service, which has just been published, providing principles for the commissioning and provision of high quality neonatal care. I know I am not allowed to use visual aids but I am very happy to share this with any noble Lord who might want to see it afterwards.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000010"></a>By funding the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries&#151;formerly Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health&#151;progress can be audited and recommendations made to inform change and improve outcomes. That echoes the point made by the noble Lord, Lord McColl.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000011"></a>My noble friend Lord Macdonald referred to dystonia and medication. I want to put on the record that NICE has been commissioned to produce guidance on the management of spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. That will include medicines effective in dystonia. My noble friend and other noble Lords raised the issue of training for healthcare professionals. The training curriculum for paediatricians includes immediate resuscitation of the newborn to deliver adequate circulation of blood and hence oxygen, to the brain&#151;measures to maintain adequate circulation.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000012"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, mentioned the Peto Institute, which is renowned and provides many parents with additional support, advice and education.

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000013"></a>It is worth saying that while we know some services are patchy, this Government have made unprecedented investment in a range of services for disabled children. Most recently, we have given &#163;340 million funding to the NHS through PCTs for services aimed at disabled children. It is supported by a new indicator on parents&#146; experiences of services for their disabled children. We are not just giving money; we are also asking the questions as part of our Vital Signs report. We have asked PCTs to provide us with specific statements on their progress in relation to wheelchairs, palliative care, short breaks and community equipment. That information will be used to inform where we should go next.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="091104124000014"></a>In conclusion, we believe that maternity services are the touchstone on whether we are delivering quality care based on safety, effectiveness and patient experience. Our overwhelming objective is to improve outcomes, including reducing the incidence of cerebral palsy. This means continually seeking the right kind of research over the right kinds of periods and improving the quality of care for women, babies and their families.</p>

<p>To ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government what progress has been made towards implementing the aims of the Vision 2020 initiative to prevent avoidable blindness and support those in developing countries who are unavoidably blind.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="091104141000005"></a><b><a name="91104-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="091104141000106"></a>Lord Crisp:</b> My Lords, it is a privilege and a pleasure to introduce this debate. In asking for it, the aim was to raise the profile and to argue that blindness and eye health should be much more mainstream in international development. It is reasonable to say that we have already got a degree of success in raising the profile by the large number of noble Lords who have decided to speak, to whom I am very grateful. I am very much looking forward to hearing the contributions from so many Peers, including their experience and their concerns. I know that we will be hearing about this in the context of India and Africa. I am only sorry that there is such a short allocation of time.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000006"></a>My task is setting the scene. I will be brief and will ensure that I do not go beyond my more generous time allocation. First, I declare an interest: I am proud to be chair of Sightsavers International, which for almost 60 years has promoted and provided programmes and services to prevent and treat blindness, and to support blind and partially sighted people in partnership with local organisations in 33 countries. Sightsavers International is a founding member of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, which brings together the world's leading eye organisations to deliver Vision 2020: the Right to Sight as a joint programme with the  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC81"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>WHO. We are tied in with the IAPB and the WHO. In declaring that interest, perhaps I may also say that Sightsavers International and the IAPB enjoy generous support from the Standard Chartered Bank through its Seeing is Believing campaign, which was launched in 2003, and whose previous chief executive, now the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Abersoch, has been such a personal and prominent supporter. Additionally, Merck, the drug company, has provided large quantities of the drug, Mectizan, to help control river blindness.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000007"></a>My point is not just to declare an interest and record appreciation, but to say that there is an enormous unity of purpose among eye organisations, excellent corporate support and good support from the World Health Organisation. I would like to see the Government give eye health an even more prominent place in their thinking and give it more support. I should say to the Minister that I understand that the Government have not ignored eye health and that &#163;50 million has been allocated for neglected tropical diseases, which includes, for example, onchocerciasis, for which allocations will be made. I am disappointed that it does not also include trachoma, a neglected disease which particularly in many cases affects women.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000008"></a>Let me be clear about what I am asking about progress and Vision 2020. Vision 2020 was launched in 1999 with two aims; first, to eliminate avoidable blindness by 2020 and, secondly, to prevent the projected doubling of avoidable visual impairment by 2020. So there are two very clear aims. This is a big problem but we can deal with it.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000009"></a>I want to describe the problem and make it clear that action can be taken. I shall give a few figures to illustrate why we should act and give this issue greater prominence. Three hundred and fourteen million people live with severe visual impairment, of whom 45 million are blind. Those are very big numbers. Seventy-five per cent of that blindness is treatable or preventable. Most of it comes from cataracts, trachoma and river blindness, all of which are perfectly treatable or preventable. I know that some noble Lords will speak about these diseases and what can be done. My third, and sad, statistic is that 90 per cent of blindness occurs in poorer countries. That statistic speaks for itself. Less well known&#151;I apologise to noble Lords for producing all these statistics&#151;is that this is also a gender issue. The best estimate suggests that two-thirds of blind people in poorer countries are women. The reason for that is twofold. First, they are more likely to be affected by conditions such as trachoma because they look after the children, deal with the dirty water and are exposed to infection. Secondly, in most cases they are, sadly, less likely to get help, so they are hit two ways. As I say, the best estimates suggest that, consequently, twice as many women in poor countries are blind than men.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000010"></a>This is not just about blindness as if blindness were a simple and single thing; it also affects people&#146;s life chances. We need to ensure that we do not see it just in terms of health. According to research from the International Centre for Eye Health, a blind person who gets their cataracts dealt with returns to something like their previous economic status within a year once their blindness is treated. In other words, they are able  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC82"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to resume some kind of economic activity, or at the very least their carer can resume that activity. This is about the economy and employment. It is also about education. A third of the world&#146;s children not attending primary school are disabled, although not necessarily blind. I know that progress is being made&#151;this is all doable&#151;and I shall be interested to hear what the Government say. When I say that it is astonishingly cheap to tackle this problem, what I mean is that doing so represents astonishing value for money. It is feasible to talk about eliminating trachoma over the timescales that we are talking about. The organisation that I work with, Sightsavers, works with BRAC in Bangladesh and we are looking at how we can eliminate the backlog of cataracts in one of the major provinces. Enormous things can be achieved.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000011"></a>I said at the outset that I wanted to gain greater prominence for this issue within the Government and more widely, and to &#147;mainstream&#148; it, as eye health is too often left out of the thinking. I talked recently in Mali to an American involved in international development who thought it was strange that eye doctors were being trained there when the country had other pressing needs. He ignored the fact that eye health affects so many people in a community. I fear that that sentiment is relatively common. Eye health should be seen as key to the millennium development goals, including education, women's rights and employment. I want to make three suggestions to the Government and I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000012"></a>First, there is, rightly, renewed emphasis on primary care. A great deal of eye health disease can be dealt with very easily in primary care; for example, the more minor conditions, not necessarily cataracts or trachoma but diseases arising from poor hygiene, living in dusty and desert conditions and sometimes from using traditional remedies. These are too often missed out. We want to see eye health emphasised as part of primary care, so that when you are pushing forward your policies on primary care, eye health is a central part.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91104-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000013"></a>Secondly, there is a growing emphasis on human resources and training more health workers in Africa. It is equally important that eye health is part of this, not separate. Training is needed from the most local level of community worker to deal with the most local issues to the specialist. There are a lot of innovative models of mid-level workers in eye care. Thirdly, greater prominence should be given to disability in DfID programmes. Education, employment and rehabilitation need to be addressed to achieve all the millennium development goals. Disability is implicated in, if it is not the cause of, at least 20 per cent of world poverty. These are the three big issues for mainstreaming: ensuring that primary care policies relate to eye health; ensuring that human resources policies relate to eye health; and giving disability greater priority.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000014"></a>Finally, I ask that DfID looks again at its whole support for eye health and Vision 2020. A good start might be a meeting with the Minister and the IAPB&#151;I do not think that this has happened yet but, if it has, it has not happened recently&#151;to demonstrate how seriously committed the Government are to this and to mainstreaming.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000015"></a>Let me end on hope. This is a big problem, but there are solutions. Most of these conditions are treatable or preventable, and treatment can have quite a quick impact. There is a great deal of interest in this, as shown by those noble Lords who are speaking in this debate, as well as support from the corporate sector in the form of the Standard Chartered Bank and from the WHO. Eye health organisations are also well organised, and we want even clearer government policy working alongside us.</p>

<p><a name="091104141000016"></a><b><a name="91104-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="091104141000107"></a>Lord Low of Dalston:</b> My Lords, in my maiden speech in this House, I described blindness as one of the severest disabilities and suggested that, considering the critical role that sight plays in enabling us to interact with our environment, couching everything in terms of disability is unhelpful because it obscures the central importance of sight. There is now a pressing need for blindness to be placed higher up the political and social agenda. It therefore gives me great pleasure to be the first to congratulate my noble friend Lord Crisp on bringing these matters to wider attention today and on having secured this opportunity to set out his stall in an already overcrowded marketplace. I am sure all noble Lords will agree that it was an impressive presentation. I am only sorry that I missed his first few sentences in the commotion of the albeit seamless changeover from the previous debate.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000017"></a>In my maiden speech I talked about the domestic agenda, but the problems in the developing world, although not exactly the same, are if anything even more pressing. I therefore join others in paying tribute to organisations, such as Sightsavers International, the Christoffel Blindenmission and the IAPB, which are attempting to tackle them. At a time when it is difficult to find anyone with a good word to say about bankers, it is good to learn that the Standard Chartered Bank is putting so much of its considerable weight behind such endeavours. As my own organisations, the RNIB and Skill, are less active internationally, I do not have quite so much of an interest to declare this afternoon.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000018"></a>It is also very gratifying, as my noble friend has said, to see such an impressive turnout for this short debate. When such an impressive list of speakers is so obviously seized of the issues, it is clear that the message is getting through. I am sure that the Government have got the message; I just hope that the debate will reassure them that they have the support that they need to give this priority, and that it will give them some pointers on how this can be done most effectively.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000019"></a>After the formalities, which are important, it is not possible to say very much of substance in four minutes. I want to make just two points within an overarching framework of rights. Although blindness cannot be prevented, it behoves us to have particular concern for the rights of those who are left to grapple with it. Two of the most important of these are the right to education and to information in a form in which people with little or no sight can access it.</p>

In 1990, the Education for All programme was launched by the United Nations, with the goal of universal access to education by 2015. EFA has made significant progress in reaching non-disabled children, but I fear that it has in large measure failed to include children with disabilities, particularly those who require alternative modes of communication.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000021"></a>The funding for EFA comes largely from developed countries, so those countries should be asking why children with disabilities are still not being reached effectively by EFA and should be insisting that Governments which receive EFA funding should serve all children, including those with visual impairment. EFA-VI is an initiative led by the International Council for Education of People with Visual Impairment and the World Blind Union&#151;I am a board member of both. They assist developing countries with technical advice and support to ensure that their EFA national plans include provision for children with visual impairment. Any support which the Government can give to this initiative will represent a very good investment of effort.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000022"></a>On access to information, efforts are under way through the World Intellectual Property Organisation to agree a treaty which will dismantle copyright barriers to the free flow of information in forms made accessible to the visually impaired. More than 100 countries have expressed support for such a treaty but some of the big players, like the United States and the EU, are digging their heels in. Any assistance which the Government can give to promote a more positive approach would be very welcome, and I shall be happy to give the Minister a full briefing if he would find that helpful.</p>

I also put on record the great work that his charity, Sightsavers, does. I am pleased to say that a charity of which I am a trustee is pleased to support it year on year. I agree with all that has been said about the burden of blindness and the loss of visual acuity in the developing world. I have seen it at first hand most recently in Cameroon, where 50 per cent of the villagers were blind from black flies attacking their sight.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000024"></a>However, in the few minutes available to me, I would like to speak about the issues we face in our country. One relates to retinopathy of prematurity. In the previous debate we discussed the incidence of cerebral palsy in babies born prematurely&#151;10 per cent of births are premature. Retinopathy of prematurity is emerging as an important cause of visual loss and sometimes blindness. Retinopathy of prematurity is one of the few causes of childhood visual disability, which is largely preventable. Many extremely pre-term babies will develop some degree of retinopathy. Although, in the majority, that will never progress beyond mild disease, in some it will become serious and occasionally cause blindness. In the previous debate, the Minister said that the Government have just launched a strategy for neonatal care and I hope that it includes screening of all births in the United Kingdom of less than 32 weeks, checking for retinopathy of prematurity. That would certainly reduce the incidence of visual impairment in those children.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000025"></a>Next, I want to focus on diabetic retinopathy. We know that the incidence of obesity and, therefore, diabetes is rising; 30 per cent of our population now has a BMI&#151;unfortunately, including me probably&#151;greater than 30. The incidence of diabetic retinopathy is 5 per cent; 2 per cent of people with diabetes develop blindness after 15 years and 10 per cent develop severe blindness, apart from other things such as hypertension. Diabetic retinopathy is a well recognised complication of diabetes mellitus. Well conducted clinical trials have shown that good control of diabetes and hypertension significantly reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy. Good services, which provide not only better glucose control for diabetics but rigorous screening for diabetic retinopathy and early detection of it, will reduce significantly the burden of eye problems.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000026"></a>I turn to age-related macular degeneration. As the name implies, it is a common cause of reduced vision in the United Kingdom and it occurs in 30 per cent of people over the age of 60. Probably some of us here today suffer from the condition. Unfortunately, there is no immediate treatment or cure. We require greater research and identification at an earlier stage of development of the disease, because it has been shown that early detection will reduce further deterioration if treatment can be started earlier.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000090"></a>I am pleased to say that recently the first phase of a four-year clinical trial of the use of embryonic stem cells has been launched by MRC and the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine. The trial shows great promise. I have addressed three issues and finish by echoing what the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, said.</p>

It is not often mentioned in Parliament. I still remember the relief felt by aid agencies when onchocerciasis in Africa was all but conquered. Surgery and medicine have made many advances, and there have been victories along the way; but the combination of disability and poverty described by the Indian novelist Rohinton Mistry is almost unimaginable for us.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000028"></a>I am most grateful to Vision 2020 for its briefing, which helped me to see the facts more clearly. For example, as much 75 per cent of blindness is avoidable. I had not realised that cataracts are by far the most common cause of blindness. I knew that successful operations take place daily to tackle the 15 million or so cases worldwide every year. In the poorest countries, the operations do wonders for the beneficiaries. A survey in Madurai, for example, found that 85 per cent of males and 58 per cent of females who had lost their jobs as a result of blindness got them back again.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000029"></a>The underlying case of blindness is poverty. It is estimated that children born in the world&#146;s poorest regions are four times more likely to suffer from blindness than those born in higher-income countries. Conditions associated with childhood blindness, such as measles, rubella and vitamin A deficiency, are also causes of child mortality, and they are preventable. It is a sad

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000030"></a>Many charities are combating blindness, and some smaller ones achieve huge results. The Fred Hollows Foundation has reached thousands in Nepal. One agency for which I have great respect is Sightsavers. I will give an example of its work last year in India. Its local partners treated more than 1.9 million people for sight-related problems. They performed 115,000 cataract operations and provided rehabilitation training for more than 3,000 people with irreversible blindness or low vision.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000031"></a>Rehabilitation is an essential part of the agency&#146;s work. One agency related to them, Jana Jagarana in Orissa, tells of a boy called Ravi Nayak who asked his carer, &#147;Aren&#146;t you going to be helping me any more?&#148; She was in difficulty, but replied firmly, &#147;Since you are capable of doing things on your own, I should spend more time with those who need me&#148;. She gradually reduced her visits to him, but the agency has since helped Ravi with capital to start a cycle repair shop, and offered to send him for vocational training. He is apparently now happy and planning his future.</p>

<p><a name="091104141000032"></a>I end with a short song from a Vietnamese girl in Saigon known to Save the Children whose mother was poisoned by Agent Orange. I will never forget her story, which I have no time to recount now. She sang:</p>

We are all grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, for securing a debate in this crucial area. Vision 2020 has been a shining example of how partnerships&#151;and in particular public-private partnerships&#151;can be so effective. There is no better example of this, as noble Lords mentioned, than the Seeing is Believing campaign launched by Standard Chartered Bank in 2003. What a difference it is making.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000034"></a>We are also fortunate that we have with us my noble friend Lord Low, who is such a tremendous inspiration to us all in the amazing work that he has carried out with the RNIB, which he led for so many years. I have personally seen the power of public-private partnerships in founding the UK India Business Council, which is supported by UK Trade and Investment&#151;the Government working together with business in promoting the UK-India relationship.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000035"></a>India, which was mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, has the highest population of visually impaired people in the world by far. One-third of the world's blind people live in India. A study performed by the Prasard Eye Institute in my birthplace of Hyderabad at the turn of the millennium calculated the direct and indirect economic loss due to blindness in India at $4.5 billion per year. To put that figure in perspective, in the year of the study, it would have cost a tiny fraction of that to treat all the cataract cases in India.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC87"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000036"></a>I have seen in India institutions such as the Happy Home and School for the Blind in Mumbai, run by the inspirational Meher Banaji, and the amazing, positive impact that they have. Childhood blindness accounts for 28 per cent of the lifetime economic loss. Those children are robbed of a start in life, their disability hindering their primary education and with family members coming to stay at home as caretakers, poverty becomes a real prospect. An investment in developing nations and in their children is an investment in the future, and the future of the children.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000037"></a>The problem of disability, and, more specifically, blindness, not only causes hardship at the level of the individual but has a domino effect. The scope of that knock-on effect is hard to grasp. As the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, said, 90 per cent of those living with blindness live in low-income countries. We can see how real the effects are. It is not only the blind who feel the desperate grip of hardship, but the families of the blind and the communities in which those families live.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000038"></a>Access to healthcare is a human right and there is no question that under that principle, every possible action should be taken to ensure that those living with impaired sight are given the treatment that they need. If that is not incentive enough, the global economic burden of blindness is shocking. The global impact due to low vision and lost productivity was estimated at $42 billion in 2000. In the UK, once you reach the age of 40, an annual glaucoma test is provided free, funded by the Government. Just imagine how many unnecessary cases of impaired sight could be avoided if that were available in developing countries throughout the world.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000039"></a>In our work at the UK India Business Council, we have realised, with British companies working in India, that corporate social responsibility is not a nice thing to do, it is a must. I believe that, through the power of government, and governments working together with the private sector and NGOs, we can eliminate unnecessary blindness forever throughout the world. I urge the Minister and the Government to do everything that they can to make that a reality.</p>

I intended to quote something that he stated in another report. At the risk of repetition, he said that there is a huge shortage of health workers globally and what is needed is a powerful and co-ordinated international response to address that shortage, with the developed countries, including the UK, supporting the scaling-up of training, education and employment of health workers.</p>

This was a most welcome development and, combined with increased support for health from other donors, has produced some excellent results and is an indication of what can be achieved when such an investment is made. It showed

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000042"></a>As I have said, the relatively small expenditure of $99 million over six years on this initiative has made a huge difference and provided such an excellent return on the investment that I would suggest to the Minister that consideration should be given to reordering the priorities of DfID&#146;s aid budget so as to ensure that a greater proportion is allocated towards eye care services. We should bear in mind that this concerns about 300 million individuals in the developing world and the fact that with the increase in population and life expectancy, this problem could well get worse rather than better, despite all the progress that has been made.</p>

The key point that struck me in my noble friend&#146;s opening remarks was that 80 per cent of the world&#146;s blindness is avoidable and can either be treated or prevented by known, cost-effective means. Some progress has been made, of course, but nothing like enough, and there is a real risk that without major and effective intervention, the number of avoidably blind people worldwide will increase rather than decrease as we approach 2020. That is why the Vision 2020 programme is so important.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000044"></a>I want to stress three or four points which put the issue of blindness into a broader context than just its treatment. First, avoidable blindness is best eliminated when eye health programmes are embedded in health systems and underpinned by effective government policy. Efforts to tackle blindness and visual impairment must be made within an approach that supports and strengthens national health systems. It is particularly important, as my noble friend Lord Crisp said, that that should be done at the primary healthcare level because it provides the best means of reaching the greatest number of people.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000045"></a>My second point was also made by my noble friend Lord Joffe: the importance of adequately trained eye care personnel and the lack of those staff, which is a sub-sector of the broader issue of the chronic lack of effective health workers in developing countries. My noble friend Lord Crisp has done a terrific amount himself on that, on which I congratulate him, but it is a crucial element in treating blindness.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000046"></a>Thirdly, disabled people, including blind people, are among those most affected by natural disasters and conflicts. Refugees with disabilities are among the most isolated, socially excluded and marginalised of all displaced populations, which means that efforts to respond to emergencies both acute and chronic must address the issue of people with disabilities.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000047"></a>Finally, but most important, is the fact that eye disease is no respecter of national boundaries. Initiatives such as onchocerciasis control are dependent on cross-border collaboration in political and health terms

I stress that this is as much a political issue as it is a health issue, which allows me to draw attention to a point that I have made in other contexts in your Lordships&#146; House. There is a need in our own country for DfID, the Foreign Office and even the Ministry of Defence to work closely together to ensure that the right political context in which social measures such as health can be taken and thus the incidence of blindness reduced.</p>

I would like to devote my allotted few minutes to addressing the problem of river blindness in Africa, where I have spent most of my life. A number of rather chilling statistics exist and one reads that more than 100 million people are at risk in 30 African countries, with almost 18 million already infected with the disease.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000049"></a>In researching for this debate I read the initiatives of Vision 2020 to prevent avoidable blindness. I was encouraged to read that between 75 and 80 per cent of the world&#146;s blindness is avoidable, 60 per cent is treatable and 20 per cent is preventable. I returned last week from a visit to Ghana where the health authorities have been fighting the scourge of river blindness for almost 50 years. West Africa, particularly Nigeria, has been worst affected. Despite treatment with ivermectin, concerns are growing that this crippling disease is endemic and may be developing a resistance to the drug. It is encouraging that its mass administration has been effective in preventing nearly 40,000 cases of river blindness a year, but that figure could be considerably increased with better management. I was pleased to hear that phase three trials have recently been launched in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana and Liberia to assess the effectiveness of moxidectin in preventing transmission from the worms that cause river blindness. It is also encouraging that scientists in Cameroon and Ghana have identified the first biological agent, a midge, which can be cultivated, that eats the pupae of the blackfly that cause river blindness. Like my noble friend Lord Bilimoria, I also support the work of public-private partnerships in preventing avoidable blindness.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000050"></a>I have always been a firm believer in prevention rather than cure. While it is unlikely that the scourge of river blindness will be eradicated, it is encouraging that there are cost-effective solutions to the problem. In a recent article on combating river blindness in Cameroon, my noble friend&#146;s charity, Sightsavers International, has estimated that for an average cost of just 5p, the drug ivermectin can protect an individual against the devastating effects of the disease for a whole year. However, 15 years of such protection would be needed because that is the period during which the river blindness bug stays in the system. Getting the treatment to remote communities and training people to distribute it is a challenging task. As most speakers have already mentioned, river blindness predominantly affects poor people in remote areas. In many cases, children have missed out on education because they are forced to stay at home to act as

In some cases, residents have fled areas where the level of infection has hit hard, leaving &#147;ghost&#148; villages behind. These are often situated in arable areas of Africa, near to fast-flowing rivers.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000051"></a>It is well known that lack of eye care can have a severe economic impact by perpetuating poverty or pushing a family into poverty. Clearly, effective and low-cost solutions exist to eradicate avoidable blindness. To this end, I wholeheartedly support the aims of the Vision 2020 initiative.</p>

<p><a name="091104141000053"></a>I hope the Minister will have noted that we are talking about more than 45 million people with total blindness and a further 269 million with poor vision. A fact that we often seem to forget is that if one breadwinner in a family loses their sight, it is likely on average to affect the development of at least four or five members of that family. Therefore, we are talking about a much wider problem. Those of us who have travelled in many parts of the world, particularly in undeveloped countries, are aware that unless we take drastic action and develop proactive programmes, the number of blind people worldwide will increase substantially. It is estimated that we can add a further 30 million to the present number of 45 million by 2020. We also know that there is a direct link&#151;I am again grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, and a number of other noble Lords who have spoken about it&#151;between blindness and poverty. This disadvantage often results in families who are unable to afford the often simple treatments that could retain their sight.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000054"></a>Earlier today, the noble Lord, Lord Patel, mentioned the link between premature birth and cerebral palsy. Yesterday, when I spoke to him in the corridor about this debate, he said that a similar link could be established with blindness on the same principle, which is interesting. At this stage, some of the research may ultimately lead to a solution, but we now need to put initiatives in place so that the projected increase in the number of blind people does not happen. The Government&#146;s record in tackling poverty is not bad, but that does not mean that it could not be better. We must remember that poor people will suffer most during the economic depression. Millions of people could build a sustainable life if their sight was restored.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000055"></a>I welcome the initiatives taken by Vision 2020. At the national level, a strong partnership between ministries of health, NGOs, professional organisations and civil society groups, all of which have been brought together by Vision 2020, should facilitate the development and implementation of effective and sustainable national eye care plans worldwide. I hope that the Minister will be able to comment on the role in place for developing and assisting in the strategy that has been developed by Vision 2020. It should not be difficult. Examples have been cited in this Chamber. Pharmaceutical firms and medical providers now operate at the global level.

A very interesting example was cited by the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, about the partnership that could provide this initiative.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000056"></a>The overall objectives of Vision 2020 are entirely commendable; namely, to increase awareness within the key audiences of the causes of avoidable blindness and to look for the solutions. The other aim is to secure the necessary resources to increase prevention and treatment activities. I ask the Minister if he could throw some light on the type of resources that we are making available to tackle this problem.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000057"></a>There can be no excuse. Blindness prevention strategies are among the most cost-effective in healthcare. There are blind people around the world who should not be blind because their condition is treatable. In so many cases, had there been a comprehensive eye care system available, they would have got that treatment and would not be blind. It is imperative that the good work of Vision 2020 is built on and developed further. Support from the Government must be wholehearted and the continuation and furthering of partnerships between the private and public sectors must be actively encouraged. In this way, a future envisaged by Vision 2020 will be realised; that is, a world in which no one is needlessly blind.</p>

He rightly emphasised that addressing gender inequality needs to be a key component of future efforts to develop the eye-care industry because this involves childhood access as well. We need to remember that although the number of blind children is far smaller than the number of blind adults, the number of blind years is almost the same. Assigning priority to blindness conditions should be considered, therefore, in terms of blind years rather than just the absolute number of blind people.</p>

<p><a name="091104141000060"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, asked me to describe the cataract work that we do on a mercy ship in West Africa. This is a hospital ship with six operating theatres, two of which are devoted to eye surgery. We can treat 40 cataracts a day because there are no EU restrictions on the number of hours we work.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000061"></a>The joy of being able to see again after years of blindness is really quite indescribable. I shall never forget my first cataract operation. When the bandages were taken off the man the following day, he shrieked with joy, threw his hands in the air and for the next five minutes praised the Lord&#151;I mean the real Lord, not me. We have witnessed some amazing scenes. Twin boys aged two who had been blind from birth and had never walked were carried onto the ship. It is unusual to see twins in West Africa because they usually die in childbirth. Their eyes were sunken, expressionless and wandering around. The cataracts were removed and on the following day when the bandages were removed, these two little chaps began looking around in total amazement. They had never seen anything before, so they saw each other for the first time and then their mother. It was an emotional scene. They began to

I must tell noble Lords the whole story. The next day, being boys, they started fighting each other, so they were perfectly normal in all respects.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000062"></a>One problem is that in the western world cataracts are removed through a 3 millimetre incision using very expensive ultrasound equipment. Most developing countries cannot afford this kind of machinery, so we do without it and teach the locals a technique that uses a 6 millimetre incision which is almost as good, and in many ways is better because African cataracts tend to be much harder. There is a need to ensure that western countries include this alternative technique in their training programmes so that doctors can visit Africa and teach the local staff how to do it. Perhaps the Minister could encourage this.</p>

<p><a name="091104141000063"></a><b><a name="91104-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="091104141000116"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I begin by adding my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, on securing this debate and bringing the important issue of blindness, whether avoidable or unavoidable, to our attention. I know that over many years he has made a great contribution to health, including more recently in developing countries. I also thank all the other contributors to the debate who have brought to it their experience, interest and knowledge. The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, effectively set out three challenges which I hope to answer as I go through the narrative of my speech and respond to questions. On the fourth challenge, his reward is an immediate &#147;Yes&#148; to the question of meeting Ministers. That is a given and can be arranged.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000064"></a>I can certainly confirm the statistics used by the noble Lord and others that, globally, some 340 million people are visually impaired and 45 million are blind. As has been said, the vast majority&#151;almost 90 per cent&#151;live in poor countries with weak health systems and little or no immediate access to health services which could prevent or treat blindness. It was also pointed out that cataracts, which can be removed using a relatively simple surgical procedure, continue to be one of the main causes of blindness. However, they are avoidable if healthcare is available at a reasonably simple level, and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McColl, for his expertise in describing the treatment. The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, also raised the issue.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000065"></a>Trachoma is the second most common disease. It is linked to extreme poverty and poor sanitation, but even the simple acts of face and hand washing are not easy if there is no access to water. Glaucoma cannot be detected early enough where there are no systems for eye checks. Childhood blindness often arises from poor diet, inadequate sanitation and through diseases like measles, for which a vaccine exists. Onchocerciasis, which henceforth I shall call river blindness&#151;although I got the pronunciation right once, I may not do it a second time&#151;is a parasitic infection that infects the poorest of the poor. They are the people who find it most difficult to access the necessary drug treatment.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000066"></a>There is no need for me to dwell on the huge suffering that blindness brings to individuals because it has been graphically described by other noble Lords. The $64,000 question, or perhaps the rather more expensive question to ask, is what are we doing about it. The important thing has been said already: there  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC93"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are many health challenges across the world, and when it comes to avoidable blindness, it does not have to be this way.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000067"></a>In the vast majority of cases, tried, tested, simple and cost-effective interventions already exist for blindness and other visual impairments. They are preventable and treatable&#151;as indeed they are in developed countries. Let me put that statement into context. We are therefore talking about poor countries&#151;countries where Governments have to contend with manifold health priorities, if not crises, including HIV, TB, malaria, complications in pregnancy and childbirth and other neglected tropical diseases; where there are few doctors and ancillary services; where the system for delivering health care is often dysfunctional; where resources are limited; and where, sadly, health is often not the top priority on the Government's agenda. Here, I am at one with the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, in believing that access to health is a public and human right. Therefore, it seems to me that a Government, whether rich or poor, should put that high on their list of priorities.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000068"></a>The question is: what has the UK done and what are we doing to contribute to the elimination of avoidable blindness and to support those who are unavoidably blind? The causes of visual impairment are numerous, so we must address them as part of a global effort on multiple fronts. The noble Lord, Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, raised the important issue of river blindness in Africa. DfID is a long-standing supporter of the African programme of onchocerciasis control. That is a global partnership led by the World Bank and the WHO. In 2008, the programme treated 120,000 communities affected by the disease. The UK also supports research into that and other tropical diseases. The clinical trial of the drug moxidectin, which could dramatically speed up the elimination of river blindness across Africa, was launched last year.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000069"></a>We are addressing vitamin A deficiency and measles vaccinations through core funding to UNICEF&#151;by &#163;21 million in 2008. We support the GAVI Alliance&#151;by &#163;30 million in 2006-08. Through our bilateral programmes in Sudan, 6.5 million children received vitamin A supplements through one such programme and, in 2008, thanks to the work of DfID, more than 3 million children have been vaccinated against measles.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000070"></a>There are clear linkages between malnutrition and the level of blindness, especially among children, so we are now stepping up our efforts against malnutrition with the new nutrition strategy. However, those interventions are not sustainable unless countries have underlying strong and lasting healthcare systems&#151;another point made by the noble Lord, Lord Jay. Those systems must be able to deliver. As noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, said, that means having a trained workforce, the infrastructure and systems for drugs delivery and healthcare, including eye care, where they are needed. That is why last year the Secretary of State for DfID committed &#163;6 billion until 2015 to improve health systems and services. That is why the UK has led the development of the international health partnership to support developing country Governments who want to improve the health of their people according to their priorities.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC94"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000071"></a>In addition to raising additional funding for health systems, we set up the high-level task force chaired by the Prime Minister and the president of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick. The task force reported this year and helped to secure $3.2 billion funding for improved health services across the developing world. However, developing country Governments must lead the way by investing more of their own money in healthcare systems and meeting the Abuja target of 50 per cent of government spending towards healthcare.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000072"></a>I echo the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, that this is a partnership that is both public and private, national and international, and the task that we have can be achieved only if we work together. The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, made three points. One concerned making sure that primary care included eye healthcare. We agree that it is important that eye care is integrated into primary healthcare. DfID funds health sector plans of developing countries, with a focus on primary healthcare and the diseases of poverty. We also agree that it is important to improve the number and quality of healthcare workers, and healthcare workers at community and health centres will be trained across a range of priority issues, including eye health.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000073"></a>The third point related to the desire for disability to have greater prominence in DfID. DfID recognises that disabled children are excluded in many instances from access to education and that disabled adults are excluded from other services. This is clearly damaging not only to the individual but to families and the local economy. That is why disability is clearly on the DfID agenda.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000074"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, talked about dismantling copyright barriers, which, as he rightly says, is being discussed in Whitehall. I would welcome any more information that he has on that so that I can take the matter further and discover precisely where matters are and how we can assist. He also asked about DfID&#146;s support for education. DfID has provided &#163;8.5 billion over a 10-year period&#151;from 2005 to 2015&#151;for education. That includes funding to support disabled children, a large number of whom are blind.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000075"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, made a number of important points, including one about diabetic retinopathy. Important though they were, however, they relate to the United Kingdom and its health service, so I am happy to pass them on to my colleagues in the Department of Health. DfID has an interest in their impact in the developing world, but I am glad to say that other ministerial colleagues have the responsibility for them here in the UK.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000076"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, talked about avoidable blindness. We support action to prevent blindness by funding international organisations and partnerships and by giving countries bilateral support for research. This support will have a direct and indirect impact on avoidable blindness. We also support the strengthening of healthcare systems. The kind of money that I am talking about is &#163;6 billion to improve healthcare systems between 2008 and 2015; &#163;13.14 million to the World Health Organisation for 2009-10; and &#163;30 million, which I have already mentioned, to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation. I also mentioned the

This is dealt with through the World Bank, which manages donor-pooled funds&#151;currently &#163;500,000 per year&#151;and we as a country have supported it continuously since 1974. UNICEF has &#163;21 million of core funding to provide food and other humanitarian aid.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000077"></a>I see from the clock that I have spoken for 10 minutes. I shall have to speed up, which will be of great sadness to the <I>Hansard</I> writers. I am already too fast for most people to understand, which is not always accidental.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000078"></a>India was mentioned. We are supporting the health sector in four states with a total population of 260 million. We are giving West Bengal &#163;100 million from 2004 to 2010, Andhra Pradesh &#163;40 million from 2007 to 2010, Orissa &#163;50 million from 2007 to 2012, and Madhya Pradesh &#163;60 million from 2007 to 2012. That includes support for work on tropical diseases, blindness, and child health and nutrition, the focus of which is on poor and excluded groups, including the disabled and the blind.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000079"></a>I will have to respond in writing to a number of points that noble Lords have raised or I will fall foul of the Deputy Speaker, which I would hate to do. The noble Lord, Lord Jay, made the important point that we need a political context and cross-border collaboration between government departments. I agree. In recent months, we have seen closer co-operation between DfID, the MoD and the FCO on health issues, including a cross-departmental Whitehall group that always includes the Department of Health.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000080"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, pointed out that the recession will clearly have a damaging impact on the world&#146;s poor. We agree, which is why we have made a commitment to continue to support health. Eye care is central to this. We do that best by supporting the kind of programmes that we are supporting and by remaining on track to achieve the UN target of giving 0.7 per cent of our national income by 2013.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000081"></a>I will write to noble Lords on any points that I have missed. I will also ensure that my ministerial colleagues in the Department for International Development have a copy of this debate, so that they can see noble Lords&#146; awareness of this issue and their desire to raise it. This has been a matter of importance to your Lordships, and the quality of the debate has been excellent.</p>

<p>To ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government, with reference to the Agreement of July 2006 between the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and the BBC, what is their assessment of the extent to which the BBC has paid sufficient regard to the importance of reflecting humanism in its programmes. </p>

Recently, the BBC, the venerated home of public service broadcasting, gifted the British National Party a public platform while we humanists are still denied even a walk-on part on &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;.  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC96"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Tonight I argue that the BBC has failed the humanist community in Britain both in the spirit and in the letter of the Communications Act 2003, which requires the BBC to schedule programmes on religion and other beliefs, including humanism, as was made clear in the debate by the then Minister, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000083"></a>The Human Rights Act and other equality and anti-discrimination law similarly accord humanism the status of a belief, but humanism is ignored by the BBC. We humanists are atheists who do not have a Bible or a Koran, or indeed a Moses bringing tablets down from the mount, to fix our beliefs. We make do with our human nature and our life experiences to establish our moral values. We believe in a naturalistic explanation of life provided by patient scientific inquiry and careful reason. We share a respect for human rights, celebrate individual responsibility and social co-operation, and promote mutual respect. We create, if we can, our own meaning to our one-off lives. The humanist tradition established by the Greco-Roman thinkers predates monotheistic religions although it has, of course, influenced Christians&#146; own version of humanism. We arrive at our beliefs independently by reason and experience, not by dogma or indoctrination.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000084"></a>Humanism in the UK is significant and substantial in number but still single and silent in expression. None of us marches under a humanist banner in anger, arms or hatred. Nevertheless, we are subject to verbal excoriation; witness the gratuitous attacks on the courageous Professor Dawkins by those who should know better. We have been quiet, perhaps for too long. Now that established religion loses heart, congregations and credibility, it searches for a scapegoat and chooses us. I believe that our voice should now be heard in the public square, and especially in the BBC. We do not want just to take part in others&#146; scheduled religious programmes, although our voice is seldom heard in, for instance, the otherwise excellently chaired &#147;Sunday&#148; programme. When we are called, we perform the obedient role of token members of God&#146;s loyal opposition, but we have a distinctive voice. We want programmes made for us&#151;humanists talking humanism to other humanists on a variety of issues that interest us. These might include how we conduct non-religious funerals or how to educate free from the straitjacket of rigid religion. I would love to debate with humanist colleagues our common admiration for church music, or why we appreciate listening to Bach or Handel in the architectural settings of England&#146;s finest churches. The BBC can and should provide a platform for these searching debates. It should encourage a new set of cultural and intellectual programmes tailored to humanists. Similarly, combined debates of humanists and religionists could examine issues of common interest such as the environment, poverty reduction, your Lordships&#146; House or what new uses our wonderful churches could be put to in a modern, secular age. We have common humanist concerns that can unite us across the religious divide in the face of crass commercialism.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000085"></a>Unfortunately, the BBC treats humanism as the absence of religious belief, ignores its noble and ancient history and underestimates the strength of the humanist community in Britain. According to the Social Trends 2006 survey, 46 per cent of us are non-religious. However,  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC97"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we remain a community disregarded. The BBC quaintly argues that the vast majority of its output is secular; but have you ever watched a humanist &#147;Match of the Day&#148; or an atheist &#147;Strictly Come Dancing&#148;? The truth is that religious public broadcasting is growing while Anglicanism contracts. Mark Thompson confesses that the liturgical or contemplative religious content occupies some three hours each week on Radio 4. Basically, it is Christians talking Christianity to other Christians&#151;and the output is doubled at Easter and Christmas. However, not a single minute is allowed to humanists.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000086"></a>Other forms of Christianity are given public space alongside the established Church of England&#151;but not us. This is at a time when the Church of England is dwindling as our constituency grows. We still have no town crier to speak up for us in the public square. Why not? In a pluralising Britain, many non-Christian religions are rightly and readily invited to the public debate. Why not humanists? Even the 5.45 am slot &#147;Prayer for the Day&#148;, once the brief intonation of a short prayer, has elongated into a mini &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;. It is a form of mission&#151;or should I say missionary?&#151;creep.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000087"></a>My concluding thought for the day is that the title &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; does not guarantee an exclusive religious viewpoint&#151;but that is what it is, and it is discriminatory. By excluding us, the BBC implies that humanists are bereft of a moral compass; or worse, that we are amoral or immoral. It implies that we have no way of commenting sensibly on contemporary events. The BBC&#146;s excuses are strange and strained, as well as offending the spirit of the BBC charter. It says that &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; is an oasis of religion in a stream of unremitting news. In the BBC&#146;s taxonomy, items on sport, politics or culture are bizarrely classified as humanist.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000088"></a>Does the BBC really believe that only the religious can be spiritual? I respond to sunsets, Shakespeare and song, but I do not find God filtering my emotions. The Reverend Giles Fraser, a contributor to TFTD, said it would be madness to let secularists in&#151;this from a man who recently hosted a rerun of the famous Putney debate in the 17th century when his church rang to the rafters with unorthodox views. The BBC fears that humanists will stridently attack religion, but all we want to do is tell a listening and willing audience what humanism is about and what it has to offer. We leave internecine religious squabbling to those who are best at it&#151;witness the unseemly exchange on last week&#146;s &#147;Sunday&#148; programme provoked by the Pope&#146;s recently proffered pastoral chalice to unhappy Anglicans.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="091104141000089"></a>I conclude by saying to my colleagues that I understand that the BBC is about to make a decision on this, and I hope that it will be influenced by tonight&#146;s debate. We do not want to oust religious believers from the church pew or the park bench, but we do ask them to budge up a bit and let us be heard in the public square. Finally, I invoke the <I>Church Times</I> which supported our cause in 1994, and I ask our colleagues from the church who will speak later in the debate that, when they wake up tomorrow morning, they might remember the words promoted by the <I>Church Times</I> that:</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000002"></a>Humanism is growing in strength. It has growing public recognition in non-religious ceremonies such as marriages, funerals and baptisms. This has made significant contributions to public policy. The moral values held by humanists are weighed and considered. Humanism is a philosophy in its own right and is not a negative response to religion. The BBC needs in its programmes to give a perspective from the non-religious viewpoint. It needs to embrace debate on morality and ethics as expressed by humanists as well as by religious faiths, otherwise it is being unequal and one-sided. I think that the last programmes on humanism on broadcast media were in 1965, yet the Human Rights Act 1998 and European equality and anti-discrimination law give religious and non-religious beliefs such as humanism equivalent status in law.</p>

<p><a name="091104143000003"></a>The BBC is ignoring the fact that the British Social Attitudes Survey has found that over two-thirds of people&#151;69 per cent&#151;either did not claim membership of a religious organisation or said that they had never attended a religious service. Many only attend religious ceremonies such as weddings, funerals and baptisms. Some 70 per cent of people believe that the Church and the state should be kept separate in modern Europe. More dramatically, 44 per cent say that faith is one of the world&#146;s greatest evils, comparable to the smallpox virus but more difficult to eradicate. Even I would not go as far as that.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000004"></a>Why is the BBC ignoring this diversity of expression and feeling? Is it trying to convert people to religion or to reflect specific moral viewpoints? If so, it should include humanism. The BBC has an important role to play in this. The British Humanist Association evidence to the House of Lords Communications Committee on the duty of public service broadcasting stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="091104143000036"></a>&#147;members of society should be able to learn about each other and negotiate the terms on which they share their community&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="091104143000025"></a>Clearly, &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; is an ideal place to allow members of society to experience different moral and ethical standpoints. Humanists, after all, have thoughts. The BBC is being too defensive, is ignoring evidence of society&#146;s diversity and is denying access to a wider range of debate.</p>

<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC99"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has not just popped up in the early 21st century. In 1955, psychologist, broadcaster and humanist Margaret Knight courted controversy by suggesting in two talks on the BBC&#146;s Home Service, as was, that moral education should not be inextricably linked to religious education. The need that she felt to make it clear that moral and ethical values are not the preserve of the devout is, sadly, still with us today.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000006"></a>I want to raise just three main points. First, I suggest that we are rather vague and inconsistent when we are discussing humanism and religion. Just as atheism and agnosticism are often confused, so the terms atheism and humanism seem to be used interchangeably. As the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, said, &#147;secular&#148; seems to have accumulated such a general meaning that the BBC, anxious to defend the paucity of humanist or non-religious programming, puts sport, weather and news in that category. This bundle of disparate concepts is then set up as being inherently, irrevocably and sometimes violently in opposition to religion. I do not see that as a helpful or a productive view.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000007"></a>I wonder whether fear discourages the BBC from doing more to serve the needs of humanists and the wider public who might like to know more about humanism. I really cannot see why that should be the case unless there is a religious lobby in the UK as hypersensitive and anti-intellectual as in the US, where one programme provoked an avalanche of vitriol simply because it discussed atheism. Although some high profile commentators such as Richard Dawkins have attacked religion in all its guises, not all atheists or humanists take such assaults to be the foundation of humanist thoughts and values. Where exactly are our voices explicitly heard?</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000008"></a>My second point concerns what we are looking for. I would not want humanism to be exclusively confined in a category &#147;religion&#148;, a genre of programmes with declining audiences and unimaginative approaches to questions of morality and ethics. Thinking about this issue within the framework of diversity makes me think that although it may be a tactical coup for humanism to be included on &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;, it does not amount to a strategic win. We should continue to look at bolder, more innovative ways of disseminating ideas and generating debate. With all the different modes of technology-based communication available to us, noting how many communities are deserting the main television channels and recognising that conventional modes of viewing on television at fixed times, et cetera, are rapidly being supplanted, we could do more to be much more innovative ourselves in reaching a wider audience. Humanists need to engage with young people and groups with similar values&#151; for example, the British Muslims for Secular Democracy, which is made up of Muslim democrats from diverse ethnic and social backgrounds and supports a clear separation between religion and the state.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000009"></a>Thirdly, from a reading of Mark Thompson&#146;s speech last year, &#147;Faith and the Media&#148;, which was given at the Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#146;Connor lecture series, a number of points seemed to be quite contradictory. I guess that I would sum it up by saying that, although his examples of exemplary programming came from the religious and ethics department, almost every example

They were about nativity, the daily service, et cetera. Although he spoke of,</p>
<ul><a name="091104143000037"></a>&#147;how limitlessly diverse and complex, how imperfect the world is that we broadcast to&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="091104143000026"></a>the idea of complexity and diversity was not borne out in his speech. All I would ask is that we see a much broader representation of that complexity and diversity from the BBC.</p>

First, I need to say that I simply do not understand my religious faith as being determined by dogma and indoctrination. I do not understand my religion to be rigid and I do not understand Richard Dawkins to be possessed of particularly great courage, since as the professor for the public understanding of science, he has resorted again and again to so much evidence of lack of the use of scientific method in the way that he has pilloried&#151;yes, pilloried&#151;religion.</p>

<p><a name="091104143000011"></a>I want to make one point on &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;. As a contributor to &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; for 17 years, I honestly believe that I could deposit the 198 scripts which I have written for the programme in front of everyone in this Grand Committee and that noble Lords would not find one single occasion when I took a swipe at anyone who did not believe. If I could have the same assurance that British humanists using the same slot would not take a swipe at people who did believe&#151;there has been a little bit of evidence of that in the contributions made thus far&#151;then it would seem to me that their place in the slot would be perfectly justified and justifiable.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000016"></a>It was the late Gerald Priestland, the former religious affairs correspondent of the BBC, who, some 25 years ago, was asked why the BBC had religious viewpoints only on &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;, and why the BBC did not provide atheists and humanists with their own slot. Priestland, in his own inimitable way, replied: &#147;Actually we do. We call them news bulletins&#148;. I guess one had to be there to know whether that was humorous or not. I have had the privilege of debating with Richard Dawkins on television and hearing him say on the same programme, &#147;But I&#146;m a cultural Anglican&#148;. So there is an interesting observation to be made here.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000017"></a>Today, I speak as someone who has not been asked to contribute to &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;, unlike my illustrious predecessor, the late Jim Thompson, whose contributions to the programme were perhaps most notably marked by his &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; following the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Neither do I speak as someone who needs to defend the programme from humanist or secular thought. That is a little like St. Irenaeus who, when asked whether he would defend the Bible, replied, &#147;Defend the Bible. I would rather defend a lion&#148;.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000018"></a>Paradoxically perhaps, I welcome debate and critique of faith, particularly my own, in order that it may be lived more appropriately to the precepts of its founder. I agree with much of what humanists have to say about the worth and dignity of human life and with Andrew Copson's article in last Saturday's <I>Guardian </I>on John Stuart Mill in which he enunciated those very values of,</p>
<ul><a name="091104143000039"></a>&#147;worth and dignity of human life&#151;vital principles for modern humanists&#151;stimulated him in social action, opposition to slavery, and a commendably anachronistic appetite for gender equality&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="091104143000030"></a>I agree too with Copson when he observes that,</p>
<ul><a name="091104143000040"></a>&#147;the political principles he&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="091104143000031"></a>that is Mill&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="091104143000041"></a>&#147;evolved are ones that can be shared today by people of any religion as much as by humanists&#148;.</ul>
<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000019"></a>I believe that there are places where the humanist secular voice can be heard in programmes made by the religion and ethics department, and I offer the &#147;Moral Maze&#148; and the Sunday programme as examples. Like the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, I would welcome the opportunity for something more imaginative in general debate between religious people and people who do not base their faith in humanity on a religious tradition. The difficulty about &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; is that it is defined by the BBC as providing,</p>
<ul><a name="091104143000042"></a>&#147;a unique reflection from a faith perspective on topical issues and news events. Speakers from across the world's major faiths offer a spiritual insight rooted in the theology of their own tradition. This brief, uninterrupted interlude has the capacity to plant a seed of thought that stays with listeners throughout the day&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="091104143000032"></a>That is the nub of it: it is a distinctive slot where faith perspectives can be given on the day's news. Once that  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC102"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is lost, it loses its role. By their nature, both humanism and secularism are non-religious, and offer a valuable perspective by being so; but not on &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;. It is a bit like the lion lying down with the lamb. The only recorded incident seems to have been on Noah's Ark, and when Noah was asked, &#147;Did it work?&#148;, he replied, &#147;After a fashion, but it took a new lamb each day&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104143000020"></a>A recent BBC survey&#151;we are all citing figures&#151;by MORI indicated that 85 per cent of 2,200 people polled identified themselves as having a faith&#151;62 per cent Christian. We can all throw figures at each other. Despite the fact that, as I have said, I would like be there to be wider programmes, I believe that &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; should continue to be as it is defined.</p>

Soon after arriving at the BBC, I shared my convictions about &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;, with a wise old BBC stager&#151;and there were a lot of them. I suggested to her that the programme was anomalous for two reasons. First, from a purely broadcasting perspective, it was an earnest sermonette placed bang-slap in the middle of the liveliest and most engaging political bazaar anywhere&#151;the &#147;Today&#148; programme. The transition from one to the other always jarred, and still does. Secondly, the whole notion of imposing established religion in the heart of radio peak time seemed to me out of tune with the growing emergence of a predominately secular society. The wise old stager patiently admonished me. &#147;You have many battles to fight&#148;, she said. &#147;Fight the ones that you can win. This isn&#146;t one of them. You will never prevail against the embedded power of the established churches&#148;. I confess that I accepted her counsel, for she was certainly right at the time. Perhaps one day she will no longer be.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000022"></a>As others have said, of course the BBC must respect, reflect and meet the needs of people of religious conviction and belief, but organised religion does not have a monopoly of the spirit, nor of perspectives on morality and ethics. The BBC must one day soon loosen the stranglehold of the established religious organisations and more fully embrace the humanist movement.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000023"></a>Humanism does not deliver stern principles carved in tablets of stone, nor does it create institutions whose rules must be obeyed. Rather, it is a tradition, a loose network of individuals broadly exercised by questions of the spirit, concerned to optimise the sum total of human happiness here on earth; individuals naturally respectful of others, wedded to rationalism and to scientific rigour, revering all life, unafraid to proclaim and to celebrate the joy of existence and the richness of human expression. I have no doubt that that movement, the humanist movement, is burgeoning.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="091104143000024"></a>The BBC has a long history of path-finding&#151;of, for the most part, being ahead of the curve in most realms of human endeavour. It is time for the BBC to sniff the air in matters spiritual and to move ahead of the curve here, too.</p>

I speak from the perspective of a humanist, happy or otherwise, who has never had any faith-based beliefs. I am a lifelong supporter of a licence-funded BBC, but increasingly a critical friend.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="091104144000002"></a>For much of my life I have not been too fussed about people banging on about their religious beliefs, provided I am not expected to listen to them and they are not trying to convert me. However, over the past decade or so, I have detected a greater assertiveness and stridency by the faith-based communities. When there are issues of ethical complexity, I pick up a tone of ethical superiority from their spokespersons. Some of the faiths become campaigning organisations through the media when they detect a threat to their interests. A good example of this was the Catholic Church&#146;s campaign against the Assisted Dying Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Joffe. Of course, the churches are entitled to put their views on these controversial issues, but so are we humanists, and we want our voices to be heard much more. This is particularly so as we live in a largely secular society where the overwhelming majority of people do not worship regularly and many who describe themselves as C of E on a form have weakly-held or no religious views. I consider my views, and those of my fellow humanists, to have the ethical equivalence to those of any bishop, priest or mullah, but they are often given air time to express their views while my fellow humanists are not. That is why I think it is important that public service broadcasters such as the BBC provide a proper opportunity for the alternative to the faith-based viewpoint to be heard regularly. That is the importance of the 2006 agreement. This alternative viewpoint also needs to be heard regularly on prime time and prestige programmes, not just &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; but also TV programmes such as &#147;Question Time&#148; or &#147;Newsnight&#148;. If a political hooligan like Nick Griffin can be given time, then I think that some of the rest of us should be given equivalent time. I would like to see more monitoring of the BBC&#146;s performance in this regard and the provision of much more data on it in the public arena.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="091104144000003"></a>I conclude by drawing attention to yesterday&#146;s ruling by Mr Justice Burton in the Employment Appeal Tribunal case involving an environmentalist, Tim Nicholson. The judge said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="091104144000013"></a>&#147;A belief in man-made climate change, and the alleged resulting moral imperatives, is capable, if genuinely held, of being a philosophical belief for the purpose of the 2003 Religion and Belief Regulations&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="091104144000011"></a>This is a major change of ruling by the courts and the BBC might like to ponder that ruling when considering its programming arrangements. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

However, the BBC Trust has now set up a committee to examine the issue further, and the trust chairman, Sir Michael Lyons, promises that the committee,</p>
<ul><a name="091104144000014"></a>&#147;won&#146;t just be looking at Thought for the Day: they will be looking at the way the BBC serves the interests of citizens who are humanists, and have no faith&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="091104144000012"></a>So, seven years on from the Communications Act, we can now anticipate that proper coverage of those &#147;other beliefs&#148; will be consolidated on BBC screens in 2010.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="091104144000005"></a>I also thank the BBC for setting up a standing conference on religion and belief, on which a humanist now sits alongside a dozen or so other representatives of major religions. The Director-General of the BBC, Mark Thompson, will be an ex officio member of the conference. The other ex officio member will be the new head of BBC religion and ethics, Aaqil Ahmed, and I welcome him to his new post. Mr Ahmed has an impressive record from his years as commissioner for religion and head of multi-cultural programming at Channel 4. It was therefore disappointing to read that Protestants in Ulster, and even the Church of England, had expressed concerns about the appointment of Mr Ahmed, a Muslim, to his BBC post. I assure those critics that, in my experience, television executives in such roles are professionals who understand concepts of fairness and impartiality and who will spend much of their working lives communicating ideas and information with which they might not agree if that is what public service broadcasting requires. I speak as a non-believer who was responsible as executive producer for factual programming, including religious output, at both Granada and Scottish Television. My humanist friend, the noble Lord, Lord Birt, will no doubt have had the same experience at London Weekend Television and the BBC.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="091104144000006"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Birt, would also agree that the clerics who sat on our formal ITV religious advisory committees were tolerant, wise and broad-minded in the support that they gave us for producing our religious programmes, which were often rather good. My confession is that we godless producers helped to fill the pews with our electronic proselytising&#151;more than can be said, I suspect, for &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;. With all due respect to the noble Lord, Lord Griffiths of Burry Port, I caution my fellow humanists not to strive too officiously for slots on &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; unless they are convinced that banality is not contagious.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="091104144000007"></a>It is worth noting in closing that the BBC&#146;s review of its current religious and ethical output, circulated to noble Lords to inform this debate, suggests that more attention is already being given to other beliefs. I look forward to auditing the BBC&#146;s output in the year ahead and revisiting this important issue with noble Lords in a future debate.</p>

The result is that some in today&#146;s society get the opportunity to express their views while others are denied the opportunity.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="091104144000009"></a>A letter dated 21 June 2009 from BBC complaints states that there are about 30 contributors to the 360 thoughts each year. Presumably each contributor gets many opportunities to express their views, but not a single one of these regular contributors appears to be a humanist. We are not even given a ration of one single thought. According to the same letter, these short talks plant a seed of thought and a spark of spiritual insight that stay with listeners during the day. Having heard Bishop Tom Butler&#146;s polemic earlier this year on the assisted dying amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, and having read the thought of the Chief Rabbi on 12 October 2005 expressing his opposition to assisted dying just before debates in this House on the matter, the seeds of doubt planted in my mind were not exactly spiritual. I wondered how the BBC could allow &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; to become a political platform for a self-proclaimed campaign by the churches to oppose any legislation on assisted dying, without allowing at least one slot on &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; for proponents of such legislation. If there is to be a &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;, it would be better sited in one of the BBC&#146;s religious programmes, of which there are an abundance, where it would doubtless be of great interest to what is probably a relatively small and declining percentage of listeners, particularly compared to the audience of the excellent &#147;Today&#148;.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="091104144000010"></a>I do not for a moment accuse the BBC of being deliberately partial. The issues to which I have referred are probably the result of 40 years of &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;. The BBC may have lost sight of the world having changed. In conclusion, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Griffiths, that I am a great admirer of most of the work of the church and would respectfully suggest a more open-minded and less rigid approach to some of the controversial issues of the day, such as homosexuality, women&#146;s rights and assisted dying.</p>

Perhaps a good slot would be a discussion of one of the moral issues of the day. In its present form, it seems to be assumed by the BBC that it must be a god slot, reflecting what many churchmen tell us on &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;, that only belief in god provides a basis for morality. This argument does not stand up.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0911052000002"></a>Different gods promote very different moral values. The Greek gods were not exactly moral role models, but on the other hand they were interesting and sometimes fun, and did not encourage or command their worshippers to proselytise. The Old Testament Jehovah is a very unpleasant, tyrannical and cruel god. Judeo-Christian and Muslim gods have at different times commanded their followers to massacre Midianites and abduct their women, stone prostitutes and adulteresses, and slay heretics and infidels. At other times they have

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91104-gc0008.htm"/>


<a name="91104-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0911052000003"></a>Christians, who take their inspiration from the Sermon on the Mount, a splendid moral text, do not acknowledge a god who issues such commandments. The god they worship is a god of love. Likewise, moderate Muslims disown passages of the Koran that incite people to murder or commit cruel acts, and tell us that his commands have been misconstrued because the true Allah is a merciful, tolerant and humane god. What both are saying is that to be a proper god, to qualify as the god they worship, he&#151;there is no question of she&#151;must be a god who cannot require worshippers to commit evil acts. There is therefore a standard of goodness by which god is judged. The Old Testament god, Jehovah, fails the test and is not the true god. The New Testament god, the father of Jesus and Jesus himself, passes the test.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0911052000004"></a>Believers apply a standard of goodness independent of god. You do not obey or worship god just because he is god or is a god of authority, but because in your view he is good, and if he was not, you would not. It follows inexorably that there is no need for god as a basis for morality and we can leave him out of it. It also follows that humanists, who do not believe in a god, have as much right to have a say in a slot about morality as believers.</p>

<p><a name="0911052000005"></a><b><a name="91104-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0911052000024"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, for introducing this debate. I must declare interests within the Church of England as a patron of livings, a practising member of the Church of England, a member of parochial church councils and president of the Norfolk branch of the Prayer Book Society. I am sorry that took so long. The agreement of July 2006 requires the promotion of different cultures and viewpoints. Does this mean that humanism should be included within what is essentially a religious programme? It is hard to think that a creed, however laudable and much admired, as is humanism, but which has no belief in any god, is a religion.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0911052000006"></a>When it comes to philosophical beliefs, one wonders not only whether the BBC is aware of humanism but whether it is aware of any secular philosophy outside the boringly and so depressingly unoriginal over-favouring of the so-called progressive family of Marxism, socialism and liberalism. If humanists feel that they do not get a fair look-in, they should talk to ordinary Conservatives who sense an institutional prejudice against non-liberal, non-collective viewpoints. The article by Mr Charles Moore in yesterday&#146;s <I>Daily Telegraph</I> about BBC commissioning editors&#146; assumptions about the nature of British history is a striking example.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0911052000007"></a>However, it must be difficult for the trust to know where to draw the line when faced with demands to promote different viewpoints. There must be a very large number of different philosophies in this country, so I imagine it would be impossible to pay attention to every single one. Certainly, it would be difficult to include all philosophies within one programme such as &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;. It is an extraordinarily difficult task. For an organisation that has so lost its way that it can defend leaving offensive and obscene

<a name="91104-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0911052000008"></a>I hope that the BBC listens to what humanists are saying and does so with respect, but I hope it also understands the frustrations of millions who embrace the humane philosophy of conservatism, the values of which are so rarely voiced in an objective and balanced manner.</p>

In some respects, on all sides of the argument, the expertise with which the contributions have been made fitted exactly that slot. I want to emphasise that it is only in the House of Lords that one can be questioned at 2.30 pm by a bishop about how to look after flocks of sheep and at 7.30 pm reply to a debate on humanism, the BBC and the Government&#146;s role.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0911052000014"></a>I hope that it will be appreciated that I have difficulties in responding to this debate in the obvious sense. It has been a fascinating debate and I am not sure that it would not have sufficed to be produced as a one-hour programme for the BBC to consider all aspects and viewpoints of religion and humanism. But the real issue is where the Government stand in relation to this. The only reason I am responding is because I am speaking on behalf of the Government, who scarcely got a mention in the whole debate. The BBC certainly has been harangued, harassed and challenged, but very little has been said about the Government for the very good and obvious reason that the Government&#146;s locus in this debate is very marginal. Of course, the Government set up the framework of the charter of the BBC by an Act of Parliament, which was debated and produced only a few short years ago, but the Government are concerned that the charter, which is set out in legislation, clearly stresses the most important  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC108"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column GC108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>feature of the British Broadcasting Corporation; namely, that it is independent of government. That is its glory and its role.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0911052000015"></a>Within that framework, if this debate is to indicate that the Government should take a perspective on how &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; or other programmes should be presented by the BBC, I want to emphasise that the Government have no locus at all. It is the case that the BBC has answerability. I congratulate my noble friend Lord Harrison on taking this opportunity to identify an important matter for the BBC to consider. I also reassure my noble friend that he could not have been more timely in setting the debate for this day. &#147;Thought for the Day&#148; is the subject of a complaint that is going before the BBC Trust. &#147;Complaint&#148; is an odd concept, because when it becomes an item on the BBC Trust&#146;s agenda it is rather more an appeal than a complaint. The trust is deliberating on this matter tomorrow, hence the great timeliness of this debate. All members of the trust have an obligation to be well informed about the nation and its views, and take great steps to be so.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0911052000016"></a>I have a list of the BBC&#146;s activities to analyse the views of the nation on issues such as this. The charter certainly confirms that it is the trust&#146;s responsibility to assess the performance of the BBC executive in this area by conducting investigations, where appropriate, into any BBC activity. Of course the trust would say that it holds consultations and has audience councils where licence-fee payers can present their position on the BBC. There are also research projects through which the BBC analyses public opinion and seeks responses to its progress. The trust is active, but it is responsible for safeguarding the independence of the BBC. The BBC executive is responsible for discharging its functions under the charter.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0911052000017"></a>I shall comment from the Government&#146;s point of view on humanism and &#147;Thought for the Day&#148;. It is not the Government&#146;s responsibility to make any diktat on programmes. The BBC certainly has an obligation to listen, so I would be more than a little surprised if members of the trust did not listen carefully to this debate, which would help their deliberations tomorrow. I emphasise the obvious point that this has been an extremely valuable and interesting debate. Indeed, this House prides itself on its ability to raise issues that it is often infinitely more difficult to raise at the other end of the building, if only because religious and humanist beliefs can from time to time raise passions and produce stances that, for elected Members of Parliament, can be difficult.</p>

<a name="91104-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0911052000018"></a>We delight in the fact that we are a little remote from the immediate political battle, and have had contributions tonight from Members of this House with a very wide range of experience of these important issues and whose opinions and perspectives are greatly valued. That is the great advantage of the debate. I hope that all participants will appreciate that in my winding-up speech on this occasion, reluctant as I am ever to seek to absolve myself of full responsibility, I have to say that the Government&#146;s position is extremely limited. I do, however, hope that the BBC has been listening.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09110486000015"></a>I am today issuing a consultation paper on the distribution of concessionary travel special grant funding for local authorities in 2010-11.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09110486000016"></a>Following the extension of the statutory bus concession in April 2008, to provide free off-peak local bus travel anywhere in England, the Government have provided additional special grant funding to local authorities of &#163;212 million in 2008-09, followed by &#163;217 million for 2009-10 and &#163;223 million for 2010-11. This is in addition to the funding that Government provide each year for concessionary travel through the formula grant process, bringing total spending on concessionary travel to around &#163;1 billion a year.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09110486000017"></a>A special grant report, which specified the amounts to be paid to authorities for the three years from 2008-09 to 2010-11, was approved by Parliament in March 2008. The formula used to distribute the extra funding was based on data on eligible local population, visitor numbers, retail floor space and current bus use. As such it was designed to take account of likely demand in areas such as coastal towns, urban centres and other places likely to experience an increase in costs.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09110486000018"></a>There is no evidence that the additional special grant funding is insufficient in total to meet the costs of the new concession. However, I am aware of some distributional issues that have arisen that have led to around 30 (out of over 260) travel concession authorities at risk of a significant shortfall in funding. At the same time I am aware of other authorities that may have received more funding than they require to meet the additional costs of the improved concession.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09110486000019"></a>It is for this reason that I am today launching a consultation on whether to allocate the special grant for 2010-11 using a revised distribution, which seeks better to match the pattern of costs being incurred by local authorities. Any revised grant distribution developed after the consultation will be published in the form of a special grant report which will itself then be the subject of parliamentary scrutiny in due course.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09110486000020"></a>Earlier this year we also consulted on the way in which concessionary travel will be administered from 2011. Over 200 responses were received to the consultation and we are in the process of considering these responses. I expect to be able to make a further announcement on the outcome of this consultation in due course.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09110486000021"></a>I would like to emphasise that the funding distribution and administrative issues should by no means detract from the success of the national bus concession, which the Government will continue to offer to older and disabled people in England. These changes make no change to either the services pass holders are entitled to use, or to who can receive the concession. Concessionaires themselves should therefore not notice any difference in the service they receive, under the proposals suggested.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09110486000022"></a>The introduction of free off-peak local bus travel throughout England from 1 April 2008 has given the opportunity for greater freedom and independence to around 11 million older and disabled people. No older or disabled person in England now need be prevented from local bus travel by cost alone and the scheme represents a major step forward in tackling social inclusion for some of the most vulnerable people in our society.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09110486000025"></a>With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09110486000026"></a>Today the Committee on Standards in Public Life, under its chair, Sir Christopher Kelly, has published its report setting out recommendations for a new framework for parliamentary allowances.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09110486000027"></a>People in this country need to be able to have full trust and confidence in their Parliament. What happened under the old allowance system has knocked that confidence.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09110486000028"></a>We come into Parliament not to serve our own self interest&#151;but to serve the public interest. But that is not the impression the public have. We have all acknowledged that and recognised that to ensure that we have a system in which everyone can have confidence we needed to take action.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09110486000029"></a>We have already made changes and the Kelly report is another important step on that path to restoring public confidence.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09110486000031"></a>Before I turn to the Kelly report, I should like to remind the House of the action that we have already taken.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09110486000032"></a>To deal with the past we are ensuring that any overpayments&#151;including those which were simply a mistake&#151;are paid back. That is the work that the Members Estimate Committee, which is chaired by you Mr Speaker, commissioned from Sir Thomas Legg.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09110486000033"></a>We have already taken action to change the current allowance system. In order to allow for the period while wholesale reform of our allowances is being considered&#151;we introduced interim measures last May to pare back allowances, as a result of a meeting of the party leaders and the Members Estimate Committee.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09110486000035"></a>Amid the enormous attention paid to past problems, no one should overlook the fact that we have already decided to:</p>
cap the monthly amount that can be claimed on mortgage or rent;prevent a Member changing the designation of main or second home;abolish the second home allowance for outer London Members; andstop claims for furniture, stop claims for cleaning, and stop claims for gardening.
<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09110486000036"></a>Parliament has not sat back waiting for Kelly. The current allowance system is already very different from the one which allowed for the claims which have angered both the public and the House.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09110486000037"></a><I>Independently setti</I><I>ng our allowances in the future</I></p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09110486000038"></a>We have also recognised that, for the future, it is no longer appropriate for us to set or administer our own allowance system. That is why in July we passed the Parliamentary Standards Act which set up the new Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority which will decide on our allowances and run the system.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09110486000039"></a>So, just as we no longer vote our own pay increases, we will play no part in setting or administering our allowances.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="09110486000041"></a>My right honourable friend the Prime Minister, in March, asked Sir Christopher Kelly, the chair of the Committee on Standards in Public life, to review the system of MPs&#146; allowances.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09110486000042"></a>I should like to thank Sir Christopher and his committee for the important work they have undertaken and also thank all those, including many honourable Members, who gave evidence to his committee.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09110486000043"></a>His report was published only this morning. But it is obviously right for the House to hear an early Statement and have the chance to air initial views.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09110486000044"></a><I>Why we have allowances</I></p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="09110486000045"></a>MPs representing constituencies outside London need to be able to live both in their constituency and in Westminster because they need to work in both places. We do not want a Parliament where the only people who can come to Westminster as MPs are those who are wealthy enough to afford to pay for two homes out of their own pocket. Nor do we want to undermine the importance of MPs working in two places&#151;both in the constituency and in Westminster. Both are important. Nor do we want to have a situation where you cannot have your family with you if you are an MP. The Kelly report recognises that the allowances are there so that Parliament works properly on behalf of people in this country:</p>
that the constituency link is sustained;that Parliament is not barred to people on modest incomes, and

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="09110486000046"></a>The Kelly report acknowledges this.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="09110486000047"></a>The Kelly report covers 138 pages and puts forward 60 recommendations. Among the key recommendations are two that I should like to draw particularly to the attention of the House:</p>
that Members should not be able to claim for mortgage interest but only for rent or hotels. They recommend that for those with existing mortgages they should be able to continue to claim for one further Parliament; andthat Members should not be reimbursed for the employment of family members. Those who currently do will be able to continue to do so for one further Parliament.

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="09110486000049"></a>The acting chief executive of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, Andrew MacDonald, has been appointed and has begun work and you, Mr Speaker, have today announced that Professor Sir Ian Kennedy has been selected as the new chair-designate of IPSA. I will put the Motion to confirm his appointment to the House in the next few days. The other members of the authority will be appointed shortly.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="09110486000050"></a>The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has already started the work of setting up the new allowance regime for MPs. A new allowances regime will be in place to come into effect in the new Parliament&#151;as recommended by Sir Christopher Kelly.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="09110486000052"></a>In the light of this, the Government welcome and fully accept the Kelly report which should be taken as a whole. It will be for the IPSA to take it forward. This is the approach Kelly&#146;s report itself recommends.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="09110486000054"></a>Until such time as the IPSA takes the Kelly report forward, we will retain the current restricted allowance rules and every claim is of course published and available for the public to see.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="09110486000056"></a>Mr Speaker, because we decided in July that in future we would play no part in our allowance system and it would be done independently, it does not make sense for us now to vote on the future shape of our allowance system. Instead that is the job of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. After all, that is what we set it up to do.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="09110486000057"></a>The Parliamentary Standards Act lays down that Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority must consult MPs and others when drawing up the allowances regime. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority will set to work immediately and we expect, following such consultations, it to proceed as quickly as possible to put into effect the Kelly recommendations on allowances.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="09110486000058"></a>The events that lie behind the recommendations in the Kelly report have caused anger and dismay both  in the public and among honourable Members.</p>

the payback system is underway;the new restrictive allowance system will remain in place for the time being;Sir Christopher Kelly has recommended a new framework for our allowances; andthe Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority is up and running and will set up the new allowance system and administer it.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="09110486000060"></a>Sir Christopher Kelly&#146;s report is another important step on the road to the public knowing that the allowance system has been put on a proper independent footing and that we are getting on with our important task of serving our constituents and this country.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="09110486000061"></a>This House of Commons has yet fully to resolve this damaging episode.

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="09110486000064"></a>I have received the 22nd report of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC). This report has been made under Articles 4 and 7 of the international agreement that established the commission and it reports on levels of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. I have considered the content of the report and I am today bringing it before Parliament. I have placed copies in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="09110486000065"></a>The IMC report on the serious threat posed by dissident republicans. It concludes that the activities of both the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA, including the murders of Sappers Quinsey and Azimkar and PC Carroll in March and a number of other extremely serious incidents, are designed to undermine peaceful political progress.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="09110486000066"></a>The IMC notes that the completion of devolution could be a potent intervention &#147;because policing and justice would no longer be a point of contention across the political divide&#148; but rather be &#147;a platform for co-operation against those trying to undermine the peace process&#148;. The Government remain committed to do all they can to provide a solid foundation for a devolved Department of Justice.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="09110486000067"></a>The IMC also acknowledges the very real progress towards decommissioning made by loyalists. It concludes that the UVF is an organisation on its way to going out of business and that the leadership of the UDA has given a significant lead to change the organisation and shown remarkable commitment and progress in community development. I, too, hope that the UDA will follow through on the commitments it has made and complete the decommissioning process.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="09110486000069"></a>I am pleased to announce our intention to introduce amending regulations to align the payment arrangements for state pension and pension credit with the arrangements for working age benefits.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="09110486000070"></a>We plan to introduce a new part-week payment for people who move onto state pension from a working age benefit, to ensure that they do not experience a break in payments. DWP customers would also be able to keep the same pay day and pattern of payments when they reach pension age.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="09110486000071"></a>In line with current practice for working age benefits, people who reach state pension age on or after 6 April 2010 will be allocated a pay day based on the last two digits of their national insurance number, and will be paid in arrears. Customers will continue to have a choice around how frequently they are paid.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="09110486000073"></a><b><a name="91104-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="09110486000096"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing (David Hanson) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="09110486000074"></a>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) marked a major step in the protection of privacy. Prior to RIPA, many of the more intrusive techniques which it regulates could be used by any public authority and authorised at any level, for any purpose. There was no comprehensive system of independent oversight, no independent judicial complaints mechanism available in relation to all these techniques, and no means by which Parliament could prescribe the ranks of authorising officers or limit the purposes for which the techniques could be used. In addressing this situation, RIPA ensured that only specified public authorities could continue to use certain key techniques to protect the public, and only if they could do so compatibly with the European Convention on Human Rights and, particularly, the Article 8 right to respect for private and family life.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="09110486000075"></a>Nevertheless, a small number of local authorities have authorised techniques under RIPA in circumstances when most of us would say it was not necessary or proportionate for them to do so. In order to prevent this happening again, my department published on Friday 17 April a consultation paper entitled <I>Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000: Consolidating Orders  


<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS18"></a><b>4 Nov 2009 : Column WS18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and Codes of Practice</I>. This paper set out proposals to ensure that techniques regulated in RIPA can continue to be used when they are necessary and proportionate, but that there is no repetition of the small number of cases when they have been misused.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="09110486000076"></a>Today I am publishing a summary of the responses submitted as part of this consultation exercise. The summary explains how I intend to develop the proposals set out in the consultation paper in light of the responses received.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91104-wms0002.htm"/>


<a name="91104-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="09110486000077"></a>My department received 222 responses to the consultation exercise. As explained in the summary, most of the responses were broadly supportive of the proposals in the consultation document. Subject to minor changes set out in the summary, I intend to take forward the proposals for secondary legislation described in the consultation document as soon as possible. The secondary legislation, and the related codes of practice, will include measures to:</p>
 clarify the test of necessity and proportionality so techniques will not be used for trivial purposes such as investigating dog fouling or people putting bins out a day early; raise the rank of authorising officer for RIPA techniques in local authorities to senior executive at a minimum of director level; give elected councillors a role in overseeing the way local authorities use covert investigatory techniques; require constituents&#146; communications with MPs on constituency business to be treated as confidential information, and therefore subject to authorisation by a higher rank of officer; treat covert surveillance of legal consultations as intrusive rather than directed surveillance, meaning that it can be carried out only by a very limited number of public authorities, primarily the  police and intelligence agencies, and only with independent approval; andclarify how provisions currently in the Policing and Crime Bill will reduce bureaucracy relating to RIPA in police collaborative units comprising two or more forces. 
<a name="91104-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a><a name="09110486000078"></a>Following a proposal by the Local Government Association, I intend to require each local authority to appoint a single official to be responsible for ensuring that all authorising officers are of an appropriate standard. This new role will have to be filled by a member of the corporate management team to whom authorising officers will report.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="09110486000079"></a>A number of respondents suggested that the key to effective and appropriate use of RIPA techniques was training, rather than the rank of authorising officers. With this in mind, I have asked my officials to work with the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Local Government Association and the Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services to establish a package of accredited training for local authority authorising officers, and, in addition, to prepare bespoke written guidance on how local authorities should use RIPA.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a><a name="09110486000080"></a>It is absolutely clear that a wide range of public authorities need to be able to authorise key techniques under RIPA in order to protect us from those who

It is equally clear that public authorities must respect our right to privacy and use techniques under RIPA only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so. I believe the measures outlined in the summary of responses will ensure that both objectives can be met.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="09110486000082"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State issued a Written Ministerial Statement on 20 July (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 96WS) about the discovery of a backlog of conduct cases which had been identified by the General Social Care Council (GSCC). He announced that we would be asking the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE) to undertake a review of the GSCC&#146;s conduct functions. CHRE today published the report of its review of the GSCC. The Government welcome this report.</p>

Insufficient attention was paid to a growing backlog of conduct cases, despite additional funding being provided by the department for three years to enable GSCC to address a growing number of complaints. Of particular concern was the decision to suspend, for a period of time, any new referrals to the GSCC&#146;s Professional Conduct Committee.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"></a><a name="09110486000085"></a>I met the GSCC&#146;s chair, Rosie Varley, on behalf of both the Department of Health and the Department for Children, Schools and Families to express Ministers&#146; concerns about the issues raised in the report and to set out clear expectations for the GSCC going forward.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="09110486000086"></a>Significant progress has already been made in handling cases on receipt of complaints and addressing any ongoing risks to the public resulting from the poor management of conduct since July. Ministers have been assured by the chair of the GSCC that all cases are now routinely risk-assessed and allocated to a responsible manager who ensures that risk is continually reviewed as new information arises. Interim suspension orders, which suspend the registration of social workers against whom serious complaints have been made while they are investigated, are now being applied for where appropriate.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a><a name="09110486000087"></a>The GSCC has also begun the process of reforming its operational processes and strengthening its infrastructure to support performance management of its conduct function. A remedial plan to address the backlog of cases is now in place and Ministers have asked for monthly reports on progress to be provided to the department.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a><a name="09110486000088"></a>Ministers have made it clear to the chair of the GSCC that they expect to see significant operational improvements as a result of the implementation of the council&#146;s action plan by the end of March 2010, including the resolution of the oldest cases. The chair of the GSCC has been asked personally to oversee reform of the GSCC&#146;s procedures, to ensure effective governance and to report on progress to Ministers in March 2010.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a><a name="09110486000089"></a>The Department of Health will continue to work closely with the GSCC to assure and assist in the delivery of its recovery plans.</p>

<a name="91104-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a><a name="09110486000090"></a>The CHRE&#146;s report and the Government&#146;s response have been placed in the Library and copies are available for honourable Members from the Vote Office.</p>

It would not be appropriate or necessary to ask JACQA to duplicate Ofqual's efficiency objective, but JACQA will need to consider whether according to the Section 96 criteria and in the context of the stated aims of the 14-19 qualifications strategy, public investment in a qualification represents good value for money.</p>
