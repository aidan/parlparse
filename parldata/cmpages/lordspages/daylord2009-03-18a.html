The UN is investigating a number of specific incidents that occurred in Gaza during the conflict. The Israeli authorities have also said that they are investigating specific incidents raised by the aid agencies.

The Israeli Government, too, have undertaken to examine the conduct of their forces in Gaza. The House will appreciate that Israel is a signatory to the Geneva Convention and therefore has obligations. Those investigations will go on. We will of course monitor the situation carefully and take any action which is necessary as a result of the outcome of those investigations.</p>

Does he not agree that this demonstrates Israel&#146;s willingness as a vibrant democracy to hold itself accountable for any breaches that may have occurred? What steps are being taken to ensure that similar inquiries are conducted into alleged violations by Hamas?</p>

Of course, there are higher priorities than these issues, important though they are. The world is mostly interested in securing a fair and peaceful arrangement for the development of the relationships between Israel and the people of Palestine and Gaza. Those matters need to be taken into account. It is not always the case that a threatening challenge to those who have been responsible for reprehensible conduct is necessarily the next stage forward in advancing the cause of peace.</p>

Will the Minister confirm that it is not the case that Israel and Hamas stand on exactly the same ground in international law? Israel is a fully constituted democratic sovereign state, while Hamas is a proscribed terrorist organisation, so labelled by the United States of America, the European Union, Australia and Canada.</p>

There is a difference between a sovereign state and the Hamas rule in Gaza. That means, therefore, that the expectations, obligations and any sanctions are different in the two cases. That does not alter the fact that, when conflict of this kind has occurred, it is important that as far as possible the truth of the incidence of atrocities is identified. I do not have the figures for the numbers of rockets; I imagine the noble Lord has put it forward as being a lesser force than was wielded by the Israeli armed forces in Gaza, which is certainly so.</p>

The Bank of England is involved in creating a degree of money expansion in order that the crucial functioning parts of our economy have access to resources which alone will get us through the present recession as rapidly as possible. The result of our emergence from that will be that, in the fullness of time, the Bank of England will be able to reap the rewards of the money that it has transferred.</p>

He is right that the crucial aspect is not only that resources are made available as far as the banks are concerned but that they then spread to the wider economy. He knows that this exercise is not like flicking on an electric switch. It is a complex process. It is one that the Americans are pursuing for the same objectives. They, too, are finding it difficult to guarantee that the resources flow as fast as they would wish and as fast as we as the Government of the United Kingdom would wish.</p>

We will do our best to ensure that, but the noble Lord will recognise that the purchase from foreign institutions can be of great benefit in increasing the demand factor of those economies, which are also in recession. That helps to get world trade flowing again at levels that are absolutely essential to an economy such as ours, which depends so much on it.</p>

On the one hand, many firms are finding that bank loans are rarer than hen&#146;s teeth, despite the Government&#146;s unsuccessfully, as yet, pouring billions of taxpayers&#146; money into the banks; and, on the other hand, very few people are buying their products. Clearly, the reduction in the rate of VAT by the maximum rate allowed under the VAT directives is not doing enough to encourage people to start buying again. Is the time not overdue for the Government to turn their attention, as my party has, to reductions in personal taxation?</p>

The noble Lord will be aware that, for the banking system, measures have been taken to secure deposits, to give the banks stability through capitalisation and to move through a raft of measures to try to get lending flowing again. It cannot be switched on overnight. On tax measures, there will be increases in household incomes next year, starting in April. That has not yet impacted on the arrangements. Every basic rate taxpayer will get &#163;145 extra from measures already announced. The impact of the VAT reduction is to put something like &#163;12.4 billion into the economy. Again, this will not all come at once. It will, effectively, accrue over a 13-month period. That makes a real difference of, on average, around &#163;145 per household to people&#146;s disposable income.</p>

I am bound to agree with him. We need to be careful in some of the comparisons, because the basis is not always consistent. Whatever our challenges here, there are severe challenges elsewhere in the world and we stand well in comparison not only of unemployment rates, but employment rates. We should not lose sight of the fact that employment in the UK is still significantly above 1997 levels. In fact, I think it increased over the last month.</p>

The ILO basis and the claimant count measure different things. The claimant count looks at particular points in time. The noble Lord raises an important point. Sometimes we miss the fact that jobs appear through Jobcentre Plus and are taken up very quickly; therefore, they do not feature in the count. We should also recognise the dynamics that are still in the labour market, and not only in the current level of vacancies. Notwithstanding the increase in claimant-count unemployment, in February 250,000 people moved off JSA.</p>

The proposals are potentially costly for the taxpayer, and we need to consider the costs and evidence on positive and negative impacts. We are also looking at the experiences of other countries that have introduced similar schemes, such as Germany.</p>

Do the Government appreciate that the possibility of a scrappage scheme was first discussed in autumn 2008? If further delay takes place, and the Government&#146;s plans are to make a decision when the Budget comes at the end of April, does the Minister accept that there will a lengthy time before any such scheme could be introduced? It could be the autumn before there is any impact on the second-hand car industry, which will have been nearly a year since the proposal was first mooted.</p>

It is clear that the German scheme has cost the taxpayer &#8364;1.5 billion. If we are to introduce a scheme&#151;we have not decided whether this is appropriate&#151;we must ensure that we evaluate the impact on the second-hand car market and on discounts. There are many complex aspects to introducing a scheme. That is why we are taking our time: we need to get it right. We have introduced many schemes over the past few months to stimulate the economy. We have got them right because we have taken time to consider them.</p>

However, any scheme that we introduce needs to ensure that while we are rewarding the individuals bringing their car back and giving them cash, the impact on the industry is not just that of bringing forward sales and causing a crisis in the second-hand car market. On trains, I am afraid that I have to pass.</p>

Our car manufacturing industry is mainly exporting cars. Although I am very much in favour of updating cars, is there not a risk that the scheme will not have the benefits to the economy that we hope?</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09031886000056"></a>&#147;With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a Statement about Stafford Hospital, following the Healthcare Commission&#146;s investigation published yesterday. The report details astonishing failures at every level and shows that for patients admitted for emergency care at Stafford there were deficiencies at every stage.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09031886000057"></a>The Healthcare Commission found disorganisation, delays in assessment and pain relief, poor recording of important information, symptoms and requests for help ignored, poor communication with families and patients and severe failings in the way the trust board conducted its business. While the management was obsessed with achieving foundation trust status, the wards were understaffed and patient care seriously compromised.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09031886000058"></a>The report cites incidents where patients were left without food or drink for days because operations were delayed, of nurses who had not been properly trained to use basic, lifesaving equipment and of patients admitted to A&amp;E being triaged by receptionists. It notes that there was a dangerous lack of experienced staff, that observation and monitoring of patients was poor, that essential equipment often was not working and that there were no systems in place to spot where things were going wrong in order to make improvements.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09031886000059"></a>In short, it is a catalogue of individual and systemic failings that have no place in any NHS hospital but which were allowed to happen by a board that steadfastly refused to acknowledge the serious concerns about the poor standard of care raised by patients and staff. I apologise on behalf of the Government and the NHS for the pain and anguish caused to so many patients and their families by the appalling standards of care at Stafford Hospital and for the failures highlighted in this report.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09031886000060"></a>I will set out the actions that we will take in response to this report during my Statement, but I want to begin by summarising the events that lead to the Healthcare Commission&#146;s investigation. The commission became aware of high mortality rates for specific conditions or operations at this trust during the summer of 2007, through its routine analysis and statistics known as hospital standardised mortality ratios, or SMRs, produced by the Dr Foster research unit, based at Imperial College.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09031886000061"></a>Whenever the Healthcare Commission is alerted to unusually high mortality rates, it initially asks the trust to provide further information to explain such anomalies. High standardised mortality ratios are not necessarily an indicator of poor clinical performance, nor do they signify that there have been avoidable deaths, but they do act as a screening tool to identify the need for investigation.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09031886000062"></a>Further analysis showed that there were consistently high mortality rates for patients admitted as emergencies going back several years. The trust repeatedly dismissed  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_234"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 234</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the significance of these statistics, saying that they could be explained by the problem that it was having with the recording of data. The accuracy of information coding&#151;that is, the system for cataloguing types of surgical and other interventions&#151;had historically been poor in the trust and the internal group that the trust itself had set up to consider high mortality rates assumed that they could be explained by coding errors. The Healthcare Commission refused to accept this explanation and launched a full-scale investigation in March 2008.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09031886000063"></a>In May of that year, following its first visit, the commission asked to see the chief executive and set out its immediate concerns about poor patient care and inadequate staffing levels. Since then there has been gradual improvement. The Healthcare Commission states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09031886000282"></a>&#145;the Trust deserves credit for progress on infection control and for responding positively to the concerns of the Commission&#146;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031886000064"></a>On an unannounced visit in February to the accident and emergency department the Healthcare Commission noted significant improvements. Its visit raised no immediate concerns about the safety of patients admitted to the accident and emergency department. However, the failures are stark and they occurred over a substantial period of time.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09031886000065"></a>Patients will want to be absolutely certain that the quality of care at Stafford Hospital has been radically transformed and in particular that urgent and emergency care is administered safely. I have today, jointly with Monitor, asked Professor Sir George Alberti, the eminent physician and national clinical director for urgent and emergency care, to lead an independent review of the trust&#146;s procedures for emergency admissions and treatment and its progress against the recommendations in the report. He will report in five weeks&#146; time and his findings will be published to the House.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09031886000066"></a>The Healthcare Commission has told me that it is confident that Stafford Hospital is an isolated case and that, having looked at other trusts with similarly high standardised mortality ratios, it is reassured that a similar succession of serious lapses in care has not occurred elsewhere.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09031886000067"></a>The National Quality Board has been set up to look at how organisations work effectively together in patients&#146; best interests. It is composed of representatives of the royal colleges, patient groups, regulatory bodies and clinical experts. I have asked the board to look at how we can ensure that any early signs that something is going wrong are picked up immediately, that the right organisations are alerted and that action is taken quickly.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09031886000068"></a>The public and the House will want to know how the problems at Mid Staffordshire could have remained undetected for so long. One of the reasons why the Healthcare Commission began its investigation was that, after having initially been alerted to problems in the trust, it became clear that there had been serious failings for some time. The Healthcare Commission&#146;s report raises serious concerns about why the primary care trusts and the strategic health authority either failed to spot the problems at the trust or, having spotted them, failed to act.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09031886000069"></a>I have asked Dr David Colin-Thom&#233;, the national clinical director for primary care, to review the circumstances surrounding Mid Staffordshire trust prior to the Healthcare Commission&#146;s investigation to learn lessons about how the primary care trusts and the strategic health authority&#151;within the commissioning and performance management system that they operate&#151;failed to expose what was happening in this hospital. His recommendations will focus on what commissioners across England&#151;GPs and PCTs&#151;can learn from this case to be sure that they are advocating effectively on patients&#146; behalf.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09031886000070"></a>Our principal concern today must be to reassure the families and friends of patients who have died at Stafford Hospital that they will be able to ascertain whether any of the failings detailed in the Healthcare Commission&#146;s report contributed in any way to the death of their loved ones. As the Healthcare Commission has said, it is not possible to determine conclusively from any set of statistics whether there were any unavoidable deaths due to poor standards of care. That can be done only through a case notes review. I can confirm that the new leadership of the trust will respond to every request from those relatives and carry out an independent review of their case notes to determine whether or not the care that they or their loved ones received was appropriate.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09031886000071"></a>The failings at Stafford hospital are inexcusable. I hope that we can close this chapter in the hospital&#146;s history by acknowledging and addressing past failings and by ensuring that lessons are learnt by government and the NHS at all levels to make sure that these terrible failures are never allowed to happen again&#148;.</p>

The report published by the Healthcare Commission makes truly appalling reading. This is a trust where failure was not sporadic or of short duration, but systemic and long term. The list of failings could not be more damning: chronic understaffing, patients starved and neglected on the wards, a lack of basic staff training, poor record keeping, equipment that did not work, an inexcusable lack of professionalism in A&amp;E and, perhaps most concerning of all, a steadfast refusal to take seriously the complaints and worries of patients and their families. &#147;Quality of care&#148; in these hospitals was a phrase with little substantive meaning.</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09031886000073"></a>None of us can feel anything but shame that such a hospital could operate like this in the NHS for so long and, furthermore, that it should be a foundation trust. We need to have confidence now that the right questions will be asked of the right people and that the right lessons will be learnt. The Statement pertinently asks what on earth the strategic health authority and the local PCT think that they have been doing all this time. What kind of performance management has the strategic health authority been engaged in and why does a PCT, if it pretends to be on the ball, continue to commission emergency care services from a trust whose standards of performance, even at an anecdotal level, should have raised serious question marks?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09031886000074"></a>I do not want to personalise this debate, but the chief executive of the strategic health authority, Cynthia Bower, has been appointed as chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, the new health and social care watchdog. Ms Bower allowed herself to be deceived into thinking that the anomalies emerging from the mortality statistics were the results of coding errors, not anything more sinister. How and why did that happen?</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09031886000075"></a>Looking forward, is the Minister confident that the process of registering NHS providers by the Care Quality Commission will be sufficiently rigorous, bearing in mind that registration will depend on the quality of care being delivered in a given organisation? Will the new system of quality accounts ensure that failings in basic care, such as those at Stafford, are recognised and dealt with in a timely way?</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09031886000076"></a>Those questions remind us that the point of debating a Statement of this kind is not only to talk about a particular NHS trust, but also to look at its implications for public policy more widely. Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust became a foundation trust only last year, yet well before that, in 2007, serious concerns were voiced about mortality rates in the trust. At what point did the Secretary of State become aware of these concerns? Why was the trust allowed to acquire foundation status in the face of an impending investigation by the Healthcare Commission? What questions were asked at that time about the quality of the senior management in the trust? Did Monitor ask those questions before ratifying the trust&#146;s new status?</p>

<a name="90318-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09031886000077"></a>When the Healthcare Commission wrote to the chief executive at Stafford on 23 May last year requiring urgent action, what did Monitor do about it? The report shows that this was not a case of a corner being turned as soon as the commission flagged up the trust&#146;s shortcomings; as late as September of last year, the commission says that it found,</p>
<ul><a name="09031886000283"></a>&#147;unacceptable examples of assessment and management of patients&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031886000248"></a>The individuals leading the trust may well have taken some action, but essentially they were in denial. Even when the chief executive resigned a fortnight ago, he said that he was proud of what had been achieved and that it was his decision to leave. Why was it his decision? Did no one ever consider removing and replacing the senior management at an earlier stage? There was no intervention of this kind by anyone. Why not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09031886000078"></a>Is the Minister prepared to acknowledge that the Government bear some responsibility for this chapter of failures? We have seen in the NHS in the past few years a constant round of organisational change and a dogged obsession with narrow process-related targets. Stoke Mandeville, Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells and now Stafford were all hospitals that were directed towards goals other than good patient care: meeting waiting-time targets, managing organisational change and avoiding overspending their budgets. The Healthcare Commission said, about a year ago:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="09031886000268"></a>&#147;A common trend has been trust boards concentrating on some of their activities, such as the delivery of targets or mergers, at the expense of others&#148;.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="09031886000269"></a>&#147;We have found that the boards of NHS trusts we have investigated are particularly vulnerable to being consumed by the business of healthcare, in the form of mergers, reconfiguration of services, financial deficits, and targets&#148;.</p>

<a name="90318-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09031886000082"></a>The reductions in expenditure that the hospital had to achieve in order to become a foundation trust must have led directly to underqualified staff being employed and corners being cut. Will the Minister comment fully on what the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said about the target culture in the National Health Service? Anyone who still works in the health service will say that this has corrupted the workings of the service. If there is no slack, people cannot work properly in a caring profession; they cannot give patients the time that they need. Targets have brought about this situation.</p>

Finally, will she reassure the House that the chief executive of Stafford Hospital has not been given a golden handshake and moved off to an equally lucrative post somewhere else in the health service?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09031886000085"></a>I will work my way through the points raised by the noble Earl. It is very legitimate to ask what the SHA and PCTs were doing during this period, and why they failed. We know that boards are accountable for ensuring that their PCTs and the regulator hold them to account. In this case, there are undoubtedly lessons to be learnt  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_238"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 238</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about why the commissioning process did not adequately draw attention to failures in the care that was being provided. They are also accountable to the regulator, whose alert system will be triggered by the investigation.</p>

<a name="90318-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09031886000086"></a>There is no doubt that there are lessons to be learnt about why the commissioning process did not adequately draw attention to the failures of care that was provided. That is why we have asked David Colin-Thome to review the circumstances in mid-Staffordshire prior to the Healthcare Commission&#146;s investigation, to learn the lessons about how the primary care trust failed to detect and prevent the failures. He has been asked to do this rapidly and he will publish his findings within a month. His recommendations will focus on what the commissioners in England should learn from this.</p>

<a name="90318-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09031886000087"></a>On a broader level, a substantial World Class Commissioning programme is under way to help commissioners to hold their acute providers to account for the outcomes that they deliver to their patients. The Healthcare Commission acknowledges that the SHA was not aware of the concerns about the quality of services provided by the trust before the Dr Foster Unit published its report in 2007. However, we know that as soon as the SHA became aware of the high HSMRs, it commissioned the University of Birmingham to undertake research into the findings on these in advance of the Healthcare Commission&#146;s investigation. At that stage, the trust was focusing more on the data issues than on the poor quality of care. There will undoubtedly be lessons for the PCT&#146;s performance managers to learn in ensuring that boards are held to account for monitoring the information needed to safeguard the quality of services provided to patients. That is part of the brief for David Colin-Thome&#146;s review.</p>

<a name="90318-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09031886000088"></a>The report asked a legitimate question about how the trust was awarded foundation status in the middle of this investigation. Perhaps I may explain the timeline. The Secretary of State supported Mid Staffordshire in proceeding to the Monitor assessment in June 2007, and it was authorised as a foundation trust by Monitor on 1 February 2008. Monitor examined the quality of safety, including the HSMR issues. The concerns at Mid Staffordshire were not known when the trust was authorised as a foundation trust, and Monitor based its judgment on the best information available at the time. I have already said that there had been a trigger in relation to those figures because they were being investigated as part of data collection, rather than as part of a failure of service to patients.</p>

<a name="90318-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09031886000089"></a>Monitor would not have authorised a trust in the midst of a Healthcare Commission investigation or if it had been aware of, or had serious concerns about, the quality of safety issues. The trust was authorised in the usual way. We have a clear process that works. Ministers approved this in the normal way. Again, we would never have supported an application had there been any indication that there were serious concerns or that a Healthcare Commission investigation was under way.</p>

<a name="90318-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09031886000090"></a>I repeat that the issues at Mid Staffordshire were not known when the trust was authorised as a foundation trust. Monitor based its judgments on the best available evidence. It would not have authorised foundation

However, as part of their reaction to this report, Monitor and the Secretary of State have said that they will be reviewing the communication links between the department, which includes the Secretary of State&#146;s office and the Ministers responsible for agreeing that foundation trust status should go ahead, the Healthcare Commission and Monitor to ensure that communications are as good as they can be when considering foundation status.</p>

<a name="90318-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09031886000091"></a>With regard to what is being done to improve the quality of safety, the noble Earl and the noble Baroness were right to point to the work of my noble friend Lord Darzi and his quality matrix review. Indeed, in the past few weeks we have spent quite some time discussing exactly how the setting of national standards will work at each level and how they will roll down to a local level. If we recall our previous discussions about how those quality standards would work at a local level, there is absolutely no doubt that they would catch this type of issue. They would take on board such things as complaints from patients. It is reprehensible that this trust did not discuss its patients&#146; complaints; that is disgraceful.</p>

<a name="90318-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09031886000092"></a>We do not see a trade-off between targets and quality. It is important to remember that the NHS had no targets in the 1980s and 1990s, and hundreds of thousands of people were on waiting lists. People were kept waiting in accident and emergency for 18 hours. But from the centre we have managed to turn that round by setting targets. We must remember that that has been achieved through the remarkable efforts of exceptional people who work on the front line within the NHS. The vast majority of healthcare establishments have met their targets and continue to do so day in and day out.</p>

<a name="90318-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09031886000093"></a>The next stage review <I>High Quality Care for All, </I>launched by my noble friend Lord Darzi, suggests that there will be no new targets. Until now, every NHS organisation across the country has had targets that have been achieved. We are now turning our attention, rightly, to ensure quality. This report has pointed out to us that there is a great deal more to do.</p>

That happens every day in my trust and others. The benefit of all the trusts meeting the targets is that they have better healthcare. It is evident that

May I ask not only that the failings of management, the strategic health authority and local primary care trust be examined by Sir George Alberti, but what on earth was happening to the senior medical and nursing staff in this hospital, who must have been aware of the problems that led to this appalling report?</p>

That is why the chief executive and the chair of the trust stood down on 3 March. On the good side, in terms of improving the performance of this hospital, this issue was undoubtedly due to a failure of management and understaffing. There is an action plan and increased investment in new staff. For example, there are now 12 matrons instead of three, the number of nurses has been increased significantly, the number of middle-grade doctors has been increased, as has the number of consultants, and 14 more housekeepers have been recruited. It is on the right trajectory, which is our major concern. Can we be confident that the people of Stafford can attend this hospital? I think we can now say that that is the case.</p>

I make the point that when the Healthcare Commission visited the accident and emergency department of Stafford Hospital in May last year, it did not wait to write its report but immediately went to the chief executive of that hospital to outline its concerns and start remedial action to improve services to patients. This is not something that we have sat on, nor have we waited around for improvements. Saying that one will learn lessons when things go wrong is exactly the right thing to do.

The system is that a complaint is initially dealt with locally. If the complainer is not satisfied with the response he receives, the complaint then goes up the tree of the health service to be dealt with. That will work, by and large. The problem in this case was that the complaints being dealt with at local level were not being acknowledged and were not being taken as part of the planning process of clinical care within that hospital. That is part of the problem. I understand that the new leadership of the trust will look at the complaints that were made and how they were handled.

Does she further agree that, despite the criticism of targets, the four-hour target for A&amp;E admissions was widely welcomed by patients and has resulted in a substantial reduction in waiting times?

To conclude on the clinical guidance governance on applications from trusts, it currently looks at a raft of other areas. Among those are: a discussion with the board, relevant clinical governance sub-committees, a review of the processes, a report of clinical problems, a clinical audit plan and a review of action plans to address issues. It reviews performance data, targets and standards, along with trends, press coverage and complaints covering trend analysis and reporting, including a review of the data from surveys of patient services and staff surveys.</p>

I understand that both Monitor and the Healthcare Commission will be looking to make sure that they are more rigorous and that they communicate more obviously to ensure that these things happen in sequence. Better communication might have helped, although the evidence of the report will suggest that it would not necessarily have helped in this case.</p>

<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="09031886000121"></a><b><a name="90318-0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09031886000407"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My Lords, the legislation before us forms part of a long-standing debate on the regulation of UK party funding, and this is the context in which it must be considered. I think it is therefore worth briefly reminding noble Lords of the recent history which has informed the Bill&#146;s objectives and provisions, before turning to the detail of the Bill itself.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09031886000122"></a>In 1998, the Government asked the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#151;the CSPL&#151;chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Neill, who will, I am delighted to say, be speaking in this debate,</p>
<ul><a name="09031886000286"></a>&#147;to review issues in relation to the funding of political parties ... and make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031886000252"></a>The Committee&#146;s report recommended an overhaul of the system of party funding and expenditure based on tighter controls on spending; restrictions on who could make political donations in the United Kingdom; and greater transparency.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09031886000123"></a>These principles&#151;which I believe all parties continue to support today&#151;formed the basis of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which established the Electoral Commission and required parties to record and report to the commission donations above certain thresholds. These reforms were enacted in the spirit of consensus across the political spectrum and support from the public.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_245"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 245</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09031886000124"></a>Notwithstanding this, and the indisputable fact that the 2000 Act represented a significant step towards a more transparent and better regulated political system, it is now clear that it has not fully addressed all of the concerns which exist about the financing and expenditure of political parties. Where there has been agreement on what change is necessary, the Government have sought to take this forward. It was in this vein that we incorporated provision in the Electoral Administration Act 2006 to subject loans to parties and other donees to the same disclosure and permissibility rules as donations.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09031886000125"></a>In 2006, the Constitutional Affairs Committee recommended further reform to the system; and in 2007 the CSPL recommended changes to the governance and powers of the Electoral Commission. The recommendations of both committees attracted widespread support.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09031886000126"></a>In March 2006, Sir Hayden Phillips was appointed to carry out a general review of political party funding and expenditure in the United Kingdom. His final report, published in March 2007, found that there was significant pressure on parties to raise and to spend large amounts of money, and proposed a package of reforms designed to tackle its effects on the political system. His proposals had three main strands: first, tighter and more comprehensive spending controls; secondly, a cap on donations coupled with increased public funding to mitigate its effect on political parties; and, thirdly, a strengthening of the regulatory capacity of the Electoral Commission. However, subsequent inter-party talks designed to produce an agreement on the way forward were suspended in October 2007 on the basis that there was no prospect of a comprehensive agreement being reached.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09031886000127"></a>The Government are clear that any reforms in the area of party funding must attract broad consensus. Without that, they would lack legitimacy, and we would risk making these matters the focus of partisan dispute, which would be to no one&#146;s advantage. The Government regret that fundamental reform was not possible. We are also clear, however, that the absence of agreement on the model of long-term reform put forward by Sir Hayden should not prevent us taking what steps we can now&#151;that is, where there is broad party political agreement on them&#151;to make improvements to the system and, in the process, help to increase public confidence in politics and politicians.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09031886000128"></a>The Government&#146;s White Paper, <I>Party finance and expenditure in the United Kingdom</I>, published in June last year, therefore proposed some immediate steps in the areas where we believed that consensus existed. These measures formed the basis of the Political Parties and Elections Bill, as introduced last July in another place.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09031886000129"></a>The Bill before us today has evolved significantly from the Bill which had its Second Reading in another place. It has benefited from constructive engagement and scrutiny and, in its amended form, reflects the Government&#146;s commitment to moving forward on the basis of consensus and willingness to listen to representations from all those who place the health of

This is the spirit in which my right honourable friends guided the Bill through another place; I hope to do the same here.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09031886000130"></a>I turn to the provisions of the Bill. Clause 1 clarifies the Electoral Commission&#146;s regulatory role, in line with a recommendation of the CSPL. Clause 2 strengthens the commission&#146;s powers to compel the disclosure of information. It was the subject of detailed discussion in another place, and has been extensively amended to take account of the concerns expressed there about the extent of the powers in the clause as introduced.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09031886000131"></a>Clause 3 gives the commission access to a flexible range of civil sanctions, again following a CSPL recommendation. The range of sanctions and the safeguards to which they are subject very closely follow the scheme established by the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008. I should like it to be clear that none of the 93 offences and requirements currently in the 2000 Act will be removed from the criminal sphere by this Bill or by subsequent secondary legislation. This clause was also amended in another place to take account of concerns expressed there about how the commission might apply sanctions.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09031886000132"></a>Clauses 4 to 7 reform the Electoral Commission&#146;s governance arrangements so that it can benefit from commissioners and staff with more recent experience of politics. Here, again, we are implementing recommendations made by the CSPL.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09031886000133"></a>Clauses 4 and 5 will allow the appointment of four commissioners with recent political experience. Each of the three largest parties represented in another place will be entitled to make nominations for appointment as a nominated commissioner. Clause 5 originally required the nomination of two or more people by each party, but was amended at the request of the Speaker&#146;s Committee so that parties may nominate a single person. The remaining nominated commissioner will be selected by the Speaker&#146;s Committee from among the nominees of all other qualifying parties represented at Westminster. The recruitment and selection process for the appointment of electoral commissioners is ultimately a matter for the Speaker&#146;s Committee, and the Government have sought to ensure that the provisions in the Bill provide for a selection process which is acceptable to it.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09031886000134"></a>Clauses 6 and 7 increase the overall number of commissioners to nine or 10 to ensure that the nominated commissioners will be in a minority, and relax the restrictions that apply to political activities for other commissioners and Electoral Commission staff.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09031886000135"></a>Clauses 8 to 15 relate to political donations and expenditure. The House will be relieved that I do not intend to go through each of these in detail, but I shall touch briefly on those which have been amended significantly in another place.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09031886000136"></a>Clause 8 is intended to increase the transparency surrounding the true source of donations. It places a new responsibility on donors giving over &#163;7,500 to political parties and members&#146; associations, or over &#163;1,500 to party accounting units and holders of elective office, to declare whether they have received money or benefits with a value in excess of these thresholds,</p>
<ul><a name="09031886000287"></a>&#147;with a view to, or otherwise in connection with&#148;,</ul>

<p><a name="09031886000253"></a>the donation. The intention is to ensure that, when an individual or organisation may be making a donation as an agent for another, is made clear to the recipient of the donation, as the law already requires. The Government amended the thresholds at which donations must be accompanied by declarations in another place in response to concerns about the administrative burden which the new provision might place on parties.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09031886000137"></a>Clause 10 allows MPs and other office holders to appoint compliance officers to help them to fulfil the requirements of the 2000 Act in relation to reporting donations. The Government added this provision to the Bill in another place in response to representations received there. I stress that holders of elective office will remain liable for breaches of the law. Clause 12 was added to the Bill in another place to address concerns that there is less transparency of donations from unincorporated associations than those from other types of donors. It requires unincorporated associations, giving donations to regulated donees in excess of the recordable thresholds in the 2000 Act, and which in total amount to more than &#163;25,000 in a calendar year, to provide information about the source of significant gifts which have been made to them during a three-year period.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09031886000138"></a>Clause 13 increases the threshold in the 2000 Act for recording donations from &#163;200 to &#163;500; the threshold at which individual donees and party accounting units must report donations to the Electoral Commission to &#163;1,500; and the threshold at which national parties must report donations from &#163;5,000 to &#163;7,500.</p>

The problem with keeping it too low is that it adds huge bureaucracy for all the parties in having to deal with donations of those amounts.

<a name="09031886000144"></a><b><a name="90318-0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09031886000413"></a>Lord Bach:</b> My Lords, as I understand it, the commission suggested that the figure of &#163;200 was too low. Later today I shall come back to the noble Lord and, if I am wrong, I shall withdraw what I said about the commission. As I understand it, that is what it said. It may not approve of the actual figure but it wanted an increase, and it seems to us common sense that there should be an increase.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09031886000145"></a>The Government brought forward these provisions as amendments in another place to address concerns shared across the House that the current thresholds imposed a high burden of compliance that was not proportionate to the benefits. As my right honourable friends made clear in another place, while we are committed to transparency, this must not be achieved at the cost of overburdening political parties; and we have agreed to consider whether the reporting threshold for individual donees and party accounting units should be further raised.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09031886000146"></a>Clause 14 introduces more effective controls on candidate spending in certain parliamentary general elections. The Bill originally proposed a spending limit that would regulate all spending for the purposes of a candidate&#146;s election, including that used before he or she is formally defined as a candidate. Debate on this provision during Public Bill Committee in another place was curtailed: but it was clear that the measure did not enjoy the support of opposition parties. I know that my honourable friends were disappointed that they had not been able to secure agreement to that proposal. Nevertheless, in the spirit of consensus, they listened to the views put forward by honourable Members and tabled the group of amendments which is now Clause 14.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09031886000147"></a>Under current legislation, an individual generally becomes formally regarded as a candidate only at the point of dissolution of Parliament, with the result that expenditure by candidates on their expenses is currently regulated only from dissolution onwards. Having accepted that the earlier triggering proposal did not command consensus, Clause 14 introduces a second regulated period for candidate expenditure. This second limit would regulate candidate election expenditure during the period after 55 months of a Parliament have elapsed and before the date on which an individual formally becomes a candidate. At that point, the new limit would come to an end and the existing candidate expenditure limit would take over to regulate candidate spending from that point onwards. The Government are aware that Clause 14 does not represent an ideal solution&#151;it may well be that no ideal exists. It will not tackle the problem of unregulated, pre-dissolution expenditure for shorter Parliaments. It will, however, improve the current system of regulation and does, we believe, command cross-party support.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09031886000148"></a>The final group of clauses in the Bill, Clauses 16 to 23, relates to elections and electoral registration. With the exception of Clauses 22 and 23, these provisions are relatively straightforward and I will not go into detail now. Clauses 22 and 23 make provision for the piloting of data-matching schemes which will allow electoral registration officers to receive data from public authorities for the purposes of improving the comprehensiveness and accuracy of their registers.  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_249"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 249</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The pilots, which will be evaluated by the Electoral Commission, will help us to identify what data and what data-matching techniques are most useful for maintaining electoral registers.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09031886000149"></a>As my right honourable friend Michael Wills made clear when he introduced these clauses in another place, the Government are entirely clear that any data matching must be carefully scrutinised and controlled. The clauses contain a number of safeguards: data must be relevant to electoral registration and can be used only for the purposes specified; public authorities providing data will be consulted on the release of information and proper safeguards will be put in place to ensure compliance with the Data Protection Act; and any order putting in place a data-matching scheme must be debated and approved by this House and another place, and can be made only following consultation with the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner. We have sought the views of the Information Commissioner who has indicated that the measures seem proportionate and sensible in view of the strong public interest in ensuring that the register is as comprehensive as possible.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09031886000150"></a>Noble Lords who followed the debate on these clauses in another place will know that they form only one part of a much wider package of reforms. My right honourable friend Michael Wills outlined the significant steps that the Government have already taken, and continue to take, to improve the electoral register; and announced that the Government would be bringing forward amendments in this House to facilitate the move to individual registration in Great Britain on a fixed timetable; but that timetable will have at its heart the twin principles of the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the register. These principles were welcomed and accepted by all sides in another place and I hope that they will be similarly supported here. As they will be a significant feature of the debates on the Bill in this House, I should like to say a little about the Government&#146;s intentions now.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09031886000151"></a>In summary, the Government will bring forward amendments to put in place a statutory timetable for the introduction of individual registration; to begin the rollout of measures to prepare both the public and the electoral system for that change; and to put in place a series of tests that will be independently assessed by the Electoral Commission to ensure that the shift is made only once the system is ready for it. We intend to bring forward amendments which will make provision for electoral registration officers to collect personal identifiers from electors on a voluntary basis alongside the existing process of household registration from August 2010 until August 2015. At this point, and subject to certain tests which I will come on to, the provision of identifiers would become compulsory and household registration would effectively end. The period of overlap between the two systems would allow the Electoral Commission to work with EROs to identify any issues that are likely to arise from the move to individual registration, including what identifiers are most appropriate and which groups may have difficulty providing them.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_250"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 250</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09031886000152"></a>From autumn 2015, all new registrations would have to provide the identifiers to be put on to the register. Anyone already on the register in autumn 2015 who did not provide their identifiers would be carried forward for two further years, to 2017. From that point, we would have full individual registration; that is, everyone on the register would have provided identifiers. However, we also intend to provide that that shift in 2015 would proceed only if two statutory tests, which would be assessed by the Electoral Commission no earlier than January 2014, were met.</p>

<p><a name="st_95"></a>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09031886000155"></a>The Commission would have to have a reasonable expectation that the move to compulsory provision of identifiers would, first, not compromise the accuracy or comprehensiveness of the register by the point of full individual registration in 2017; and, secondly, that the electoral register was both as comprehensive and as accurate as was reasonably practicable, and that the effectiveness of the registration system was improving across Great Britain, as supported by performance standards data and other measures.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09031886000156"></a>If the commission concluded that the tests were met, it could recommend that the shift to full individual registration should proceed, subject only to a vote by Parliament on whether to accept its recommendation. If the commission recommended against, or Parliament did not endorse a positive recommendation, the shift to compulsory provision of identifiers would not proceed. I am sure that the House will agree that this represents an historic change, and one which is vital to the health of our democracy. Such a change should be not be undertaken lightly; I hope that I have demonstrated that the Government are committed to ensuring that the move to individual registration will take place at the right pace and subject to a number of safeguards and tests along the way.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09031886000157"></a>Of course, the proof of the commitment will be in the detail of the amendments which we bring forward and, notwithstanding the time it will take to ensure that these necessarily difficult and complex amendments will be technically effective, I hope to be in a position to share and discuss them, and any other government amendments which we judge necessary, with noble Lords before the substantive debates. As in the other place, the Government&#146;s key priority is that this legislation should reflect a broad consensus on the way forward. We are committed to taking this Bill through this House on the basis of agreement and I look forward to working with noble Lords to that end. I beg to move.</p>

My starting point is that the party political process in this country is something that we have nothing to be  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_251"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 251</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ashamed about. It is a system that has secured the orderly transition of power, determined by the people of this country. Political parties are the glue that holds the political system together. They are the means by which legislators communicate with the electors, and the means by which the electorate is given a choice of competing visions of Britain&#146;s future and alternative teams of political leaders.</p>

<a name="90318-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09031886000159"></a>Moreover, political parties are made up of hundreds and thousands of dedicated volunteers, who canvass in all weathers, and leaflet and fundraise in all circumstances in, and very much for, their local communities. In many constituencies the political parties are the largest voluntary organisations outside of churches in membership and, certainly, in terms of work in the community. This is a tradition of which we can rightly be proud. It is also a vital part of the social capital of this country, which we wish to retain and develop.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09031886000160"></a>On donors to political parties, we should regard as laudable the fact that organisations and individuals are free to make properly disclosed donations to political parties with which they share aims and aspirations; or in order legitimately to minimise the risk of another party attaining power. People donate to charities and religious organisations and we call it philanthropy, derived from Greek and meaning &#147;love of people&#148;. Yet somehow, when people donate to party political organisations, which are part of the fabric of our society, they are termed &#147;lovers of power&#148;. This cannot be true and is unfair. People who make properly disclosed donations to a party are very much strengthening, not weakening, the fabric of our democracy. We ought to defend them.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09031886000161"></a>Our political system is one to be proud of. All those involved in making the machinery work are rightly deserving of praise. Nevertheless, many of these people are being let down. There is a serious problem and it impacts on the legitimacy of our political process. The Bill is, therefore, of the utmost necessity and we welcome it. We welcome it to this place, on this day and in this form slightly more than we welcomed it in the other place when it was introduced in October. There have certainly been many concessions that we welcome, and which the Minister has outlined to us this afternoon.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09031886000162"></a>We need to remember that this political process has been under way for some time. The Bill is welcome. It is of the utmost necessity and we only want to move it further and faster. It is necessary because of a series of high profile cases, such as the &#147;loans for honours&#148; inquiry, in which, for the first time in history, a serving Prime Minister was interviewed three times by the police. For the record, in this case no prosecution resulted from that. I do not want to be too partisan in making this point because the Liberal Democrats have also had problems, in accepting a donation for &#163;2.4 million from a convicted fraudster, Michael Brown. Again, for the record, the Electoral Commission found that the party had been reasonable in regarding it as a seemingly extremely generous donation, though one that has still not been repaid.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09031886000163"></a>For these purposes, a White Paper was produced and the Lord Chancellor, Jack Straw, used a key phrase in the foreword:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09031886000270"></a>&#147;When political parties are brought into disrepute, the reputation of the entire political process is tarnished. It is therefore important  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_252"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 252</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that action is taken to strengthen and sustain the standing of political parties within the political process in the eyes of the British public&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031886000164"></a>That is why the Bill is both urgent and necessary. We should not limit the examination of weaknesses in the electoral system to the issue of party political funding alone. Whatever the ambiguities about the rules governing cases of donations, there is no ambiguity about one thing. In the last seven years there have been 42&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="09031886000165"></a><b><a name="90318-0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031886000417"></a>Lord Clinton-Davis:</b> My Lords, is the noble Lord not being unduly optimistic about the contribution made by members of all parties? I think it has declined, and we all ought to be worried about that. Does he agree?</p>

<a name="09031886000166"></a><b><a name="90318-0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09031886000418"></a>Lord Bates:</b> My Lords, I share the concern&#151;it is shared on all sides of the House&#151;that participation in all voluntary organisations in communities is declining. Our communities are the weaker for it. We would certainly want to see all measures in this legislation enhance the prospect of people taking part in party political activity up and down the country. I will come to that in a little more detail later on.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09031886000167"></a>Wherever the ambiguities may be about the funding of political parties and party political donations, there is certainly no ambiguity about the fact that, over the past seven years, there have been 42 convictions for electoral fraud in the United Kingdom and only one of the 43 authorities in England and Wales has had no case to investigate. The Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly's monitoring committee commented that there are,</p>
<ul><a name="09031886000289"></a>&#147;vulnerabilities in the system which should urgently be addressed".</ul>
<p><a name="09031886000255"></a>The Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust stated in its report of April 2008 that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09031886000271"></a>&#147;There is widespread, and justifiable, concern about both the comprehensiveness and the accuracy of the UK&#146;s electoral registers&#151;the poor state of the registers potentially compromises the integrity of the ballot&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031886000256"></a>We take that extremely seriously. This proves that it is not so much the risk of serious fraud at the ballot box that we are talking about. It is happening, and change is urgently required to tackle this aspect of the legitimacy of the process as soon as possible. Furthermore, this opportunity for fraud was significantly increased by the extension of postal voting, as was again found by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust report, which said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09031886000272"></a>&#147;Public confidence in the electoral process in the UK was the lowest in Western Europe in 1997, and has almost certainly declined further as a result of the extension of postal voting&#148;.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09031886000168"></a>As it stands, the Bill is therefore a missed opportunity. It was going to be a calamitous missed opportunity to tackle this important issue but, on Report, just before Third Reading in the other place, the Government finally conceded that they would bring forward proposals for individual voter registration, as the experts have long been calling for. However, it was rushed through at that stage. Many Members of the other place would have preferred that this concession was given in Committee so that it could have been scrutinised by them. So we will be looking to the Minister to provide some assurances and much more detail than we have so far received about how this will operate in practice. What we have been offered so far by the Government is an incomplete system that will not be introduced in a mandatory way  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_253"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 253</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>until 2015. It will not exclude people already on the electoral role, and it will therefore be 2017&#151;possibly two general elections&#146; time&#151;before we can again have confidence in the veracity of the register. As the Minister has told us today, personal identifiers will be introduced, but only on a voluntary basis. Can that deliver the confidence that we seek?</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09031886000169"></a>All of this is happening while this system has been successfully introduced as a pilot in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office published <I>Electoral Registration in Northern Ireland</I>, which said that voter registration had been central to enhancing the accuracy of confidence in the electoral register. That is the case made. We do not resent them for having it, but why can the people of Northern Ireland have it and why can it not be spread much quicker into the rest of the United Kingdom?</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09031886000170"></a>Finally, there are places where the Bill should be toughened and uncompromising. However, there are also areas, relating to local associations and committees having responsibility to appoint an effective compliance officer in order to identify the source of donations over &#163;500 on pain of criminal offence, which seem to us to go too strongly in the other direction, to the extent that they could discourage legitimate volunteers from taking on those places, or legitimate donors from making donations to the party. It is important to recognise that at a local level, the association, committee chairman or organisers are not qualified lawyers, they do not have access to the best city regulators and they do not have teams of accountants working for them. They are often working by themselves, late into the night and on a voluntary basis, and trying to follow the rules. It is very difficult for them, particularly when the rules change with such frequency.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09031886000171"></a>Therefore we propose two suggestions: first, that there ought to be a defence of innocent mistake; and secondly, that the threshold required for registration&#151;rather than being reduced from &#163;500 down to &#163;200, as was hinted at early on in this debate&#151;should actually be raised to &#163;1,000, to take in many more donations and potential donations, and to remove lots more bureaucracy from this. I understand that the Minister finds this slightly puzzling, but of course this particular element is all about trying to answer the problem which arose from the David Abrahams donations scandal, when it was alleged that donations of &#163;600,000 had been made to the Labour Party through a series of proxies. We understand that that is unacceptable, and that we need to restore confidence to the system. However, we feel currently that moving that threshold to a higher level would help with that, whilst doing nothing to diminish the prospect of catching the serious abuses, which is what we are looking for.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09031886000172"></a>I have spoken about some of the measures which we hope to see this Bill address as it goes through Committee. We feel that this Bill has been framed in such a way as to provide a missed opportunity for a long-term, sustainable settlement with regard to party donations from trade unions, companies and individuals. However, the Government&#146;s many concessions in another place mean that this Bill is now in a format that for the most part we welcome.</p>

I should also apologise at the outset on behalf of my noble friend Lady Hamwee, who will table some important amendments at a later stage on elections to the London Assembly, but who is unfortunately not able to be with us today.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09031886000174"></a>I have begun to realise that this House takes great notice of experience. I should put it on record that I am the veteran of 12 parliamentary and county elections, and I have perhaps also to recall that I won half of those, which is a better record than some of my colleagues on these Benches. Experience is important, and I note with interest that there are in the House a number of noble Lords who obviously will be able to contribute very substantially from that experience to our discussions on the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, has had perhaps less experience in that respect and that may explain why he started his speech with tones of comparative complacency about the state of British politics, which I do not share.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09031886000175"></a>It is rare that we are given the opportunity to improve not just one piece of legislation, but the public perception of our whole political system. We are going to have to use this Bill to take up that opportunity, even if the Government at present have failed to do so. After all, Minsters have trumpeted this as a great opportunity&#151;a great vehicle&#151; to take big money out of British politics and to increase the transparency of donations and spending from what remains. The Bill does not do that. It does not return political influence from the cheque book to the ballot box and it still places a cloak of secrecy around many large donations. In short, the Bill has gone through an elephantine period of gestation, but we have ended up with a mouse. It is a failure, and we in this House have a particular responsibility to turn it around and make it into a success.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09031886000176"></a>The public surely are demanding cleaner politics. The incidence of cash for peerages, loans for Lords, bungs for amendments: all these episodes have tarnished the reputation of Parliament, this House as well as the other House. However, these are merely symptoms of a much more insidious disease&#151;the reliance of the party system on big political donations. It is a rotten system. Contrary to popular perception, it places Britain in an even worse position than the United States. American election campaigns are expensive&#151;astonishingly expensive&#151;but they are also reliant on a broader base of funding. Donations are limited to $2,400 per election from individuals to any given candidate. Even the higher limits of $30,400 for donations to national party committees are much lower than the amounts now given to British political parties. Surely we should be aiming for our legislation to be at least as stringent as that in the United States.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09031886000177"></a>There are three ways in which we on these Benches think that politics can and should be purged of narrow special interests brought about by big donations and the sharp focus on a small number of marginal constituencies. The first&#151;no Liberal Democrat could come to a debate of this sort without referring to it&#151;is

We must have reform to ensure that every vote, everywhere, counts. The second is certainty about the timing of general elections, to make it absolutely clear when spending limits will begin. The third is an end to what is currently referred to so regularly as the party-funding arms race. We cannot use this Bill to do the first two but we can make real progress on the third. I trust that this House will take the lead in that respect.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09031886000178"></a>Surely we must adopt an all-embracing cap on the individual donations to political parties. If we do not, we will be in danger of slipping back to the worst, corrupt excesses of the 19th century when the wealthy could buy seats and political influence. Surely we must also give every constituency an equal spending limit regardless of its marginality, by dividing the national spending limit by the number of seats. If we really are to end the arms race in marginal seats, we have a duty to amend this legislation in such a way that it covers not only local spending to promote a candidate but national spending which has been used to promote his or her party in any given constituency.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09031886000179"></a>If billboards saying, &#147;Britain&#151;Forward not back&#148;, or, alternatively, &#147;Mum&#146;s eyes. Dad&#146;s nose. Gordon Brown&#146;s debt&#148;, are plastered all over a specific constituency, it should be attributed to the party&#146;s election expenses in that constituency, not just to the national limit. That principle was accepted at the end of the 19th century and surely it must apply now. I am quite willing to accept that if my right honourable friend Nick Clegg writes to a group of electors in a specific constituency, that expenditure must also be the responsibility of the local agent and recorded against the local limit.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09031886000180"></a>Some Members of your Lordships&#146; House have great experience in this and have been involved in constituency campaigning for many years. They will be only too well aware of the expenses limit on the specific candidate and his or her agent in that constituency and how important it is to observe those ceilings. However, if we do not make a real change to the Bill as it stands, we will be ripping up all the constraints and safeguards that have been in place ever since the 1883 Act. That would be a terrible retrograde step. We must also look again at the recording and reporting thresholds specified in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09031886000181"></a>There is a real danger that the Bill will allow a series of impermissible donations to be made from beyond these shores. The Electoral Commission itself draws attention to a real question mark by saying that the Bill as it stands,</p>
<ul><a name="09031886000290"></a>&#147;may encourage impermissible donors to seek to increase their influence on UK political parties, for instance by making regular donations just below &#163;500&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031886000257"></a>It would therefore seem to be possible for someone from Belize, for example, to contribute &#163;499 every day of the year without it being necessary to report it. That is absurd. Clause 13, by increasing this limit, is in fact a dangerously retrograde step.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09031886000182"></a>What is most extraordinary is that the Conservative Members in another place sought to increase the reporting limit still further. That is the point at which donations not only have to be verified as permissible but their source declared on the public record. The Conservative Members sought to increase the limit for  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_256"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 256</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reporting donations to &#163;3,000. That, surely, would be a backward step. What is more, I am confused by the position of the Conservative Party. I looked at <I>Hansard</I> for December 2007 when Conservative MPs were so exercised by the need to introduce an overall cap on donations that they called a special Opposition Day to debate their call for,</p>
<ul><a name="09031886000273"></a>&#147;a comprehensive package of reforms to restore public trust and to support a vibrant local democracy and voluntary activism, which must include an across-the-board cap&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031886000183"></a>Yet those same MPs considered the Bill on Report at the end of last year and were unable to support my honourable friend David Howarth&#146;s amendment to introduce such a cap, arguing that it was &#147;for another day&#148;. Why was it so essential to restore public confidence in 2007, but it is too early to do so in 2009?</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09031886000184"></a>I and my colleagues in both Houses believe that the Hayden Phillips proposals on party funding were well considered and we endorse them. We were bitterly disappointed when in the autumn of 2007 the other parties pulled the plug on the discussions, apparently in pursuit of their own special interests. However, we have a responsibility now to build on those proposals, not only to deal with the current crisis of confidence in our political system, but to make sure that we deal with it in a way that stands the test of time.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09031886000185"></a>The Phillips proposals to which the Minister referred dealt with, first, caps on donations and loans to national political parties; secondly, the introduction of sensible safeguards for individual union members&#146; political contributions; thirdly, spending ceilings for the whole Westminster electoral cycle; and fourthly, the suggestion of a broadly based scheme to encourage local campaigning with limited public funding. The Phillips package offers an essential starting point for discussing this Bill.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09031886000186"></a>Sadly, however, the Bill as it stands will certainly not achieve the changes on which all parties were originally agreed. We cannot use this Bill, obviously, to introduce the sanity of a fixed-term Parliament, much though that might be desirable, but we should at least amend the Bill to make sure that there is a level playing field on campaign finance for all elections, not just for the special circumstances of the present time. It is manifestly wrong at any time to legislate only for the existing situation in the full knowledge that this Parliament is likely to last 60-plus months. Very few Parliaments in recent years have gone beyond 48 months; in fact only two elections in the past 12 have gone full term. Imagine the free for all in those other 10 if there were no restrictions at all under this Bill.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09031886000187"></a>I was first elected in February 1974 and the next election was in October 1974. What would happen in those circumstances? We would not have got anywhere near the 55-month trigger point; it would have kicked in 48 months too late. The measures in the Bill will apply only when a tired old Government are desperately hanging on and not daring to face the electorate. That is surely absurd; that is making the rule for the exception rather than the generality. We must investigate ways in which the investment in campaigning for all general elections can be effectively monitored and limited.

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09031886000188"></a>Some Members of your Lordships&#146; House may recall that as long ago as 1992 Labour recognised this problem in its election manifesto. It summed up the problem in this way:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09031886000274"></a>&#147;Although an early election will sometimes be necessary, we will introduce as a general rule a fixed parliamentary term&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09031886000189"></a>Other issues will have to be dealt with. I give notice to the Minister that we will seek to remove Clause 17. This was based on a clause produced by a Conservative Back-Bencher, which managed to produce an extraordinary situation in the other place whereby there was a Division without the new clause being moved. I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the House of Commons <I>Official Report</I>, 2 March 2009, col. 678.</p>

We believe that the integrity of the register is crucial to the reputation of our whole electoral system. We do not believe that registering more people is in itself legitimate if it has to rely on fraudulent additions. I understand that the commission recommended the change in 2003. What has happened since then? The long process to which the noble Lord, Lord Bates, has just referred could have been well under way by now if the Government had listened to their own advisers. As we are threatened with an extraordinarily long transition period to 2017, beyond two elections, surely it is time to get on with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09031886000195"></a>In brief, it is extremely important that the Electoral Commission is now given the resources and powers to keep the difficult balance between ensuring the integrity of the political system and avoiding excessive burdens on volunteers. It is far from clear that the Government have recognised the nature of this dilemma. Meanwhile, we in this House should be under no illusion that the Bill offers us a rare opportunity, and therefore we should be absolutely clear that it is important to do it justice in order to make sure that we restore public confidence in our political system. As it stands, the Bill does not meet the clear concerns of the public, and we have a manifest duty to strengthen it.</p>

The noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord MacGregor, were also members. The other representative of a political party was the late lamented Lord Shore&#151;Peter Shore. They were the trio who represented the three parties. We produced the committee&#146;s fifth report, which, as the Minister said, was substantially accepted by the Government, went through and led to the Act of 2000.</p>

<a name="90318-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09031886000197"></a>I will pick up on certain themes and talk about them briefly. The first is individual registration, which was mentioned by the previous two speakers. As the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said, in 2003 the Electoral Commission advocated individual registration and said that it was essential. The commission put it on high ground; it said that it was a fundamental democratic right to register your own vote. We could argue about that, but that was the commission&#146;s position and it has been an important element in thinking about politics ever since. It is unfortunate that we in this House cannot, in this Second Reading debate, discuss the clauses that give effect to this idea. The Government said on Report in another place that they were bringing forward the clauses, as the Minister confirmed today. However, the process is very slow and the clauses are very late. I hope that we will not be in the position that I remember when a different Bill came from another place and one-third of it had not been debated there at all. Here we have an important part of the Bill that deserves consideration at Second Reading, but we have no specific clauses on which to focus. Having made that complaint and lament, I move on.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90318-0006.htm"/>


<a name="90318-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09031886000198"></a>In the literature on this subject, there has been much citation of the Northern Ireland experience, which it seems has been a success. There are two things to note. First, when the system first came in, there was an immediate fall of some 11 per cent in the number of registrations. Secondly, there was a requirement to register annually, which echoes the bit of paper that comes round with the rating list every autumn, giving the householder an opportunity to say who in the house is a voter. However, that was found to be unworkable because people became fed up with having to register annually. They asked, &#147;Why have I got to do this every year?&#148;, and so that was dropped. Therefore, one of the benefits of the household system&#151;the regularity&#151;was lost.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_259"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 259</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09031886000199"></a>The other point of interest is the general perception of the public. A survey&#151;the BMRB research report&#151;has recently been carried out for the current Committee on Standards in Public Life. I refer, without having it in front of me, to point 6.2 on page 63 of that report. Although quite a big majority of the people who answered the questionnaire&#151;something like 70 or 80 per cent&#151;said that they would favour a system of individual registration, they also said that it was likely that the number of registered voters would decline. That poses a real question, which has to be investigated.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09031886000200"></a>I believe that the effect of introducing the system here and how it would work are matters for evidence. We are not Northern Ireland; we have a different community and a different make-up. Would individual registration work in an acceptable way in all sections of the community in this country? That is a serious question, which needs to be thought about. Would all men and women register their names? Would that be in accordance with custom and ethics and so on? We cannot just take it for granted that the experience in Northern Ireland would apply throughout England.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09031886000201"></a>The other important question on which we require evidence is: what would it cost to set up this system? We have heard talk of bureaucracy. Will it involve a fair amount of bureaucracy and place burdens on local authorities? There was some mention of that at the meeting with the Electoral Commission that I attended the other day in this House; it was considered to need further thought. Therefore, I am saying that this is a serious matter and we need to have a proper debate about it. I suppose that it is impossible to reopen the Second Reading debate, but the clauses need to be considered very seriously in this House.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09031886000202"></a>My next point concerns what I call the insecurity of the postal system. I refer to the 11th report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has nothing to do with me&#151;it was produced years after I left. The report came out at the beginning of 2007 and is called <I>R</I><I>eview of </I><I>t</I><I>he Electoral Commission</I>. Chapter 5 has the heading, &#147;Integrity of the Electoral Process&#148;. The committee was worried about the effect of the postal voting that had taken place. I shall read out one or two brief excerpts from page 79 of the report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09031886000275"></a>&#147;The introduction of postal voting on demand without the need to present a reason for the application, has demonstrated the vulnerability of any trust-based electoral process&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031886000259"></a>The report goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09031886000276"></a>&#147;While it is clearly imperative for as many eligible individuals as possible to participate in the democratic process, we can no longer base our electoral system on trust alone if we wish to protect the integrity&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09031886000260"></a>of that system. Paragraph 5.8 states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09031886000291"></a>&#147;evidence received by the Committee suggests that since the introduction of postal voting on demand there has been a growing perception that the electoral system is more susceptible to organised electoral fraud&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031886000261"></a>A worrying feature that has accompanied postal voting is a change in public perception. In some areas of the country, fewer than 50 per cent of people thought that the system was safe. The report gives examples in table 5.1 on page 81 of some of the offences that have taken place between 2001 and 2006. There is no time to go into them all, but I shall cite some of them. In Hackney, there were hundreds of forged postal and proxy votes. In Havant in 2000, there were 22 forged  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_260"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 260</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>postal votes. In local elections in 2004, there was a large postal fraud in Oldham and 43 postal votes were tampered with in Stoke-on-Trent. As I said, the report gives various examples.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09031886000203"></a>People who write on this theme are concerned about fraud. I have the executive summary of a report that was commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust and came out last year, which also refers to this worry. It states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09031886000292"></a>&#147;cases tried since 2000 underline that the extension of postal voting clearly enhanced the vulnerability of UK elections to large-scale fraud. The likelihood of such fraud occurring could&#151;and should&#151;have been predicted on the basis of evidence of growing proxy vote fraud during the 1990s&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031886000262"></a>It goes on to refer to the Birmingham case and to other evidence of rigging and quotes the 2008 Council of Europe report, which has already been mentioned this afternoon. That report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09031886000277"></a>&#147;It does not take an experienced election observer, or election fraudster, to see that the combination of the household registration system without personal identifiers and the postal vote on demand arrangements make the election system in Great Britain very vulnerable to electoral fraud&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031886000263"></a>That was the pretty pungent criticism of three visitors from the Council of Europe who examined our system and thought that we had opened the way to fraud. It is a pity that no thought has been given to that in the Bill. It is one of its omissions.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09031886000204"></a>On a different point, the Bill provides that there should be four nominated commissioners. The scheme as regards one, two and three is easy to see&#151;each of the three major parties will nominate a commissioner. There is then room for another, as statutory provision says that there should be four commissioners. However, proposed new Section 3A is pretty woolly and hazy on who the fourth individual will be. It looks as if there might be a contest between various small parties that have managed to get two Members of Parliament elected. They might have a tussle on who gets the fourth place.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09031886000205"></a>Is this really worth doing? On the Committee on Standards in Public Life, we had, as I said, a member of each of the three major parties. They acted in an entirely neutral way and not as representatives of their parties in the slightest, but each of the three brought their experience of politics. We always knew that, when somebody started talking nonsense, somebody else would say, for example, &#147;It doesn&#146;t work like that in the House of Commons&#148;. We had the balance of that from three people and I raise the question of whether we need a fourth.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09031886000206"></a>My next point refers to the increase in the figures: &#163;200 going up to &#163;500, &#163;1,000 up to &#163;1,500 and &#163;5,000 up to &#163;7,500. That is not really what the Electoral Commission wanted. It certainly does not like the look of &#163;500, although maybe it was open to an increase in the &#163;200.</p>

The Electoral Commission did not recommend the increase as I thought it had. The decision to raise the amount was taken by the Government&#151;I can justify it at a later stage if I have to. The Electoral Commission did not suggest it and I was wrong to say that it did.</p>

I was not quite sure whether it would accept some increase, but my position is that I do not think that any of these figures should be increased. There is no justification for it. We talk about this leading to bureaucracy, but I do not see why it causes more bureaucracy to enter a small figure than to enter a large figure, and I do not think that it gives the public the right feeling in days when those with money are regarded with some suspicion.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09031886000209"></a>I shall put down my position on a point that has been touched on today: public funding. In the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#146;s fifth report, we went into public funding. At that stage, the Labour Party put in a written submission opposing it. One of its arguments was that public funding was not something that we ought to be looking at in times of financial stringency. Talk about financial stringency! Turn over a few pages of the scrapbook and get to 2009, and that is exactly what Mr Jack Straw said the other day in another place. He said that the public would not look with a kindly eye on public funding for Members of Parliament. That is completely correct, I think. If the issue comes up, we will probably have a debate about it when an amendment is moved.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09031886000210"></a>The final thing that I want to mention is a hobby-horse of mine. The Bill refers to civil sanctions to be given to the Electoral Commission. In substance, they are not civil at all, but completely criminal. They are fines imposed for committing an offence. They are a fixed monetary penalty, a variable monetary penalty and a non-compliance penalty, as set out on page 37. The standard of proof is the criminal standard&#151;it must be beyond reasonable doubt&#151;and what is being alleged is the commission of an offence. They are really criminal in nature. That is all that I have to say.</p>

<a name="09031886000211"></a><b><a name="90318-0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09031886000427"></a>Baroness Gould of Potternewton:</b> My Lords, in welcoming the Bill, I must declare an interest as chair of the HS Chapman Society, an organisation that brings together from all parties high-level experts on election procedures, regulations and practices to examine and make proposals to maintain the integrity of all aspects of our electoral process. I welcome the Bill because it puts right many of the weaknesses and omissions of the 2000 Act. I have suggested the need for an Electoral Commission since 1991, after listening to the views of the Association of Electoral Administrators, which believed that many aspects of the electoral process at that time were insufficiently rigorous and in many cases little more than ad hoc. The establishment of the Electoral Commission was a milestone, but its remit in the 2000 Act was too wide and lacked sufficient regulatory control.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09031886000212"></a>Last year, the HS Chapman Society held a seminar to consider the recommendations on the future role of the Electoral Commission proposed in the Eleventh Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life and to hear the response of the Electoral Commission. That report stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="09031886000278"></a>&#147;An effective Electoral Commission is a necessary and vital part of the modern institutional architecture. Its core duties should be as a regulator to ensure integrity and public confidence in the electoral process and in the framework that governs the political party funding and campaign expenditure&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_262"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 262</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09031886000264"></a>I believe that the regulatory proposals in Clause 1, based as they are on those principles, will enable the Electoral Commission to be a proactive regulator of party funding with stronger control over electoral administration. However, this has to be accompanied by full implementation of the sanctions outlined in the Bill, which I believe will be adequate when we get the proposed amendments that will recast the current criminal offences into ones based on compliance models and fines.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09031886000213"></a>The 2000 Act placed too great a burden on political parties and particularly on voluntary treasurers. The sanctions proposed will ease that burden by enabling the Electoral Commission to respond to breaches in a more proportionate and flexible way. Offences will be those committed without reasonable excuse, while those who have honestly made a mistake in reporting incomplete donation returns will be treated fairly. The training by the Electoral Commission of treasurers on compliance with the law should also ease that position.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09031886000214"></a>The original writing of the Bill went too far in allowing the Electoral Commission to have powers to search donors&#146; premises. The provisions finally arrived at will protect both the donor and the commission by making it the decision of a judge, based on a reasoned request from the commission, that any relevant document should be released, and only on further refusal would the police be able to carry out a search. This gives the donor every reasonable opportunity to comply.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09031886000215"></a>I come now to what was previously a controversial subject when we discussed the 2000 Act: allowing some commissioners to have direct political experience, as in Clauses 4 and 5. As noble Lords will recall, in the debate on the 2000 Act all sides of your Lordships&#146; House felt that it was wrong for there to be no direct political experience on the commission. As the Lord Chancellor said in the other place when introducing the Bill:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09031886000279"></a>&#147;With hindsight ... that was an error&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/10/08; col. 46.]</p>

<p><a name="09031886000265"></a>It will be of immense value to the commission to have four commissioners directly nominated by, but not representative of, the political parties in the Commons. It is important that the Speaker&#146;s Committee, which will confirm the appointments, ensures that there is absolute transparency in the making of those appointments, not least in how the fourth commissioner from the qualifying small parties will be determined.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09031886000216"></a>The reduction of the restriction on involvement in political activity from 10 years to five years for all commissioners will provide a layer of experience that has been missing. The same principle applies in respect of the staff by reducing the current prohibition on employment from 10 years to one year, except for the post of chief executive, which is reduced to five years. In no way am I suggesting that the staff cannot be impartial, but I understand the desire of the commission for some flexibility so that, if necessary, it can apply to the Speaker&#146;s Committee for the five-year ban to be applied also to a small number of other posts, particularly to someone who might be acting on behalf of the chief executive.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09031886000217"></a>I fully appreciate how difficult it has been to arrive at the necessary consensus on candidate spending limits but, without doubt, it was an unintended  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_263"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 263</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consequence of the 2000 Act that, in seeking to establish a clear definition of when someone has become a candidate, it seriously weakened controls on candidate spending. This has caused a dramatic increase in targeted spending by candidates. As outlined by my noble friend, Clause 14 removes the original triggering proposals from the Bill and replaces them with new controls on candidate spending at those Westminster parliamentary elections held more than 55 months after a Parliament first met. That is four and a half years, and I have some questions about that period. The proposal has the benefit of clearly defining when time controls will be in place.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09031886000218"></a>I have been advocating since I was a party official that we ought to have fixed-term Parliaments, but this is not the Bill to deal with that position. However, I have some concern about the situation for shorter-term Parliaments. Having looked at the detailed explanation of the candidate spending amendment, I urge that the Electoral Commission, in its guidance to parties, spells it out in simple terms, with clear examples for each of the different outcomes depending on when an election is held. I found it more than a little complicated and felt that I ought to sit down with a pencil and paper and work it out. I am sure that voluntary party members will feel the same. It is important that it is spelt out clearly.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09031886000219"></a>The new average limit of &#163;30,000 per seat seems sensible. When I first became an agent we thought &#163;2,500 was an enormous amount to spend. I therefore find &#163;30,000 difficult to imagine, but I am sure it is right.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09031886000220"></a>As my noble friend said, the increased reporting thresholds for donations should alleviate the compliance burden on political parties, which we also have to take into account. Importantly, the Bill clarifies the position on unincorporated associations and will increase the transparency surrounding large political donations. This will close the loophole which has allowed a breach of the principles of the 2000 Act and which currently allows wealthy donors to make anonymous donations to political parties above the amount which has to be reported. Actions like those also cause concern among the public, while we have to look seriously at the issue of foreign donations; I look forward to seeing whether that comes up in Committee. Having read Clause 10, about the compliance officers, I have one query for my noble friend. Could he clarify a little better exactly who can and should be a compliance officer, and what their particular role would be?</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09031886000221"></a>I turn to an important part of the Bill, which others in your Lordships&#146; House have raised although it is not quite in the Bill yet. It is the question of individual registration. For far too long, there has been a democratic deficit arising from the 3 million eligible people who, because they are not registered, are not able to vote in this country. Ninety-one per cent registration is not acceptable. On polling day we are, all too often, confronted by people who want to vote, then discover that they have not registered and so cannot. It is such a simple thing; &#147;No registration, no vote&#148; should really be the sign that goes on all of our posters.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09031886000222"></a>The Electoral Commission, as has been said, has long argued the case for individual registration to replace household registration, as has my own  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_264"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>organisation, the HS Chapman Society. It is good news, then, that the Government are to produce an amendment for this House to discuss bringing in a scheme for individual registration. We will have to consider carefully the points within that amendment and look at it in some detail, but I support the Government in this; it is better to have it later than never. I am really glad that the Government have now come around to that thinking, but I appreciate why they had reservations that individual registration might result in a drop in the registration level, as in Northern Ireland. The process has to be rigorous enough to make sure that does not happen, which is why the timescale of allowing that work to go on until 2015 is absolutely right.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09031886000223"></a>The integrity of the register is paramount and must be comprehensive and accurate, which means that electoral registration officers have to make special and increased efforts but have to be provided with the right tools and resources to make it happen. The Minister, Michael Wills, indicated that he would be coming forward with proposals to provide the extra resources needed. Experience has shown that money, unless ring-fenced for its intended purpose, is likely to be lost in other local government expenditure. The money has to be spent for the purpose for which it was allocated, but account must be taken there of the additional dimension of asking for personal information identifiers&#151;such as date of birth or national insurance number&#151;as well as a signature. The public will almost certainly want reassurance when providing that information. Equally, provision has to be made for reaching people living in multi-occupancy accommodation, those with literacy problems and other hard-to-reach groups. The decision to allow two-tier local government, as well as one-tier, to receive relevant data from other sources will greatly assist, but must clearly be done in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09031886000224"></a>I appreciate that the Electoral Commission&#146;s monitoring of current standards and expenditure on registration by local authorities will give an assessment of performance variability throughout the country; those details will, I believe, be available shortly. That information should be the basis for starting the planning process towards individual registration. As my noble friend said, equally important will be the judgment of the Electoral Commission in determining whether sufficient time has been given to allow full implementation of the scheme or whether a further period, perhaps two years, is required.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09031886000225"></a>The introduction of individual registration is a major breakthrough and should provide greater protection against electoral fraud while enhancing the legitimacy of the electoral process and the integrity of the ballot. Whether it is in the provision and expenditure of funds or the validity of our election, our electoral procedures&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Bates, said&#151;need the proposals in this Bill. I will fully support its progress through your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_265"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 265</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that was implied in the 2000 Act and was originally going to be increased in the current Act. I welcome the Government&#146;s pull-back with the restriction of investigatory powers, which will be an important aspect in encouraging local people to serve as officers of their local parties. All too often, as many of us know, it is not a question of who is going to carry out these roles but how we will get anybody to do it at all. We want to find ways of encouraging them. In Committee, we will need to explore whether the changes the Government made achieve what it says on the tin.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09031886000227"></a>Since this is a Second Reading debate, I shall step back from the detail and look at two issues which I describe as the elephants in the room. The first is the maintenance of public confidence in how our elections are run; the second is the maintenance of public confidence in the way in which our political parties are financed. If we get those two building blocks right, most other issues fall into place. Several noble Lords have remarked on the evidence of declining electoral confidence on both counts and the consequent dangers to the fabric of our democracy. That will be even more important at a time of considerable economic stress such as we are apparently going to have. People are at work; they are impoverished; it is more than ever important that they feel that their democracy represents their views and aspirations as a means of avoiding other and much less attractive ways of expressing them. Some people have said that this is primarily an issue for the other place, but I do not think it is any more, if it ever was. The waves of cynicism and disbelief are beginning to lap against the foundations of your Lordships' House as well.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09031886000228"></a>On how elections are run, the Government&#146;s response to the decline in electoral turnout was to make it easier to vote, hence the introduction of pretty wholesale postal voting. But any dispassionate observer would have said that that was an experiment doomed to failure. Those of us who have fought general elections will recall travelling up and down streets on election night, asking people to vote. The person says that when they have finished washing the car or mowing the lawn or when their television programme comes to an end, they will go and vote. You say, &#147;For goodness&#146; sake, go and vote&#151;for me, preferably&#151;but above all, go and vote&#148;. Even so, you have a pretty clear idea that they are not going to.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09031886000229"></a>Postal voting will not change that aspect of behaviour; rather the reverse, in my view, because the easier it becomes to vote the less people value it. There may be some argument for saying that voting should require at least some effort on the part of our fellow citizens in order to participate in our democracy. It happens, after all, only once every four or five years, and of course one should provide safeguards for the old, the infirm and the ill. However, as my noble friend on the Front Bench pointed out, it was worse than this because the cases of electoral fraud undermined confidence in the whole process, and participation decreased rather than increased.</p>

<a name="90318-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09031886000230"></a>I was extremely disappointed that there was nothing about this in the original Bill, but I welcome the Government&#146;s Damascene conversion on 2 March. God loves a sinner who repenteth. We have a very  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_266"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 266</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>interesting set of proposals to consider. Of course we shall need to look at them in detail. If I heard him aright, the noble Lord, Lord Neill, set a few torpedoes running about the nature of them, which may well yet take those provisions amidships. I congratulate the Government on the Bill; certainly there is a cheer for having got that first part of the task in hand.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09031886000231"></a>So much for the first elephant. The second is party funding, on which, I am afraid, the Bill is entirely silent. To use a caricature, if you go to the saloon bar of the Dog and Duck and talk about party funding, after a certain amount of unprintable stuff about politicians generally, you will be told that my party is funded by, and responds to, rich people and the Labour Party is funded by, and responds to, the trade unions. I think that the Labour Party has a good many rich people in it as well, but never mind about that. I am not saying that that is a true reflection of the situation, but it is how people think, react and behave. To restore confidence, we need to show that this is not the case. The Bill would have been an ideal opportunity for us to do so, but it would require courage and resolution on the part of both major parties to accept the inevitable consequence: a cap on individual donations. For my party, it would be an opportunity to demonstrate beyond peradventure that rich men cannot influence it; for the Labour Party, it would be an opportunity to introduce transparency to its financial arrangements with the trades unions. There are, of course, risks and dangers, but surely, given the degree of cynicism about our political process, it is a risk that we should all be prepared to run.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09031886000232"></a>Finally on this point, if we really want to be bold and encourage the parties to reach out to a mass membership along the lines referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, in his intervention on the Minister&#146;s speech, perhaps some form of matched funding from the taxpayer, whereby, up to a modest level per head, individual donations could be matched, should be considered. This would have the twin benefits of encouraging parties to produce more members and providing them with additional funding. But I am afraid there are no ideas from, nor cheers for, the Government on this topic, because they have ducked it.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09031886000233"></a>I turn briefly to the provisions. Clause 4 proposes the introduction of electoral commissioners from the political parties. I can see the superficial attractiveness&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, referred to it&#151;of getting people with political experience involved in the commission, but I say to the Government, &#147;Be careful what you wish for&#148;. If one talks to Members of the other place about the way in which their internal disciplinary procedures run, they will say, in a moment of honesty, that they too often become party political matters, and that the process of discipline has therefore become less effective and less commanding of public confidence than might otherwise be the case. There is a danger in introducing party-political electoral commissioners. I understand that they will be extinct volcanoes&#151;that is, people who have had a distinguished career but who are no longer involved in the day-to-day thrust of politics&#151;but members of the Electoral Commission need to be, like Caesar&#146;s wife, above suspicion.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_267"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 267</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09031886000234"></a>I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to Section 4 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, entitled &#147;Parliamentary Parties Panel&#148;, on which, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, served if I heard him correctly in his opening remarks. Subsection (2) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09031886000280"></a>&#147;The function of the panel shall be to submit representations or information to the Commission about such matters affecting political parties as the panel think fit&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031886000266"></a>I accept that it is quite narrowly drawn, with financial matters primarily in mind, but it could be built on. We could have the advantage of party political input without running the risk of the Electoral Commission becoming involved in party politics. The Minister should consider whether we cannot get the best of both worlds by slightly reforming something that already exists in the 2000 Act.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09031886000235"></a>Clause 10 relates to the compliance officer. I cannot see clearly what this man or woman will achieve other than duplicate existing functions. Most of the duties laid down seem primarily to be the responsibility of the election agent, and there are considerable dangers of divided responsibility, with neither party being prepared to take primary care. I refer the Minister to Clausewitz&#146;s old saying: &#147;Better a bad general than a divided command&#148;. We have a divided command here.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09031886000236"></a>We should look carefully at Clause 17. I agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and I was delighted to hear that the Minister intends to allow a free vote on this issue. Transparency is a key regulatory objective and one of the principles of good regulation. This change was popped into the Bill without any debate a couple of weeks ago. Electors are entitled to know where their candidate lives; for some, local roots are an important aspect of the appeal of a candidate. To those who argue about security, I say that I am not aware of attacks on candidates. There have been some dreadful cases of attacks on Members of Parliament, particularly the one in Cheltenham, but that was about a surgery. I assume, therefore, that a candidate&#146;s address will not remain a confidential matter; otherwise, the contact between the Member of Parliament and his constituents would be greatly reduced.</p>

However, as a matter of course, if every single parliamentary candidate can avoid giving any detailed information about where he lives, we are shutting off the electorate from the candidate in a way that is undesirable as a matter of course. Clearly, we hope that the issues that particularly affected my noble friend&#151;Northern Ireland and so on&#151;are a thing of the past. The proposal to introduce this without debate or consideration of the various aspects of which this is an important part is something that we should examine again in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09031886000239"></a>My final point is that the Electoral Commission will have an extraordinarily heavy burden to play in this new world. The noble Baroness, Lady Gould, quoted from the report on the Committee on Standards in Public Life. After her quote, the report went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09031886000281"></a>&#147;Through a combination of deficiencies in its current mandate, that is too weak in some areas and too broad in others, combined with a lack of courage, competence and leadership in its regulatory and advisory approach, the Commission has not successfully performed these core duties&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031886000267"></a>We cannot legislate for courage, competence and leadership; that will be achieved in the hearts of the men and women who serve on the commission, who will need to be well endowed with those characteristics. But we can and should provide the appropriate framework. While welcoming the rather glacial progress that this Bill represents, I am not convinced that the Government have done enough to provide the right architecture to enable the Electoral Commission to execute its heavy responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09031886000242"></a>The political reform of this country is a necessary condition for delivering a more successful Britain and a Britain at peace with itself. It is not a secondary consideration at this time of financial crisis. There is currently much evidence of disquiet in this country about our political system. I believe that imports a danger. When the public is under pressure for economic and external reasons and it is not content with the system that we have, it is more likely to listen with greater attention to the voices of populist extremists. That extremely important point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Bates, in opening for the Opposition.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09031886000243"></a>We must therefore ask ourselves whether the Bill has gone far enough to meet the concerns of the public. It is unquestionable that it has gone further and in many respects it is an improvement on the 2000 Act, but I am surprised that the Government have not felt it possible to grasp the nettle of expenditure in elections. They recognised that this was a grave concern and that the fear that votes could be bought  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_269"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has not evaporated since the Government asked Sir Hayden Phillips to consider these matters. It is reasonable, and therefore it should be possible, for the parties to assemble and consider how they would address these issues even now.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09031886000244"></a>I know that an election is in the offing for the Westminster Parliament, but even now we should attempt to remove this anxiety. We should look again openly and particularly at the principles that underlie the report of the Constitutional Affairs Committee and that of Sir Hayden Phillips. Those principles were well enunciated and they are not addressed in the Bill. One principle that Sir Hayden enunciated was that the status quo in which there are no caps on donations is unsustainable and therefore donations to parties should be limited. That is an extremely important principle and it needs to be particularly addressed in our debates.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09031886000245"></a>Another principle was that expenditure on general election campaigns was progressively growing and should be reduced. I do not see anything in this Bill that goes in that direction. That worries me, particularly because we do not have the sort of controls over expenditure in this country that the United States has and which my noble friend Lord Tyler, in his detailed and helpful speech, enunciated. We cannot congratulate ourselves on getting this right if we do not address that general point.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09031886000246"></a>A further related point is that if we were to affect the incomes of political parties, there is a potentiality for inequitable consequences and the loss of stability. I need not remind the House that Sir Hayden Phillips advocated some increase in public funding of political parties. It is important to espouse the view that political parties are an absolutely key part of the working of our democracy. They are responsible for the sophisticated development of policies by parties not in government and the success with which they propound those developed policies will enable the public to have a sense of its involvement in the political process. More than anything, it will have the potential of encouraging people not to take a backseat, not to listen to the cheap points which are being scored by the populists and even to participate directly in seeking to formulate these attitudes. Hayden Phillips drew attention to the fact that, in this country, membership of political parties has dropped from one in 11, 50 years ago, to one person in 88 today. To me, that is retrograde and unfortunate. If parties cease to play a part, what is to take their place? Is it to be individuals? I cannot imagine anything more dangerous.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09031886000247"></a>I hope that in addressing these considerations in Committee, we will consider these wider considerations in putting forward our individual proposals, which I do not propose to touch on today, and I hope that we will not simply consider how they affect one or other political party. All political parties are required to be funded properly&#151;not excessively funded&#151;with sufficient income to enable the serious work of political thinking and political education to be advanced.</p>

I can still remember the challenges that we faced: on the one hand, quite rightly, we were trying to implement our manifesto commitment to clean up political party funding and, on the other hand, we were struggling with the practical operation of what became a complex and, to my mind, unwieldy piece of legislation. From my perspective, this Bill is a welcome opportunity to iron out some of the unnecessary local burdens, while tightening up on the big funding issues, which continue to threaten the integrity of our political parties and, therefore, the reputation of our democratic system.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09031894000002"></a>I am sure that there will be some robust discussions during the passage of the Bill through the Lords, as is absolutely right, but, as has been said, there have been considerable efforts in the other place to try to reach a cross-party consensus on issues that should transcend individual interests in favour of the more compelling objective of renewing faith in our political party system. I hope that we are able to keep that goal in our sights as the debate progresses.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09031894000003"></a>In that context, I would like to make the following points. My main concern about the 2000 Act was that it placed daunting new accounting burdens and draconian sanctions on the rather scarce and precious local volunteers on whom we all rely to keep our local democracy alive. Those individuals, often elderly, provide an essential presence in local communities and act as the recruiting sergeants of the next generation of political activists. As a number of noble Lords have said, we expect too much of them and often exploit their good will. At the time, I was concerned&#151;it was borne out by some evidence&#151;that the new responsibilities of the Act would prove to be the final straw and they would step down from office. To be honest, it felt like the people drafting the legislation had never run a jumble sale or passed a hat around to get enough money to pay for the hire of the room.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09031894000004"></a>That is why I am pleased that the provisions in the Bill have begun to address that issue by introducing a more proportionate regime for local accounting. It is helpful that the basic level of recordable donation has been increased to a more justifiable figure. More important, the concept of a local compliance officer who could be appointed to make the returns to the Electoral Commission on behalf of other local officers could provide some welcome relief to our overburdened volunteers.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09031894000005"></a>I am also pleased that the thresholds for other recordable and reportable donations have been increased to more sensible levels. More fundamentally, I very much welcome the shift in the nature of sanctions that can be applied to breaches of the law at a local level. If our activists were put off by the bureaucracy of the previous recording procedures, they were terrified of the penalties for default that threatened them with criminal proceedings. Again, it seemed as though there was no real understanding of the slightly chaotic and unstructured nature of local activism. It is absolutely right that, where honest mistakes are made, there should be flexibility in the application of sanctions.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09031894000006"></a>Secondly, I very much welcome the move to extend the size of the commission to enable four commissioners with political experience to be appointed. Clearly it is  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_271"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>important that the political appointees are not in the majority, but in its early days the commission felt that it was struggling to understand the real world of political parties on the ground. It was making policies for an idealised concept of super-organised local activists who did not exist and it was less effective for that. There is a role for knowledge and experience in a regulator and I am sure that the new appointments will enhance the status of, and respect for, the commission.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09031894000007"></a>Thirdly, it has to be right that, in the longer term, we move to individual electoral registration. The concept of a head of household taking charge is increasingly an anachronism, which takes no account of the changing nature of households and relationships and subtly downgrades the status of those passively being registered. It is also, as we are painfully aware, more open to fraud. There is a real opportunity now to use an electoral registration campaign to reach out to the next generation of voters and persuade them that their right to vote has significance and value. It should mark their transition into the adult world and bring with it other advantages and benefits.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09031894000008"></a>That is easy to say and more difficult to deliver. It would be a disaster if the result of this initiative was fewer people being registered and fewer individuals voting. That is why we need to proceed carefully. The full and enthusiastic support for the initiative from local electoral registration officers is crucial and they need to be guaranteed the extra resources to roll out this programme. It is also vital that the verification proposals have broad popular support and do not become an excuse for a registration boycott. This is a difficult challenge. We are right to proceed with it, as it is long overdue, but it is also right that we should learn the lessons as we proceed and not put the whole registration process at risk.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09031894000009"></a>Fourthly, I have a couple of comments about the trade union political funds, which some people have suggested should be included in the Bill. Already, the political activities of trade unions are massively regulated by both trade union and electoral law. Already, donations, affiliation fees and donations in kind have to be clearly recorded and made public. Trade unions also have the draconian duty to reballot their members on continuing these activities every 10 years. These funds are then used to affiliate individual members to the party in the form of a membership fee. This is very different from the large-scale individual donations that the Bill attempts to regulate, and the two should not be confused.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09031894000010"></a>Finally, I turn to what are now described as unincorporated associations but which most people would describe as front organisations. Of course, political organisations, like all other parts of our lives, have become more complicated. It is also true that an organisation set up for one purpose can easily become a convenient vehicle for an entirely different purpose. The key to unlocking these complex relationships has to be transparency. This was the spirit and intention of the 2000 Act. It is vital that we take the opportunity in the Bill to close any remaining anomalies that have drawn a cloak of secrecy over millions of pounds in hidden donations. That is why I welcome the measures in the Bill, which will require unincorporated associations that make donations to political parties in excess of  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_272"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#163;25,000 a year to report the names of individual donors to their funds. It is right that the public should know who funds our parties; people should be reassured that opportunities for foreign nationals to fund our parties via this route are now being blocked.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09031894000011"></a>I am aware that I have touched on only a few aspects of the Bill. I look forward to opportunities to debate the issues as the Bill progresses through this House. There is always a temptation when dealing with issues in which many of us take a close interest to become rather partisan. I hope and believe that we will manage to avoid that trap and to craft a Bill that has at its heart renewed transparency and renewed public faith in our political system.</p>

I will largely restrict my comments to matters of finance and party funding. Many aspects of the Bill address those issues and issues of disclosure. However, I fear that the Bill does not go far enough. I was co-author, with Andrew Tyrie, of a paper for the leader of the Conservative Party. I also served in the discussion stages with Sir Hayden Phillips. Two things that we tried to demand were a cap on donations and matched funding, to which my noble friend referred earlier.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09031894000013"></a>We live in a world that demands transparency and where the media have become obsessed with political party donors and with what they perceive&#151;I use that word deliberately&#151;as their motives. The Bill, by not imposing a maximum amount per donation, does not address those issues. It cannot be right that there is overdependence on a union or a number of individuals for the annual running costs of a party. It cannot be good for politics and it cannot be good for the parties themselves. Through the passage of the Bill, we must be earnest about changing that.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09031894000014"></a>Neither does the Bill prevent a cash-grab race from taking place, as it does not restrict what political parties may spend in any one year. It cannot be right that, depending on a party&#146;s political fortunes and popularity in the polls, one party should be able unreasonably to exceed another in its ability to raise&#151;and therefore to spend&#151;money. A cap on annual running costs would be welcome.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09031894000015"></a>However, the most acute problem is the raising of money for a general election, which effectively doubles the money that a party is required to raise in one year. Large donations are therefore required and the issues of influence and reporting raise their ugly heads again. If we are to get to a consensus on this, we need to resolve how we support parties in their election fundraising initiatives.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09031894000016"></a>Neither does the Bill promote democracy, because it does not produce a plan for financially supporting new political parties, allowing them to campaign&#151;and thereby permitting the nation to debate broader democratic issues&#151;without being dependent on a rich donor. Nor does the Bill financially incentivise political parties to encourage greater turnouts at the ballot box and greater involvement in political debate. A grant scheme or incentive plan is surely an imperative. Yet again, that opportunity has been missed.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09031894000017"></a>Finally, the Bill does not address the undue influence of trade unions or the amount that they are allowed to give the Labour Party. In the last year we have seen the unions bail out the party from its deeply parlous financial state. What is the price of that bail-out? It is totally unreasonable. The Bill does not permit trade union members to opt out of their union contributions being directed to the Labour Party. This must change.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09031894000018"></a>It may seem odd that I welcome the increase in the threshold for a declaration, but the threshold has not changed since 2000 and therefore has not kept pace with inflation or comparable gift-making to other voluntary organisations. This change helps the significant administrative burden on our local associations, which, after all, are made up largely of volunteers, as was said earlier.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09031894000019"></a>I turn now to policing. During my time as treasurer, the Electoral Commission was the most frustrating and inadequate organisation to deal with. It neither policed nor interpreted the legal implications of the 2000 Act adequately. Despite the Conservative Party having a compliance officer, a finance director and a finance board, who tried to maintain regular contact with the commission, it failed in its guidance and liaison with them. Of course, the moment that trouble started, it ran for cover proclaiming its vast innocence. I think that noble Lords opposite will agree with this.</p>

<a name="90318-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09031894000020"></a>As we all know, the Electoral Commission also failed to monitor the postal voting system and to rigorously police the election process. It is therefore imperative that the people who run it not only understand the Bill but also its relationship with the parties, to help them with interpretation and to work closely to ensure that parties fulfil their obligations. I welcome the fact that there will be four commissioners, but it is important that they understand the workings of political parties. We should not ban former political party executives from being commissioners; we should encourage them, because those people fundamentally understand the workings of political parties. The commissioners should also understand parties&#146; financing, because we must deal with what is an acute problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09031894000021"></a>I am afraid that the Bill has been fudge. Despite its great rhetoric, and despite the procrastination, it has failed to address the practical issues of fundraising and how to engage with a wider audience in politics.</p>

I speak on the Bill mainly because I was a member of the Committee on Standards in Public Life at the time of its report on the funding of political parties, which laid down the framework for the later legislation.

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09031895000003"></a>Two matters are of particular importance: first, the increasing transparency, particularly by requiring unincorporated associations to disclose the source of donations made through them; and, secondly, a provision not yet in the Bill but promised by the Government, as the noble Lord, Lord Bach, has done, to bring about individual registration by electors throughout Great Britain. Electoral fraud is indeed an increasing problem and has undoubtedly affected some results, particularly in local government elections. Individual registration with identifiers would make fraud much more difficult to achieve. It needs to be brought forward more quickly than is now proposed by the Government; although I obviously recognise that it would take some time to achieve.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09031895000004"></a>There are several other useful provisions in the Bill. I welcome, among others, the greater power to obtain relevant information, and the powers to impose civil penalties; on this, I am afraid that I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Neill. The threat of criminal penalties has deterred many party members from accepting offices in their local parties that would place them in danger of acquiring a criminal record. Criminal penalties should be reserved for deliberate and conscious breaches of the law, and not for breaches caused by ignorance or incompetence, which are better dealt with by civil penalties.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09031895000005"></a>I also welcome the extension of the size of the Electoral Commission by adding four members nominated by political parties. My experience over six years on the Committee for Standards in Public Life persuaded me that having members with front-line knowledge of the workings of the political system was useful to the committee, and it would also be useful to the Electoral Commission. However, we also need to clarify the method of selection of the fourth political member. By an odd coincidence, I have recently been on a mission to Sri Lanka for the International Bar Association, where we discovered that failure to spell out what was, in that case, the method of electing the sixth party nominee to their constitutional commission had stymied the whole operation. We must therefore give some greater indication in the Bill of how the fourth member will be selected.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09031895000006"></a>I support some proposals in the Bill in principle but not in detail. In these, I agree to a considerable extent with the Electoral Commission. The Bill proposes in Clause 13 to increase the permissibility and recording thresholds from &#163;200 to &#163;500. While I accept that some increase may be desirable, that seems to me to be altogether too high. I suggest that the increase should be from &#163;200 to &#163;300. That would tally with the 50 per cent increase in the reporting thresholds provided for by Clause 13.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09031895000007"></a>Clause 14 limits free candidacy expenses for general elections occurring more than 55 months after the previous general election. This is good in principle but, as my noble friend Lord Tyler pointed out, four of the last general elections have taken place only four years after the previous general election. Four years seems to have become the standard length of life of a Parliament if the governing party expects that it is likely to be re-elected. This suggests that a limitation on constituency spending should preferably operate  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_275"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 275</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>throughout the life of a Parliament and, in any event, should at least come into force at a much earlier date than that proposed by the Bill; I suggest that that should be not later than 42 months after the previous general election, so that it would be there after three and a half years. Then there is the question of the withholding of the home addresses of candidates. I am not persuaded that we need it at all, except in cases of a real security threat, as the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, pointed out.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09031895000008"></a>Finally, there are provisions that should be in the Bill but are not. Of these, much the most important, which has had support from a number of other speakers, is the cap on donations. This was not recommended by the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#146;s fifth report, but developments since then have made it clear that it is necessary. Indeed, it is essential that parties are to be given a reasonably level playing field. The present system enables a party with wealthy supporters to run more expensive campaigns and to be more active outside the campaign periods. More important even than that, some contributions in recent years have been so huge that party policy can be altered by the promise of more money or by the threat of withdrawing financial support in the future.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09031895000009"></a>Wealth can quite legitimately be used to buy fine houses, great works of art or yachts and Rolls-Royces. However, it is contrary to the spirit of democracy to allow wealth to buy political influence, so we need to add a cap on donations to the provisions on the existing cap on spending. That should apply with or without a consensus.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09031895000010"></a>Another provision that should be in the Bill, or perhaps in the forthcoming Finance Bill, is tax relief for small donations. This was proposed in the Committee on Standards of Public Life&#146;s report, but was not adopted. We have in this country for years recognised that donations to charities are a matter of public interest and should have tax relief through gift aid. However, modest donations to political parties are also very much in the public interest and should be encouraged. This has already been recognised in principle, although not many people appreciate this, by exempting bequests to political parties that have two or more members in the House of Commons from inheritance tax liability. The same principle should apply to donations by the living. The simplest method would be to use the gift aid system with some changes. In particular, there would be a cap on the size of the annual donation that could qualify for relief&#151;I would suggest no higher than &#163;1,000&#151;and higher-rate taxpayers could not set off their donations against their higher-rate tax liability as they can in the case of gifts to charities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09031895000013"></a>We are facing a grave crisis&#151;a crisis that affects all our political parties. We do not have an easy way out of this, but we have to face the situation together. Unfortunately, I do not think this Bill&#151;or any Bill&#151;can really do this. I am not suggesting for one moment that we should not consider what is being proposed. There are certain advantages in this Bill, but it is not a complete answer&#151;or any answer&#151;to the underlying problems that we face. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, was in my view unduly optimistic about the contribution that Members are able to make in the political process. That is an issue which confronts all parties but, as I have said, I do not think that any Bill can answer that problem.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09031895000014"></a>I became involved in politics a long time ago&#151;before the 1945 election. Some Members&#151;very few in this House&#151;will appreciate the significance of that. I became involved at a time when people really cared: the turnout in 1945, 1950 and 1951, and even in 1955, was enthusiastic and energetic in a way that few of us would say has happened since. I have been a member of the Labour Party for a very long time; the decline in voting is an issue that confronts all parties, if you care about the democratic system, as I do. I remember in that time&#151;64 years ago&#151;that people flooded into the election canvassing rooms. They really cared not only about casting their vote, but that other people should cast their vote, too. How can we resuscitate that situation? Is it possible? I repeat, it affects us all.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09031895000015"></a>We are not facing up to the real problems. The real problem is that people want to feel that they can really effect change, something that many people think is impossible to achieve at this time. Despite what I have said, this Bill by and large represents an advance. It is also capable of becoming even more benign, within the limitations that were spelled out by my noble friend Lord Bach. I hope that in his wind-up, he will give the House further and better particulars of what discussions have taken place with the Electoral Commission and others about the proposals in the Bill, and about some of its shortcomings. The essential goals that we should seek to attain, as the Electoral Commission urges, are how we can modernise and strengthen the electoral registration system to make it more meaningful as far as ordinary people are concerned, and how we can introduce individual electoral registration. I would hope that we can see some worthwhile changes in this Bill.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09031895000016"></a>The Electoral Commission is clearly concerned about the effect of the Bill&#146;s proposals about reporting donations and loans. Despite improvements contained in the Bill, the risk remains of a lack of confidence, as expressed by the Electoral Commission,</p>
<ul><a name="09031895000059"></a>&#147;in the transparency and integrity of party and election finance&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031895000017"></a>Is there validity in this concern? What is the Minister&#146;s response?</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09031895000018"></a>The Electoral Commission welcomes the changes devised by the Government to Clause 2 and Schedule 1, establishing that the Government are in listening mode and that this new procedure is a significant improvement on what we have now. I submit that the Electoral Commission is right when it suggests that statutory requests for information and explanations should be dealt with similarly to requests for documents, thereby  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_277"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 277</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>extending the new court order procedure. As the Electoral Commission argues, such a procedure would enable an investigation to be effective. It strongly recommends&#151;I think that it is absolutely right in this&#151;that a civil court procedure is to be preferred to a criminal prosecution for not complying with a statutory request. What is the Minister&#146;s response to this modest proposal?</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09031895000019"></a>I turn to Clauses 4 and 7, concerning electoral commissioners. It was submitted in the House of Commons that the fourth nominated commissioner should provide a voice that would otherwise be unheard, for parties with fewer or no seats in the House of Commons. What is the Minister&#146;s view about this? It is essential that that issue should be faced.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09031895000020"></a>So far as donations are concerned, Clause 13 increases the permissibility and recording threshold from &#163;200 to &#163;500. I share the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, about this. Why have we come to that conclusion? There is a need to take account of the inflation that has occurred since 2000&#151;that makes sense&#151;but it is absurd to change the amount to &#163;500. What justification is there to change it from &#163;200 to &#163;500? Although I think that there should occasionally be a review of the situation, we should react adversely to this particular proposal.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09031895000021"></a>I turn to candidates in parliamentary elections. The Electoral Commission considered that voters should be able to have sufficient information to identify a candidate&#146;s links with his or her constituency, and the Minister indicated that there will be certain changes. Will there be any changes as far as that is concerned, and what is the general purpose which the Minister prescribes? It is quite insufficient to enable only candidates, some others closely identified with the candidate and representatives of the Electoral Commission to have access to the candidate&#146;s full address. What is suggested is that the returning officer should identify the candidate&#146;s home address. I think that that represents a demonstrable improvement on what has gone before. However, there needs to be further discussions with the Electoral Commission and the discussions should not be confined to that issue. It would be enormously beneficial to do that and I humbly commend the proposal.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09031895000022"></a>I hope that what I have said is not wholly negative and that the Minister will take some account of it. I await his reply with bated breath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09031895000025"></a>I am an elected member of Pendle Borough Council, which is an electoral registration authority. I have also been an election agent for many hundreds of candidates over the years; indeed, I am an election agent for a candidate in a by-election at this very moment. My noble friend Lord Tyler was bragging, I think, that he has stood in 12 elections and won half of them. If I have my arithmetic right, I have stood in 20 and won 80 per cent of them. However, I defer to my noble friend because he got elected to the House of Commons, which I failed to do on several occasions.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09031895000026"></a>I want to talk about two nitty-gritty issues: individual registration and postal voting. On individual registration, I join those who welcomed the announcement made at Report stage in the House of Commons. We look forward with interest to see what the government amendments actually say. I join those who have urged the Minister to ensure that the amendments are here in time for Committee stage, when they can be thoroughly discussed and properly gone over without the constraints of the more formal procedures on Report.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09031895000027"></a>I, too, join my noble friend Lord Goodhart in expressing concern that it will take eight years before the system comes in if all the hurdles are passed. That seems a very long time. Like him, I understand that there are many interesting and intricate hurdles to be passed before it can be brought in, and indeed that it will cost money. But eight years is a long time. Looking round your Lordships' House, I think that some of us may not be here in eight years. The way things go, projects like this slip, they do not speed up once a timetable has been put in place. The Government say eight years but it might be 10 or 12 years&#151;who knows?&#151;unless someone puts a bit of oomph behind it. I believe that electoral registration is necessary in principle. I think that it is necessary to help stamp out some kinds of electoral fraud that do or can take place.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09031895000028"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, talked about the different culture in England, Scotland and Wales as opposed to Northern Ireland. He may be right. If people were asked which part of the United Kingdom would most easily take to such changes, I do not think that most would necessarily choose Northern Ireland first. It has undoubtedly been a success in Northern Ireland and there is no reason at all why it cannot be a success here. If the Government are putting forward a timetable for this, let us have some pilots. Let us pilot individual registration in different parts of the United Kingdom, or in England, Scotland and Wales, and see what the difficulties and results are in practice without trying to overcome possibly very real hurdles or making assessments on the basis of what might happen. I have not always been in favour of the concept of piloting in elections in other areas but it really could happen in electoral registration. Pilots could go ahead in some areas in two or three years. Those could identify, thrash out and resolve the difficulties and that experience could then be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09031895000029"></a>I do not believe that individual registration will on its own stamp out fraud through postal voting; I shall explain why in a minute. However, I do believe that it is vital to stamp out possibilities for personation at polling stations. Not a great deal of publicity is given to personation at polling stations, but there is evidence that it exists on an unacceptable scale in some parts of the country. I suppose that one case of someone personating another elector would be an unacceptable scale, but I am referring to a scale at which elections can be changed. For example, I have quite a bit of information from my honourable friend John Hemming MP that personation is a problem in Birmingham. I believe that it is a problem in at least one town in Lancashire, though fortunately not in the areas where I am politically active.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09031895000030"></a>In principle, individual registration is right because people ought to be responsible for their own votes. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, who brings some youth to the Chamber&#151;compared with some of us, at least; and she can read <I>Hansard</I> to see what that is all about&#151;referred to the &#147;head of household&#148;, a description that has not actually been used, at least since the Electoral Administration Act of two or three years ago, to which my noble friend Lord Goodhart referred. The truth of the matter now is that the electoral registration form for a household is filled in and sent back by whoever bothers to do it&#151;whoever picks it up and decides to fill it in. This is utterly and totally unacceptable, particularly in multi-occupancy housing, where the person filling in the form may be someone who you do not know much about. That is not an acceptable practice. The idea that there is a male head of household is outmoded in even the most conventional households. Individual registration is right in principle and has benefits in practice.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09031895000031"></a>I do not want to say a lot about postal voting. The first time that I tried to tell your Lordships about some of the problems of postal voting was when we were discussing the European Parliamentary and Local Elections (Pilots) Bill back in 2003, and I recounted some of the utterly unacceptable practices in relation to postal voting and what became known as &#147;warehousing&#148; of voting in the infamous case in Birmingham. At that time, many noble Lords around the Chamber did not really believe me. How could this level of electoral fraud and malpractice in British politics be practised and be quite so prevalent in some areas? We now know, partly from the court cases to which the noble Lord, Lord Neill, referred, that this problem is widespread and totally undermines the democratic process in those areas. There is absolutely no point in beating about the bush; most organised postal vote fraud is in areas where there are large south-Asian communities. There is a cultural problem there and there is no point in pretending that that is not the case, because it is. Unless we tackle the problem at its roots in those communities, we will not sort it out.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09031895000032"></a>Postal voting, by its very nature, is not and never can be secure. My answer would be to start by saying that there should be no postal voting, and then by asking who really needs it. My bottom line, or perhaps my top line, would be to return to the system that existed before 2000, but I would restrict its use to  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_280"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 280</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people who needed it for medical reasons or reasons of disability because they physically could not get to the polling station to vote. In this modern day and age there are other ways of providing voting facilities for people who are simply away from home.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09031895000033"></a>In the future, it should be possible to arrange to cast your vote anywhere in this country, given the computer and communications systems that exist nowadays. Obviously, that would have to be organised and thought about carefully, but such a system is possible. Systems of advance voting, were used in America before the presidential election, when many of us discovered to our astonishment that in some areas between 25 and 30 per cent of the electorate had already voted before polling day&#151;but they had voted in a polling station.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09031895000034"></a>I was not in favour of pilots for postal voting because I was not in favour of postal voting on demand, but pilots for advance voting systems could be looked at in this country to provide a means by which people can vote, even if they will be away on polling day.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09031895000035"></a>So there are other ways of doing it. We should look at other ways of voting that are secure. The problem with postal voting is that you can never guarantee whether the person who has had the voting paper sent to them has filled it in and sent it back. Even if identifiers are used and verified, and even if there is individual registration, that problem does not fundamentally change. In particular, you cannot guarantee, even if the correct person is filling in the ballot paper, that there is not someone standing next to them making sure that they are voting the right way. Even if that does not happen, you cannot prevent people doing what someone did to me at the last election&#151;they knocked at my door and said, &#147;Can I give you our postal vote?&#148;. I said, &#147;If it&#146;s sealed up I shall take it back, but I really don&#146;t see why you can&#146;t just post it&#148;. They said, &#147;Oh no. We want to show it to you to make sure that you know that we voted for your man&#148;. That is inherently possible in postal voting and it totally and utterly undermines the secrecy of the ballot box.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09031895000036"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Neill, and others, I think that this Bill misses an opportunity to turn back the clock from 2000 and place much greater restrictions and security measures on postal voting.</p>

I have only two brief points to make. The first is to support the Electoral Commission, as other noble Lords have done, in its recent briefing paper, which is nervous about increased thresholds for donations that do not need to be declared. As the commission has said, the proposal to increase the declarable threshold to &#163;500 may mean that any cumulative series of donations which are individually worth less than &#163;500 will be legal, regardless of where they come from, and will not need to be reported to the commission for publication.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09031895000038"></a>As a fundraiser, I confess that I find this a rather attractive proposition, but it cannot be right if we wish to identify substantial donors to our political parties. I fear that the commission must be right when it suggests  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_281"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 281</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that this proposition may result in large donors making regular donations of just below &#163;500, perhaps even by standing order. I should have thought that that must defeat the object of the present Act and of this Bill. I submit that this may be an area to which we may wish to return in Committee. One could of course require the cumulative totals of small gifts to be declared when they reach &#163;7,500.</p>

<a name="90318-0008.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09031895000039"></a>My other suggestion is that we should perhaps revisit the requirement for a large donor to be on the electoral roll. I have to tread rather delicately here, which noble Lords may think is not my strongest suit, because my party is in dispute with the commission about this area. However, I welcome the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, when she referred to the burdens placed on amateur activists and donors, who may make technical and sometimes innocent mistakes.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09031895000040"></a>In the report of the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, which gave rise to the present Act, he suggested that a party should have been able to accept a donation from someone who was on the electoral roll, or who was known to be eligible to be on the roll. A Conservative amendment to include the latter category was lost in your Lordships&#146; House after the Government argued that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09031895000058"></a>&#147;It would be no easy matter for a registered party to establish whether a donor whose name did not appear on an electoral register was nevertheless entitled to register&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/11/00; col. 695.]</p>

<p><a name="09031895000057"></a>That might be so, or it might not. People may not want to be on the electoral roll for a perfectly respectable reason, such as not wanting to reveal their address for security reasons, but a party might be satisfied that they were bona fide resident taxpayers in this country. If so, I suggest that the party should be able to accept a donation, perhaps while informing the commission in each case. There will not be many such cases.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09031895000041"></a>I appreciate that the present rule gives certainty and clarity, but the Bill does allow in Clause 17 for candidates to withhold their addresses from general scrutiny, and therefore moves in the direction that I suggest, although I appreciate that the clause is somewhat controversial for some of your Lordships. The object of the exercise is to prevent foreign and anonymous donations; if we can achieve that without penalising even a small number of people, perhaps we should try to do so. I look forward to the Government&#146;s views on my two suggestions.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, on the other hand, asked how raising the donation threshold so significantly would reduce the level of bureaucracy. It seems clear that, by raising the threshold in this way, many local party treasurers will no longer have to make any returns, which will reduce their paperwork and the stress put upon them. It is not donations of up to &#163;500 that we should be worrying about when considering the Bill.</p>

I point out that these are the first increases since 2000, nine years ago, and that we may not have further increases for a significant period of time. I have no doubt that the Minister will refer to the fact that the Electoral Commission, while initially expressing reservations about the large increase, decided that it would not oppose higher thresholds. Above all, we must consider that the burden of bureaucracy on volunteers would be wholly disproportionate to the benefit of any transparency over donations at a level below &#163;500.</p>

My noble friend Lord Tyler drew attention to the failure of the Bill to address the problem that our system allows millions of pounds to count for more than millions of votes. He made the democratic case that the ballot box should be more important than the bank balance. Figures supplied by the Electoral Commission show that almost half of the Conservative Party&#146;s income from donations in 2008&#151;some &#163;10 million out of the &#163;22 million raised&#151;came from donations in excess of &#163;100,000. More than two-thirds of the Labour Party&#146;s income from donations&#151;some &#163;16.5 million out of &#163;23 million&#151;came from donations in excess of &#163;100,000; and half the party&#146;s total income&#151;around &#163;12 million&#151;came from trade unions. For the record, around a fifth of the Liberal Democrats&#146; income from donations in 2008&#151;just over &#163;600,000 out of &#163;3.2million&#151;came from such large donations.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09031895000047"></a>The donation patterns show three things. First, there continues to be an unhealthy arms race in relation to party spending, which the legislation in 2000 failed to halt. Secondly, those making the largest donations can be seen to have a significant, and possibly even corrupting, influence on the parties, if their proportion of the overall donation level is very high. Thirdly, all the parties have concluded, despite public protestations, that cash counts for a lot in politics, and can have a decisive influence in the outcome of elections. All the parties feel that they need money to compete, otherwise they would not seek these large sums. The case for a cap on very large donations, as was proposed and nearly agreed in the discussions with Sir Hayden Phillips,

I was delighted this afternoon to hear both noble Lords, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts and Lord Marland, supporting this principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09031895000048"></a>There have been a number of references in our debate to the proposed changes to the composition of the Electoral Commission. It is fair to say that the commission had reservations about these changes, but has now accepted the principle of having a minority of commission members with hands-on political experience. Some of us with such experience, including the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton, argued in 2000 that the Government were wrong and that the political parties panel was an inadequate way of enabling the commission to have the necessary insight into electoral processes. We feel vindicated now. We would reassure others that the political members of the commission will be in a minority, but will be able to assist fellow commissioners on the basis of being poachers-turned-gamekeepers.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09031895000049"></a>I turn to the issue of the trigger and constituency limits. I expect that in future debates we will return to the controversy surrounding the &#147;trigger mechanisms&#148; for starting the period for which candidates and agents must limit their expenditure. My noble friend Lord Tyler explained the absurdity of making an arrangement in legislation that would apply only to a small number of Parliaments; two out of the past 12.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09031895000050"></a>The old trigger mechanism for starting a candidate&#146;s election expenses was inadvertently abolished during the passage of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Suggestions have been made to reintroduce such a mechanism for a period of four months prior to polling day. The proposals, initially from the Electoral Commission, were rejected during the passage of the Electoral Administration Act 2006, when everybody agreed that a four-month rule for counting expenses was impractical, because in the absence of fixed-term Parliaments, no one knows when it is four months before polling day. A cap on expenditure, at national and local level and over the course of a Parliament, would make much more sense than a cap over the period from the 55th month of the Parliament through to polling day. A cap on expenditure should apply every year, not just on national spending in the last 12 months of a Parliament, as at present, nor just on local spending in what looks likely to be the last four months of this Parliament.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09031895000051"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gould, agreed that there was a problem. Perhaps I have an answer. Spending caps should apply every year and should start to be applied from the day after each general election, when we all know that the campaign begins for the subsequent general election. A major problem with the current proposals is that they still fail to address the unintended consequence of the change nine years ago that permits any amount of what is deemed to be &#147;national expenditure&#148; to be targeted at particular constituencies. This has exacerbated the potential for multimillionaires to buy influence over the electoral process, by allowing them to concentrate expenditure on marginal seats.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09031895000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ashcroft, is not here today to defend the way in which he could boast of giving well in excess of &#163;10 million to the Conservative Party before the last election and his claim that his money influenced the outcome in 25 of the 33 seats that the  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_284"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Conservatives gained in 2005. I should still like to persuade the Government to cap such donations nationally. However, to have any effect on what is sometimes called &#147;the Ashcroft problem&#148;, we must bring back an effective cap on constituency spending by properly defining what is local and what is national expenditure in particular constituencies during an election campaign.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09031895000053"></a>Having failed to bring back the old trigger, the problem now is that many tens of thousands of pounds&#151;perhaps hundreds of thousands of pounds&#151;can be spent legally in particular constituencies in the immediate run-up to polling day if the expenditure is deemed to be part of a party's national rather than local campaign. This sort of expenditure will not be capped by the proposals in the Bill, and the Bill as drafted completely fails to deal with the problem. It means that millionaire funding allows parties to place advertisements targeted on local newspapers in certain constituencies; it allows them to pay for huge billboard advertising sites that appear only in their targeted seats; and it allows them to bombard target voters in those seats with dozens of national mailshots from the party leader. At the same time, an MP or a candidate from a party without such wealthy backing finds that any personal promotion is subject to a very strict and small local limit. That cannot be right; it is not democratic and must be changed before our next election, which could be corrupted in a way that has not been the case in this country since the era of rotten boroughs in the 19th century.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09031895000054"></a>Finally, I turn briefly to the subject of individual voter registration, which has been raised by many other speakers. Among the mistakes that I believe we made in 2000 was allowing postal voting on demand without proper safeguards being in place. We have made some progress since then, particularly in the Electoral Administration Act a couple of years ago, but more must be done if we are to have proper safeguards against fraud.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09031895000055"></a>At the same time, I recognise that we need to ensure that the electoral register is as accurate and complete as possible, and the belated moves towards individual voter registration are very welcome to many of us. However, I think that the Government&#146;s approach to this whole subject has been reminiscent of the old phrase, &#147;Lord, make me holy but not yet&#148;. Postal voting came in in 2000 but the necessary safeguards produced by individual voter registration may not appear until perhaps 17 years after that or even later, when four general elections may have taken place, along with numerous other elections to other bodies. It is simply not good enough to say that we will have to wait until then.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09031895000056"></a>I look forward to the further stages of the Bill and to the opportunity that it presents for a further attempt to halt the arms race on spending, clean up the reputation of politics and ensure that power lies where it belongs&#151;with the voter and not with the funder.</p>

I also look forward to him bringing forward the other parts of the Bill that he has promised. As he will be aware, this Bill is already very different from what was originally introduced in the Commons and it will differ further, we hope, following the Committee stage. As the noble Lord, Lord Neill, put it, it is unfortunate to have Second Reading of the Bill when a rather large part of it is not there. However, I shall come later to the subject of individual voter registration.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09031896000002"></a>I start by declaring an interest, albeit a very small one compared with what my noble friends and others have declared, but I think that it is important. For many years, I have been active, like many others, in the local constituency association where I live and I am a former chairman of that association. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, and my noble friend Lord Hodgson, I think that the state of our parties is a matter of considerable importance and that we should all do all that we can to encourage greater participation in the voluntary side. In particular, I should like to encourage greater participation in the voluntary side of my own party, but I would hope that the other parties might benefit as well.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09031896000003"></a>That should be borne in mind in all our discussions on the Bill because it is important that, as many noble Lords have put it, we do not impose burdens on individual members of associations&#151;we all think particularly of treasurers&#151;that discourage people from becoming actively involved in those associations. I mention treasurers in particular because I remember that when I was chairman of my own local association, we brought in a new constitution, one of the sensible rules being that no officer should remain in office in the association for longer than three years. However, we suspended that almost immediately when we realised that we were not going to be able to find a new treasurer. I think that many people who have been involved in their local associations will have come across that problem. That needs to be borne in mind, particularly when we come to the question of the levels at which to set the various sums that need to be disclosed.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09031896000004"></a>As I said, the Bill is rather different from what was originally introduced and it will change further. I want to discuss a few points before I hand over to the Minister and allow him to answer properly for the Government. The first relates to Clause 13, which concerns the thresholds and limits for donations. These have not been changed since 2000. For that reason, we think it right that they should go up and we will certainly put forward amendments to allow us to discuss whether they have gone up by the right amount or whether they should go up further. That will be an opportunity to debate these matters nine years on from 2000.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09031896000005"></a>It is also important that we should look at the mechanism for increasing those sums in the future. I can see that simply bringing in a power to increase them in line with the RPI each year would, again, make things very difficult for people on the voluntary side of the parties. The thresholds would go up by odd sums and it would be very difficult to remember them.  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_286"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 286</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Therefore, a better approach might be to have some mechanism by which the thresholds could be increased once each Parliament by an appropriate amount that could be looked at by all those concerned. The increase could be broadly in line with inflation or, if necessary, the thresholds could be changed by a greater amount. That could be done by order or it could be included in the Bill. I should certainly welcome the noble Lord&#146;s views on that and on the whole question of what the thresholds in Clause 13 should be.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09031896000006"></a>I move on to Clause 14 and the whole question of triggering. I should like to hear from the noble Lord exactly what the point is of having this triggering mechanism at 55 months. As the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, said, it would have applied in only two of the past 12 Parliaments. It seems a rather pointless thing to have included in the Bill, but the Minister will no doubt give his justification for it in due course and I shall welcome hearing what he has to say.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09031896000007"></a>I turn to the question of penalties&#151;or civil penalties, as I think they were described. The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, rightly made the point that they might be called civil penalties but they look more like criminal penalties than anything else. That was dealt with by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I underline that these will be very difficult for individual members of an association&#151;again, I think particularly of the treasurer&#151;who might, inadvertently, make mistakes. We are all told that ignorance is no defence in criminal law. However, we are told that these are not criminal but civil penalties, although to me they look like criminal penalties. The point is that it does not make the whole job of compliance very easy for the individual member of an association. Would the Government be prepared to consider whether there might be a defence of inadvertently not knowing what was going on? Again, we will bring forward amendments on that in due course.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09031896000008"></a>I now come to the part of the Bill which is not there and which we are debating without having seen it&#151;that is, the part concerning individual voter registration. We were told&#151;I think in the Minister&#146;s response to a question from his noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours&#151;that an amendment will be tabled before the Committee stage. It would have been more helpful to see something now. I appreciate that the Minister could not amend the Bill before Committee, but even a draft of what was coming might have assisted us in this Second Reading debate. Although we have agreed that the Bill will go into the Moses Room for Grand Committee, I have some questions on that in the light of this new and big subject coming in. I make that point simply for the assistance of the usual channels, who can discuss it and tell us their conclusions; we will no doubt do what they say.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09031896000009"></a>We are told that amendments will be tabled on individual voter registration but that, for some peculiar reason, they cannot be brought into effect for at least eight or nine years from now&#151;2017. That is a suspiciously long time and we wonder why the Government are so keen to ensure that individual voter registration is not operable for at least the next two general elections. We know that there may be an election some time later this year or, at worst, in June of next year and that  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_287"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 287</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there will be another in about 2014. I appreciate that it is too early to get anything going for the coming general election, but surely the Government could manage something a little sooner than 2017. After all, this system has been tried and tested in Northern Ireland for some years. We shall be tabling amendments to that effect and I imagine that others will want to question why the Government are being so slow on individual voter registration, which is of considerable importance if we are to stamp out the fairly high degree of postal vote fraud in the past few years.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09031896000010"></a>As is frequently said at the end of the Queen&#146;s Speech, &#147;Other amendments will be put before the House&#148;. Certainly my noble friends and I will make sure that others are brought forward. For example, as suggested by the noble Lords, Lord Neill of Bladen and Lord Rennard, further constraints could be put on postal voting. We will want to give serious consideration to those matters. I wish the Minister well. As I said, we broadly support the Bill as it now looks and we very much support the idea of individual voter registration and what the Minister will introduce, but we will want it a little sooner than he suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="090318101000002"></a>This has been a lively, interesting and well informed debate. There is fantastic expertise in this House on these subjects and the Government are grateful to noble Lords for their contributions. However, I feel that the Bill is in a rather unusual and unfair position as it has been attacked for not being something that it has never pretended to be. It is not the final answer to what has been described as the democratic deficit in this country. That is not this Bill at all. It has a more modest intention; it represents a significant attempt to make important improvements where we can, by agreement. My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis said that to him it represents an advance. That is what it is supposed to be. It is not the final answer to all these issues. It is particularly an advance, we hope, towards a system of party funding that is, first, more transparent and, secondly, better regulated.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="090318101000003"></a>It is in the interests of all parties for the regulations governing party finance and expenditure to be strengthened and for the public to have faith in the democratic process. We have heard interesting comments on all sides about what noble Lords consider to be the democratic state of the nation. We believe that all this can happen only through a consensual approach. These are not matters that can best be decided by partisan politics. The Government&#146;s commitment to move forward on the basis of broad consensus is reflected in the Bill. That does not mean agreeing about everything but is about not doing something that is so out of tune that it is fundamentally opposed. I repeat that the Government are in listening mode to representations as the Bill proceeds, and I suspect that there will be broad support for many of its aspects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="090318101000004"></a>Noble Lords have raised important matters and I look forward to debating them in Grand Committee. In advance, I shall try to deal with some of them now, but I am setting myself a strict time limit because I know that my noble friend beside me will do it if I do not. I start with the issue of donation caps, which is very attractive to noble Lords on all sides of the Chamber, and I can understand why. It is important to go back to Sir Hayden Phillips on this point. To implement a cap without introducing greater state funding would result in major financial instability for political parties. He is right about that because it would impose significant restrictions on parties&#146; freedoms to raise their own funds, and an increase in public funding would be needed to offset the effect of a cap on donations. In other words, his view was that without increased state funding, it was not necessarily right to impose a donation cap. As we have made clear, such fundamental reform of the current party funding regime would need to command cross-party consensus and the confidence of the public. Frankly these conditions do not currently exist.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="090318101000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, made an interesting point&#151;all his points are very interesting&#151;about spending limits starting each year. We do not believe that it is possible to reach consensus on any more fundamental reforms at present. In its limited way, the Bill represents quite a step forward and has broad cross-party consensus. On raising recordable thresholds, as has been referred to from the start of this Second Reading debate, there are differences of opinion. Some believe that we should not raise the threshold at all; others that we should raise it by a little; one or two may even agree with the Government that moving from &#163;200 to &#163;500 is right; but others think that it should be more than that. Let us see how our debates go. The Government&#146;s view is that we have it right.</p>

<a name="90318-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="090318101000006"></a>The interesting point is what we should do in the future. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, had an interesting idea, which may find some support. It would require the Government to review these thresholds once during the life of each Parliament. We want to consider that proposal and perhaps come back to it at a later stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="090318101000011"></a>I move on to the issue of electoral fraud and shall deal with it as quickly as I can. It was raised by a number of noble Lords. I think we are slightly in danger of falling into a trap. Our political system is not corrupt; it is still the envy of the world. That is not to say that it does not have considerable problems, many of which have been raised today. The Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust report <I>Purity of Elections in the UK: Causes for Concern</I> made clear that,</p>
<ul><a name="090318101000028"></a>&#147;there is no hard evidence suggesting a significant increase in electoral malpractice since 2000&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="090318101000026"></a>and the Electoral Commission&#146;s report gave details of prosecutions for electoral malpractice. There were 23 convictions for RPA offences between 2000 and 2006. Convictions do not necessarily occur in the same year as the offence. Published information shows that the number of convictions relating to RPA offences in that period peaked at 11 in 2001, and the number of convictions has since declined. Of course, I am not naive enough to argue that just because there have been no convictions, there have been no cases of fraud. Of course there have been, but we have to put this in perspective.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="090318101000012"></a>It is clear that postal voting has proved popular and has helped to boost turnout. In itself, that is a good thing. We have to take very seriously the risk of electoral fraud, and, as one or two noble Lords said, we have put in a range of measures to safeguard the security of postal voting.

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="090318101000013"></a>Innocent mistakes were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bates. I do not know whether this is the first time he has spoken from the Front Bench in a Second Reading debate, but I congratulate him on his speech. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, and my noble friend Lady Jones also mentioned them. We are considering a concession. We have undertaken to consider this proposal and will return to it in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="090318101000014"></a>I turn to the issue of 55 months. I was surprised by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, on this. I understand that the noble Lord&#146;s colleagues in another place welcomed the proposal that the Government made on 55 months. It is for this Parliament, which may go longer than 55 months. Who knows? It is possible that it may. Let me concede this: these provisions provide for 55 months. I accept that that is a relatively infrequent occurrence. In bringing forward the Bill, we have been clear from the outset that any changes to the regulation of party funding must command a consensus. There is a potential problem of unregulated spending occurring prior to dissolution, and it could still arise in future Parliaments. I regret that we have been unable to find a solution to tackle this that all parties can support. If this House can find a solution, the Government would be extremely grateful. We do not deny that there is a problem, and we are doing something to sort it out for the forthcoming election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="090318101000017"></a>On the next issue, I pray in aid the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen. His expertise on this is probably greater than that of any other noble Lord. There are matters on which he criticised the Bill. Although he says we should have done this sooner, he praised the Government on the move towards individual registration. He made the important point that this is a serious move towards individual registration and is bound to take some time if it is to be done properly because it affects voters all round this country. It took some time to become successful in Northern Ireland. There was a drop in registration when it was first brought in there. I ask noble Lords not to rush ahead of themselves in asking for some ridiculous timetable for this important step.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="090318101000018"></a>I was heard in some parts of the Chamber to say that we would start collecting personal identifiers from August 2010 to August 2015. What I meant to say, and what I think I said, was autumn 2010 and autumn 2015. I make that point if I was wrong.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="090318101000019"></a>As far as pilots for individual registration are concerned, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would like this to be a pilot case. He may recall better than most of us the provisions for the collection of personal identifiers from electors on a pilot basis that were brought forward in the Electoral Administration Bill 2006. Those provisions were removed and replaced with provisions for the universal collection of postal vote identifiers brought forward by my noble friend Lord Elder in response to a consensus around the House that we should get on with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="090318101000020"></a>Moving on to the commission itself, there were some issues around the fourth member with some political experience. Nominated commissioners&#151;those with political experience&#151;will not be party representatives just as they were not, I believe, on the noble Lord&#146;s committee. We believe that it is right that there are four nominated commissioners&#151;there was some support around the House for that&#151;allowing the perspective of one smaller party to be heard. This was a recommendation from the CSPL. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, also had a view on this. The proposal that there should be some members of the commission with some political experience was supported by all parties during the Commons stages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="090318101000021"></a>My noble friend Lady Gould, who also has huge experience in this field, asked about candidate spending rules. The Electoral Commission said before the Public Bill Committee in the other place that it would aim to publish draft guidance on the Bill&#146;s original proposals in January and then finalise its guidance as soon as possible after the Bill has completed its passage. However, I think it would say that that is an indicative timeframe rather than anything more precise.</p>

We have heard of some of the difficulties that local parties on all sides have found and those of Members of Parliament. An honourable friend in the other place tabled an amendment seeking to achieve this. Opposition parties did not dissent and thus the proposal was included in the Bill, appeared on Report and has come to this House.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="090318101000023"></a>Compliance officers are intended to assist elected office holders with requests of compliance set down by the 2000 Act. However, they do not absolve office holders from responsibility for compliance themselves. I look forward to discussing compliance officers in Committee. Any holder of a relevant elective office&#151;that obviously will be a Member of the other place, a Member of the other Parliaments and Assemblies in the UK, or a member of a local authority in London and elsewhere&#151;will be able to appoint a compliance officer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="090318101000024"></a>My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis asked what discussions had taken place with the Electoral Commission and others concerning the Bill. We are in regular contact with the Electoral Commission at all levels and we are aware of its views on the Bill, much of which it supports, I am glad to say. It does not support everything in the Bill but we have an honest and open dialogue with it which we hope will continue to be constructive. We believe that the measures in the Bill concerning the Electoral Commission will assist it to do an even better job than it has so far done.</p>

The problem is that many businesses will become balance-sheet insolvent as soon as they receive their rate demands. For this reason, some local authorities  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_292"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have delayed issuing rate demands because they are waiting for this SI and its regulations. The situation is unusual. When matters go awry, it is usually due to the errors and omissions of Ministers some time ago. This is not the case today. The problem is that the Ministers are unwilling or unable to put the situation right.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="090318104000002"></a>It may be helpful if I explain the background to the problem. In the beginning, at the time of the nationalisation of the ports, it was decided that it would be appropriate for the Secretary of State to prescribe the rateable value of the whole port. The local authorities raised a rate demand on the whole port based upon the prescribed rateable value. When the 55 statutory ports were privatised, prescription continued. The businesses within the port did not pay rates; they occupied premises within the port, under a licence, as part of a commercial contract with the port owner. The terms and conditions of those contracts would vary depending on the nature of the operation of the occupier. For example, it may have been a crane hire company, a stevedoring company, a storage company, a freight-forwarding company or any one of the numerous operations that take place within a port.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="090318104000003"></a>However, rates were not an issue as they were covered by the port owner. Quite properly, the Government decided to return all 55 statutory ports to what are termed &#147;normal rating principles&#148;; in other words, the same principle which every business in the United Kingdom works under. This was fine, but in 2000 the then junior Minister at the DETR, Beverley Hughes, had to prolong prescription until 2005, and there were good reasons for that. The Valuation Office Agency has a statutory duty to compile and maintain accurate rating lists, which for the port businesses had to come into force on 1 April 2005. The VOA obviously had to undertake this valuation of the ports before that point. Unfortunately, the VOA woke up to its obligations only in 2006, and while it may have informed the port operators and owners, the port businesses and occupiers were not informed in advance of any change in the system or any increase in rates.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="090318104000004"></a>We are not talking about one isolated firm being out of the loop; this affects many different businesses in many different ports. Businesses in ports are now receiving massive retrospective and totally unexpected rate demands. In many cases these are financially devastating. Of course, for some port businesses these increases are modest and they have been able to pay the rate demand without any serious difficulty. I have no doubt the Minister will draw your Lordships&#146; attention to this.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="090318104000005"></a>Let me give a few examples to illustrate the magnitude of the problem. I have been informed that for each of the past four years TTS (Shipping) Limited has paid corporation tax, national insurance contributions and PAYE of between &#163;425,000 and &#163;860,000 a year. In 2007 its retained profit was less than &#163;40,000 and it believes it has a backdated liability for rates of more than &#163;1 million. If your Lordships should uncharitably think that TTS Shipping is a small firm which would benefit from improved information acquisition, how about DFDS Tor Line plc, which has a backdated rates demand of &#163;9.9 million and an increased annual liability of &#163;3 million. The MD of DFDS Tor Line has  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_293"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>written to me indicating that his main board is considering relocating the business outside the UK. The rates bill of Freshney Cargo Services has gone from &#163;48,000 to over &#163;850,000, far more than its best ever year&#146;s profit, and its retrospective liability is &#163;2.4 million, something it never expected to have.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="090318104000006"></a>All these businesses will have had proper plans and a proper cash-flow forecast. They had commercial arrangements with the port owners and their own customers and they thought they knew what their cost of operation was. Without the SI, these retrospective rate demands will have to be paid almost immediately. The effect of the SI to which my Motion refers is to give the companies concerned up to eight years to pay the rate demand. This demonstrates that a very serious problem exists, otherwise why would the Minister have done it? I am not opposing the order, because it will solve the problem for a few, but for many it will only prolong the agony in that on their balance sheet their liability will exceed their assets.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="090318104000007"></a>However, if directors of affected businesses reasonably believe that they can trade through the problem, it might be legal to continue trading. Expensive legal advice will have to be taken&#151;and often&#151;because presumably every time they have a setback it will increase their liability on the balance sheet, and being balance-sheet insolvent will mean banking covenants may be breached; it will be even harder to raise finance, which is extremely difficult in any case; and if finance can be raised, it will be very dear. For many, the financial strain will be too much and the business will collapse, with the attendant loss of employment.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="090318104000008"></a>Your Lordships will have noticed that the SI experienced a rough passage through this House&#146;s Merits Committee. I will not rehearse the committee&#146;s concerns in detail, but it was extremely disappointed about the amount of information accompanying the order and, therefore, the ability of Parliament to properly consider the regulations. There was also concern about European state aid rules being breached, but I shall not weary your Lordships with that argument.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="090318104000009"></a>The situation I have described is serious. The regulations do not solve the problem; the solution is to revert to the old system of prescription and the original rating lists. It is important to understand that it is not as if the ports, and the businesses within them, were exempt from rates; it was just a different system. I am sure that the Minister will not tell us that no rating system was in place prior to 2005, and I hope that she will not suggest that I am proposing to write off the debt; I am not. I am suggesting reverting to the original system. Ministers constantly say that these retrospective rates are due under the law, which is quite right, but the law implemented by the Government is having completely unintended consequences that arise not from ministerial failings but, frankly, from incompetence at the VOA. Ministers need to go for primary legislation, delay implementing normal rating principles until April next year, and continue to use the old rating lists.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="090318104000010"></a>I fully appreciate the difficulties that the DCLG and transport Ministers find themselves in. Even in normal times, it is not easy to find a slot for primary legislation. It will be even more difficult now; my  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_294"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble friend Lord Bates will say a little more on this point from the Front Bench. I am convinced that, at some stage, the Minister will have to return to this House with primary legislation. I urge her to do that sooner rather than later. The Minister will not come to the Dispatch Box unarmed; she will tell your Lordships that many businesses are relisted during the year, and the ratings change. That is right, but the ports are different.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="090318104000011"></a>If an ordinary business takes on new or altered business premises inland and is subject to the normal rating principles, any competent surveyor can indicate, reasonably accurately, what their rateable value will be, and hence the rates to be paid. An allowance for those rates can be made in the company&#146;s business plan and cash-flow forecasts. If the local authority, for any reason, delays or omits to issue a rate demand, the business will not be able to organise a party. The estimated rates will have to be shown on the balance sheet as an accrual, and provision will have to be made in the cash-flow forecast. The ports, however, are different. The commercial arrangements between the port owners and port businesses were predicated upon the pre-2005 rating arrangements, so, for those businesses, rates were not an issue. They simply did not need to be considered by a port business, as long as the port was operating under the prescribed rather than normal rating rules.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="090318104000012"></a>The Minister will say that to write off debt would be unfair to other ratepayers. First, I have already explained that I am not proposing a write-off. Secondly, to which other ratepayers would it be unfair, since there was always a rating system for the ports? Finally, the favourite phrase at the moment is, &#147;in the current economic circumstances&#148;. These circumstances are not good; shipping is already badly affected, as the ports will be. We cannot save every business, but let us avoid making it unnecessarily difficult for those companies to survive our current economic problems. I beg to move.</p>

I have no interest in ports, apart from being a harbour commissioner in the port of Fowey in Cornwall, which is not significantly affected by this, but from going around the country talking to people in ports I hear the concern that they have about these regulations.

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="090318104000014"></a>My worry is that these businesses, which have sometimes been operating in the ports for many years, are in strong competition with each other and with other ports and, as the noble Earl said, they have had no means of assessing what their future rate demands would be because the Valuation Office Agency had not got around to telling them. They have ended up not being able to charge their customers or make provisions, as they do not know how much to charge, but they receive these massive bills three or four years later.</p>

The committee suggested, as the noble Earl has said, that the Government should,</p>
<ul><a name="090318104000019"></a>&#147;consider the proposal to maintain the rateable values of premises in statutory docks and harbours at the levels published in the April 2005 rating lists until the new rating list is published in 2010&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090318104000018"></a>That seems perfectly reasonable; they will still have to pay rates, but at least it will be on the basis that they understood before. This issue happened on the railways five or 10 years ago; I think that has been resolved now, but I agree with the noble Earl about the increased rate demands faced by these companies. Companies will be going into liquidation. They may have eight years to pay, but if they cannot pay anyway it does not help matters much.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="090318104000016"></a>We are in a situation of severe economic problems. We have a Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform that is trying to help companies survive and prosper. I would hope that this matter could be resolved by some good joined-up government between my noble friend&#146;s department, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, and the Treasury. I fear that enough companies will be going into liquidation without those poor people operating at the ports joining them&#151;and it is not just the port companies but the ports themselves. Associated British Ports tells me that its demand has gone up really dramatically because of this revaluation, by 100 per cent to &#163;7 million a year. Now, it is a big company, but I hope that my noble friend will agree that a 100 per cent increase, backdated again, is difficult for companies to suffer. I look forward to what she will say, but at the moment my inclination is to join the noble Earl if he puts the Question to the House.</p>

Both noble Lords who have spoken covered how this situation arose, but it is unfortunate that the Government did not take a leaf out of Scotland&#146;s book. There, they saw the problem arising, instituted proper consultation and did something about it. This problem could easily have been got around and, as the noble Earl said, it was only due to the inefficiency of the Valuation Office Agency, which did not complete its statutory obligation to produce new rating valuations by April 2005.</p>

Another company on Merseyside, which has a turnover&#151;not profit&#151;of &#163;1.8 million has received a rating bill for &#163;1 million.

First, I am totally against anything retrospective in principle, but where the ports are concerned, on a more positive note, I should like to paint a picture of what is happening out there at the moment. We are heavily involved in the trade routes of this country. To declare my interest, I ran P&amp;O for 22 years. We had probably the largest fleet by far in Europe and also controlled many of the ports worldwide, so I am speaking with that experience behind me. I am still life president of P&amp;O and also chairman of Swan Hellenic ships.</p>

<a name="90318-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="090318109000005"></a>I suggest to the Government that this is a great opportunity. The great shipping companies can choose anywhere to land their goods. If you take the far eastern trade, you have the choice of going to our ports, or to Le Havre, Zeebrugge, Rotterdam, Antwerp, Bremen, Hamburg, and so on. But at the moment, the weakness in sterling, which in a strange way might be a strength, gives us an opportunity to offer a service which will entice many of these companies to bring their ships to our ports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="090318109000006"></a>At the moment, many of us are very troubled about what is happening in the City of London and what we might be losing abroad. But it is often not realised that the ports of this country are extremely vibrant. Those ships have the effect of creating massive businesses in the surrounding areas of our great ports. This is a marvellous opportunity to give these companies the chance to bring further business to this country. It is not, therefore, the time to burden them with having to pay extra moneys in this form.</p>

He set out very clearly the history and background to this, and there is no point in any of us repeating that. However, I should like to speak about the position of local authorities in some of these ports. They are under a statutory duty to send out these bills and collect the money, yet there are councillors, including my colleagues in Hull and Liverpool, who are extremely unhappy about this because their first interest is the health of their port, its value to the local economy and to the economy of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="090318109000008"></a>Our view is that this mess that has been caused by the Government and the Valuation Office Agency for which they are responsible. The Government therefore have to take full responsibility for finding a satisfactory solution to the problem. The Treasury Committee proposed a solution, which the noble Earl recommended, of port ratings being maintained at the levels published in the 2005 lists until the next scheduled revaluation of statutory ports is undertaken in 2010. Whether that is the right way forward is for the Government to decide,

If they do not adopt this proposal, they have to come up with a solution that is not simply telling companies they have eight years to pay the money back.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="090318109000009"></a>The ports industry is vital to the British economy. To penalise this vital industry in a recession is economic madness and will only hinder any recovery. Cancelling back payments does not set a precedent for other business rates, but it will be a powerful reminder to Government and their agencies of the terrible impact mistakes can have on British companies and consumers. We all know that mistakes can be made and in modern organisations, mistakes will be made. The important thing is that when that happens, solutions are found.</p>

At a time when seldom a week goes by without a Minister coming to the Dispatch Box to announce some initiative to rescue the car industry, the banks or the housing industry, it seems like a classic own goal to allow this measure, which will cost real jobs, to go through. As we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, there are some businesses for which it is already too late&#151;they have gone into receivership. Many are clinging on by their fingernails. CAT UK, a company based in Grangetown in the north-east of England is doing good business in very tough times, importing cars from Renault. It has been faced with a tax bill of &#163;500,000. That is a huge sum; even if it is repaid over eight years, it still amounts to something like &#163;40,000 per year.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="090318109000012"></a>I do not know whether the Minister is aware of how many of these businesses are at the tipping point, where something like this will tip them over the edge. Is she aware of the difficult relationship that many of these companies have with their banks? The fact that a liability has to be crystallised and recognised on their balance sheet will cause great difficulties with the banks and in accessing appropriate credit. The Government&#146;s Insolvency Service has warned Ministers that the liability will remain even if the debt is repaid by instalments. It wrote to John Healey on 9 February 2009, saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="090318109000070"></a>&#147;The debt, like any other, would need to have to be booked immediately. Depending on the company&#146;s overall financial strength, it may not have the assets to cover this additional liability. In such circumstances, the company would be balance sheet insolvent&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090318109000065"></a>These are very serious charges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="090318109000013"></a>If this was due to the recklessness of the companies themselves&#151;some 1,600 in 55 ports are affected by this&#151;of course one could not expect the Government to go round bailing people out left, right and centre. But this was not a result of the recklessness of those 1,600 businesses; this was a result of the recklessness and failure of the Valuation Office Agency, as has been acknowledged.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="090318109000014"></a>The fault does not stop at the Valuation Office Agency. It was responsible for not consulting, but under the Treasury&#146;s own guidelines, no impact assessment

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="090318109000015"></a>There is an irrefutable case for rethinking this policy before it is too late. It will cost jobs in many business that are really struggling at the present time. It will be a catastrophic own goal. We shall drive business offshore. My noble friend Lord Sterling spoke about the options that shipping companies have. Those apply not only to the companies that were mentioned. I mentioned CAT UK. Renault is talking to it about the possibility of relocating its operations to Zeebrugge and shipping cars across as they are needed to order, rather than storing them port side. On the negative side, this is an own goal. However, on the positive side, it is a marvellous opportunity for the Government to come to the rescue.</p>

I am very grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, for giving me an opportunity to set out the Government&#146;s concerns on this issue and the reasons for our having come forward with our propositions. I am grateful, too, to all noble Lords who have spoken in the debate. It has been a measured debate, which the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, introduced extremely clearly. A spread of expertise has been shown around the House which has aided the debate.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="090318109000017"></a>I completely understand that the debate has aroused considerable concerns and accept that noble Lords&#146; anxiety is well placed. The issues were raised in the context of the Non-Domestic Rating (Collection and Enforcement) (Local Lists) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2009 that were laid before the House on 10 February. Concern is not confined to this House: there have been two Adjournment debates in the other place. Much of what I say will reflect what Ministers in the other place have said, and I shall refer to some of the correspondence between Ministers and the Insolvency Service, to which the noble Lord, Lord Bates, has already referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="090318109000018"></a>Before I address the arguments put by noble Lords, I should put the regulations and their aim in their policy and regulatory context&#151;I shall perhaps address some of the grievances raised by the Merits Committee in doing so. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, gave a good summary of the history of why we are in this position.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="090318109000019"></a>Although the debate has been largely about ports, the relevant regulations are not aimed exclusively at ports; they apply equally across England to all businesses, sectors, and areas which now find themselves with a significant and unexpected backdated rates liability incurred by their property being separately rated by the VOA&#151;I shall use the short term to save time. Therefore, although the debate is concerned primarily  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_299"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with ports, there is certainly a wider concern, which has obviously been made worse by the current economic situation. The regulations are designed to ease the pain and go beyond ports alone. For example, in the current financial year up to 31 October, 1,666 properties had a backdated adjustment to their rates liability of more than 33 months, including some in ports.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="090318109000020"></a>I start by saying that the Government are deeply concerned. Those concerns were set out in a letter from the right honourable Stephen Timms and the right honourable John Healey, from my own department, to the Treasury Sub-Committee on 10 February. They said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="090318109000071"></a>&#147;We have consistently said, in the current economic conditions, the Government is concerned about the impact of backdated rates liability on the trading prospects of businesses and we believe that there is a general case to assist businesses receiving large, unexpected backdated liabilities that have to be paid immediately, as the position for a number of port occupiers has demonstrated&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090318109000066"></a>We are providing such assistance. That is why the regulations allow businesses in such circumstances the unprecedented scope to schedule payment of backdated business rates over eight years. I shall come to why we have arrived at that position rather than some of the other options put forward by noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="090318109000021"></a>The current situation in law is that each of our 55 major ports and container terminals in England and Wales is run by a designated port operator which has overall responsibility for business rates, except where any part falls to be separately rated. Properties have been separately rated over the years depending primarily on whether the occupier of that separate part is in &#147;paramount&#148; control; for example, a port chandler&#146;s shop independently controlled of the port operator. There has therefore always been a mixed economy within the ports: it is a rather murky picture economically.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="090318109000022"></a>There were 1,600 separate assessments within 45 ports in England, and more than 250 assessments within 10 ports in Wales, on the list at 1 April 2005 before the ports review commenced&#151;I shall come back to that. The situation now facing port occupiers stems from two separate developments which I need to put on the record.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="090318109000023"></a>The first issue, as the noble Earl pointed out, was the move away from prescribed rating for the statutory port operators. The larger statutory docks and harbours were, until 31 March 2005, subject to a methodology for valuation&#151;prescription&#151;by which the valuation was determined by reference to a formula set by the Secretary of State. The Government decided in the Local Government Act 2003 to end prescription and replace it with conventional rating. That formed part of the long-term policy to apply conventional rating to ports and other utilities, which meant essentially that we were anxious to ensure that everyone was rated on the same independent basis. As with all other forms of rating, the Valuation Office Agency relies on the provision of accurate information to assess the rateable value of property.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="090318109000024"></a>The second issue was the review of ports, which became necessary after a change to the Southampton Container Terminal valuation in 2004 identified some properties which should have been rated separately from the port operator&#146;s assessment. The physical, in  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_300"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>situ review of ports by the VOA which commenced in 2006 was able to establish the full nature of the situation in all ports and ensure that all individual businesses within and outside of ports were treated in the same way. It was clear that the same situation could exist elsewhere, so, in May 2006, once the Southampton appeal was settled, which took some time, and the status of some port tenants was clarified, the VOA immediately began its review across all 55 major ports in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="090318109000025"></a>Noble Lords might well ask why that physical inspection had not been done previously and why the VOA had been content to take the information unchallenged. The VOA is reliant in all its work on information that it receives to keep the ratings list accurate. It was only when it discovered an inaccuracy that might have been replicated that it was under an obligation to conduct a proper and full review.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="090318109000026"></a>The review discovered that there were many properties eligible for separate rating which had never been listed, and the result was to increase from 1,643 to 2,248 the number of properties in ports separately assessed for business rates. They were rated with a rateable value of around &#163;53 million from 1 April 2005. It is those properties that now find themselves with significant and unexpected backdated liabilities. Noble Lords have put on the record the scale of some of those unexpected liabilities.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="090318109000027"></a>That is not the whole story, however, because the rating review has not had the same impact on every business in every port; indeed, it has been reported by local authorities that some &#163;1.7 million of backdated liability has been paid. However, I can say to the noble Lord, Lord Bates, in particular, in view of his powerful summing-up, that there is a case to be answered where businesses have been badly affected.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="090318109000028"></a>The VOA is not under the control of my department, which is responsible for the collection and distribution of business rates; it is the responsibility of the Treasury and HMRC. The VOA has acknowledged, in response to the Treasury Select Committee, that there were serious failures of communication, particularly with the occupiers, and by implication that too much reliance was placed on information being provided by the port operators. Andrew Hudson, head of the VOA, indicated to the Select Committee:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="090318109000072"></a>&#147;With the benefit of hindsight we have learned a lesson and please God this does not come up again: if it were to, we would seek to improve our communications with the occupiers as well as the operators&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090318109000067"></a>Indeed, Mr Hudson accepted that,</p>
<ul><a name="090318109000074"></a>&#147;in practice some of the people who have written in were not aware that this work was going on&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090318109000068"></a>So the VOA has put its hands up and said that yes, there was a communications failure.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="090318109000029"></a>I do not think that apologies are often sufficient. However, there is another explanation of why the review took so long&#151;because it did take a long time. It was a slow process. Part of that explanation is that deciding which operators should be separately rated was not straightforward. It was not just a matter of going out and looking at the properties; it was a matter of trying to establish the exact degree of control exercised by either port operator or port occupier. It  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_301"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 301</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was also complicated by the varying nature of ports and continuing changes in operational practice. The VOA said that some operators were more helpful and co-operative in that regard than others. The review would have been completed sooner if operators and occupiers, some of them large businesses with professional advisers, had supplied information more willingly. That point is important, because it was the length of time that the review took that made the bills accumulate.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="090318109000030"></a>The VOA recognises that its communications could have been better. The Director of Rating accepted:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="090318109000073"></a>&#147;Perhaps with hindsight we should have done more investigative work&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090318109000069"></a>Yes, I think that it should have done. However, The VOA wrote to all port operators in May 2006 advising that a full review of assessments would need to be undertaken, and followed this up in October 2006 when detailed replies had not been received. The letter explained the background and requested that the operators ensured that their tenants, whose identity would not necessarily be known to the VOA, because of the previous inclusive formula basis of valuation, were alerted. There seems to have been a lack of communication between operators and occupiers as well.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="090318109000031"></a>Another issue has been raised in another place, which I should also like to put on record. Many commentators have indicated that it is doubly unfair on the occupiers that these companies have to pay their rates liability as some port occupiers claim they had already paid their rates via their fees to the port operators. It is described as the Cumulo system. Port occupiers have told CLG that, when the designated port operator was regarded as liable to pay business rates, the contractual arrangements between the port operators and port occupiers typically contained explicit or implicit fee elements to cover the business rates incurred by the port operator. The Treasury Select Committee indicated that payments should be taken into account. However, it is not all that simple; nothing in this story is simple.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="090318109000032"></a>First, the liable party for business rates is the business in occupation of a property, not the landlord. Secondly, there is a serious absence of evidence that the port occupier&#146;s fees made a specific contribution to rates. We have asked the CLG for that evidence; the only contract that we have seen is ambiguously worded, saying that when the property is separately rated the occupier is liable for rates. Clearly that is a matter between the port operators and the occupiers&#151;between the landlords and tenants. It is part of the background of why the situation is so murky.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="090318109000033"></a>I quite understand that the grievance felt by the port occupiers is compounded by the fact that, with independent rating, the rates payable by the port operators themselves have in some cases declined. Although the review has resulted in an increase in the aggregate rateable value from around &#163;201 million to about &#163;211 million, the main issue for the newly assessed port occupiers is backdating the effect of the review. The port operators&#146; liability has in some cases reduced. I merely raise the question whether there is not a moral issue here for the port operators themselves.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_302"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 302</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="090318109000034"></a>That is the background. I hope that I can be forgiven for putting that on the record, because it is very important that we understand the complexity of the situation. I turn now to what can be done to ease the situation, and the options that have been put forward. The suggestions put forward, outside this House and by the noble Earl and other noble Lords, include the suggestion to waive liabilities entirely by postponing or changing the alteration and its effect to the ratings list until 2010; to prescribe, as the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, suggested, the value of the separately assessed properties as zero; or to return to prescription of the statutory ports. The noble Earl has not raised the question of a waiver, and it is sensible not to do so, because it would raise some massive issues about the ratings system. It is worth saying that the integrity of the ratings system, to which we all subscribe, is that it has to be fair and equitable and that, therefore, any solution must not confer a disadvantage among other rate payers who have paid rates and were billed on time.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="090318109000035"></a>It is also inescapable, as the noble Earl said, that valuation officers are required by law to maintain accurate rating lists. When they become aware that a change is needed, as they did in the ports, they must make the alteration and specify the date when the change should take place. The date of the change is governed by legislation. When the correction is to insert into the rating list property that existed prior to the compilation of the 2005 list, backdating to the beginning of the list is required. Backdating is an integral part of the system of non-domestic rates; it reflects the volatility of the constant changes in the commercial property market.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="090318109000036"></a>Furthermore, no discretion is given to either the Valuation Office Agency or Ministers to waive a liability to taxation. I think that that is right, as it would not be in the interests of fair competition or in line with the principles of taxation for such a liability to be waived. It is because of this, and the fact that we cannot now pretend that we do not have the full facts of the case, that we cannot undo what has been done and maintain the list as at 1 April 2005 and hold off until 2010 when the next rating list comes along. That proposition introduces a much bigger issue; it would mean that, unlike all other tenants across England liable for rates, including the separately assessed properties in ports identified from the start of the 2005 list, these newly rated businesses would be given a directly favoured tax advantage over assessed properties. That is where the unfairness would lie in this context.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="090318109000037"></a>The second option is that the Government should prescribe the values of the separately assessed properties. I return to the Treasury Select Committee recommendation. In effect, it would be a return to prescription, but maintaining the rateable values of properties as at 1 April 2005 would require these newly assessed properties to be given a zero rating as from 1 April 2005. In effect, it is still tantamount to a waiver. There are other serious problems with doing that, as it would not solve the problem that noble Lords identified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="090318109000038"></a>The Secretary of State still has the power to prescribe rules for ascertaining rateable values and, in theory, she could use those powers to prescribe rateable values for the individual businesses at ports. However, it is

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="090318109000039"></a>None of the other 1.7 million properties on the business rating list is valued other than on the basis of market rent and there is no clear rationale for special treatment. In particular, there is no basis on which a low rateable value could be established. If the valuation methodology were challenged in the courts by any other ratepayer whose property is valued conventionally, it would be difficult to defend in rationality and reasonableness terms.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="090318109000040"></a>With regard to prescribing the statutory ports by a formula again, even if we were to return to prescription&#151;the old system, as the noble Earl explained it&#151;the properties now separately identified for rates would nevertheless continue to be separately rated, because that is what the legislation requires, and the only effect would be to alter the rating method for the port operator.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="090318109000041"></a>I know that this is disappointing in many respects because it would seem that some of these options offer a solution. In fact, we have come to the limits of what the Government can do in what we have done. Following the Chancellor's announcement in the Pre-Budget Report, we have quite exceptionally put in place a scheme to help all businesses, which may include some occupiers of ports, pay significant and unexpected backdated liabilities over eight years. We have never done that before: it is a long period of time. The Government have estimated that that will benefit up to 1,500 properties a year across England both within and outside of ports and will give help with cash-flow problems faced by some companies.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="090318109000042"></a>If we were simply to say that it is all too difficult and let the law take its course, the port occupiers and other businesses would still be liable for a backdated rates liability, but that liability would apply from the end of March and would have to be paid within two weeks. That would be the effect of revoking the regulations as well, which why we were so pleased to hear the noble Earl say that he was in favour of the principle of the regulations. Furthermore, local authorities will, in order to act diligently, have to bill the businesses and take collection and enforcement action. Otherwise, they may be required to fund the required contribution themselves to central government.</p>

<a name="90318-0011.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="090318109000043"></a>What else are we doing? The Valuation Office Agency is playing its part. It has put in place a fast track for appeals so that businesses that face significant bills can challenge their assessments. I understand that 70 have already done so. Local authorities, once they knew that this was likely to come their way, began to gear up immediately and they have been given information by the CLG so that they can prepare schedules of payments. They are very organised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="090318109000044"></a>I can also give some assurances about technical insolvency, which I hope will be of some help. I am aware that many businesses have said that, despite this exceptional arrangement to spread payments, they will have to add this liability to their balance sheets. That will mean that they will become technically insolvent, and as a result, although they may be in a position to continue their businesses, technically they will have to cease trading. That is a serious matter. The department has taken advice from experts in the Insolvency Service and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. Clearly, the outcome will depend on the individual circumstance of each business on a case-by-case basis, but it will depend on the level of both the existing assets and liabilities when the backdated rates bill was received and the directors&#146; reasonable expectations of being able to meet their liabilities as they fall due in the future. The advice that the department has received is clear on the fact that the additional liability is not in and of itself a de facto reason for a company becoming insolvent. We want to ensure that that is widely understood, so that companies can continue trading where there is a reasonable expectation of being able to meet their liabilities in the future.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="090318109000045"></a>The substance of that was put in a letter from my right honourable friends John Healey and Stephen Timms to the Treasury Select Committee. I shall put that letter in the Library and I hope that noble Lords will feel that they can make use of it. We will also see whether we can put it on government websites so that it will be accessible. In addition, companies can of course get advice from legal support, qualified accountants, authorised insolvency practitioners and so forth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="090318109000046"></a>I am sorry to have taken the time of the House at such length. Nobody would deny that this is an extremely difficult matter. It is one that we wish had not arisen and certainly not at this time. We do not deny that. We have done what we can do to assist within the current law and system of business rates. I hope that noble Lords who have spoken will accept that and will not press their case to a vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="090318109000048"></a>The Minister has skilfully tried to tempt me to withdraw my Motion but I cannot do so because it is accurate. The regulations will not prevent insolvencies from occurring. In the later stages of her response, the Minister touched on the insolvency issue, but I anticipated her response. Businesses will still experience the problems that I described. They will find it extremely difficult to raise finance. She also touched on seeking professional advice. In these circumstances, professional advice would be very expensive. The Minister pointed out that the regulations do not just benefit port occupiers but they benefit the whole of the business community. That is just as well, otherwise the regulations would definitely fall foul of EU state aid rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="090318109000049"></a>The Minister indicated that the problem is largely a commercial problem between the port operator and the port businesses. She is suggesting renegotiating a commercial contract after the supply of the goods and services in question, so that the port operator can pay money to the port business, even though that was not provided in the original contract. I do not know how many commercial negotiations the Minister has taken part in, but I fear that such negotiations might be a bit tricky. Moreover, I wonder how often central government have paid out money which is not due under a contract. I am certain that Ministers will have to do much more than the regulations provide for at some point in the future. The Minister explained how difficult and how complex these arrangements are; I accept it will not be easy but, at some point, more will have to be done. This is not the time to impose a huge, retrospective financial burden on businesses in an already fragile industry. I should like the House to determine this matter. I beg to move.</p>

That distress is often increased when they are prescribed antidepressants, which sometimes unjustly have a reputation with the general public of not doing any good.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="090318109000052"></a>Depression and its stablemate anxiety are the most common mental health disorders. One in five people will suffer from them at some stage in their lives, with one in 50 suffering from severe depression. People are often reluctant to go to their GPs because, understandably, no one wants mental illness on their medical record&#151;people are afraid that it will affect job prospects in the future.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="090318109000053"></a>As the economic situation worsens, more people are forced to face unemployment, debt and loss of self-respect, which can only make depression more likely. This problem is urgent. The treatments currently available are the talking therapies and drugs. Despite the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence asking doctors to use drugs with caution, they cost the NHS &#163;400 million per annum.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="090318109000054"></a>I have always been enthusiastic about cognitive behavioural therapy, which from now on I shall call CBT. Long ago, I worked in a centre where it was being used. It seeks to teach people skills to tackle their problems. It needs well trained and experienced therapists, which the NHS does not have in great number. Everyone who needs a therapist should be able to access one, but I understand that in some parts of the country it takes up to 18 months for a suffering person to see a psychotherapist. That is useless and unacceptable. Last May, the King&#146;s Fund found that one-third of people suffering from depression were not getting any treatment. That is a lot of human misery. Even so, the cost of treating depression&#151;also according to the Kings Fund&#151;is &#163;1.7 billion per annum. The cost of lost employment is &#163;7.5 billion per annum. The problem is urgent and escalating.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="090318109000055"></a>The Government have taken some important steps in recent years. They aim to make therapy more accessible and announced about two weeks ago that psychotherapy centres, to which patients will be referred directly, would be established in all primary care trusts. This will involve training 3,600 more psychotherapists. However, it takes about four or five years for them to become competent and the problem is more urgent than that; we do not have the time to train that many people.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="090318109000056"></a>The rather irritating fact is that the Government have had a partial solution at their disposal for some time in the form of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy. This, I emphasise, is useful for mild to moderate depression. At this juncture, I declare that I have absolutely no financial interest whatever in any company that provides software for these therapies.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="090318109000057"></a>In February 2006, NICE recommended that primary care trusts should purchase and use computerised CBT, and a treatment called &#147;Beating the Blues&#148; was recommended. It should have been available 90 days after recommendation; primary care trusts are obliged to provide their patients with what NICE recommends. It would treat 400,000 people each year, producing a cost benefit to the NHS of &#163;126 million a year. Despite this, there has been only about 15 per cent take-up by the primary care trusts. To date, nine primary care trusts have complied with NICE guidance. It is another NHS treatment at the mercy of the postcode lottery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="090318109000058"></a>Many who have used &#147;Beating the Blues&#148; have found it very helpful in dealing with their problems. The Government have failed too many people who are suffering. The problem of depression is immediate and requires treatment now. The Department of Health has been offered a way by NICE, which approved &#147;Beating the Blues&#148;, to treat people as part of its access to psychotherapy programmes, but it has failed to take up the recommendation.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="090318109000059"></a>Ministers have given all sorts of assurances over the years. In March 2006, the White Paper <I>Our </I><I>Care, Our Health, Our Say</I> included a commitment to support primary care trusts in delivering these computerised treatments. In November 2007, the national director for mental health, Louis Appleby, wrote to all primary care trusts reminding them of the obligation to provide computerised CBT by 31 March 2007. On 28 March 2007, Patricia Hewitt, then Secretary of State for Health, told us that patients would have this service provided by their primary care trust. In December 2008, only a few months ago, Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said that primary care trusts were obliged to provide funding for NICE-recommended computerised CBT packages.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="090318109000060"></a>So where is it? Why is it not being delivered? We get more and more announcements and commitments to mental health services, but this promise is yet to be delivered three years on. Alan Johnson has tried to be helpful by saying that patients who are dissatisfied with the non-availability of a treatment should take up their concerns through the NHS complaints procedure. In my opinion, an already mildly depressed patient might become very seriously depressed or even suicidal if they had to tackle the NHS complaints procedure. I had plenty of experience of that with my constituents in the other place.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="090318109000061"></a>The trouble is that government promises are not being delivered&#151;period, as Tony Blair used to say. I appreciate that, in some sections of the profession, it will be said that a computer program cannot replace a face-to-face session with a trained psychotherapist. Maybe not, but it can replace a non-existent psychotherapist, which is currently the reality for most patients with mild to moderate depression.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="090318109000062"></a>This should not be a consideration in clinical treatment, but it is worth remembering that, in 2004, the noble Lord, Lord Layard, in his paper <I>Mental Health: Britain</I><I>&#146;</I><I>s Biggest Social Problem?</I>, estimated that the cost then of a course of face-to-face CBT was &#163;750, whereas, according to NICE, the computerised program that that body had approved cost &#163;45. That is a huge difference. Help could be made available to far more patients. We must also remember that many young people who suffer from depression spend an awful lot of time with their computers. My young people certainly do; I sometimes think that Facebook has replaced the pub for some of them. We may sneer, but it is the most natural thing in the world for them to talk to a computer.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="090318109000063"></a>In conclusion, we cannot wait any longer for evaluations and reports to see whether greater access to CBT is being achieved for patients with mild to moderate depression. There is a proven treatment, but it is still not available in the vast majority of primary

It is timely because of the recession that is now upon us, and which will do so much damage to the mental health of so many citizens of this country.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="090318110000002"></a>The goods news is that the Government, well before the recession was even dreamt of, had embarked on the programme to which the noble Baroness refers, which will revolutionise the availability of psychological therapy services in this country. I do not think that any of us are opposed to computerised CBT, as recommended by NICE as part of the stepped-care system; of course, it is one of the rather low steps. It has also required the participation of a living therapist for it to be effective in any of the evidence-based trials. For anybody with a serious condition, the human one-on-one treatment is essential. That is what the Government&#146;s programme concentrates on.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="090318110000003"></a>In a debate on the future of CBT in this country we must focus mainly on CBT provided by live therapists to patients in the new way that the Government will make possible in this country. This is the most radical improvement in psychological therapy services ever undertaken. I am impelled by the fact that we are having this debate to say a little about some of the good things about it. I should declare an interest because I am a member of the programme management board. However, I then want to say a bit about its future, which is still not assured, because it depends on the upcoming Comprehensive Spending Review. Then I would like to say something about CBT for children, which is also a very major issue that still needs to be addressed properly.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="090318110000004"></a>Let me start with the scale of the problem, which the noble Baroness mentioned. Sixteen per cent of the adult population suffer from clinical depression or a diagnosable anxiety condition. Until now the main support available for these people has been non-specialist support from GPs, mainly in the form of medication. This is despite the NICE guidelines, which say that computerised CBT should certainly be available in the early stages, but also that one-on-one CBT should be available for everybody who suffers from depression or anxiety disorders that are not either very mild or very recent. As has been said, that has not been the case throughout the country, due simply to the fact that the therapists have not been available within the NHS to deliver it.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="090318110000005"></a>However that all changed from the announcement that the Secretary of State made in October 2007, when the Government committed themselves to creating  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_310"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 310</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a modern psychological therapy service throughout the country that delivered the NICE guidelines to everybody who needed them. This commitment was backed by the full amount of money that had been estimated as necessary and feasible over the CSR period that followed on from that announcement. We now have this programme of improved access to psychological therapy, or IAPS, which is being rolled out throughout the country. It is led by an excellent team in the Department of Health and it is very clearly described on its website. To give the bare bones: in the next three years, as the noble Baroness said, the plan is to train 3,600 new CBT therapists, not through five-year courses&#151;because these will be people who already have experience of working with mentally ill people&#151;but one-year courses involving a combination of off-the-job training and on-the-job supervised cases. All the professionals believe that that is what is needed to enable somebody to be a professional CBT therapist.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="090318110000006"></a>The programme of training and rollout started in October and it is running well ahead of schedule. In two years from now over half the people in the country will have access to it, because of the grass roots enthusiasm which the primary care trusts have shown in responding to this challenge. I would just like to put in parenthesis that the pushing of computerised CBT preceded this programme, and was based on the assumption, to some extent, that this money would not be available. The noble Baroness has an important point about computerised CBT, but we have to realise that this programme supervenes the instructions that were given about that, and delivers hope of something much more serious than the computer can deliver.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="090318110000007"></a>How do we know that all this rollout is worthwhile? We know from randomised control trials, which show that at least half of those treated will recover from their conditions as a result of treatment. Pilots in the field have confirmed this success rate, and of course that means that not only will we get major humanitarian benefits from this programme, but we will also get&#151;and we can do these calculations&#151;a return to the Exchequer which would fully repay, in savings on benefits and lost taxes, the expenditure that is being made. So it is very important that we proceed with this programme at the centre of our effort to deliver CBT to the British population. We will know whether it is working because every session that a CBT therapist has with a patient will include monitoring the patient&#146;s progress. This will not be money down the drain.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="090318110000008"></a>The problem is that the programme is funded for three years but after that there is no commitment. We are just coming up to the spending round in which that will be determined. It is vital that the programme continues until the whole country is covered, not just half of it, by these state-of-the-art services. We have therefore to ensure that in the next spending round the necessary growth in funding continues from 2011-12 onwards. We owe that to the people out there who are suffering.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="090318110000009"></a>In the pilots, the typical patient treated had been suffering from their condition for five years&#151;five years of wasted life, when they could have had, with a 50 per cent probability, a complete transformation of their lives. We cannot allow that to continue. So I have a  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_311"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>simple question to the Minister. Can she assure the House that when the department compiles its spending bid it will indeed seek the funds necessary to complete this crucial programme?</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="090318110000010"></a>I should like finally to say a word on children. The programme that I have been discussing relates to adults, but of course many of those who suffer as adults also suffered as children. Child mental illness is even more tragic than for adults. It is also the source of so many of our social problems. Ten per cent of all children would be diagnosed as suffering from mental illness of all kinds, and 5 per cent from anxiety disorders for which the prime treatment is CBT. Of these children only a quarter are currently receiving specialist help or have seen a specialist in the past year. That is just not good enough. Although we have child and adolescent mental health services which in many cases are excellent, their capacity is just too small. There are many children in real need who get turned away or do not get referred because the waiting list is too long, and not all the services are delivered in accordance with the NICE guidelines.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="090318110000011"></a>What we now need is a strategy for expanding and upgrading CAMHS as well as adult services. A number of us have suggested a five-year plan which would train 200 extra child therapists every year and be adequately funded to pay local services for providing the on-the-job training within the NICE guidelines. I think that that would be a powerful formula. It would cost no more than &#163;35 million by the final year of the next spending round. I very much hope that the Minister can undertake that these proposals will be seriously considered for very high priority in the department&#146;s spending bid.</p>

<a name="90318-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="090318110000012"></a>To conclude, we have an excellent plan for providing face-to-face CBT&#151;obviously, computerised CBT will be there as well&#151;to all adults who need it, but it still needs to be refinanced for the second half. We need to do something similar for children. I have every hope that the Government will do this because they have shown their willingness to bite this bullet which had been neglected for so many decades. This Government have been outstanding so far in their approach to this, after decades of neglect. I really hope that they will complete the job.</p>

Improved Access to Psychological Therapies is bringing CBT and other NICE-recommended treatments to millions of depressed people and people suffering from anxiety, most of whom have never had access to any psychological therapy in the past. That is an important point, because a number of NICE-recommended treatments are included within the programme. As others have commented, this is the most significant development in mental health since the inception of the NHS. It is pretty powerful stuff. The IAPT programme is placing this country in a leadership role internationally in the delivery of psychological therapies.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_312"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="090318110000014"></a>My noble kinsman Lord Layard, as I think I have to refer to him, spoke about CBT itself, and I want to limit my remarks to the computerised version of that programme. Before doing that, I should briefly mention that I have an interest in this as chair of the East London NHS Foundation Trust. We happen to have one of the two pilots in the CBT programme and it was very moving to listen to a number of users talk about having direct access to this programme. They did not have to wait 18 months; they could walk in, self-refer and have access to CBT. They talked about how much better they felt and the fact that they now had jobs. Things really are happening on the ground which we can be very pleased about.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="090318110000015"></a>I want to be clear that when referring to computerised CBT I am referring to all the versions of it. I was a little distressed that the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, mentioned only one such version, and I fear that she may have been at the receiving end of some pretty effective marketing on behalf of a commercial company, because there are a number of computerised versions. The commercial product is called Beating the Blues, which was recommended by NICE in 2005. More recently other programmes have been reviewed and encouraged by NICE, which regards them as comparable to and as good as Beating the Blues. The dramatic difference between Beating the Blues and the other computerised programmes is that these others are free of charge, whereas the licence fee for Beating the Blues is &#163;30,000&#151;not an inconsiderable sum.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="090318110000016"></a>These programmes can be used for primary treatment; alternatively, they can be used to add value to a therapist-delivered programme where the therapist&#146;s work is the core treatment. The research evidence quoted by NICE suggests that the computerised programmes can be helpful in either situation, given a professional therapeutic environment.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="090318110000017"></a>The only really important point that I want to make is that computerised CBT can only be effective if it is delivered in a therapeutic environment and is supported by about three sessions of face-to-face CBT. These programmes should not, therefore, be delivered without that support, nor only with the support of a Beating the Blues member of staff, who are not actually trained to Department of Health standards. This is fundamental. The best way to ensure benefit to the user is for the patient to access a computerised CBT programme at a recognised IAPT site where they can be sure that the support therapists are properly and appropriately trained. The only cost per patient using a free programme is between &#163;17 and &#163;36 for two or three hours of a low-intensity worker at band 4 or 5.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="090318110000018"></a>The significant impact of input by trained therapists was well illustrated by a recent study of the computerised treatment of social phobia. Only 33 per cent of patients completed a course of stand-alone treatment without any therapist input, whereas 77 per cent of those receiving clinician support as well as the computer programme completed the treatment. The conclusion of the research was that the clinician-supported programme was a success and the non-supported programme was not in any significant way.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="090318110000019"></a>Why am I so concerned to ensure the availability of therapeutic support from a properly qualified person if a patient is using computerised CBT? It is common  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_313"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 313</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sense. If a patient has a problem with CCBT, they become disillusioned. One should remember that these people are already depressed or perhaps very anxious. As a result, if they are subsequently offered the real thing&#151;CBT face to face with a therapist, or group CBT&#151;they are likely to turn it down, assuming that it will be just as bad as the treatment they have tried. We know that 50 per cent of people with depression can be cured by CBT: that is a very powerful statistic. It would be a tragedy if many of those people, having tried something in the wrong way and with inadequate support, then turned their back on their one hope of a cure.</p>

However, I have seen the reverse situation apply, which is why I was so enthusiastic about the computer system. Many patients see a behavioural therapist and do not get on with them: the therapy does no good, or they do not like having to go and see somebody or to take time off work. They are greatly advantaged by the computerised system.</p>

We have all learned a lot from that experience. Some people do not want face-to-face therapy. However, having a professional therapist working with you over the phone is very different from working with a computer, on your own and unsupported, feeling depressed and trying to manage. Having lost my speech on my flipping computer this evening, I say with great feeling that the frustrations caused by a computer can be considerable.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="090318110000022"></a>These are complex matters, but the evidence suggests that it is very important to have a well trained professional with you at the beginning of your treatment, so that when you start using your computer, the therapist can check that you are getting along okay, are happy with it and making progress. We do not want people buying a very expensive product and starting the programme without the necessary support. Not all of us are computer-literate. I like to think that I am half-computer-literate, but many people are not even that. Workbooks can be given to people, in which the treatment is the same as the computerised CBT, but the words are on paper instead of on a screen. All the options can be weighed up by a professional therapist who understands the different treatments available, and can judge what will suit each patient.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="090318110000023"></a>That is what we need to work towards. What we must be careful about is something that does more harm than good. There is no question that a stand-alone computer programme can do more harm than good to many people, by blocking them from a treatment that could be much more effective.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="090318110000024"></a>I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I hope that she will assure the House that, for the treatment of depression, every PCT will be encouraged to make available computerised CBT&#151;ideally the free version, but certainly some sort&#151;along with the face-to-face and group treatments involving CBT techniques.</p>

I am sorry that her noble friend Lord Alderdice was not able to stay on the speakers list, because I should have been very interested to hear how he, as a consultant psychotherapist, viewed this subject.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="090318110000026"></a>I am also delighted to have heard the double act that we have just experienced. Both noble Baronesses and the noble Lord, Lord Layard, are singing from the same hymn sheet&#151;at least, they are in harmony&#151;but, in comparison, I shall strike a slightly discordant and rather more cautious note. As noble Lords might expect, I shall speak from the perspective of a former GP.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="090318110000027"></a>Large numbers of studies testify to the very high proportion of consultations in primary care that are due to psychological problems. Some estimates are that they account for up to 50 per cent of a GP&#146;s work. Although only about 10 to 15 per cent of the population on a GP&#146;s list may have a long-term identifiable psychiatric illness, those people consult much more frequently than the average. At any one time, a similar proportion of the psychologically &#147;normal&#148; members of a GP&#146;s list have transient problems in reaction to a particular life stress: bereavement, relationship breakdown and now, as all noble Lords have said, job loss, possibly repossession of a house or bankruptcy. Often, psychological distress is expressed indirectly in physical symptoms or in consultations for self-limiting afflictions which more robust people would shrug off. Sometimes anxiety about physical symptoms without demonstrable cause can be allayed only by a hospital referral. Thus, many specialist out-patient clinics also contain a high proportion of anxious or depressed patients. Often, a negative X-ray or blood test, for example, is needed before the patient, and sometimes the doctor, can accept that the problem is psychological or emotional rather than physical.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="090318110000028"></a>However, part of the reason for the apparent increase in stress-related disorders is that it is now more socially acceptable to speak about them and to seek help. It is also now recognised that more physical symptoms may have a psychological explanation than was previously thought to be the case. However, while some of these symptoms can be relieved by suitable medical drugs, the patients are likely to relapse when the treatment stops if the problem is long term. There are also unpleasant side-effects, and dependence is common, especially with the benzodiazepines.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="090318110000029"></a>Medication is of course a tempting option when consultation times are short and psychological treatments are rare, but the benefit is temporary unless psychological or talking therapy is also given by either the doctor or another person. Medication does not touch the root of the problem&#151;it has been described as &#147;sweeping the dirt under the carpet&#148;&#151;but it can often be useful at the beginning of a course of psychological treatment. For example, if a client is too depressed to engage with the therapist, he or she may need a small pharmacological boost to begin with. However, I think that all noble Lords here accept that there is a real need for psychological therapy in both primary and secondary care. As all noble Lords have said, it is good that the Government  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_315"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have recognised the value of psychological treatment through initiating IAPT. I point out that this initiative is not restricted to CBT but includes different modes of psychological treatment, as well as counselling, which in good hands can be effective in many cases and is now frequently what we fall back on.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="090318110000030"></a>CBT, as we now always call it, has gained in importance partly because it lends itself to assessment much more readily than other therapies. It is of limited duration and predictable structure. A large number of case control studies have been carried out on CBT which have shown its usefulness and, in some cases, its cost effectiveness compared with medication. The methodology of some of these studies has been criticised. However, NICE, which has a reputation for insisting on sound research, has recommended CBT including CCBT, as other noble Lords have described, in that programme, Beating the Blues for depression in children and a for number of adult conditions. However its effectiveness compared with other forms of psychotherapy is not so well documented&#151;at least according to my rather limited search when preparing this speech.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="090318110000031"></a>A comparable and more ambitious form of brief psychotherapy is CAT&#151;cognitive analytic therapy&#151;developed by Dr Anthony Ryle which consists of, rather similarly to CCBT, 16 sessions and aims at reformulation of a person&#146;s relationships with the important people in their life history, thus increasing understanding as well as altering behaviour. Both clients and therapists in that treatment have to work harder than in CBT, which is popular with clients and therapists alike partly because it has a readily understandable structure and does not probe too deeply into uncomfortable areas. It helps clients to devise coping strategies for their symptoms and maladaptive behaviour, but it does not attempt to help them to understand fully the origins of their difficulties.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="090318110000032"></a>One problem with behavioural therapy&#151;cognitive or otherwise&#151;is that while it is often very effective in eliminating symptoms or compulsive behaviour, for instance, other problems tend to crop up later because the underlying problems have not been addressed. Psychiatrists have suggested to me that while it can be useful in itself, it is a good non-threatening introductory route into more in-depth psychotherapy for those who need it. Others have been less kind and describe it as a quick fix&#151;possibly pushing the dirt aside rather than, as drugs do, sweeping it under the carpet, but nevertheless not clearing it away. That task is of course sometimes not attainable with any form of therapy. Some, who are even less kind, have let off broadsides against it. Professor David Richards, professor of mental health at New York University and a one-time proponent of CBT, said in a recent paper:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="090318110000071"></a>&#147;It is an unproven contention that it is possible to take the results of experiments conducted by charismatic product champions, in highly controlled environments and implement them in the widespread manner suggested by Layard".</p>

One recommendation which I like is that all organisations providing psychological help should &#147;promote psychological mindedness&#148;. This certainly prevailed in the health centre in which I worked to the benefit of both patients and staff.

The noble Lord, Lord Rea, has already introduced his. CBT is not the cure for all ills that it is sometimes held up to be. Indeed, it is not, strictly speaking, a treatment at all, since its purpose is to support patients in recognising and managing their symptoms. However, there is a group of chronic illnesses where overwhelming post-exertional fatigue is a major factor, causation is poorly understood, and for which there is no single or comprehensive treatment&#151;CFS/ME, fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome, for example&#151;that do not respond positively to CBT. Patients expect doctors to provide answers, and doctors are, naturally, reluctant to admit defeat. Current advice to doctors is that, after routine tests have failed to point to causation, there is no need for further investigations. Some doctors take the easy route by concluding that the illness must be psychological and that CBT will provide the answer. However, many clinical tests listed in the Canadian criteria do show disease/disorder dysfunction in many bodily systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="090318110000037"></a>I will deal only with the 240,000-odd CFS/ME sufferers this evening. This is an illness that, according to some researchers, has had several different names in the past; neurasthenia and hysteria are examples. Others researchers have believed since 1934 that it is caused by viruses, other micro-organisms or toxins. Even more confusing is the incidence and severity of symptoms reported by patients. It is not surprising that almost everyone concerned with this illness, be they patient, carer or medical practitioner, is, to some degree, bewildered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="090318110000038"></a>In the face of this bewilderment, in 2004, the Secretary of State for Health and the Welsh Assembly asked NICE to prepare,</p>

<p><a name="090318110000063"></a>In August 2007, the guideline was published amid a barrage of criticism from the ME community. Why was it criticised? It was because the only &#147;treatments&#148; recommended by NICE on the basis of very limited and strongly criticised scientific evidence were CBT and its twin sister, graded exercise therapy or GET. The quick reference guide to the 300-plus pages of the full guidelines described CBT as:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="090318110000072"></a>&#147;An evidence-based psychological therapy that is a collaborative treatment approach. When it is used for CFS/ME, the aim of CBT is to reduce symptoms, disability and distress associated with the condition. The use of CBT does not assume that the symptoms are psychological or &#145;made up&#146;&#148;.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="090318110000039"></a>Unfortunately, in the view of a number of professional organisations and researchers working in this field, the evidence-base is not as clear as NICE would have us believe. A statement from ME Research UK asserts that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="090318110000073"></a>&#147;The evidence base consists of only five trials which have a validity score of less than 10. We note that the most recently published RCT on CBT (O'Dowd 2006) states: &#145;there was, however, no evidence that the treatment restored normal levels of function for the majority of patients&#146;&#148;.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="090318110000040"></a>The Association for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in the NHS states,</p>
<ul><a name="090318110000078"></a>&#147;it is highly misleading to state that CBT is the therapy of first choice, since the only relative efficacy RCT quoted in the Guideline (Risdale et al 2001) shows that counselling has better outcomes than CBT&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090318110000064"></a>It goes on to say that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="090318110000074"></a>&#147;This recommendation seriously conflicts with the recommendation that patient choice and preference need to be uppermost in the collaborative approach to care, and the finding that 45% of patients report either being made worse or not helped at all by CBT and, elsewhere, only 7% of patients surveyed report being helped&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090318110000065"></a>It asks:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="090318110000075"></a>&#147;Why is a misleading recommendation being made?".</p>

<p><a name="090318110000066"></a>There is no mention in the NICE guidance of the analysis report in 2004 by the 25% ME Group for Severe Sufferers that was submitted to the GDG of NICE that reported that 93 per cent of respondents found CBT unhelpful.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="090318110000041"></a>I could cite a great many more criticisms of the recommendation by NICE for CBT. The recent judicial review did not test the scientific validity of NICE's recommendation for CBT and GET. The statement issued by Professor Littlejohns, NICE clinical and public health director, that the decision,</p>
<ul><a name="090318110000079"></a>&#147;means that the NICE guideline is the gold standard for best practice in managing CFS/ME",</ul>
<p><a name="090318110000067"></a>is not entirely accurate.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="090318110000042"></a>People with ME already bear a great burden of disbelief about the reality of their illness from their closest relatives, their friends, the medical profession and other care professionals they encounter, as well as the community at large. There has been a preponderance of articles on &#147;yuppie flu&#148; in the press and broadcast media; research funding, other than that provided by the ME charities, has been exclusively weighted in favour of the psychosocial as opposed to the biomedical aspects of the illness; and ME patients seem to have to

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="090318110000043"></a>I have a quotation from <I>Health Insurance News UK</I> dated 22 February 2009. Under the heading,</p>
<ul><a name="090318110000080"></a>&#147;Medical Insurance May Not Cover Chronic Fatigue&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="090318110000068"></a>it gives a condensed description of ME. It then states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="090318110000076"></a>&#147;This sounds like a physical problem, doesn&#146;t it? However, the NICE guidelines suggest that it is a psychiatric condition rather than a physical one.&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090318110000069"></a>It goes on to say:</p>
<ul><a name="090318110000081"></a>&#147;Because of the NICE guidelines private health insurance companies are within their right to refuse cover if an applicant&#146;s policy does not include psychiatric cover&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090318110000070"></a>I cannot find any confirmation for the extraordinary suggestion that ME is a psychiatric condition in the NICE guidelines. Will the Minister ensure that this misinformation is rapidly withdrawn?</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="090318110000044"></a>Young people with ME get very little understanding of their predicament from educationalists and social workers. Far too frequently their parents are accused of &#147;perpetuating the child&#146;s illness behaviour&#148;. This often results in the child being put on the at-risk register, forcibly removed from the family and given medical treatment, including CBT and GET, that commonly does not work. The child is then blamed for the failure. It can then take years for the child to regain any semblance of a normal life. Too many children remain isolated and ignored and living in a twilight world.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="090318110000045"></a>I have been dealing with ME sufferers for 17 years and I have never encountered a group of patients who are so maligned. The last straw for them is the requirement that they undertake a course of CBT and/or GET in order to qualify for benefits and private insurance payments. I accept that, in some cases, CBT alone may be beneficial. I suspect that in the old days it would have been called &#147;grin and bear it&#148;. However, CBT is rarely offered without GET and ME patients know only too well&#151;and their views are supported by some 4,000 papers on scientific and clinical research&#151;that GET makes their symptoms worse.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="090318110000046"></a>The NICE guidelines lay great stress on the importance of shared decision making, working in partnership with the patient and the need for specialist expertise. Unfortunately, because this is a &#147;Cinderella&#148; condition, there are few specialists. Indeed, some of the specialist centres set up following the CMO report in 2002 have had to close because of a lack of funding and expertise. For this reason, &#147;referral out of area&#148; and &#147;choose and book&#148; should be available to all sufferers.</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="090318110000047"></a>The Department of Health and the World Health Organisation acknowledge that this is not a psychiatric condition. What action is the Minister&#146;s department taking to ensure that people with ME are as respected as people with other medical conditions and that they are not forced to accept, as a condition for receipt of benefits and social care, &#147;treatments&#148; such as CBT and GET that, at best, provide no beneficial effects and, at worst, are positively harmful?</p>

<a name="90318-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="090318110000048"></a>I remind the Minister NICE guidelines state:</p>
<ul><a name="090318110000082"></a>&#147;Healthcare professionals should be aware that&#151;like all people receiving care in the NHS&#151;people with CFS/ME have the right to refuse or withdraw from any component of their care without this affecting other aspects of their care, or future choices about care&#148;.</ul>

I congratulate my noble friend Lady Tonge on asking this Question and securing this debate on a very important subject.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="090318110000050"></a>There is nothing new about CBT, except perhaps the label and considerable sophistication of techniques. Were he still living, my father would now be 104 years old; he was a general practitioner in an industrial Lancashire town. Despite having spent two years of his high school education in Vienna, he generally regarded psychiatrists as a visitation of the devil. However, he spent an awful lot of his time talking to his patients and we, his children, were there because we lived in the surgery; we lived his life with him. He used to say, as advice for our future, &#147;Just remember: people who don&#146;t eat want to eat, people who can&#146;t go to school want to go, people who are completely unable to work because of a mental condition really want to go to work, and those in that terrible category of agoraphobics want to go out and enjoy life. It is just that they can&#146;t&#148;.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="090318110000051"></a>The therapies that my father, and many old-fashioned general practitioners, applied in such places when the local economy and culture collapsed&#151;when the cotton industry was destroyed, and people were suddenly putting together gas cookers rather than enjoying the camaraderie of the cotton mill&#151;all contributed to his powerful belief, which he certainly instilled in his children, that talking to people about their problems helps an awful lot, and probably a great deal more than pharmacology. A starting point in any discussion of mental illness is, surely, that it must never be regarded as a second-division form of illness.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="090318110000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Layard, has made a great contribution to the argument in that mental illness is an illness like any other, and needs to be treated with the same serious attention. We know, because we all have friends and relatives who have suffered from depression and other mental conditions, that it knows no class distinction, belongs to no one political party&#151;it probably belongs to them all&#151;and sees wealth as no barrier. There is no quick fix. We should not wed ourselves to any one solution. The old-fashioned Jungian/Freudian divisions are to be avoided in CBT, as in anything else. We have to make the best of the cocktail of cures that is available&#151;on a subjective basis, of course.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="090318110000053"></a>Anyone who has ever been close to a seriously mentally ill person, whether they are suffering from phobia, depression, an eating disorder or anything else, knows how tempting it is to think and sometimes, foolishly, to say, &#147;Oh, just pull yourself together and get on with life.&#148; However, before they reach anything like a &#147;pulling themselves together&#148; situation, people suffering from mental illness, like people with serious physical illness, need something and/or someone else to pull them together sufficiently to progress to full recovery. Between wanting to be better and starting to be better, there is a large space where cognitive behaviour therapy has an important role to play.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_320"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 320</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="090318110000054"></a>We must also not forget the cost of failing to deal early with mental illness. It merits repeating again and again that it has a terribly high mortality rate. The mortality from most illnesses is at the hands of the illness; the mortality from mental illness is usually at the hands of the sufferer. It produces frequent self-harming scars that stay with the sufferer for life, a refuge in dangerous substances, and a reduction in revenue through inability to work. For some, as the Howard League knows only too well, it produces incarceration in prisons and young offender institutions. Shockingly, about half those incarcerated there are suffering from diagnosable mental illnesses, but many are not being treated for them. This is no exaggeration of the morbidity of recognised and easily diagnosable conditions; it is a fact.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="090318110000055"></a>What does CBT offer? Not a miracle&#151;it may be completely wrong for some cases&#151;but it at least offers cheap, early intervention. There is plenty of evidence, for example, that early, non-pharmacological intervention in teenage anorexia and depression, which destroy many young lives and hold those people back for years, can result in total recovery and a successful adult life. There is evidence, too, from those GP practices around the country that have very imaginatively taken on talking therapy psychotherapists as part of the apparatus of their practices that the recovery of patients is quicker, less reliant on drugs and less liable to secondary and tertiary referrals. The recent Royal College of Psychiatrists study by Muñoz-Solomando, Kendall and Whittington, provides powerful and peer-reviewed support for the use of CBT in many child and adolescent mental health cases, including cases of OCD, post-traumatic stress disorder and even attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The evidence from that study is that when people are in groups, when they are able to talk to each other with the guidance of a psychotherapist using CBT techniques, recovery can be hastened dramatically.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="090318110000056"></a>NICE was absolutely right in recommending, as the first line in child and adolescent mental health, that there should be non-pharmacological approaches. I respectfully agree with the noble Lord, Lord Layard, that there are great merits in this and that there is evidence of such a programme being rolled out. However, I share the view of my noble friend that it is being done too slowly and that it should reach the outer reaches of this country as quickly as possible. I shall say a word about rurality in a moment.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="090318110000057"></a>There is remarkable evidence that a combination of CBT and Fluoxetine, a tried and tested substance, appears to reduce the risk of self-harm for depressed children and adolescents. So the news that CBT sends out is good. It is so good that I offer one plea to the Minister to which I hope she will respond. There should be far more of it in prisons and young offender institutions. Those are places where it can be tried, tested, made available and used on an everyday basis. You are guaranteed the co-operation of the patients: they are captive&#151;they have nothing else to do, they have no choice. What better cohort to cure than people who are already costing us at least &#163;45,000 a year to keep in custody?</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="090318110000058"></a>This presents the most remarkable value against hospital admission. I went to a hospital a couple of years ago where I was told that a seriously ill adolescent with a mental health problem was costing up to &#163;145,000 a year to keep in hospital. It is probably a good deal more now. Early intervention might avoid some of those cases.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="090318110000059"></a>This provision should be made available throughout the United Kingdom. I know that the Minister does not have responsibility for Scotland and Wales. I have an interest in Wales because I used to sit in the other place for a Welsh constituency. The availability in rural parts of England, as in rural Wales, is very limited, particularly when there is a great need for the therapies to be given by people qualified to give those therapies and not others. Occupational therapists are not necessarily very good at psychotherapy, and vice versa. It needs to be accurately targeted and used.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="090318110000060"></a>Rural areas are very neglected in mental health provision, but there is plain evidence of need. I have a niece who runs a charity for the Church of England which deals only with depressed and suicidal farmers. They are just an example of a cohort living in the countryside, often very isolated, which needs to have this sort of therapy available. I applaud the computerised version of this therapy; it has a great deal to offer, although I do not think we should spend a huge amount of time on it because it is a small part of a big subject.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="090318110000061"></a>My final plea is this: let us keep mental health provision above party politics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="090318112000001"></a>We are all aware of the debilitating effects that depression, chronic anxiety and other matters related to mental health can have on our ability to carry on with our lives as normally as possible. We are also aware that many people are affected by some form of mental health issue in their lifetime. I shall repeat and reflect on many of the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, and other noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="090318112000002"></a>NICE has recommended psychological therapies for people with a range of mental illnesses, but reports show that 86 per cent of people with schizophrenia are still not getting any treatment. We all agree that psychological therapies are not a one-size-fits-all solution, but for many people there are clinical benefits and, in the long term, there is a cost saving to the Government. NICE recommends CBT as the treatment of choice for people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, OCD, bulimia nervosa and clinical depression.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="090318112000003"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, said, evidence shows that the number of cases of mental illness and suicide increases with rises in unemployment, repossession of homes and uncertainty about the future.

<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="090318112000005"></a>In 2008, 141,000 people claimed incapacity benefit for mental health-related illnesses.

<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="090318112000009"></a>While we recognise the benefits of CBT, without adequately trained psychologists, psychotherapists and nurses, it will be impossible to meet any government targets for service provision. The Government recognise that an extra 10,000 therapists are needed, so can the Minister say when they anticipate reaching this target? Are there figures to show the ratio of people with GP-diagnosed mental health problems to therapists in each PCT area? I ask because it is estimated that PCTs have purchased only 15 per cent of the treatments required. Meanwhile, people are put on lengthy waiting lists at a cost of around &#163;300 million per year. How many people are on the waiting list for cognitive therapy in each PCT and how many are receiving treatment? How many community mental health teams in each PCT offer CBT?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="090318112000010"></a>I shall turn briefly to children. One in 10 of all five to 16 year-olds have some clinically significant mental health difficulty. Sadly, only one-quarter of them receive specialist help. What are the Government doing to act on the recommendation of the report <I>A Good Childhood</I> that IAPT is rolled out for all children as well as adults?</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="090318112000011"></a>The debate cannot have a narrow focus on whether therapy works or not. It is widely recognised that there will be those who do not benefit from CBT. However,  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_323"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 323</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in evidence to the Health Select Committee in March 2007, Professor Michael Barkham recommended that the Department of Health should work with NICE and professional bodies in psychological therapies and agree a national research programme. Will the Minister say whether those recommendations have been followed and whether the Government have undertaken randomised controlled trials of alternative forms of therapy since 2007?</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="090318112000012"></a>This is a subject that demands a raft of questions and of course recognition that different people need different treatments. Unfortunately, time is not on our side. I would very much like to hear the Minister&#146;s response to the questions raised in this interesting debate.</p>

This is a matter in which my right honourable friend the Health Secretary has taken considerable interest in the last few years.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="090318112000014"></a>The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme is the focus of major investment by both the Government and the NHS. My right honourable friend Alan Johnson announced annual funding rising to &#163;173 million&#151;that is the first question answered for the noble Baroness, Lady Verma&#151;by 2010-11, to improve the care on offer to people suffering from depression and anxiety disorders. This investment was warmly welcomed by all the major charities representing people who use mental health services, as well as the key professional bodies of psychological therapy practitioners from a wide range of disciplines. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Layard for his important work in this area; his remarks were welcome and positive, and we know that he is watching us in this matter. I take his point about funding issues; in many ways, I was rather expecting the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, to berate me about such matters, too.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="090318112000015"></a>The overall aim of this investment is to help the NHS implement guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#151;NICE&#151;relating to effective evidence-based treatment for depression and anxiety disorders. The guidance outlines appropriate treatment arranged in a series of steps. Each step relates directly to specific and measurable levels of depression or anxiety disorder. Each step offers clinicians a number of effective treatment options, which a practitioner and a patient will discuss and agree on the most appropriate.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="090318112000016"></a>Computerised CBT, specifically Beating the Blues, is one of the indicated treatment options for people with mild depression. However, NICE is currently in the process of reviewing its guidance on the treatment of depression and recently published a consultation document which broadens the range of effective computerised CBT programmes to include many that do not incur a cost to the NHS.</p>

<a name="090318112000017"></a><b><a name="90318-0014.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090318112000034"></a>Baroness Tonge:</b> My Lords, could the Minister tell me, before she goes on, why the original computerised CBT approved by NICE had so little take-up when the need out there was so desperate?</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_324"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 324</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<a name="090318112000018"></a><b><a name="90318-0014.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="090318112000035"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, it might have been the cost. It is vital that people using computerised CBT are supported by trained therapy workers; it could be that it was a question of putting together packages. Evidence shows that it is ineffective if no trained support is given. My noble friend Lord Layard outlined the issue concerning CBT much more eloquently than I did, and was supported by the remarks of his noble kinswoman.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="090318112000019"></a>I take issue with the idea that this is a postcode lottery. This representation of how NICE guidelines work is incorrect; the current guidelines mean that PCTs have to make Beating the Blues available if their clinicians prescribe computerised CBT for their patients. If clinicians in consultation with individual patients do not prescribe computerised CBT, clearly there will be no need for the PCT to provide it. So there is no more a postcode lottery here than in any other choice between recommended treatments. There is consultation between the clinician and patient.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="090318112000020"></a>To provide the full range of NICE recommended treatment options, the programme will initially train a new workforce of 3,600 therapists. Initially, this training will focus on cognitive behavioural therapy and the routine collection of patient-reported outcomes at every session. In November last year, we published our statement of intent to broaden the programme&#146;s approach, working towards ensuring that all patients have a choice of evidence-based psychological interventions by extending the skills of these new therapists as the services mature.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="090318112000021"></a>The programme was initially piloted in Doncaster and Newham, as noble Lords have said. Both areas succeeded in dramatically cutting waiting times and brought half the people they treated to measurable recovery. They also increased the number of patients who were in work by 5 per cent. The pilot sites demonstrated success in reaching and providing effective treatment to previously hard to reach groups.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="090318112000022"></a>The NHS has embraced the programme with enthusiasm. The original plan was to establish 20 new services in 2008-09, and in fact 35 services are now up and running. The original plan was to train 700 new therapists in the first year, and in fact, over 800 trainees have joined the new workforce. Later this year, another 81 PCTs will establish services with around 1,700 more trainees. On 8 March, my right honourable friend the Health Secretary announced an additional &#163;13 million for 2009-10 to speed up the availability of psychological therapies for people with mental health problems due to the economic downturn. This extra funding will be used largely to enable employment and psychological therapies services to work closely together to meet the specific needs of individuals who have lost their jobs or are at risk of doing so in these difficult times.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="090318112000023"></a>I will now refer to particular points raised by noble Lords and I apologise if I am not able to cover everything, particularly the very long list of questions asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Verma. I was not able to note them all down or find all the answers in my brief, but I promise that I will write to her to answer all her questions.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_325"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 325</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-0014.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="090318112000024"></a>The review of the independent Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services was raised by my noble friend Lord Layard and other noble Lords. The review was commissioned by Ministers and reported in November 2008. It identified the need to reduce waiting times from referral to treatment. The Government have accepted this recommendation in principle and have already commissioned good practice guidance in this area. Taking work in this area forward will be a priority for the national support programme. It is indeed a priority for us and the proposals of my noble friend Lord Layard are being considered as part of this programme. I believe that he is also a member of that steering group.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="090318112000025"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, raised the issue of PCTs being encouraged to provide CBT. The Government have already made that clear. We have encouraged PCTs to make CBT available where clinicians prescribe it for patients. We will continue to do so. I have already mentioned that CBT should be presented to patients as a treatment option only by trained therapies as part of an overall treatment package. It is worth noting&#151;there was some discussion about this&#151;that this is a process that empowers patients to make choices about the treatments that are right for them.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="090318112000026"></a>My noble friend Lord Rea asked a series of questions about IAPT services being available for people with serious health problems. The service provides treatment for people with common mental health problems from mild to moderate depression. But people with comorbid depression, other anxiety disorders and more severe and enduring mental health problems would be able to access IAPT services for their depression and anxiety disorders. Indeed, people with drug or alcohol problems would not be excluded from receiving evidence-based psychological therapies for their depression. Where PCTs&#151;Liverpool, for example&#151;have identified particular local needs for people with comorbid problems, they have targeted the new IAPT services on that population. The Government are providing significant funding for people with depression and anxiety disorders for access to those therapies.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="090318112000027"></a>My noble friend Lord Rea also raised the issue of investment. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, spoke of  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_326"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column 326</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the importance of the range of treatments and support that should be available. My noble friend is right that we should be looking for a whole range of therapies. As CBT has the strongest evidence base for a full range of common mental health problems and there is a great shortage of fully trained therapists, we are addressing that shortage first. However, we are extending the programme to other NICE-compliant treatments for those problems. My noble friend was right to point out that other therapy disciplines do not have CBT&#146;s level of evidence. There is quite a lot of discussion about how to deal with other therapy disciplines.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="090318112000028"></a>The noble Countess, Lady Mar, made a very interesting and well informed speech about CFS/ME, whose sufferers she has championed for many years. I will be pleased to investigate the issues that she has raised about CFS/ME treatment, recommended by NICE. It is important to restate the value which the Government place on the independence of NICE&#146;s evaluation process, but I undertake to follow up the disturbing point she made and see whether I can provide her with clarification.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="090318112000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, spoke with great wisdom about the different applications of CBT in many different settings, particularly for young people. I absolutely agree with him about the need for making CBT more available in young offender units. He is right to point out the need to roll this out in rural areas and across the UK.</p>

<a name="90318-0014.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="090318112000030"></a>Since October 2007, we have invested significantly in improving access to psychological therapies. I have already mentioned the amount to the noble Baroness, Lady Verma. Psychological therapies are expanding across the country and making one of the most significant improvements in our mental health services that we have seen in decades. The Government&#146;s commitment to that is beyond doubt, as their level of investment demonstrates. The NHS&#146;s commitment is similarly convincingly shown by the pace with which it is establishing these much needed services. Once again, I thank the noble Baroness for bringing this important topic to the attention of your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000004"></a>I pay tribute to the work that members of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee have done in considering the order, which has at its heart a desire to ease the administrative burden on community premises that make such an important contribution to life in our communities, and I know that there is cross-party support; I hope that I am not presuming too much. I also thank organisations such as Action with Communities in Rural England, Community Matters, and the Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services, which have been working closely with my department and whose input into the development of this order has been extremely valuable.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000005"></a>The proposal aims to remove the legislative burden of Section 19 of the Licensing Act 2003 on village halls and community premises. This section currently provides that where a premises licence authorises the supply of alcohol, the licence must include two mandatory conditions. The first condition is that no supply of alcohol may be made under a premises licence when there is no designated premises supervisor&#151;sometimes  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC100"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>known as the DPS&#151;in respect of the premises licence, when the DPS does not hold a personal licence, or when their personal licence has been suspended. The second condition is that every supply of alcohol under the premises licence must be made or authorised by a person who holds a personal licence. I hope that this is not a contentious matter. It is simply a reduction in red tape, and I hope that the Committee will support it.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000006"></a>The order will allow community premises, such as church halls and village halls with properly constituted management committees or management structures, to apply to replace the existing mandatory conditions with a simpler and cheaper arrangement. There will be a fee of &#163;23 for considering applications. The responsibility for alcohol sales will lie with the management committee as the premises licence holder. This is very similar to the existing arrangement for non-profit-making members&#146; clubs, such as the Royal British Legion or a political club, through which responsibility is collective rather than through a nominated individual.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000007"></a>To ensure that there are sufficient safeguards, the licensing authority will be required to take into account any representations from the police. In addition, should problems occur, the mandatory conditions can always be re-imposed by the licensing authority following a review of the premises licence.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000008"></a>The order has been proposed because surveys indicate that although 90 per cent of village halls have premises licences, the majority of these are limited to the provision of regulated entertainment and do not cover alcohol. That limits the ability of the village hall to host the full range of activities for the community, including fundraising events, local theatre and social functions.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000009"></a>The main reason why many halls have not applied for the full licence relates to the understandable reluctance on the part of volunteers to become a personal licence holder with individual responsibility for authorising the sale of alcohol. That requires paying for a personal licence, a Criminal Records Bureau check, obtaining a necessary qualification and taking time off work for training. Individual volunteers also tend to be anxious about being made the designated premises supervisor, which places a good deal of responsibility on one person&#146;s shoulders.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000010"></a>The total cost of gaining a personal licence is estimated to be approximately &#163;273. We estimate that the overall potential savings under this proposal would be &#163;202,678 per year. It is not a huge sum of money&#151;this is not a hugely significant order, but it removes red tape that will make a difference to volunteers on hard-working village hall committees.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000011"></a>I am delighted that the Delegated Powers Committee recognises the merits of this order and has made no recommendation other than that it should be considered under the affirmative procedure. While we initially recommended that the order follow the negative resolution process, we accept that the number of premises involved and the interest in licensing matters mean that the level of parliamentary scrutiny should be high. I therefore commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000012"></a><b><a name="90318-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090318116000289"></a>Lord Luke:</b> As we heard, the order would give local authorities the option of introducing a different code for community halls so that they do not always have to  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC101"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have a premises supervisor. As that would be instead of the usual mandatory code, it would reduce some of the burden on community facilities. That would imply a greater flexibility and discretion rather than a rigid one-size-fits-all approach. Can the Minister confirm that that is the situation? If so, we on these Benches would agree with the order.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000013"></a><b><a name="90318-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="090318116000290"></a>Lord Roberts of Llandudno:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to talk on this order. The Minister suggested that it was for England, but of course it is for England and Wales&#151;it covers both our countries. Some questions need to be resolved. Is it not better to have a recognised licensee in charge of the sale of alcohol on any premises in the community? I often speak to some of our local licensees in north Wales, who say that the problem is that the supermarkets and so on sell alcohol unregulated, but the pub owner or licensee is able to keep order on his premises. Of course, he stands to be penalised if he fails to do that. We have to look not only at ease, but at making sure that the premises are well regulated by somebody who knows what he or she is doing.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000014"></a>I move on to the managing boards that would take over the responsibility. Having been involved with many managing boards and local hall committees over the years, I know that they change their composition. Sometimes you get an active, responsible committee or board and you would trust them with most forms of activity. But then you have an annual meeting, there might be conflict and the board might change. You might even have conflicts then, because some members might be teetotallers and others might enjoy alcoholic refreshment. That change and instability would not be there if one person were responsible for the licensed hall.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000015"></a>The Minister should think of such things. Especially in the booze culture we face today, they should be seriously considered.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000016"></a><b><a name="90318-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="090318116000291"></a>The Lord Bishop of Ripon and Leeds:</b> I welcome this relaxation of the requirement that a designated premises supervisor with a personal licence is needed in every instance where alcohol is supplied in community buildings. I know from personal experience how hard it can be to get someone with a personal licence to provide alcohol, and that this has led to events being cancelled and to community and church halls not being used as effectively as they might be for the benefit of local people. Therefore, I am grateful that the order provides for the management committee to authorise the supply of alcohol in such buildings. I take it that the provisions will ensure that the management committee keeps an eye on what is happening in the building with regard to alcohol, and, indeed, that protests can be made to the police if necessary.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000017"></a>My only concern is that the definition of &#147;management committee&#148; in Article 6(1)(b) is not entirely apt to cover parochial church councils, which are in charge of most of our church halls. I should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s assurance that it covers a PCC as the responsible body in those cases.</p>

Noble Lords on these Benches want to give the order a fair wind as its motives are valid. However, as I say, it constitutes a significant change to the Licensing Act 2003 and a number of questions about its implications and likely effect need to be considered and answered by the Minister.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000019"></a>It is interesting that the Government have chosen to use this LRRA procedure in this case. Those of us who have campaigned about live music know that that matter would also be a perfectly worthy recipient of the procedure but it has been rather slower in coming forward in that case. However, I recognise that a huge number of premises will be affected by this order, as, indeed, would be by a reform of the de minimis live music provisions. Why was this mechanism adopted? The Government decided after consultation&#151;albeit on rather a small base of consultation&#151;that extending a temporary event notice from 12 to 15 days, or whatever, would not fit the bill and would not be sufficient to meet the requirements. Instead, they decided to amend Section 19 of the Act and add this alternative condition, which you can opt into. I recognise that they consulted widely on the different options available as regards how the alternative condition could be invoked. They have allowed those who run community and village halls to opt into this process where there is a management committee that can hold the licence.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000020"></a>These are long-term licences. My reading is that premises licences last for as long as the building itself. Therefore, in theory, these licences can last for an extremely long time. As my noble friend pointed out, a very big change is involved from individual responsibility&#151;that has considerable consequences for those who hold these licences&#151;to collective responsibility, which is a very different matter.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000021"></a>I recognise the proviso that the licence can be reviewed if there are complaints from the local community in accordance with Sections 51 to 53 of the Act. Can the Minister also confirm that a general review of this LRO is automatically provided for after three years? I believe that that is the case and I would be grateful to him if he could give that assurance. But what is key here is that he should set out the Government&#146;s thinking behind the question about altering Section 19 versus an extension to the TENs regime. What that says is that village and community halls hold so many events that 15 or even 20 occasions are not adequate, so the procedure is not adequate. However, what we are really seeing is the conversion of some village halls into permanent social clubs, which is a significant change. That may well be justified by the consultation and be welcomed by many communities, but it could have a considerable impact on the local environment. I believe that the Government and local communities need to take this step with their eyes open.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000022"></a>The reason we are prepared to give this order a fair wind is not only the review mechanism, but also the clear recognition that this is a deregulatory step, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Luke. We are as a party committed to deregulation and we welcome it wherever it occurs, particularly for small and local community organisations. However, if deregulation is at the cost of potentially turning some local village halls into social clubs to compete with commercially

In those circumstances, one needs to look carefully at the fee level, and I see that there was some debate about that in the explanatory document.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000023"></a>I am sorry to speak at length because I am sure the Minister thought that this would be completely non-contentious, but there are underlying issues. We should be grateful not only to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of the House of Lords for pointing out in its report published on 22 January that this should be dealt with under the affirmative procedure, but also to the Regulatory Reform Committee of the other place. That committee did an even more thorough job than our own committee because it looked at the content of the order in greater detail. It made exactly the same point: that this kind of LRO in these circumstances should be dealt with under the affirmative procedure. The Minister should tell us what lessons the Government are drawing from the observations of those two committees. It is all very well for the other place to produce one paragraph saying that the order has been passed by the negative procedure without debate while one of its own committees recommends that it is dealt with under another one, but it is not healthy for the Commons to find itself having to backtrack and have another committee look at it. We need a clear process that reflects the significance of orders being put forward in these circumstances. At the time, the LRRA was welcomed as legislation that would lead to the real possibility of delegation, but that does not mean that we can just do it by sneaking legislative reform orders through the parliamentary process. There has to be a full and proper debate when these matters come up.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000024"></a>Finally, in terms of the impact assessment, I would be interested to hear what the Minister&#146;s latest intelligence is on the number of church and village halls that are likely either now or in the future to take up the new procedure under Section 19. I believe that this is a very significant matter. The consultation was poor in terms of take-up, with a very short second phase. Indeed, if one looks at the sheer number of village and community halls across the country, this could affect thousands of them, and that in turn means that there could be a considerable impact on communities.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000025"></a><b><a name="90318-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="090318116000293"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords who have spoken. I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that I did not come into this Committee with any presumption that this would be a short debate or that the issue would not be examined carefully. As soon as I saw the composition of the Committee I knew that that would not be the case, and so it has proven.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000026"></a>I also want to disavow the idea that I was trying to restrict the order to England, which the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, suggested. I am not sure that I mentioned England&#151;I am not sure that I could, during a week when it is only Wales that counts with regard to the rugby match on Saturday. He is right; the order applies to England and Wales.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000027"></a>I am grateful for the points that were made. In a moment I will come on to the procedure that I mentioned and which the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC104"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to. He has always taken a great interest in these issues. First, though, I shall deal with one or two of the more specific questions.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000028"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Luke, asked me whether the order is intended to reduce burdens and increase flexibility. That is indeed its objective; it will give the community the option to apply to remove restrictions and make it easier for it to obtain a fully flexible licence. That is why, in our consultation, we have had support for this. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, says about how we should go about it, but there was a desire that we should have an order that reduced these burdens and red tape. It is modest; we are not talking about huge amounts of money being saved, nor about a great issue in legislative terms. However, it is important to those concerned with organising these events.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000029"></a>I reassure the right reverend Prelate that &#147;management committee&#148;, although I am sorry that it is not spelt out in quite the same terms, is a generic term. It means those who exercise authority and can be held accountable, and of course a parish council is the most reputable body in those terms and meets the Bill. The issue is straightforward: we are all aware of the reluctance of individuals to get shouldered with the burden, if anything goes wrong, of taking the heat when in fact there is a broader structure that at the end of the day is responsible because it has identified the individual as being responsible.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000030"></a>It is that broader structure that really holds the power, and it should do. Well, I say it should; the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said that it should not because members of the structure will disagree among themselves and you will not know where you stand. If that were the case, it would be problematic for the individual anyway if they were exercising that position on behalf of a divided management committee that could not make up its mind whether it wanted the event or not, or on what terms. We already think it is invidious for the individual to carry the load&#151;how much more devastating if they were backed by a management committee that did not really think it was prepared to back them? The scenario that the noble Lord was developing is one where proceeding for a licence would be hazardous if there were that level of dissent. You could have an individual who could presumably, in Napoleonic terms, be the decision-taker, but it would not be a very happy state of affairs if he had taken a decision and the management committee did not back him. There is not really a substantial point there. Any responsible organisation involved in an event that requires this aspect with regard to a licence by definition has to have summoned up the will to reach a proper decision on that and takes responsibility for that decision. If it is so divided that it cannot, it will not get the licence, and that is the end of the matter.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000031"></a>On how we went about it, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is right: we could have gone through the temporary events procedure. There are disadvantages to doing that. The temporary events concept is very light-touch indeed. The problem is that we would not get the same flexibility under that structure. Our anxiety would be whether the public are properly protected&#151;which, after all is the basis of the licence concept&#151;if we extend the very light-touch regime for temporary   


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC105"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>events. We had the option to do that, but we think that this is safer. This structure guarantees greater public responsibility, which is why it was chosen.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000032"></a>The noble Lord is always accurate in his criticism of the Government and asks accurate questions. I think that this is a pretty neat solution. It is certainly one that has commended itself elsewhere. Just for once, I will not be too concerned about that element of criticism. There was a choice, there was a balance, and a balanced decision was taken. I do not have absolute confirmation on the question of the length of the review. Three years was suggested, but I shall have to write to confirm that. I apologise that I cannot give the answer immediately.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000033"></a>On the question of the impact assessment, there are 2,000 community premises without an alcohol licence and 4,000 requiring flexibility, so we are talking about 6,000 premises. That is not epoch-making, but if we can reduce the red tape for 6,000 organisations, we have achieved something worth while.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000034"></a>Is there a danger that the halls become like social clubs because they have licences? The definition of community premises is statutory and in our statutory guidance, so we are covered on that. We can draw a line between community premises and the extension of events to village halls and so on. One safeguard that we have in place is that the licensing authority on application must consider whether the appropriate management committee is in place and the premises must hold community activities. So, first, the premises must shape up as being clearly for the community; and, secondly, returning to the point made earlier, if the licensing authority thinks that there is a wayward management structure and no one knows what on earth is going on, it will not grant a licence. It has responsibility for that.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000035"></a>I mentioned the conditions that we are introducing under the order in my introduction. They can be reintroduced following the review of the licence if there is reason for anxiety or concern; we can re-establish the regime that has obtained until now.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000036"></a>I hope that it will be recognised that this is a well intentioned, benign measure of limited impact that nevertheless will help community events, and I commend it.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000037"></a><b><a name="90318-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="090318116000295"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I beg to move the Renewables Obligation Order 2009, which is part of our attempt to drive further the significant advances we have already made towards delivering our renewables energy targets. Renewable energy is of vital importance to our strategy for tackling the two major challenges we face; that is, combating climate change and ensuring a supply of secure energy for the United Kingdom. That is why the Government support the European Union&#146;s target for 20 per cent of energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. The order under discussion is a significant step forward towards delivering the additional generation necessary to meet our share of that target.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000038"></a>The order has been rightly drawn to the attention of the Committee by the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee on the grounds that it gives rise to issues of public policy likely to be of interest to the House. I do not need to be convinced of the interest that is always generated by these issues in the House, and certainly not of the interest of Members present on this Committee. During its progress before this House, noble Lords worked with us to ensure that the Energy Act 2008 delivered real benefits for the renewables industry. I am sure it will be appreciated that this order is an extension of that work.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000039"></a>There is of course a great deal more to do, including bringing forward a feed-in tariff for small-scale generation, which was the subject of an important amendment. But we are here to debate the changes we will make to the renewables obligation. We are confident that these changes will drive significant investment in new renewables generation, building on our success to date, and set the stage for the delivery of further new build.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000040"></a>Since its introduction in 2002, the renewables obligation has increased eligible renewable electricity generation from less than 1.8 per cent of total UK supply to 4.9 per cent, almost three times as much, in 2007. The RO was originally designed to be technology-neutral and has been particularly effective at encouraging the cheaper forms of renewables generation, bringing forward large amounts of co-firing, landfill gas and onshore wind.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90318-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000041"></a>If we are to meet our targets we will need to do more. In particular, we will need to encourage deployment of other technologies&#151;technologies which are some way off commercial deployment at present&#151;which have the potential to deliver large amounts of new generation, such as offshore wind and biomass. It is these technologies that our proposals to band the RO aim to encourage. It is already working&#151;our proposals to provide additional support for technologies have encouraged significant investment in new generation. DONG Energy, E.ON and Fred Olsen Renewables have formed a consortium to bid for thousands of megawatts of offshore wind capacity in UK offshore waters. Drax has announced its intention to develop three new biomass plants of about 300 megawatts each by 2016, as well as upgrading its co-firing facilities. The PDM Group is proceeding with its plan to develop a 2 megawatt anaerobic digestion plant in Doncaster, as well as looking at other opportunities around the country.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000042"></a>We have done this by working closely with industry to develop a mechanism that provides the necessary support for those technologies that are further from  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC107"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>commercial development to come forward alongside the more developed technologies. Whereas currently each megawatt hour of eligible generation is awarded one renewables obligation certificate, a banded RO will mean that different technologies will get different numbers of ROCs. As well as supporting new technologies, this will allow us to ensure that the most economic renewables, such as the co-firing of biomass alongside coal, are not overrewarded in future.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000043"></a>The level of support offered to different technologies by the different bands is based on research carried out for us by Ernst &amp; Young into the costs and market potential of different technologies. This includes providing microgeneration with a greater amount of support, recognising that it does not benefit from economies of scale. We will continue to monitor the renewables market, and we have set out a timetable of banding reviews allowing us to respond to market developments so that banding levels continue to provide the right level of incentive for project developers.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000044"></a>The order allows us to take important steps to ensure a more stable and predictable price for renewables obligation certificates. We have done this by introducing a mechanism to ensure that the level of the obligation remains above the level of actual generation. We refer to this as a headroom mechanism, as it aims to ensure that on average the level of the obligation will always have an 8 per cent headroom over the expected level of the obligation.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000045"></a>Headroom will allow investors greater certainty by making the ROC price more stable and predictable. It will also ensure that in future years the consumer is not paying more than required to bring on this renewable generation. Given the current economic climate, I am sure that the Committee will agree that these considerations are of the highest importance.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000046"></a>We have taken steps to maintain investor confidence by protecting previous investments. This is the principle of grandfathering. Subject to certain exceptions, those stations which were operational prior to our announcement on 11 July 2006 will continue to receive one ROC per megawatt hour. This is a principle which we also intend to follow at the next banding review, ensuring that existing investments are protected, should technologies be banded down in future as costs fall.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000047"></a>The order includes a number of changes aimed at developing the biomass and waste markets. Provisions in the order allow us to better utilise the renewable fractions of municipal and commercial wastes, which are currently underused. Our aim is to encourage the development of more efficient technologies, such as combined heat and power, anaerobic digestion or gasification. In order to achieve this, we have simplified the fuel measurement requirements, making the RO more accessible to these technologies.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000048"></a>Recognising that any move to increase biomass and waste usage raises concerns about the sustainability of their sources, we are introducing a sustainability reporting requirement on generators with a declared net capacity of over 50 kilowatts. While the evidence is that the great majority of biomass fuels used for electricity generation in the UK are sustainable, we seek to better understand where these fuels come from and the effect of using them.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000049"></a>The order also makes a number of small technical and administrative changes to make the RO more accessible to microgenerators, removing some administrative requirements that disproportionately weigh on smaller businesses. It introduces provisions ensuring that the costs of administering the renewables obligation are met by those who benefit from it. Currently, the costs for Ofgem&#146;s administration of the scheme are met by the network operators. We believe that this is unfair, and we have taken steps to provide that, henceforth, the costs for Ofgem&#146;s administration are met from the buyout fund. Ofgem&#146;s costs will be removed from the buyout fund prior to it being recycled. In the event of a shortfall, the additional costs will be met by the Government.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000050"></a>The changes before the Committee today are the culmination of an extensive consultation process, working closely with industry and others, to develop the policy which was given shape by the Energy Act 2008. These changes have been well received by the renewables industry, which is keen to see them introduced. Accordingly, I commend the order to the House.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000051"></a><b><a name="90318-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="090318116000296"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> The temptation is to go over the some of the ground on the Economic Affairs Committee&#146;s report when we debated that on 24 February, but I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Davies, that I will not do that. There seems to be no point; it was a good debate. However, I want to come back initially to one point on it, the cost to the consumer. When the noble Lord, Lord Vallance, introduced that debate, he talked about the increase in renewables required if we were to meet the 15 per cent target, suggesting that the share of electricity generated from renewable sources should be 34 per cent. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090318116000247"></a>&#147;We concluded that the extra annual cost in 2020 would be &#163;6.8 billion, an increase of 38 per cent. In terms of the average household bill, that would mean an extra &#163;80 a year&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/2/09; col. 143.]</p>

<p><a name="090318116000234"></a>Nobody seriously challenged that figure. It is a number of years ahead, so it is of course difficult to quarrel with or endorse the figure. However, noble Lords may remember that in debate on the Energy Bill last year, I used statistics provided to me by Ofgem on the cost to the consumer of all the environmental measures being imposed on suppliers. I was given the figure of &#163;79 a year. I asked whether Ofgem could bring that figure up to date, including a number of new elements, such as prospective increases in the CERT&#151;the carbon emissions reduction target&#151;and the introduction of CESP. I asked Ofgem also to look at what had been happening to the cost of the European emissions scheme and the impact of the order. It does not cite the figure in any of its printed material for the good reason that it is extremely uncertain. When I asked why it did not put the figure into the papers it circulated about the gas and electricity markets, the answer was quite clearly, &#147;But it is only a guess&#148;.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000052"></a>The figure that Ofgem gave was, rather remarkably, &#163;80, but that is of course a completely different &#163;80 from that cited by the noble Lord, Lord Vallance, in the debate based on the report of the Economics Affairs Committee. Is the Minister prepared to give a view on whether the figure of &#163;80 for the total cost of the environmental measures that falls on the gas and  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC109"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>electricity consumer is about right? The &#163;80 referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Vallance, was simply the additional cost of going to 15 per cent of energy from renewables. Those seem quite substantial figures.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000053"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Davies, and certainly his noble colleague sitting next to him, will recognise that I have repeatedly asked that there should be some mention in consumers&#146; bills of what they are paying towards environmental measures. That has always been resisted, but the case for resisting it is getting weaker almost by the day. Consumers want to know what they are paying towards the environmental salvation of this country. My noble friend put it succinctly when she welcomed the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, to his post and said, &#147;We are looking forward to together saving the planet and keeping the lights on&#148;. I repeat my question: can the Minister offer any prospect that the Government will require suppliers to show in the bills what consumers are paying towards this?</p>

<p><a name="090318116000054"></a>In a moment, I shall turn to one or two issues arising from the order, but it is worth asking one other question that arises from the Explanatory Memorandum, which is a very helpful document, as always, once one wades one&#146;s way through it.

<ul><a name="090318116000257"></a>&#147;have signalled informally that they are content to approve the Order and we are waiting for formal notification that it has been approved&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090318116000235"></a>Have the Government now received that formal notification? There is many a slip twixt cup and lip and although an initial informal indication may be of some value, one would like to know that the whole thing has now been formally approved. If it has not, and if there are likely to be hiccups, that will be a substantial hurdle for the Government to overcome.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000055"></a>The order is a substantial document. I am sure that I am not disclosing any embarrassing secrets when I confess that I have not read it the whole way through.  I have, however, taken advice. I asked: is there anything different from what was envisaged when we debated the enabling legislation in what is now the Energy Act 2008 and, if so, could my attention be drawn to it, and should any other issues be raised?</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000056"></a>The main change under the order from the previous order is, as the Minister said, the banding proposals. The impression that I have been given from the consultation I have undertaken is that now that the industry has had a good deal of notice&#151;consultation documents were issued&#151;on the whole, it is prepared to live with this. However, there is a very strong view that if the renewables obligations certificate procedure is to continue to command the confidence of the industry, it must be stable. There was great welcome for the fact that the Chancellor in the Pre-Budget Statement last autumn increased the period up to 2037. That has been welcomed because it implies great stability.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000057"></a>The question of further review, which the order seems to indicate may happen, is more difficult. It is important that the system is not repeatedly tinkered  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC110"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with. That, of itself, will undermine confidence. Very large sums of money will have to be invested not only in offshore wind but, as the Minister suggested and as they achieve maturity, other forms of renewable energy. There could not be a bigger investment than the Severn barrage, which is still very much on the agenda. If people are to invest such sums, they must have certainty that the system will have the stability for which I have been asking.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000058"></a>I shall raise two or three other short points. One effect of banding is to reduce to one of the lowest bands&#151;0.5, I think, in the new ROC levels&#151;direct injection equipment into large coal-fired power stations. The impression I get is that although the industry will be disappointed to lose what it has received so far, it is prepared to live with that; but it totally supports the reintroduction of a cap on the number of co-firing ROCs that can be used by suppliers. If you have a reduced amount of the ROC, it is important that users in other systems should not be able, as it were, to drain off the available money, so that those who are interested in investing&#151;they are often very long-term investments&#151;in renewables and co-firing are protected. All I would ask is this: can the Government give a clear undertaking that the cap will not be lifted in the short term? Of course I cannot ask the Minister to say that it will never be lifted&#151;that would be silly&#151;but at the moment the industry wants the cap to be stable.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000059"></a>The view has been put to me that energy crops should be included in a supplier cap. Without doing that, there is a significant risk that these too could flood the ROC market. I should say that there the variety of energy crops is growing. I have on my desk papers about a new plant nearing completion in the north-east based on crops that cannot be used for food but which would otherwise go towards producing animal feed. This struck me as an extremely good scheme, but if it was unlimited, those who are investing in wind power and other forms of renewable energy may feel that they are going to suffer.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000060"></a>The order also looks at the question of using the ROC procedure to support heat. This is arousing a good deal of anxiety. The renewable obligation is a support mechanism for renewable electricity, and the view has been put to me quite strongly that there is in fact a separate renewable heat incentive. Indeed, my noble friends will recall that we got that into the then Energy Bill. We are running the risk of duplication if renewable heat is also going to be incentivised by an obligation that is primarily intended for renewable electricity. Can the Minister say anything about that?</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000061"></a>Finally, I turn to the question of the differential between energy crops and biomass. I have been told that there is no climate change justification for the differential between regular biomass and energy crops. There are no additional carbon benefits through the use of energy crops, and research by a company called Themba Technology Ltd in collaboration with the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Management suggests that co-product biomass tends to have lower life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than dedicated energy crops. I have not examined the research and I would not be qualified to assess it, but can the Minister say something about it? What is being suggested  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is that by treating energy crops preferentially, there is a risk that the environmental impact will be negative as the displaced biomass is likely to have a lower overall environmental footprint. In the absence of any additional environmental benefit, and some evidence to suggest a reduced benefit, we believe that the 0.5 renewable obligation certificate per megawatt hour premium attributed to energy costs will be very difficult to justify to consumers. It may be a minor point in the context of the entire order, but it is one which the Government should answer.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000062"></a>Other than that, we debated these things fully during the course of the Energy Bill and the order fulfils almost entirely what was expected of it&#151;it is a very long order&#151;and all I can say is that I hope it works.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000063"></a><b><a name="90318-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="090318116000297"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> I do not know quite how I follow that. I do not think that I have ever been in the Moses Room when there has been such an expansive explanation of an order. The fact that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has not yet read the whole thing suggests that I should give it scant consideration during this debate. On these Benches, we welcome anything, such as this legislation and the banding, that helps to bring forward the renewable energy programme for the United Kingdom. We have to see it within that context, which we welcomed generally during the passage of the then Energy Bill. Now we are going through the administrative procedures to apply it. However, we must remember that we have a huge target. By 2020, we must meet a target of 15 per cent of all energy being generated by renewables. I should remind the Minister that that target does not refer to generating capacity, which is what we often talk about in terms of renewables, but to actual energy generated. We have a long way to go in the next 11 years.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000064"></a>Certainly, this is a long order. I seem to remember reading that this was supposed to be rather simpler than the previous order, which I am delighted to say I did not have to deal with. The Explanatory Memorandum is quite strange in terms of plain speaking. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090318116000248"></a>&#147;It is also worth noting that the Order distinguishes between renewables obligation certificates and ROCs&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000236"></a>I always thought a renewables obligation was a ROC. It continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090318116000249"></a>&#147;The former is a collective term used to describe any of the certificates issued under any of the UK renewables obligations and the latter is a certificate issued under the renewables obligation in England &amp; Wales&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000237"></a>I do not know, but it does not seem to me to be a great day for plain speaking.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000065"></a>I turn to some of the issues raised in the Minister&#146;s helpful opening remarks. He mentioned the banding, which we welcome as we hope that it will bring forward new technologies in renewables. We on these Benches see that as very important, given the time it takes to bring forward these technologies. Do the Government have any technologies in mind? I believe the round 3 bids are in and I would be interested to know whether the Government feel that round 3 for offshore energy has been successful. It seemed to me that there was a good take-up of bids in that area, but does the Minister feel that we are on a trajectory to meet what we need in terms of capacity?</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC112"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000066"></a>During the passage of the then Energy Bill, we also debated where renewables obligation certificates finish and the feed-in tariff starts, which is very important. One of the issues was whether, until the Government decide where that boundary will be, there is a great risk, because of that uncertainty, that you will not get investment in that area. We did a sort of Dutch auction at Third Reading when the cap went up every time we spoke about it, but I think it perhaps landed up at 20 megawatts or around that figure. Clearly, organisations will not invest in that technology now if they think that they might be able to have feed-in tariffs in the future which give them a higher rate.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000067"></a>I would also be interested to understand from the Minister whether&#151;in terms of the carbon reduction commitment, which is one of the other strategies being put forward by the Government in terms of climate change&#151;they will still reconsider treating renewable energy differently in terms of carbon reduction commitment costs and certificates. It still seems utterly counterintuitive to me that a business that comes under the CRC umbrella because of its size is given no credit for generating its own renewable energy in the form of electricity and is treated just as if it were coal-fired energy or fossil fuel. That is still, as I said, counterintuitive.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000068"></a>Those are the areas that I would like to understand, but we on these Benches generally welcome the order and say, &#147;Let&#146;s get on with it. Let&#146;s set out these rules&#148;. We will then, I hope, urgently push forward the renewables programme that we need to meet our targets for climate change.</p>

The Committee is obliged to the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, particularly to its chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, for drawing the Committee&#146;s attention to such an important order, particularly as it gives rise to issues of public policy. I also thank my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding, who makes my job much easier because he is so on top of this subject, and I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s answer, particularly on the cost to the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000070"></a>I will not take up too much of the Committee&#146;s time, but I will say that although we have many reservations about the past performance of the renewables obligation and have criticised what one of my honourable friends in another place likes to call,</p>

<ul><a name="090318116000259"></a>&#147;a major improvement to what has been a deeply disappointing programme, given the huge potential we have to be a global player in the 21st-century renewable energy sector. I hope the Minister will listen harder to the industry and work to improve the RO, so that we see the delivery of major renewables projects, with all the jobs and economic advantages that that will entail. We must focus not only on the 2020 renewables targets, as hard and as stretching as they are, but on our carbon-abatement targets, as well. We have to ensure that the measures in the draft order do not over-prioritise one at the expense of delivering value for money in the other.</ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="090318116000250"></a>The renewables obligation disappointed and frustrated those who wanted to go harder, faster and wider in the development of the British renewables sector in its first phase. We will look closely

It is clear that, with a feed-in tariff, renewable energy can be developed much quicker than we have been able to do. I hope the new banding system succeeds, but to do that it requires a sense of ambition, open-mindedness and pragmatism to be shared in the Government. My suspicion is that we still have a one-size-fits-all approach from a system that is too Whitehall-centric and does not do enough to encourage the entrepreneurial smaller, newer and exciting technologies&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Sixth Delegated Legislation Committee, 17/3/09; cols. 9-10.]</p>

<p><a name="090318116000239"></a>I was delighted to hear the Minister today talking more warmly about this very important small section of our community.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000071"></a>I will be interested to hear the answer to the question asked by my noble friend Lord Jenkin about the cost to the consumer, but, for the moment, we are happy just to support the order.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000072"></a><b><a name="90318-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="090318116000299"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. I detected a general welcome for the order. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, cheered me up immediately by saying that he was very much in favour of it. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, got there eventually as well, although his detailed questions led me at one stage to fear that the order presented more problems than its merits justify. However, we recognise the advantages that the order brings. Like the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, I have no wish to go back to the very full debate that we had in February on these issues, nor do I want to revisit the 2008 Act too much, although there are cost references because the order is derivative from the Act. If I may, as I have quite enough on my plate in dealing with these specific questions, I will concentrate more on those than on the more general issues that were raised about the order. It fulfils the position that last year&#146;s Energy Act set out to establish.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000073"></a>I shall begin with the question of costs, which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, identified as a difficult issue. He even said at one stage that the reason why not too much is specific in this area is that elements of it are not much more than a guess. Perhaps they are a little more than a guess&#151;perhaps an estimate&#151;but there are manifold uncertainties, and the noble Lord is as aware as anyone on the Committee of these uncertainties. I am not in a position to answer his question in specific terms.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000074"></a>The noble Lord also linked that with the question of information for the consumer. That was a debate that we had with regard to the Bill. As he said, the Government were resistant then, despite his strenuous efforts to persuade us of the virtues of that approach, and he will not be surprised that I have not come along to a debate on an order armed with a change to government policy of such significance. We do not expect the renewable energy strategy to have any large impact on bills in the immediate future. In the medium term, as the noble Lord indicated, it will cause some price increases. That has implications for fuel poverty, and the Government will have to address themselves to those issues at the time.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000075"></a>We seek to ensure that we take the most cost-effective approach to meeting our targets. We will look after those consumers who are most exposed and most in

We are concerned to promote energy efficiency. We want households to play their part so that energy efficiency improves because it reduces consumption, which is an important way of keeping costs down.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000076"></a>I am not going to be able to satisfy the noble Lord on the question of figures, and I do not really think that he expected me to do so, except to indicate that we recognise that there will be some increase in costs as a result of the order in the medium and longer term. I hope that he will appreciate that the targets we have set and are committed to meeting, although they involve increased costs, are part of an obligation that the Government&#151;and, I think, wider society&#151;regard  as of the greatest significance with regard to the threats from climate change unless we have effective strategies.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90318-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000077"></a>I agree with the noble Lord when he says that an underpinning principle behind the introduction of ROCs and the changes with regard to banding is that, over a period of time, stability is important. You cannot expect serious investment decisions of the size that is required if companies feel that there may be rapid changes which they cannot take into account in their forward planning strategies. We will follow the same process for the future as we have followed in determining these bands. We will commission modelling of costs from consultants on a UK basis. We will have the banding based on these costs from consultants. We will have peer review consultants working with the industry groups. We will make sure that we consult Ministers in the devolved Administrations. We will recognise that this process has to be the product of understanding and consensus, not one that is subject to arbitrary decisions by the Government which might relate to aspects of wider policy with regard to the economy. There has to be some consistency and stability with regard to the process. I entirely accept the noble Lord&#146;s comment on that point.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000078"></a>The noble Lord asked me a specific question about whether we had approval from the European Community in a formal notification. The answer is in the affirmative; we do have that, so we are able to make progress on that part. He asked whether the co-firing cap might restrict the market. We do not think that it is significant in those terms. We have included the cap on the number of co-fired ROCs that a licensed supplier may use to meet its target due to concerns expressed by a number of members of the industry in consultation responses that unrestrained co-firing could lead to dangerous unpredictability in the value of the ROCs. We will look at this again, and if we are provided with evidence that such a threat materialised or could materialise, we will look at it again and revise our position.</p>

The danger that the noble Lord has just outlined might then become a reality. The argument that I was making is that, in fact, the cap is quite a reassuring measure for the industry, because it means that the overall amount available for ROCs will not be swallowed up by a large

I reassure the noble Lord that we are fully seized of the point that he made during his earlier speech, and I offer at least some reassurance on that. I will write a letter which is not only reassuring but, I hope, deadly accurate in comparison to the rather broader generalisations that I can manage from the Dispatch Box at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000081"></a>The preferential treatment of energy crops is intended to develop energy crop supply chains, not just for short-term greenhouse gas savings. The greenhouse gas effects of all fuels are the subject of ongoing research, not just in this country but Europe-wide. The noble Lord also asked whether I could comment on other issues that might be different from the Energy Act. That is rather a tall order to ask of me. That is how I interpreted what he was saying. The noble Lord is enormously knowledgeable in these areas, and I know that he can press me very hard. He will know the limitations in preparation for an order of limited dimensions. I am reassured by the fact that I have my noble friend alongside me, but I will not even press him for a quick resum&#233; of the changes and developments that might be consequent upon the Energy Act&#151;that would test the patience of us all.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000082"></a>I wanted to emphasise that where we are able to talk more specifically about issues of electricity prices&#151;for instance, we suggested that the introduction of a banded RO might increase prices by 7 per cent by 2015, against a 5 per cent increase if we make no change&#151;it will relate to today&#146;s changes. The cost of the renewables target for 2020 is a more difficult issue for us to analyse. The noble Lord asked me about combined heat and power stations. They will receive more support under the RO than stations that generate only electricity. That reflects their greater efficiency, which we want to encourage.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000083"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, cheered me up by being positive in his general position on the order. We had many debates on the then Energy Bill on this, and he appreciates the significance of this strategy in terms of our overall policy objectives. He asked me about the boundary between ROCs and feed-in tariffs. That is also a difficult and complex issue. We will be consulting on it over the summer so I am not in a position to be definitive, but we recognise that this issue is important and we are going to do a great deal of work on it. We hope that we will make progress in answering that question before long.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000084"></a>The noble Lord also asked me whether the renewables obligation could be expressed in simpler terms, and he castigated us somewhat about the English in our memorandum. We all know that technicalities can overwhelm the soul in this area. The RO sets out specific definitions. The difference specified between &#147;ROCs&#148; and the &#147;renewables obligation certificates&#148; is

We are obliged to take on what the noble Lord was suggesting was a certain abstruse quality to our language, in order to identify just which area we are talking about.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000085"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, also broadly supported the order. I reassure her that we have looked again at our financial support mechanisms for renewable electricity generation to ensure that we maximise contributions on all scales. We are well aware of the challenges that we face with regard to the policy, and she is right to remind us of them. I do not underestimate the challenges that face the Government in this important area of policy, and I was grateful for the emphatic way in which she made that point.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000086"></a>On the whole, I commend the measure. It is predicated on the Act that we debated so extensively last year. I remember an amendment being passed at the time, against the Government&#146;s better judgment, which will be reflected in the way in which we implement the policy because it is now part of the law of the land. The obligation is the Government&#146;s key mechanism for encouraging the development of renewable generation in the UK. Since its introduction in 2002, we have seen a step change in the number of developments coming forward. Banding will bring forward another step change necessary to launch us towards the 2020 target. I think that we are all excited by aspects of the new technology that may come on stream. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, referred to the Severn barrage but there are other technologies, with very interesting potential dimensions, which use aspects of tidal flows and currents to supply electricity. That is why this is such an exciting area. But by the same token, it is an extremely difficult area about which to predict with any certainty. That is why the challenges from the opposition Benches, which I accept are entirely legitimate, are bound to be met with a rather vague response from the Government. We are dealing with uncertain developments but the targets we have to hit and the objectives of the public policy are clear. This order is an important part of that and I commend it to the Committee.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000088"></a>Debates on EU Committee reports tend to be a little incestuous, with some half-dozen committee members slapping one another on the shoulder and saying what a good job they have done, and the Minister saying, &#147;Hear, hear&#148; from the margins. Therefore, I am particularly pleased to see two non-members of the committee present, the noble Lords, Lord Browne and Lord Giddens. We very much look forward to hearing their contributions.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000089"></a>The report was published some time ago, but I do not think that its relevance has decreased at all since then. If anything, it is perhaps more timely that we have this debate now than at an earlier stage, because the European Council will meet at the end of this week and that will provide an opportunity for EU leaders to give a little more definition and direction to the position that the EU will take up in the Copenhagen negotiations, which is of fundamental importance.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000090"></a>The committee&#146;s report was published just before the December European Council, at which EU leaders reached agreement on a package of measures aimed at implementing their commitment to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, and to increase the share of renewable energy in EU energy consumption to 20 per cent by 2020. I suggest that the continual use of the refrain &#147;20 20 by 2020&#148; is not a good and sound basis on which to base policy.  It may be nice and catchy, but I do not think it is particularly well justified. That is an aside.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000091"></a>One measure in that package was an overhaul of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The committee's report examined the proposed reforms to the scheme. We have already received the Government&#146;s formal response to our report; I thank them for that. It is fair to say that there is precious little between us. There is a large measure of agreement on where we are and where we should be going. I will nudge the Minister from time to time to give us a little more definition and to update us on progress, but there are no major policy differences between us.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000092"></a>We start by asking what the ETS is about. The aim of the emissions trading scheme is to help member states&#151;perhaps &#147;help&#148; ought to be in quotation marks, because I am sure that some of them do not necessarily see it as help&#151;to meet their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It does this by putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions. In effect, it is a device that we use to respond to market failure and to the market not costing-in the price of emissions. By introducing a cost price, it makes it cost-effective for firms and industries to reduce their emissions by increasing energy efficiency, adapting new technologies that reduce emissions or switching from carbon-based energy sources to other energy sources. That should provide a real stimulus to bring about a reduction in emissions.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000093"></a>The ETS is a cap and trade scheme, meaning that the authorities place a cap or ceiling on the level of emissions to be permitted and then issue emission allowances or permits that aggregate up to that cap. Those allowances are then traded among participants in the scheme, who must surrender allowances equivalent to their emissions to the authorities at the end of each year. The cap on the overall number of permits is  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>intended to make them scarce and therefore render them valuable. For participants, the incentive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions comes from the prospect of selling unused allowances, thereby making money or from the prospect of having to buy allowances to cover their emissions, thereby losing money. In other words, it puts in place a direct economic incentive.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000094"></a>The theory is that that will stimulate emission reductions where they are cheapest and easiest to deliver, thereby reducing the overall cost to the economy of meeting the reduction targets. However, the history so far in the first phase has not been particularly encouraging. The theory may be fine, but in the first phase of the EU ETS, too many emission permits were issued to participants, resulting in a surplus that wiped out much of their value, and with it much of their power to stimulate emission reductions. Emission permits were also allocated to participants free of charge&#151;that is now seen as a significant error&#151;which in some cases led to windfall profits when companies that had received permits free still went ahead and put up the price of their products or services to reflect the market price of the allowances. That was a perverse policy effect.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000095"></a>We have already moved into the second phase of the ETS, which began last year and will end in 2012. The European Commission has attempted to rectify some of the problems identified in the first phase, but it is too early even now to tell whether those adjustments will be sufficient to ensure that the ETS delivers the right level of emissions reductions cheaply and efficiently. For now, signs are that although there will be a shortage of emissions permits during the current phase, 2008 to 2012, it will be considerably smaller than had been predicted, because one effect of the economic slowdown has been to reduce demand for carbon permits. Indeed, carbon permit prices have plunged from a high of &#8364;30 as recently as last summer to a low of &#8364;9 last month. It has to be faced that that has a number of serious consequences for the success of the scheme, the danger being that the price is not high enough to bring about the desired change in behaviour. That must be a matter of concern.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000096"></a>A second concern is that a number of Governments, it is fair to say, have already earmarked for spending the money that they anticipated receiving through the auction process, and it looks as though they will have much less to spend on reduction projects than they thought they would have.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000097"></a>The fundamental point is that although we are still at a stage where there must be a number of questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of the ETS, even during phase 2, all our eggs, in terms of emission reductions, are in this one basket&#151;perhaps not all, but many of them. It has become the centrepiece of UK and EU climate change policy, and therefore the environmental and economic stakes in play are immense. A lot rides on the successful implementation of the new phase of the ETS.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000098"></a>If the EU is to meet its target of a 20 per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, the ETS will have to deliver a 21 per cent reduction in emissions in the industrial and energy sectors covered by the scheme. That is a tall order&#151;a real challenge. In order to  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC119"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>achieve that, EU companies in those sectors will have to face a carbon price that is sufficiently high to make economically attractive the adoption of policies that bring about a reduction in emissions. As I said earlier, the context will change when the global economy picks up, but at the moment there must be a question mark about the level of the price.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000099"></a>There is the significant problem, usually referred to as &#147;carbon leakage&#148;, that competitors in third countries may not face a carbon price at all, or will face a much lower one. That brings with it the risk that EU companies participating in the ETS may lose business to rivals in third countries or choose to relocate their own operations, leading to no environmental gain at all. The threat of carbon leakage is real. How far has thinking gone in the EU and the Government to tackle the problem of carbon leakage and identify the sectors that are particularly vulnerable to it? That is the downside of risk.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000100"></a>On the upside, the scheme should in principle promote the uptake of emission-reduction opportunities where they are cheapest, thereby reducing the overall cost to the economy. The ETS also has the potential to serve as the nucleus of a global network of emissions trading schemes, which could facilitate international action on climate change. That is the big prize to go for&#151;an international global scheme. The European Commission has proposed that the EU system should be linked to comparable systems in other OECD countries by 2015, and to carbon markets in the more advanced developing economies by 2020. That objective is right, but at this moment it seems ambitious and challenging and I would appreciate any comments the Minister could make on that.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000101"></a>On balance&#151;or, rather, with some degree of enthusiasm&#151;the committee took the view that the threat posed by climate change merits a bold response, and lent its support to the Commission&#146;s proposals to press ahead with the revisions to the ETS. There are difficulties, however, and we have warned that there will be a need for vigilance on a number of fronts if the scheme is to live up to its promise. First, if the ETS is to deliver sizeable emissions reductions, it must put a meaningful price on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. That is the central issue. Some of the concessions made during the December negotiations in the European Council, such as reducing the level of auctioning, lowering the threshold beyond which sectors qualify as vulnerable to carbon leakage, and increasing access to external credits&#151;in other words, getting other people to do things to cover your own dirty work&#151;reduce the likelihood that the scheme will produce a strong price signal.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000102"></a>Pulling in the opposite direction are projections showing that the third phase&#151;from 2013 to 2020&#151;of the EU ETS is likely to deliver a substantially higher carbon price than the emissions trading schemes that are being set up in other parts of the world, including a future US scheme. There is a difference. If we are heading towards an international scheme, which is essential, there is a problem with the carbon price that it is anticipated various regional schemes will produce. That will make it much more difficult to link the EU ETS with emissions trading schemes in other countries. In its report, the committee emphasises the importance  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC120"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of such links, and warns that the ETS will be less effective, both economically and environmentally, while it remains an isolated regional initiative. It anticipates that the EU will face stark trade-offs between maintaining the environmental rigour of its scheme, which is important, and extending its reach. Again, there is a need to guard against rhetoric and signing up to a global scheme that may be relatively hollow and may fail to deliver. However, it is a matter of judgment, and it is for the Government and the EU as a whole to see whether a credible global scheme can be put into place.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000103"></a>A third area in which the committee flags up trouble that may lie in store is monitoring and enforcement. From an administrative and audit point of view, emissions trading is hugely complex and cumbersome. The committee warns that without rigorous compliance, the ETS would not only fail to deliver the desired emissions reductions but distort competition among those who do and those who do not play by the rules. The committee was not entirely satisfied that robust enforcement mechanisms that go beyond stricter targets in the future for countries that have failed to meet their targets in the past&#151;I cannot see such countries signing up to targets in the future if they have failed to meet them in the past&#151;are the sort of sanction that carries much real weight.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000104"></a>The committee took the view that the ETS should eventually include as many sectors as possible in order to open up the widest possible range of emissions reduction opportunities. For the foreseeable future, however, the scheme will cover only about half the EU&#146;s greenhouse gas emissions, while sectors such as agriculture and forestry, aviation and shipping, and transport and housing remain excluded. The committee took away the impression that policy on emissions reductions in these excluded sectors is proceeding at a rather more leisurely place. It should therefore be underlined that the ETS alone cannot and will not do all the work. Although we have many eggs in this basket, as I said, the ETS cannot deliver the whole picture. That is an awful lot of mixed metaphors.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000105"></a>In addition to the ETS, flanking measures are required to remove barriers to energy efficiency and to support innovation and the demonstration of low-carbon technologies. That brings us to coal and carbon capture and storage. Particularly urgent is the development of a reliable and commercially viable method of decarbonising coal. Coal is likely to remain a significant, and in some places growing, source of energy, particularly in the developing world.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000106"></a>The committee called for major investment in carbon capture and storage to establish as quickly as possible whether this technology could meet that need and at what extra cost. It supported the European Parliament&#146;s proposal, backed by the UK Government, to use emissions allowances from the new entrants reserve to support such investment. Additional funding for CCS demonstration projects may now be made available as part of the European Commission&#146;s economic stimulus package, but in the UK there is concern that the Government&#146;s timetable for getting a CCS demonstration plant up and running is slipping. I press the Minister for some assurance that progress is being made in that  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC121"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>area. At the moment, we are faced with the difficulty that we do not know whether carbon capture and storage is a viable technology or whether it can deliver at a reasonable cost. That is a major concern and worry.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000107"></a>Even if a commercially viable method of decarbonising coal can be found, it will be considerably more expensive than conventional coal-fired power generation. The challenge will be to persuade countries such as China and India, which will continue to be heavily dependent on coal, to deploy such technology at considerable additional cost. In the EU, we have the problem of countries, such as Poland, which are more than 90 per cent dependent on coal in their power sector. A relatively poor country will face a major increase in its power costs if it is to go down the carbon capture and storage route, which in many ways is one of the few avenues open to it.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000108"></a>International negotiations on a treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol are under way and are expected to culminate at the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December. Financial assistance and technology transfer to developing countries will no doubt form part of any eventual bargain. I have written here that the committee&#146;s view was that the &#147;historical responsibility&#148; argument championed by some advanced developing countries is compelling, although quite honestly I think it is a little bit short of compelling; ultimately, it is a distraction.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000109"></a>Developed countries alone cannot fend off the threat posed by climate change. Much of the increase in emissions over the next few decades will come from the developing countries, not the developed countries. In terms of the human and physical capital at risk from the effects of climate change, developing countries are some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change. It is a great pity that some of those countries&#146; leaders are still in a state of denial. The rhetoric is not hopeful. Again, we will have to confront that difficulty, and I hope that it can be resolved in the context of Copenhagen.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000110"></a>It is in the interests of the larger emerging countries&#146; economies to curb their own emissions growth, and we must give them every assistance. The financial assistance which I am sure will be part of the Copenhagen deal that goes to them must be targeted to support reductions in emissions, and must not go down the route of general development aid.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000111"></a>The European Commission has recently published a communication setting out its proposals for the approach that the EU should take in international negotiations building up to Copenhagen. At the European Council on 19 and 20 March, at the end of this week, European leaders are expected to offer their steer on what the EU&#146;s position should be. Naturally, I end with a plea to the Minister that perhaps he could share the views of the Government as they head towards that meeting.</p>

The noble Lord is an excellent chairman. This has been a good report to work on and I believe it has been well received by the Government and the Commission. There is no doubt that global warming poses a great threat to our very existence. With the prediction that the planet may warm by anything from 2 degrees to 6 degrees by the end of this century, it is sensible to take precautionary moves to mitigate that part of the rise over which mankind might have some control by curbing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000113"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, said, when we started taking evidence for this report last June, the FTSE stood at 5,970 and the oil price was hovering around $145 a barrel. As Members of the Committee will know, that situation has drastically altered. Today, the FTSE is around 3,850 and the oil price is around $46 a barrel. Industrial and manufacturing output has dropped substantially, and unemployment has reached 2 million and is rising fast. It is easy to see therefore that making predictions for a system that will enter into force in 2013 is fraught with difficulties.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000114"></a>However, we did not start with a blank sheet of paper, but with the experience of the first two phases of the ETS. The scheme was Europe's response to the Kyoto Protocol, which runs out in 2012, so the third phase of the ETS will be a very important contribution to the next stage of European climate change planning. We have examined the scientific advice, and we have listened carefully to a number of business voices and environmental voices, as well as to Governments. There appears to be agreement that we must tackle this problem now and not leave it to future generations, but it is not clear that the scope of the trading scheme envisaged for 2013 is wide enough to deliver the reductions required to reduce emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 from the 1990 level.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000115"></a>Although the report notes the difficulties of including agriculture and forestry within the ETS because of weaknesses in verification and monitoring, we heard from the New Zealand Government, who seem to have overcome these difficulties. Shipping is another area that should be brought in, but the co-operation of the International Maritime Organisation is needed. Reduction measures in those sectors of the economy that are excluded from the scope of the ETS account for 50 per cent of emissions. They must be brought in before too long to provide a proper cap for the system. As an aside, the Kyoto Protocol has not been ratified by the United States, which accounts for 20 per cent of global manmade greenhouse gas emissions, while other large emitters such as India and China were not included in the protocol.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000116"></a>The first phase of the system allowed nation states to set their own emissions limits to reflect their commitment under the Kyoto treaty and to allocate nearly all the permits free of charge. As the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, said, this has resulted in windfall profits for some industries. However, with the carbon price at about &#8364;8 or &#8364;9 per tonne last week, it is unlikely to stimulate environmentally efficient investment. Governments will lose out on expected revenues while companies sell unwanted permits in order to maximise their cash positions because of the recession.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC123"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000117"></a>We have argued that all the permits, other than those in the sectors liable to carbon leakage, should be auctioned in the third phase, in order to allow the marketplace to find the correct level. There is no doubt that the oil price and the carbon price are related, hence the dramatic fall in the price of the permits. It is considered that permits trading in the range of &#8364;35 to &#8364;45 would provide the necessary stimulus to encourage green investment decisions. However, the decision taken by the European Council in December 2008 watered down its original proposals, and it has agreed that 70 per cent of permits should be auctioned by 2020 and 100 per cent by 2027.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000118"></a>Although it is tempting to comment on all the recommendations in our report, I shall comment on only one further point which I consider to be important&#151;the use of external credits. In our report, we suggest that external credits in phase 3 should be limited to those available and unused in phase 2. We note in paragraph 225:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090318116000251"></a>&#147;External credits can play an important role in reducing global emissions cost-effectively as long as they do not crowd out developing countries&#146; own efforts to cut emissions&#148;.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000119"></a>The offset mechanisms created under the Kyoto Protocol are the clean development mechanism and joint implementation. These are methods to allow businesses and Governments in developed countries to fulfil their emission reduction commitments by purchasing carbon credits generated by projects that result in emission reductions elsewhere. Over 1,000 projects have been registered with the CDM executive board. The UK was the primary purchaser of 59 per cent of CDM/JI credits in 2007, largely for onward transmissions. The EU will have to monitor this trade very carefully to make sure that the emissions target set for the various member states is not fulfilled more than their allocation by external credits.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000120"></a>The European Council meeting in December had to balance the scientific evidence and the agreed targets for emission reduction against the political climate of a deepening recession. That is what politicians do; and, of course, the result was a bit of a fudge, with brave words about commitment and then the announcement of a compromise deal. There is auctioning phased in over a much longer period, with extra time-limited derogations and the continuation of free permits in several sectors. The threshold for small emitters was raised from 10,000 tonnes to 25,000 tonnes. Generous concessions were made on the extent to which national targets on CO2 reduction could be made by CDMs. The energy trading system is a tax on industry, which will be passed on to consumers by higher prices, especially in the energy field. With demand for industrial products falling fast, businesses will have to think very carefully about energy-efficient investments, but without that investment we run the risk of missing our national target and the EU its commitment to the international protocols.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000122"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sewel, described the emissions trading scheme as hugely complex and cumbersome. Yet, in essence, it is actually a very simple scheme. Once&#151;this in itself is something of a question&#151;you can measure carbon emissions among large carbon emitters, you place a cap and, in principle, the tighter you screw that cap, the greater the demand for permits and the higher the price. As the price rises, so this encourages those who can easily make savings in emissions to do so, thus providing an incentive to energy efficiency and innovation. The cap puts on the pressure to reduce emissions while the trading allows this pressure to be absorbed flexibly by those who can most easily change their ways.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000123"></a>This hands-off market mechanism has a lot of attractions for government because it is neutral&#151;it is the market that is effecting the changes&#151;and it has indeed been the Government&#146;s favoured way of cutting carbon emissions not only within the EU as a whole but specifically for the UK. A series of White Papers has come out. In the 2006 White Paper, the Government described the EU Emissions Trading Scheme as the cornerstone of the Government&#146;s policy framework to tackle climate change. It is the main policy that we have picked up in this country for tackling climate change. The energy policy White Paper of May 2007 said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090318116000252"></a>&#147;The best way to encourage a change in investment patterns towards a low-carbon economy, and the most cost-effective way of reducing global emissions, is to establish a price for carbon ... Trading mechanisms such as the EU ETS and the CDM&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="090318116000240"></a>the clean development mechanism&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="090318116000260"></a>&#147;allow cost-effective sharing of the burden of reducing carbon emissions&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000124"></a>Phase 1 of the EU scheme ran from January 2005 to December 2007&#151;three years in all&#151;and in many respects was a success, although I know that the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, has picked up some of the other aspects of it. It embraced more than 11,000 firms, and covered all major power stations and industrial installations in 25 countries, which together are responsible for some 45 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions in the EU, with the vast majority of these installations reporting their independently verified CO2 emissions and surrendering the appropriate number of allowances to cover them to the required deadlines. In addition, an active market for emission permits was established, with the City of London as its headquarters.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000125"></a>Nevertheless, phase 1 failed miserably to achieve its main aim: the reduction of carbon emissions. Allocations to emit carbon, which were agreed by national Governments for each member state under a national allocation plan, were much too generous, and as a consequence the market price of carbon collapsed before the end of the three-year period. That provided no incentive to any installation to cut emissions. Instead, it put large profits&#151;both noble Lords mentioned this&#151;into the pockets of utilities that had raised prices to consumers in anticipation of increased costs.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000126"></a>Phase 1 has generally been regarded as a learning phase. Phase 2 came into play on 1 January 2008 and is for five years, lasting until 31 December 2012. It has promised to make good many of the deficiencies of phase 1. The Commission has set a much tighter cap&#151;6.5 per cent below 2005 levels&#151;to meet our  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC125"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Kyoto targets, and has vetted the national allocation processes to prevent overgenerous allocations. Only 90 per cent of the allocations were awarded free of charge; the remaining 10 per cent are to be auctioned. More plants and installations were brought into the scheme and include the aviation sector, which is to come in on 1 January 2012.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000127"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, said, with only one year&#146;s trading to date it is much too early to judge how far the new scheme will succeed. However, it is noteworthy that, as in phase 1, the price of emissions permits has fallen. On this occasion, the blame is very much with the recession; the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, mentioned the degree to which the price of permits has fallen.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000128"></a>Our report, as the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, said, is not about phase 1 or phase 2, but actually about phase 3, which is to start in 2013 and run through to 2020. The Commission&#146;s proposal for phase 3, which it produced last spring, was successfully negotiated through the Council in December, with final clearance due later this week. Again, the proposals take into account the lessons learnt from phase 1. Instead of a series of national caps, there is to be a single EU cap which would hold, and the aim would be to cut emissions by some 21 per cent. A number of new industries such as petrochemicals and aluminium are to be brought in, and a much larger proportion of emissions licences will be auctioned. As the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, mentioned, the committee would also opt for a larger proportion. However, under the concessions made in the December talks we see that in fact a number of Governments have caved in, so it looks as though it will be smaller rather than larger. Where permits are given away rather than auctioned, it is in effect a subsidy for the utilities and firms concerned. New regulations on monitoring and verification are to be introduced, and the degree to which external credits can be used to offset domestic emissions under ETS obligations will be restricted.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000129"></a>Our report examined the proposals put forward by the Commission last summer and in general endorsed the stronger stance, particularly the notion of a tighter overall cap&#151;a 30 per cent rather than 20 per cent reduction&#151;provided that a broader agreement was reached in Copenhagen around climate change. If the ETS is to work, it is sensible to extend its coverage to areas such as transport and shipping. Agriculture and forestry, as the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, mentioned, were the subjects of an interesting teleconference with the New Zealanders on their approach to these measures. However, I do not agree that they are coping with it all, and indeed it struck me that they still have much to learn. We are also particularly keen to see auctioning extended and the free allocation of permits limited to those industries that are likely to relocate out of the EU&#151;those that comprise the so-called carbon leakage.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000130"></a>We are and have been much in accord with the UK Government in all this, as their response to our report implies. However, we part company on two issues. First, we have argued that where allowances are auctioned, part of the revenue should be ring-fenced for policies that promote low-carbon technologies. The noble Lord, Lord Sewel, mentioned the importance we place on  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC126"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>promoting carbon capture and storage. The Commission asked that a proportion of these funds be put at its disposal, but we agree with the Government that that is not a good idea. However, the money should be directed as a matter of urgency into R&amp;D in the UK. We also parted company over the use of clean development mechanisms and similar schemes for offsetting carbon. While understanding the general argument that a reduction in carbon usage is just as useful whether it derives from an advanced country such as the UK or from a developing country such as Nigeria, it nevertheless sends all the wrong messages. If we are to meet the tough carbon reduction targets necessary to prevent global warming, all countries have to make the shift towards low-carbon technologies, with the developed countries leading the way.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000131"></a>In this respect, I think that the agreement on these issues concluded last December in Brussels was extremely disappointing, caving in as it did to much too great an extent to national and industrial interests on so many points where a tough stance was needed&#151;the commitment to the 30 per cent target is still very tenuous; limiting the number of new industries to be brought into the fold was not clear; there was a caving in on the auctioning of allowances and allowing free allocations to a lot of the major players; and there was agreement that up to two-thirds of emissions reductions could be outsourced to third-world countries.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000132"></a>I can only agree with a letter written to the <I>Guardian</I> by the Green MEP, Caroline Lucas, who was a member of the European Parliament&#146;s team working on the package. She wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090318116000253"></a>&#147;EU leaders ended up with such a dramatically weakened agreement, devoid of any serious ambition ... A 20 per cent emissions reduction target by 2020 is far too little too late and, scandalously, around two-thirds of the emissions reduction could be outsourced to developing countries. This is scientifically unsound and ethically wrong. It means the EU can cherry-pick the cheapest climate mitigation potential in developing countries in order to prolong our own unsustainable model&#148;.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000133"></a>I have for some time been something of a sceptic about the European Emissions Trading Scheme. I worried that it was too clever by half to work effectively, another of those schemes dreamt up by economists that get distorted in practice and never work out as planned. I confess that the probing that we undertook as a committee for the report somewhat reassured me. For all its limitations, it seemed to be beginning to get a carbon market off the ground and to provide a model that could be extended to link with others&#151;a link that would be so important if President Obama manages to get a similar scheme off the ground in the United States.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000134"></a>Although my scepticism is somewhat abated, it is important to put the ETS into perspective. Its record is, as we say in the final chapter of our report, unproven. In particular, the UK Government need to beware of putting too many of their eggs in that one basket. Few dispute today the gravity of the climate change agenda. All the data coming out of last week's science meeting in Copenhagen emphasise how important it is. It is important that the Government back the scheme as wholeheartedly as they can, but other policies on that agenda that promote energy efficiency and encourage the uptake of low-carbon technologies also play a part

As I have said before, the public mood is now receptive to the climate change message and the public are looking to the Government to provide the lead. Hiding behind the seeming neutrality of market mechanisms is not necessarily the most effective way to show that leadership.</p>
<h5><a name="090318116000273"></a>5.52 pm</h5>

<p><a name="090318116000135"></a><b><a name="90318-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="090318116000306"></a>Lord Giddens:</b> I venture with some trepidation into this incestuous debate, but I start by congratulating the committee on the excellence of its report. I do not want to question its excellence, but I want to comment on the wider context of the ETS. It is worth remembering its background. The European Commission originally wanted a carbon tax. Carbon markets have their origin in the US, where they were used with some success to control emissions of sulphur dioxide. The EU switched to carbon trading in the face of opposition to EU-wide taxes, and I fear that this country was one of those opposing such a tax.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000136"></a>The Commission originally proposed to auction credits. The noble Baroness mentioned economists. Some American economists invented the notion of carbon trading. It is worth remembering that they insisted that auctioning the credit was crucial for the success of the scheme. What happened in the European Union in the run-up to phase 1 was that lobbying from business and some nations sunk the proposal to auction credits.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000137"></a>That is one, but not the only, reason for the conclusion drawn by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, which I also draw, that phase 1 of the ETS was a failure. As is mentioned in the report, the Commission likes to call it a learning experience. Putting it bluntly, one has to say that it is a failure. We have some data on its consequences for lowering emissions. Some studies indicate that emissions were something like 5 per cent lower than they would otherwise have been if the scheme had not come into operation. That figure is almost certainly empty. It is more apparent than real, because it probably comes from the fact that originally member states produced tactical exaggerations of their emissions in the build-up to the scheme. We know that they did that; it is quite well documented.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000138"></a>I am pleased to see, in a phrase that was also quoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that the committee says that,</p>
<ul><a name="090318116000261"></a>&#147;its record&#151;in delivering emissions reductions cheaply and efficiently&#151;is as yet unproven&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090318116000241"></a>I hope, with the committee, that the scheme in its new form will meet with success, but it is plainly an open question at the moment. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, also said that it is worth asking why Governments like emissions trading schemes. In principle at least, they are quite popular with Governments. The reason is basically the one to which the noble Baroness alluded; all will be resolved by the magic of markets, and it does not seem like a tax even though it is a tax, so it has a certain intuitive political appeal.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000139"></a>The ETS in its new form, just like in its previous forms, must be situated in the context of a diversity of other policies and strategies that Governments have to follow. To me, that is a really crucial point, and I should like to make three sets of observations about it.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC128"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000140"></a>First, we must be careful not to measure success in terms of turnover. I have seen this so much in studying the literature on this over the past year. In 2007, the World Bank estimated the size of the global carbon market at $64 billion a year. Yet plainly that is irrelevant. What counts is how far it has actually reduced emissions. The report has a very good section on monitoring and standards, but it mostly covers monitoring the standards involved in the actual operation of the scheme itself. It is crucial that we monitor outcomes, but this is not discussed in the report. We must try to work out how far such schemes on the ground actually reduce the proportion of CO2 or greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere. I assure noble Lords that we have only very partial data on this at the moment. Most of those who favour carbon trading talk in terms of the sheer volume of trading that is generated. Whatever other benefits that might bring, it does not show us anything about the case under consideration.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000141"></a>Secondly, as noted on page 18 of the report, carbon pricing on its own will not deliver new technologies, although it could provide something of a stimulus to them. As for low-carbon technologies and limiting emissions, we need one or more significant technological breakthroughs.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000142"></a>I note what the committee says on CCS. The committee is discussing it in the context of the emissions scheme. As noble Lords quite rightly said, it is problematic. We do not really know how effective it will be in the longer term, no matter how much money is pumped into it. I feel very strongly that, alongside the ETS, Governments need to reverse their attitude towards technological innovation. I remember the noble Lord, Lord Browne, speaking eloquently about this in a debate that we had in your Lordships&#146; House about climate change. Governments should talk less about costs and emphasise competitive advantage instead. They should stop talking only of problems and start talking of opportunities.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000143"></a>I note that President Obama has been dragged into duty in this discussion. He wishes to set up a trading scheme for the United States, but there is a massive contrast between his approach to climate change and innovation and that of the European Union, which&#151;and I say this as a strong pro-European&#151;is still a typically bureaucratic, complicated concern with regulation above all. President Obama&#146;s approach has an inspirational quality to it. He says, &#147;Look, we&#146;re on the cusp of a new economy. Let&#146;s invest in it and promote innovation. Let&#146;s see if government can help businesses to secure a competitive edge&#148;. There is probably a gestalt switch in business and technology whereby the companies that are environmentally progressive will be more competitive in the marketplace, and a strong reversal of emphasis is needed to go along with carbon trading and the other target and regulation-bound commitments to which the Government have signed up.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000144"></a>Thirdly, no matter how successful or otherwise the European trading system might be, it will not take away the need for a robust fiscal policy, and the Government should not shirk from that. We know that fiscal policy must take the form of a mixture of penalties and incentives. We know, not least because of work done in BP and the inspiration of the noble Lord, Lord Browne, that however the carbon cap is  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC129"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>set, it is not going to be enough to guarantee adequate pricing for most low-carbon technologies. We know that we will need further taxation-based platforms for those technologies to get off the ground, because they are not competitively priced against existing fossil fuel technologies.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000145"></a>We also know that we need an overall fiscal order on climate change. I have been studying all the major EU countries that are signed up to the ETS in this respect, and I have found that hardly any of them have made an overall fiscal audit. By that I mean not only introducing carbon-based taxes but auditing existing subsidies for fossil-fuel businesses. I do not know how far the Government have got in making such an audit, but I would like to see them at the leading edge of the European countries in so doing.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000146"></a>My conclusion is that the report should be situated in a wider context, which has to involve diversity of policy. Wherever one looks in climate change&#151;I say this having now spent a couple of years immersed in the literature of it all&#151;there are strongly problematic elements. I support the principle of a more rigorous European trading scheme for carbon trading. I also support the principle of the internationalisation of that scheme, but that second objective is a long way off.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000147"></a>At the moment, my conclusion will be similar to that of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, in that there is a strong component of faith in the ETS at the moment. It can therefore be no more than one set of policies in the context of a whole series of other robust policies that have to be instituted elsewhere.</p>

They are idealists, after all. They might eventually be right, but at the moment the Stern review describes the economics of climate change as,</p>

<a name="90318-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000152"></a>Furthermore, we do not need only an EU ETS; we must end up with a worldwide scheme. The EU is responsible for only 14 per cent of the world's CO2 emissions, so a 20 per cent cut on the EU stage would represent only a 3 per cent cut in global emissions. We need a worldwide scheme, and eventually we need to think of a carbon economy that affects not only all businesses but all people. Having said that, my two messages for today are: first, &#147;softly, softly, catchee monkey&#148;; and, secondly, let us try to create a climate of certainty over a long period so that businesses and individuals know where and how to invest over a 20-year period.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90318-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000153"></a>On the softly, softly front, let me first deal with carbon leakage: that is, there is no point in making an EU industry uncompetitive by slapping carbon costs on to it when the production would merely move to the third world and have no such restraints. The cement and aluminium industries are good examples here. However, we can freeze the present free emission allowances for these businesses and state firmly that these free allowances are going to be gradually reduced between 2013 and 2020. This would give those industries a soft landing in this new economy but with the certainty of a route map for the future.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000154"></a>Again on the softly, softly front, I support the CBI belief that the de minimis threshold for a company to fall into the scheme should be raised from the original EU proposal of 10,000 tonnes of CO2 per annum. The CBI went for a minimum of 50,000 tonnes, claiming that while it would remove 70 per cent of business emitters from the scheme, it would actually remove only 5 per cent of emissions. Speaking as someone who has spent much of his political life supporting SMEs, especially small rural businesses, I support this message. The EU and the UK Government have now chosen a threshold of 25,000 tonnes, but I have not seen any statistics on the effect of that figure. All I will say is that it is a dangerous time for the survival of small and medium-sized businesses, and in the UK at any rate they are already going to be affected by the climate change agreement scheme and the carbon reduction commitment.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000155"></a>We have to bear in mind in all of this that everyone and every industry will soon be forced to pay higher electricity costs as a result of this scheme. The electricity generating industries will pay for 100 per cent of their allowances from the start of the scheme: thus we will all be affected, come what may, including those industries that are protected by the carbon leakage safety net. In this context, aluminium is a very high electricity usage industry and its world competitive position will be affected in a small way from day one.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000156"></a>As an aside&#151;this has been mentioned by most speakers in connection with the electricity generating industry&#151;if non-renewable generators can apply carbon capture technology to their power stations, they too will get free allowances. This is essential, and an effective system of CCS would probably be the most important breakthrough for the whole world&#151;not least in China and India&#151;if it could be made a

However, as time goes on, I am becoming less and less hopeful of the likelihood of it becoming the norm or even happening at all on any meaningful scale in the near future. I hope that I am wrong and that the exhortations of the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, will have some effect.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000157"></a>My softly, softly approach actually goes slightly further than the proposed EU scheme because I believe that every industry, including agriculture and forestry, ought to be included in the long-term plan. I have to declare an interest as a farmer, although no doubt what I am saying will not be very popular with my fellow farmers. New Zealand, which was referred to, has included its agricultural industry in its scheme but says that its agriculture will continue to have free allowances until 2030. However, it is getting its agricultural industry to assess its emissions in kilograms per hectare and thus to establish a baseline for future use. The same ought to apply in the EU. Even if every farm were made to calculate only its current emissions, that would be a first step. Benchmarks would then come into being, thought processes would happen, solutions would be identified, and, eventually, as with all SMEs and microbusinesses&#151;indeed, as with all industries&#151;they too would fall into the net of an ever-developing ETS. Softly, softly, catchee monkey.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000158"></a>As for my second point on certainty, the main thrust must be proper auditing and controls. As our chairman said, this must not be a voluntary scheme. It is crucial that the EU enforces the application of the scheme equally in every member state. Without that, it is, frankly, inoperable. We also need certainty as soon as possible on a range of other issues: for instance, in the areas I have already touched on, such as carbon leakage and the de minimis threshold. We need a long-term but well planned market structure of 20 to 30 years for this to work effectively.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000159"></a>Another complicated area is that of the emissions-saving projects outside Europe to which other speakers have referred, such as CDMs and the like. The extent to which these could be used to offset domestic obligations will be uncertain until after the Copenhagen conference. That uncertainty must be resolved as soon as possible, as immediate investment worldwide in new carbon-saving processes is vital now for both economic and environmental reasons. My own view&#151;I accept that I am slightly at odds with our report&#151;is that we should be as flexible as we dare over worldwide schemes and access to international credits, without upsetting the discipline of the internal marketplace. That may be a contradiction, but the point I made earlier was that unless this develops into a worldwide scheme, it will not serve much purpose for saving the world.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000160"></a>The rules on CDMs must, however, be clear and be rigorously policed. In the past, neither has been the case, and as a result clean investment in third-world countries has fallen into disrepute, which in the long run will be bad news for the future of our planet. Again, the need for underlying certainty through proper enforcement to encourage sound long-term investment is my main point.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000161"></a>My final point is about research, which the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, mentioned. We desperately need money for aggressive R&amp;D in this area. It is to be

As the noble Lord has said, however, the Government must do their bit on behalf of taxpayers and consumers, who will ultimately have to pay for all the downside risks. The CBI told us that in publicly funded energy R&amp;D we spend about one-third of the EU average as a proportion of GDP. The Government appear to recognise that this is an important area, and they must put their money where their mouth is.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000163"></a>I want to tender an apology to the chairman, the Committee and the House for overlooking that I should have declared in our report that I am an adviser to Accenture plc. I make this declaration in the House&#146;s Register of Members&#146; Interests, of course, and so far as I can see it is not really relevant in this instance, but, as a number of newspapers seem to have taken to adding two and two together and reaching five, since I did not mention it I ought to make sure that my oversight does not lead to any unfounded and inaccurate allegations. I can declare it only as an irrelevant interest.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000164"></a>I turn to the meat of the debate. We have heard a remarkable survey not only of what we dealt with in the report but beyond it. This is a fast-moving topic, and indeed since we reported we have seen the details of the compromise reached on the terms of the system that is to run from 2013 through to 2020, and for some aspects of it on to 2027. Some of those details have fallen short of what we recommended, but positive steps have also been announced as part of the package. I refer particularly to the support that has been offered to help stimulate the much needed development of carbon capture. Here I underwrite the plea of the chairman of the committee that the Government need to get a move on in this area if they are to avoid continuing and increasing criticism from several quarters for failing to take the appropriate decisions speedily enough.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000165"></a>The world economy has continued to decline dramatically since we reported last autumn, and as a consequence of the downturn in business, carbon dioxide emissions have also dropped. That is a good thing, and not many people would argue against it. However, as others have mentioned, a worrying consequence is that we have also witnessed a collapse in the price of traded carbon, which is seen as a cornerstone of the EU&#146;s climate and energy policy. Some have argued that the system might fail, contending that we are over-reliant on market forces and that policy-makers are ignoring the risks attached to a  low price for carbon: something that could become  the norm.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000166"></a>I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us what adjustments and alternatives might be available to the Government and the EU if circumstances demand changes to the system. Some advocate that we need a minimum and a cap within the price to ensure some stability for businesses in Europe so that they can see where they are going and decide whether they can sign up, but the present circumstances are so uncertain that all the hopes and ambitions that Europe might have will fail to be delivered unless we see a swift upturn in the world economy and thus in Europe.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000167"></a>I start from the premise, which the noble Viscount, Lord Slim, put so ably in his groundbreaking report, that the scientific evidence for global warming is now overwhelming. The benefits of early action considerably outweigh the costs. I know that this is not the universal view of noble Lords, but I share the mainstream opinion that global warming is an urgent and escalating problem. I welcome the EU&#146;s commitment to set clear targets to try to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000168"></a>Evidence of the scale of the challenge continues to grow. The reports of the Copenhagen climate change gathering held just over a week ago were quite frightening, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, indicated. The noble Lord, Lord Stern, was there, again calling for action, as he did at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. I am an avid reader of his contributions to the various international gatherings that he attends. I was particularly interested in what he said about Britain&#146;s banking industry and how it is likely to become one of the nation&#146;s key assets in dealing with climate change. He suggested that Britain&#146;s banks and financial institutions would be an essential element in building the low-carbon infrastructure that the country will need if it is to achieve its emissions reduction targets. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090318116000254"></a>&#147;Banking could do very well as Britain moves to a low carbon economy. There will be lots of business opportunities and Britain&#146;s bankers are particularly strong in this area. They have been very creative over all kinds of issues and they could do it again in the financing of green initiatives&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000243"></a>I do not know whether he was speaking with his tongue in his cheek or being truly green, but he prompted me to refer to that part of our report where, last October, we took evidence from a number of bankers, analysts and researchers. We were anxious to get an insight into how the carbon market was developing in monetary terms in its volume, its value and where it was anticipated it would go in the light of the Commission&#146;s proposals, particularly for the third phase from 2013-20.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000169"></a>I will not go into all the detail. Different views have been expressed about whether the first phase has been a success. Certainly, the bankers&#146; view was that the money had grown very quickly in the relatively short space of time that the new system had been operating. Admittedly it has declined since then because of the downturn in the world economy, but their figures showed that it was growing at a phenomenal pace. We need to get back to growth to see whether the carbon price can initiate the changes we are looking for. Will the Minister ensure that we are up to speed with the financial regulation? On page 71 of the oral evidence, at Question 334 which I raised, the Minister will see that we expressed concerns about how the system was  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC134"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>operating and how it was being regulated. While I take into account the views expressed by my noble friend Lord Giddens about overregulation, in some areas we need proper regulation.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000170"></a>In the evidence, it is interesting to note that the bankers and the analysts expressed doubts about the ability of the FSA in this area. One witness said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090318116000255"></a>&#147;What is lacking is the financial regulation. The FSA does not care all that much about the carbon market just yet&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000244"></a>This is a market worth not just up to $60 billion, but estimated&#151;not the final figure&#151;for 2008 to be worth more than $100 billion within the space of three years. The witness continued:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090318116000256"></a>&#147;The bigger gap is in financial regulation. If we want carbon to be an asset class in the same way as other commodities are assets, then before long we have to get serious about the financial regulation of that asset class&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000245"></a>In fairness we did not take any evidence from the FSA, which may have quite a different view on this. I would welcome the Minister&#146;s comments and his assurance that this issue is being examined and that we will not run into problems in the same way we have in other areas with our banks over recent months.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000171"></a>This report highlights both the challenges and the opportunities of emissions trading as part of a strategy to reduce carbon production. Like others, I believe that ultimately the solutions will have to be found on a global level. Given the problem we have with the price of carbon and where it is going, can the Minister indicate how much elbow room and opportunity there will be for European Governments at the forthcoming Copenhagen conference to actually have the money needed to incentivise the BRICs to get involved with us and the other developing countries to participate in a global climate agreement? Without the money being there and the incentive being open to them, I suspect that, while we may have our scheme operating in Europe&#151;warts and all&#151;it will not be worth anything if we cannot pull in the rest of the world. We have to be in a position to incentivise them to join us.</p>

I am a managing director of a company called Riverstone Holdings, which manages private investments in energy. I am also chairman of Accenture&#146;s energy advisory board and I am on the advisory boards of the following: Deutsche Bank&#146;s climate advisory board; Sustainable Forest Management; and Valiance, a European infrastructure investor. I believe that that should cover all the bases.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000173"></a>I very much support the conclusions of the report, and I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, and the sub-committee on constructing it. I also very much support emissions trading schemes generally. In theory, the EU ETS is about the efficiency of resource allocation in the EU, getting resources to the right places. But that is in theory. I also agree that as many sectors and as many parts of those sectors need to be included in the scheme as possible. In the light of those comments, let me make four points.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000174"></a>The potential emissions reductions that come from forest and land management need somehow to be included. Many scenarios show that if we take the  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC135"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>period just to 2020, a period that we can probably understand quite well, up to half of the required emissions reductions could be achieved by better forest management and land husbandry. So, first, somehow that must be included.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000175"></a>Secondly, to scale this globally there must be a link to the clean development mechanism or, more precisely, to whatever succeeds the present clean development mechanism, which is a project-based system. Given some concerns about governance, we hope to go to a programme-based system, one that can be administered more easily with the appropriate governance.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000176"></a>The reason that that is important is that if we look at what needs to be done by 2020, two-thirds of the required emission reductions are likely to be achieved in the developing world, and the cost of achieving them will be one-third of the total, so it is very important to link a CDM mechanism to the EU ETS. The scale of expenditure in total is about $100 billion, which exactly corresponds to all overseas development assistance last year. Carbon finance flows need to be at about that scale, and much of that could be achieved by a revised CDM mechanism.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000177"></a>Thirdly, there are plenty of exceptions in the scheme, so the EU ETS will not be a pure indicator of the price of carbon needed to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide to an acceptable level. Experience to date has shown that it will also create a carbon price that is too volatile for long-term planning. In my practical experience, the carbon price established by the trading system is unlikely to be used to determine whether a project will go ahead or not. It simply will not be used in that way, because most decision-makers will not know where to place it. We therefore need different systems to create stability of estimation, some certainty and consistency, and to do that in a transparent way. Until the system develops fully, we cannot regard it as the only mechanism to price carbon. We need it relevantly to operate alongside regulations, incentives and taxes designed  to price in the carbon externality in a practical and stable way.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000178"></a>We also need to understand that whatever we do and whatever we think about the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, it probably applies to longer-term stable investments. It does not help in determining how much research has to be done or what should be done in innovation. Nor will it inspire innovation. All these things need to be done by making choices and taking decisions.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000179"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Giddens. These systems and mechanisms of trading, incentives, taxes and regulations are in many ways designed to create a level playing field between many energy sources. In order to understand that level playing field, we need to examine the existing energy sources and ask ourselves what explicit, or otherwise implied, subsidies are applied to these sources. That is the result of a fiscal audit, which he has suggested.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000180"></a>Most people look at the things being talked about with regard to climate change and energy and ask a simple question: does this change the way our economy will work? Will it change the whole way we think about not just energy or climate change, but everything&#151;not just separate and apart, but integrated with what

The question we have to ask is whether that will happen with this scheme, or whether it will be used as a crutch to avoid looking at the whole system that operates our economy.</p>
<h5><a name="090318116000277"></a>6.31 pm</h5>

<p><a name="090318116000181"></a><b><a name="90318-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090318116000312"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, for this report. I agree with him that we should try to make this session rather less formal than maybe it would be in the Chamber, although I notice that we have not had any Committee-style interruptions or interjections yet&#151;not that I am inviting them over the next 10 minutes.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000182"></a>Reading through the ETS report took me back to my young management days when I was an energetic manager in industry. I was a member of the Bristol Junior Chamber of Commerce and we took part annually in a competition based on a business game. This was back in the 1970s, when computers did not exist in the form that they do now. We would be given a scenario. We decided a number of management actions, which we would fill in on a form and send off. They would be fed through a computer, along with forms from our competing junior chambers, and it worked out what would happen. When we came back the following week we found out what the results of our management had been, and then we made our next step. That reminds me of the EU ETS, except that we do not have a one-week gap&#151;we operate on gaps of five years and seven years&#151;but it is just as much in the fog of what else is going on. It is even more on the cutting edge of experimentation. But, instead of talking about junior managers and a theoretical company, we are talking about the future of the planet, its atmosphere and the major pollutant that we are trying to control, and about changing the habits of the whole of industry globally. That is the challenge.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000183"></a>As many Members of the Committee have said, this is the key item in the climate change toolbox in Europe and the developed world. It accounts for some 50 per cent of carbon generally, so it has to work. We do not have much of an alternative. We have various regulations and incentives, such as renewable energy targets. But, at the end of the day, if this mechanism, which we have been investing in for some eight years or so, does not work, we have a problem overall.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000184"></a>The mechanism is market-based. The noble Lord, Lord Giddens, is right; the irony of this to me was always that this mechanism was almost demanded by an American Administration&#151;at the fag-end of the Clinton era, I seem to remember&#151;and taken on by the EU. Then the US did not even put the Kyoto Protocol through Congress to be ratified. Therefore, we have a cap system that needs to decline between 2008 and 2020 by 21 per cent. Why has this become such an important item in the toolbox? It is one that we like to think can work but, as I believe the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said, it is an easy way forward for the Government, and I do not say that pejoratively. It does not constitute an overt tax, even though it will affect prices, and, even better, it provides an income stream, so you win both ways: you are not only seen as not taxing the public but you have a significant income stream, to which I shall return in a minute.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC137"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000185"></a>On the negative side, the problems were well outlined by my noble friend Lady Sharp. For example, we have oversupply in the first phase. In the second phase there will still be a problem of free issue, which means price variability. When a business is short of cash, it looks at its assets. If assets have been allocated to it for which it has not had to pay and which have a market value&#151;even though IRRs are low at the moment, their present value is worth a lot more than their future value&#151;it sells them and so the whole market moves down, although I know that it has bounced up slightly. With regard to the problem of flooding clean development mechanism units, the Commission has tried very strongly to restrict this although we are already committed to moving them forward from phase 2 into phase 3. Once they are there we are stuck with them, but the quality of incoming units could devalue the clean development mechanism EUAs.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000186"></a>The good news is that the mechanics of the system have worked well. Verification is one of the most positive aspects of the EU ETS. I am not aware that anyone has questioned the monitoring of individual plants&#146; emissions, whereas claims of cheating are rife in more or less everything else to do with the European Union. The verification procedures are good because they relate mainly to large-scale installations or energy users. It would be preferable to address other sectors such as farming, agriculture or land management but problems around verification and having confidence in the scheme immediately arise. You have to have balance in that regard. On phase 3, I very much welcome the European Commission&#146;s stronger management regarding the issuing of EUAs and its efforts to curb the inflationary aspects of clean development mechanisms. A further positive aspect is that the new-entrant reserves are also being reduced&#151;down to 5 per cent, I think. Even then, they are allowed to be allocated only on a best-technology basis. However, if we had complete auctioning, new-entrant reserves would not be required. They exist only because we allow free allocations in the first place.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000187"></a>Aviation will come into the scheme in 2012. It is a pity that we have to wait until 2012 for that but it is only three years away. However, there is no mention of shipping coming in, although the report says that it should be included where that is possible. That would be a good step. The calculations around aviation and shipping may be difficult but the emissions are reasonably easy to verify.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000188"></a>On carbon leakage and the whole area of auctioning, we cannot get away from the fact that to get a proper carbon price to make the system really work we have to auction a very large proportion of the total. The Commission does not expect total free allocation to end until 2027, and the figure should be about 70 per cent by 2020.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000189"></a>Again, we would not have had the fall in carbon price that we have had over the past month if we had had auctioning and people had to pay. You would not buy until there was a need, so you would not have the vast offloading of an asset, particularly when there is no co-ordination between member states as to when those annual allocations are let out. We are not sure

That is a major issue.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000190"></a>I welcome the fact that we are moving out from just carbon dioxide into other greenhouse gases&#151;nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons. That is good, and I also welcome the de minimis rule. As the report says very well, we have to make sure that we do not have the situation that we had with car taxation where, if there is a big step up in costs, everyone designs a car to be below that level, so that everyone gets away with the taxation. There are a number of good things there.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000191"></a>What concerns me greatly&#151;I reflect many of the comments made by my noble friend Lady Sharp&#151;is that we are heavily reliant on this one mechanism. If this does not work, the whole climate change strategy falls over in one step. We enter this debate and leave it knowing that it has to work. It includes only 40 per cent to 50 per cent of emissions. The next step down, which the UK Government are trying, the carbon reduction commitment, is only another 5 per cent or 10 per cent. Even beyond that, there is a long way  to go.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000192"></a>I absolutely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Browne, that every business that I have talked to, even large-scale ones, does not really take notice of the fact of the carbon price. No one really puts that into the spreadsheet or the investment appraisal, because it is so difficult to put it in, considering whether it will be there in the long term and what the price will be. Until that starts happening&#151;that is the litmus test in the boardrooms of this country and of Europe&#151;the system has failed.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000193"></a>The report talks about the rest of the world, which is clearly pretty important, as the European Union is now only responsible for about 15 per cent of emissions. It is wrong to look at the developing world, particularly China, and say that now the largest polluter has to change its mind. I believe that China realises the challenges, but it also understands that it has to solve the huge rural poverty in its own nation. That is the only way that China can move forward. The will is there. We should never forget that although its production of carbon may have gone up quite substantially&#151;now it is up to 27 per cent or 30 per cent of global emissions&#151;a major proportion of that increase is to feed our consumption in Europe and North America. Its answer to us is, &#147;You have put carbon into the atmosphere in the past, but now a large proportion of the carbon that we are putting into the atmosphere is for you to consume as you want to as western consumers&#148;.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000194"></a>This scheme has to succeed. We are overcommitted. The market mechanism is right, if we can make it work. We have to apply it as it needs to be applied. That means a large proportion of auctioning of permits early on. I regret to say that we have to be very cautious about the number of clean development mechanism units that we allow into our own scheme. Philosophically, I absolutely believe that a tonne of carbon saved elsewhere is equal; it does not matter where it is. The problem is that in verification of those schemes, you devalue the gold standard in Europe. Because this scheme has to work, there has to be

I do not say that I have the right answer to that, but we risk undermining the scheme.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000195"></a>I should like to ask the Minister how the Government will use the &#163;8 billion that they will get per annum by 2020. It is a nice revenue to have, and I would like to think that it will go into this area. The British Government have gone through two rounds of auctioning. What lessons came out of that that they would like to share with Europe and the Commission? How can we get carbon capture and storage to go at a much faster pace? I think we have already lost that one for 2020. Carbon price stabilisation was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Browne. The noble Lord, Lord Turner, in a committee of the other place, talked about the possibility of floor pricing. Are the Government looking at that? Even if we meet all our EU ETS targets on carbon savings and reduce them by 80 per cent by 2050, what will our carbon consumption be by 2050 compared with in 1990?</p>

<p><a name="090318116000196"></a><b><a name="90318-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="090318116000313"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, for his excellent introduction and the members of the European Union Committee on the revision of the European Union&#146;s emissions trading system. I thank in particular those who have spoken today, including my noble friend Lord Ullswater. He said that it is fairly incestuous that members should turn up and speak because they have been on a European Union Committee, but I am very happy to be here today. I spent the first six years of my time in this House serving on European Union committees, which was a very good apprenticeship for the Front Bench. It teaches you patience, if nothing else.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000197"></a>My party warmly endorses this report, which is mainly in line with the Conservatives&#146; publicly stated position. We fully support the EU ETS and agree that the scope needs to be enlarged to progressively cover more economic activity. There have been some excellent questions. Every day, I learn something more about this subject. I was obviously delighted to listen to the noble Lord, Lord Browne of Madingley, who brings such experience to our debates on this subject.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000198"></a>I, too, would like to ask some questions. I will try to keep them brief because we have been here a long time. We have all had a very nice time, but I am sure that the Minister is ready to deal with us all. In reference to the EU ETS, the committee states that,</p>
<ul><a name="090318116000263"></a>&#147;the fledgling scheme has yet to demonstrate that it can deliver the substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions that will form the yardstick of its success&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090318116000246"></a>Does the Minister agree with this assessment, and what changes does he advocate implementing to make real inroads into reducing greenhouse gas emissions and prove the worth of the scheme? It is evident from the committee&#146;s report that it anticipates the European Union eventually facing stark trade-offs between maintaining the environmental integrity of the ETS and extending its reach. Therefore, it would be good to know what discussions the Minister has had with his European Union counterparts over this potential trade-off. What measures does he think he can put in place to ensure that the ETS reaches its full potential without jeopardising its integrity?</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC140"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000199"></a>Provision has already been made for the inclusion of aviation in the ETS from 2012. However, no such provision has been made for shipping. As we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and my noble friend Lord Ullswater, the committee&#146;s report highlights that action needs to be taken on shipping, and its inclusion should be delayed until no longer than 2013 for the largest emitters in this sector. Does the Minister agree, and will the Government make a similar provision to include shipping in future UK carbon budgets?</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000200"></a>On allowances, one of the major flaws of the pilot phase in 2005-07 of the EU ETS, as we have heard, was the overallocation of free permits. In the second phase, the number of free permits was reduced by 5 per cent and the auctioning of allowances increased. The proposal for the next phase is to put in place 100 per cent auctioning for the power and CCS sectors by 2013, as we have heard today. The committee seemed to be of the opinion that while a shift towards full auctioning is a positive step, derogation should be permitted to those with particularly fossil-fuel-intensive energy sectors, and we wonder if the Minister is in alliance with that view.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000201"></a>The committee agreed with the UK Government that it would be inappropriate for the European Union to prescribe how auctioning revenues were spent. That said, the committee stipulates that member states should invest considerable funds in climate-change-related measures. What is being done to ensure investment in and the protection of certain sectors, such as carbon capture and carbon storage?</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000202"></a>Again, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, and the members of the committee on such a good, solid report. It included plenty of analysis of the future options of the ETS and the need for reform for the next phase. We agree with the way ahead, but it will need strict policing, auditing and those mechanisms. We have heard twice today about the fiscal audit that will be necessary. That is true, but having served my time on the European Union Select Committees, chaired the National Consumer Council for six or seven years and spent a lot of time in the EU working with the member states, I know, although it is difficult to accept, that how we behave is not necessarily how all the other members are going to behave.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000203"></a>This subject is particularly complicated. It is not familiar to people, and it is not delivered in a language that they can understand. We are therefore in danger of alienating them from these discussions. Those who know Kipling&#146;s poem &#147;Norman and Saxon&#148; will know how important to the British people are the words &#147;fair dealing&#148;. Fair dealing is something the British people understand and stand by; they will put up with pretty well anything else. The worry with the European Union, certainly for enforcement, is always that this is not a level playing field. If we are going to build confidence in saving our world, and if we are going to take our people with us, we should encourage more of these reports to be written in a language that can be taken up by the press in such a way that the general public are not frightened or confused but can actually understand what we are saying.</p>

I commend my noble friend and members of the committee on it. I agree with him that the Government&#146;s response shows that there is not much between us; we all broadly share the same philosophy, and many of the questions that noble Lords have raised are the very issues that the Government are grappling with in our negotiations in Europe and internationally.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000205"></a>This has been a good debate. I share my noble friend&#146;s enjoyment of taking part in debates in the Moses Room. Indeed, as a refugee from the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, I wish that we could debate in the Moses Room day after day after day.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000206"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Sewel that, although the report was written in the lead-up to the negotiations for the agreement reached in December last year, the substantive comments have been as apposite to the situation today and in the lead-up to Copenhagen as they were before Christmas. The report is as relevant as when it was first produced. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said that at its heart, emissions trading is simple. Indeed it is, but the reality is that it is a very complex procedure. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, and I share a strong feeling that the language used by governments and NGOs in the whole arena of climate change seems designed to create a barrier between the experts and the public. Over the next few years, as people begin to understand what climate change really means and what we have to do to combat it, we will have to sort out the language. Who understands what the words &#147;mitigation and adaptation&#148; mean? The trading scheme itself is very difficult for anyone unless they do what noble Lords on the committee have done, which is to spend many hours and days learning to understand it. This is a major challenge if we are to win public support for the changes that need to be made.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000207"></a>Let us be frank. The reason it has proved to be so difficult to negotiate a really effective emissions trading scheme in Europe is because of the fears felt by Governments about the impact of going for a tight scheme on their industries, jobs and the public. While collectively I think we can regard ourselves as inside the climate change tent, in the lead-up to Copenhagen we need to think carefully about how we will manage communications and take the public with us. If we cannot do that, we are not going to pass the test set for us by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, of promoting the critical importance of making this system work.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000208"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said that the ETS is the major tool in our armoury, so we have to make it work. However, noble Lords suggested that phase 1 had been a failure. My noble friend Lord Giddens and the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Wilcox, also made that point. It is clear that the market was overallocated and, in the euphemism of Europe, the 2005-07 phase of the ETS was also intended as a &#147;learning period&#148; prior to the Kyoto commitment. Perhaps that is the softly-softly approach described by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron. We are where we are,  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC142"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the really important issue is whether we have learnt the lessons taught by the difficulties encountered in phase 1 to translate, at least in terms of practice, into phase 2 and, it is hoped, into the outcome of phase 3.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000209"></a>In phase 2 the Government will auction 7 per cent of allowances, one of the highest levels of auctioning in the EU. We have held one auction so far, and from now on we will be auctioning every two months. Perhaps I may write to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and other members of the Committee because I have extensive details of how the first auction went. It was oversubscribed, which gives us confidence for the future integrity of the system. As I say, I have some interesting information about it that I am happy to circulate.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000210"></a>That takes us to phase 3. It is a fact that we were able to conclude an agreement in December. Although noble Lords have expressed disappointment with some aspects of it, it was by no means assured that we would even reach an agreement. At many moments it appeared to be touch and go, which explains some of the compromises that have had to be made. We cannot run away from that. The noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, talked about the current economic climate, and he was absolutely right to do so. But the state of the economic climate was used by many countries in the negotiations to argue that the downturn justified postponing action on climate change until stability returns. To accept that argument would be an utter disaster. Although there is some disappointment about certain aspects of what was agreed in December, the fact is that an agreement was reached.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000211"></a>That agreement puts us in a much better position for phase 3 than we are in for the current phase. We see a more rigorous approach to setting the cap on emissions; it is set at a much more ambitious level, and there is a large increase in auctioning. Several noble Lords commented on auctioning. I have every sympathy with the points raised, but the fact is that at least 60 per cent of EU ETS allowances will be auctioned by 2020. In phase 2, by our reckoning, only about 3 per cent of allowances are being auctioned across the EU. Our goal for the EU ETS is for 100 per cent auctioning in the long term. We share the committee&#146;s goal on that, but I cannot underestimate the difficulties that we have had in negotiating the auctioning level that has been agreed. We must carry on arguing on that.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000212"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is right about free allocation: it will not end until 2027 in the revised directive, but will be revised after Copenhagen, assuming that we are successful. We must ensure that any free allocations are fully justified.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000213"></a>Aviation will be included in the EU ETS from 2012, but not shipping. I understand that if nothing is agreed internationally on shipping at Copenhagen, the European Commission will put forward a proposal by 2011 on the inclusion of shipping in the EU ETS, because clearly it is very important that that should happen.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000214"></a>What about the non-traded sector? The package included an agreed effort-sharing decision that sets targets for reductions in the sectors of member states and economies not covered by the EU ETS. For the UK, that would mean a reduction by 2020 of 16 per  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cent from the 2005 levels, achieved mainly in transport and heating. It is then left to member states to set out policy measures to meet those targets. In the case of the UK, that is governed by the Climate Change Act, the Energy Act and the renewable energy strategy.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000215"></a>One way that we will do that is through carbon budgets, which will be set for government departments. Departments will then have to take responsibility for the particular sector of the economy where carbon emissions take place. We see that as a way to bear down on emissions not covered by the ETS. We are working very hard across government at the moment on the development of carbon budgets. I believe that that will be a very important tool in the UK&#146;s armoury.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000216"></a>Let me give an example of that: agriculture. Because of the importance of the agricultural sector, which several noble Lords referred to, it is perfectly possible that one of my departments, Defra, will have to take responsibility for a reduction of emissions in that sector. Frankly, that could be very challenging indeed for Defra. Speaking as a DECC Minister, I am delighted that it is that department which is to face the challenge.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000217"></a>I took part, appropriately enough, in a seminar at London Zoo about four weeks ago, where Defra had called together experts from the agriculture/farming sector to discuss how emissions could be reduced. We had very good representation from farming interests, and there was a great deal of encouragement. We are committed to exploring the potential scope and feasibility of a market mechanism to enable the trading of greenhouse gas reductions from agriculture, forestry and land management. We are very much focused on the points that have been raised by a number of noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000218"></a>I have heard the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, speak very eloquently before on the question of CDM, when I came in at a late stage on the Climate Change Act. I entirely understand where he is coming from. On the other hand, CDM provides valuable financial flows to developing countries. At heart, the question is the integrity of the system. Noble Lords have essentially said that we have to ensure that monitoring and enforcement are of the highest order. I and the Government agree with that, and we will be working with our EU partners to address those problems. In general, that leads to the point raised by my noble friends Lord Giddens and Lord Brooke about monitoring. I will go on to talk about the issues that were raised about the FSA. Clearly, unless we have confidence that the system is properly monitored and properly enforced, it will not have credibility. It is a tremendous challenge for all of us to ensure that the system has credibility.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000219"></a>My noble friend Lord Sewel and other noble Lords mentioned carbon leakage, which is something that we have to tackle very seriously. Because of the need to tackle it, it raises concern about the directive&#146;s provision to allocate allowances for free to those installations proven to be at significant risk of carbon leakage. We are concerned that the directive provides for rather more sectors to be deemed at risk of carbon leakage than appears justified by the available evidence. I am not sure that I am providing as much comfort here as noble Lords would ideally wish me to provide. I can

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000220"></a>A number of noble Lords have raised the issue of the carbon price. It has gone up a bit; it currently stands at &#8364;12.50. When I was being briefed for an Oral Question two weeks ago&#151;this did not come up, but it might have done&#151;it was about &#8364;9. It is very much lower than it was only a short period ago. There are two points that I want to make. Of course, I accept the question about long-term investment. The noble Lord, Lord Browne, and my noble friend Lord Brooke talked about the considerations in a boardroom in terms of carbon pricing and what factor it bears. They both suggested that at the moment the answer is not a lot; certainly not in terms of making long-term investment decisions. Clearly, the volatility in price has not helped that, nor has the current economic crisis that we face. One of the questions is the extent to which it is still early days. As the trading system matures, companies may become more used to it and it may well factor into their decisions more; we must certainly hope so.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000221"></a>We do not favour caps; in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, we prefer it to be a market-based mechanism. We will have to monitor the position, but where 2020 is concerned it is important to remember that the commitment, the ETS cap on emissions, is geared to deliver a 21 per cent reduction by 2025, and that has to be delivered regardless of the carbon price. Clearly, the carbon price has an impact on the decisions and the economics that will need to be addressed, but we will hold fast to the cap itself.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000222"></a>On regulation, my noble friend Lord Brooke raised the fact that the European Commission is looking at whether we need greater regulation of the market to avoid the kind of manipulation that he spoke about. This is traded on a regulated market by the FSA. It is equivalent to other commodity markets. Obviously the role of the FSA in general has come under considerable scrutiny, but I have no evidence to suggest that the FSA has not been and is not able to discharge that responsibility effectively.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000223"></a>On the question of a fiscal audit, one accepts the need for additional policies, including regulation, to complement the emissions trading system. We are looking to Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury to keep us on track to ensure that the most effective balance and incentives are in place, and we will be ever vigilant on this.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000224"></a>I turn to the issue of a global market and the links between the regional trading systems. My noble friend Lord Sewel and the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, raised the important problem of the differences between carbon pricing in different regional schemes. There is no doubt that where different regional schemes have different prices, that will cause difficulties in linking schemes. Our overall strategy is to have similar prices and ensure similar amounts of effort in emission reduction. That is our aim in negotiating an agreement in Copenhagen, which I will come back to in a moment.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000225"></a>On technology, innovation and a competitive market for this country, yes, we must promote innovation. We have funds; I am responsible for one called the environmental transformation fund, which is geared towards companies in the renewables sector that are  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC145"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column GC145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>near to market. Other funds are administered by other government departments, notably DIUS, but we know that there is more to be done and we need to integrate those funds more.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000226"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Browne, took part in a summit on the low-carbon economy about two weeks ago. It became well known for green paint, but it was actually an interesting discussion with stakeholders about how we ensure, with the inevitability of a low-carbon economy, that this country takes advantage of it, that there is proper investment, that we use British skills and that we make the most of our expertise. That will lead into a low-carbon economy strategy that we will publish in the summer. Of course the Budget will soon be upon us; I cannot comment on what is in it, because I do not know, but I will ensure that the comments on fiscal stimulus that were made today are passed on to the Treasury for its consideration. I shall certainly not respond to the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, about how I shall spend the &#163;8 billion in 2020, much as I should like to.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000227"></a>I hope that I can reassure noble Lords as regards coal and CCS. In the December negotiations we successfully persuaded Europe to support CCS. Of course, it is unproven in terms of scale and there is no getting away from the fact that it is very expensive. However, we are committed to having a commercial-scale CCS project operational by 2014. We have a competition process, the pre-qualification stage of which finished in June 2008. We aim to issue the formal invitations to negotiate shortly. I very much take the point that if we can pull off CCS in this country, it will offer us great potential in terms of exporting our know-how and technology. There is huge potential there, which is why we are committed to CCS. A number of noble Lords said that they were beginning to doubt whether we can pull this off. We should just keep the faith for a little longer. The Government are committed to taking CCS forward. As I said, the competition process will go forward. The Government certainly recognise the importance of CCS alongside all the other developments in the energy sector, including new nuclear and the takeover of British Energy by EDF. Given the expressions of interest now coming forward from a number of other consortia to build new nuclear, there is huge potential there for this country. One can look back to the 1950s and ask what would have happened if Britain had stuck with peaceful nuclear energy. We missed that chance but we have a second chance and we have to ensure that we make the most of it.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000228"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and other noble Lords suggested, a huge effort will be required to reach the renewables target, but we are committed to doing so. We think that we have the stimulus right although a lot more work needs to be carried out. However, we believe that our technical leadership will produce many spin-offs for this country, particularly in the marine area.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0006.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000229"></a>So much is riding on Copenhagen. We are optimistic. The discussions of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister in Washington were paralleled by Ed Miliband&#146;s discussions with senior members of the Administration. The Obama Administration has a very important role to play, but so, too, do the developing

My noble friend Lord Brooke made the important point that we will not get a deal simply by hectoring developing countries. We know that that is the case. I agree with him and other noble Lords who mentioned the need to incentivise. I agree that the road to Copenhagen may well be very rocky, but at heart I remain optimistic. All the signs are that, although it will be very tough, there is a determination on the part of many countries to reach agreement. That will be very important as regards the renewed targets that Europe will have to discuss.</p>

<p><a name="090318116000230"></a>This has been a very good debate. It has informed the Government about some of the key matters that we still need to take forward and to monitor carefully. The committee&#146;s report is excellent and is improved and enhanced by tonight&#146;s debate. I am most grateful to all noble Lords for all their hard work and the contributions they made tonight. I hope that in a year&#146;s time we will gather together to discuss the outcome of Copenhagen with a view to it being successful, and that the EU ETS will be seen as an important contribution to that which has credibility and integrity. As noble Lords have said, I hope above all that the outcome is that we reduce our emissions.</p>

At this stage, I shall say very little. I shall underline only three things. Carbon capture and storage is critical. At Copenhagen, the danger is that whatever is agreed will be presented as a success. Whether it is a success in reality is another matter. I have to say that I am a little sceptical about the extent to which we will finish up with a robust agreement at Copenhagen. Finally, there is the need to get a proper market working, to have auctioning across the board and to bring other sectors into the ETS. Those are the key factors in this area.</p>

<a name="90318-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090318116000232"></a>I thank the Minister for his comments and, as I said earlier, for the Government's reply to our report, which we welcomed. I also thank the members of the sub-committee, who worked so long and hard on the report. If there was ever a learning experience&#151;was that the phrase?&#151;it was not really phase 1 of the ETS but the first dozen meetings of our committee, as we tried to go from a basic level of zero knowledge to a passable awareness of the main issues. For that, we have to thank&#151;this is not just for form&#146;s sake; it is a real debt of thanks&#151;the witnesses who came before us, who were enormously patient in explaining things in a way that some of us with decaying competences could understand; our specialist adviser, Alyssa Gilbert; and the formidable home team of Julia Labeta and Alistair Dillon. All of them helped us to move from negative knowledge&#151;which, if there is such a thing, we started with&#151;to at least an appreciation of some of the main issues. There are some real unintended consequences and perverse factors lurking in the undergrowth that we have not identified.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09031888000003"></a><b><a name="90318-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09031888000043"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence, John Hutton, has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09031888000004"></a>We have decided to procure three instrumented test aircraft and associated support equipment to enable UK participation in the joint initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Air System alongside the US Services, and to continue our contributions to the production sustainment and follow-on development (PSFD) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09031888000005"></a>This decision will allow the UK to fulfil our plans to participate fully in the IOT&amp;E programme alongside the USA and represents the next crucial stage in the UK&#146;s incremental plan to introduce JSF into service and fully to understand the aircraft through-life. In particular it will enable us to confirm that we will fully meet the UK&#146;s operational sovereignty requirements for JSF and also to fulfil our obligations for UK release to service, proving the general airworthiness of the aircraft and its ability to operate safely and effectively, in combat conditions.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09031888000006"></a>Acquisition of JSF will provide the UK with an unrivalled fifth-generation tactical air system, designed with stealthy characteristics and advanced sensors, which will afford the UK a step change in capability.  Through conducting the IOT&amp;E programme jointly with our US partners, who have many years of experience in operating this type of capability and the technologies inherent within it, we will gain a unique opportunity to optimise our use of this new combat system. This decision is fully coherent with our earlier decision to procure the UK&#146;s new aircraft carriers and will enable us to move forward effectively in developing our carrier strike capability.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09031888000007"></a>With approximately 100 UK companies currently in the supply chain, there is significant UK industrial interest in the JSF programme ranging from major UK JSF industrial partners such as BAE Systems and Rolls Royce to providers of key sub-systems such as Martin Baker and GE Aviation, and down to lower tier suppliers of composite materials. The potential UK return on investment is substantial. Over the lifetime of the JSF programme, depending on aircraft costs and numbers ordered, overall expenditure with UK industry is likely to outweigh by far the UK MoD&#146;s investment in the programme.</p>

<a name="09031888000013"></a><b><a name="90318-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="09031888000046"></a>The Attorney-General (Baroness Scotland of Asthal):</b> Last year the Government published two consultation papers on measures to improve the effectiveness of fraud prosecutions. The first consultation paper, in relation to a proposed framework for plea negotiation between defence and prosecution in fraud cases, was published in April. The second, concerning proposals to strengthen the powers of the Crown Court to deal with fraud, was published in July.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09031888000014"></a>The Government are today publishing a paper summarising the responses received in both these consultation exercises, and setting out how we will take these proposals forward.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09031888000016"></a>In relation to the plea negotiation framework, I am now issuing Attorney-General's guidelines to prosecutors to bring this into effect shortly.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09031888000017"></a>The guidelines set out a clear and transparent procedure for prosecutors to engage in discussions with defence legal representatives at an early stage in a fraud case with a view to narrowing the factual issues and, where possible, agreeing what charges the defendant will plead guilty to. This procedure is designed to help complex cases progress through the criminal justice system in a quicker and more efficient fashion, while protecting the interests of the public and victims of fraud, and respecting the rights of defendants.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09031888000018"></a>In relation to the extended sentencing powers for the Crown Court, the Government intend to bring forward legislation extending the range of fraud victims who will be eligible for compensation, and strengthening the enforcement measures available to the courts to see that compensation orders are paid. Legislation is also planned to allow the Crown Court to bar convicted fraudsters from practising in certain key professions, and to wind up companies that have been used as vehicles for fraud. These measures should reduce the need for duplicated criminal, civil and regulatory proceedings, and also strengthen confidence in the ability of the courts to protect the public from fraud and compensate victims. This legislation will be introduced as soon as the parliamentary programme allows.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="09031888000054"></a>Merger Fees</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="09031888000021"></a><b><a name="90318-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="09031888000047"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform &amp; Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Davies of Abersoch):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Trade, Development and Consumer Affairs, Gareth Thomas, has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09031888000022"></a>In 2006, the then DTI announced that it was increasing the level of the fees charged to merging parties in order to recover the costs incurred by the competition authorities in undertaking their statutory merger control functions. It was decided that the increase would be introduced in two stages with an initial increase coming into effect in April 2006 and a further stage coming into effect in April 2009.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09031888000023"></a>I have decided to postpone introducing that second stage of the planned increase in merger fees. Having reviewed what has happened in the period since the first stage of the increase came into effect, it is clear that there has been a change in circumstances which suggests the planned increase would not, in fact, generate sufficient funds to recover the full cost of operating the merger control regime.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS16"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column WS16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09031888000024"></a>We therefore propose to re-examine the costs involved in operating that regime and to consult on a suitably revised fee structure as soon as possible with the aim of making an appropriate order to introduce revised merger fees at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09031888000025"></a><I>Background</I></p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09031888000026"></a>There are currently three merger fee bands set at &#163;15,000, &#163;30,000 and &#163;45,000 respectively. The lower fee band applies to mergers where the UK turnover of the enterprise being acquired is &#163;20 million or less; the middle fee is applicable where the UK turnover of the enterprise being acquired is more than &#163;20 million but less than &#163;70 million; and the highest fee is applicable where the UK turnover of the enterprise being acquired exceeds &#163;70 million.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09031888000027"></a>The increase that had been planned for implementation in April 2009 would have increased fee levels to &#163;30,000, &#163;60,000 and &#163;90,000, respectively.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09031888000028"></a>Based on an assessment of the number of mergers taking place during the two-to-three-year period prior to 2006, it appeared likely that this fee structure would generate an amount approximately equivalent to the average annual expenditure of the Office of Fair Trading and Competition Commission in undertaking their merger control functions. We consider it appropriate that those costs should be met by the companies involved in carrying out mergers rather than by the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09031888000029"></a>Having reviewed what has happened in the period since 2006, it is clear there has been a considerable reduction in the total number of mergers being considered by the competition authorities&#151;while the annual costs of operating the merger control regime have remained largely unchanged as fixed costs represent a substantial proportion of the total costs. The result is that the proposed increase in fees is likely to generate only about two thirds of the total costs allocated to merger control activity&#151;a gap of some &#163;3 million to &#163;4 million. In the light of this, we propose work with the competition authorities to examine the prospects for reducing costs; to re-examine the cost base used as the basis for setting the fees and then to develop a revised fee structure that provides for full cost recovery in future based on that cost base.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="09031888000030"></a><b><a name="90318-wms0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="09031888000048"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State, John Hutton, has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09031888000031"></a>Honourable Members will wish to be aware of an update to the progress being made with the alternative contracting arrangements for surface warship maintenance and repair. These arrangements were signalled in December 2005 as part of the wider defence industrial strategy and today&#146;s announcement is an important step towards ensuring that the capability requirements of the Royal Navy continue to be met now and in the future.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS17"></a><b>18 Mar 2009 : Column WS17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09031888000032"></a>Surface warship upkeep contracts were awarded following competition while operational, or fleet, time support was delivered through partnering arrangements under the Warship Support Modernisation Initiative.  While these arrangements have delivered clear value-for-money benefits to the Ministry of Defence (MoD), force level reductions coupled with over capacity in the surface ship repair market prompted a review.  The MoD, in consultation with industry, undertook a study (the Surface Ship Support Study) to identify the optimum approach for the future maintenance and repair of surface warships (aircraft carriers, major amphibious vessels, destroyers, frigates and mine warfare vessels) that would deliver the most efficient, effective and sustainable support policy and offer best value for money for defence as well as to taxpayers.</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09031888000033"></a>In 2005, the study concluded that the option best able to meet the needs of both the department and industry would be the formation of a surface warship support alliance, which would include current providers of surface warship upkeep and fleet time support. To take this forward, the MoD entered into detailed dialogue with industry to explore the feasibility of delivering such support through an alliance. The Ministerial Written Statements made on 14 February 2006 (<I>Official Report</I>, cols. 72-73WS) announced this exploratory phase. During this time, competition policy would be suspended to enable the alliance concept to be developed and tested progressively in a controlled manner. An order was made by the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (now Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform) excluding the maintenance and repair of surface warships from the UK Competition Act 1998. These arrangements were subsequently extended in 2008, and announced in a Written Ministerial Statement on 25 March (<I>Official Report</I>, cols. 3-4WS).</p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09031888000034"></a>Over the past 12 months, good progress has continued to be made in this crucial warship support area.  Working closely with the two dockyard companies&#151;Babcock and BVT Surface Fleet Limited&#151;the MoD has confirmed that the alliance option is the optimum solution for providing effective, affordable and sustainable support to Royal Navy surface warships.  As a result, we have signed a non-legally binding accord with the two companies which set out the principles by which the alliance will operate.  The alliance, subject to successful completion of the concept phase and further approvals as well as consultation with the trades unions, is expected to be fully implemented by 2011. </p>

<a name="90318-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09031888000035"></a>Once the alliance has initially stood up, expected to be later this year, the SSS programme will be implemented in phases.  It will commence with a proof of concept phase to allow demonstration of success against agreed criteria as a pre-requisite for moving to the subsequent phases. This approach will minimise risk to MoD, Babcock and BVT Surface Fleet Limited, and will allow the necessary assurance and scrutiny to take place as the programme develops, experience grows and benefits are realised.  For that reason, the regulatory impact assessment (RIA) that supports the exclusion of surface warship support work on public policy grounds from the UK Competition Act has been extended for a period of up to 24 months. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09031888000036"></a>The new arrangements help to promote a sustainable industrial base that retains key operational support and system upgrade capabilities within the UK, and are therefore vital to our ability to maintain and support the Royal Navy.

They take significant personal risks to make Britain more secure and operate across the world in circumstances they do not control. I have seen for myself their success in preventing terrorist attacks. We are all safer today because of the work they do with integrity and bravery. In the past months, the involvement of the security services and Armed Forces in detention activities has been under intense scrutiny while they have been unable to reply.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09031888000041"></a>It is to protect the reputation of our security and intelligence services and to reassure ourselves that everything has been done to ensure that our practices are in line with United Kingdom and international law that we will do four things:</p>
 we will publish our guidance to intelligence officers and service personnel about the standards that we apply during the detention and interviewing of detainees overseas once it has been consolidated and reviewed by the Intelligence and Security Committee. It is right that Parliament and the public should know what those involved in interviewing detainees can and cannot do. This will put beyond doubt the terms under which our agencies and service personnel operate. Once published, copies will be placed in the Libraries of the House;we will invite the Sir Peter Gibson who is the former Lord Justice of Appeal and current Intelligence Services Commissioner to monitor compliance with the guidance and report to the Prime Minister annually;in order to ensure that our systems are robust and to be certain that any lessons have been understood, I have asked the Intelligence and Security Committee to consider any new developments and relevant information, since their 2005 Report on Detention

They are highly effective, widely respected and operate unselfishly on our behalf. It is vital that we allow them to act to protect our country. But we must do so in a way that is consistent with our unequivocal commitment to human rights. I am confident that this is the case.</p>

Distribution network operators (DNOs) own and operate the lower voltage distribution networks. Typically, small generators&#151;eg small wind turbines and small wind farms&#151;connect to the lower voltage distribution networks throughout Great Britain, rather than the high voltage transmission network. DNOs manage wind generation connected on their network.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_41"></a><a name="09031890000046"></a>Small scale embedded generators can normally be connected to the distribution networks without the need for the DNO to carry out detailed network studies to assess the impact of the connection. Therefore, embedded generators can then generate without restriction.</p>

If it will not have, then as for small wind turbines, the generation would be able to operate without any restrictions being imposed by the DNO. If there is an impact on the transmission system, then National Grid in some cases, when balancing the electricity system, could request the DNO to reduce output which will in turn, request this of a generator connected to its network. However, more typically, when balancing the high voltage network, National Grid will ask generators directly connected to its network to reduce demand.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_58"></a><a name="09031890000073"></a>This additional contribution is broken down as follows. We have pledged &#163;360 million over the 3 year replenishment period (2008-10), with &#163;30 million of this subject to demand and results. This represents a 20 per cent increase on our previous level of commitment. Over and above this, we also pledged an additional amount of up to &#163;640 million from 2011-15.</p>

Support to the Global Fund is one of the important channels for the Department for International Development's (DfID) support to the three diseases and wider health systems. In June 2008, the UK announced an additional &#163;6 billion on health systems and services by 2015, over and above our support to the Global Fund.</p>

The G8 has made significant commitments to promote international development and accelerate progress on health related targets since then. In 2007, the G8 pledged US$60 billion for health initiatives including funding to help tackle tuberculosis, and there has been significant progress on treating HIV, providing immunisation against polio and supplying bed nets to protect against malaria.</p>

<a name="90318w0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_60"></a><a name="09031890000076"></a>However, huge challenges remain. As with previous summits, the UK Government will continue to work through all available channels in the lead up to the G8 summit in Italy to ensure development remains a high priority for the leaders' agenda. The UK remains strongly committed to reducing death and suffering from tuberculosis, and will encourage other G8 partners to ensure that tuberculosis is addressed as part of the comprehensive package of G8 measures. This should enable developing countries to make faster progress towards the millennium development goal targets.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_112"></a><a name="09031890000158"></a>In September 2003, Ofwat provided guidance (RD35/03) to companies on charging non-household premises for surface water drainage by site-based area. It said that companies which are thinking of introducing site-area charging need to assess possible impacts on all customers' bills. In particular, companies will need to take into account the scale and speed of any bill changes to see whether they are reasonable and acceptable to customers.</p>
