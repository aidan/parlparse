In her report, the Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised standards and suggested that the Youth Justice Board might consider emptying the centre briefly. That was not a formal recommendation and the board decided to pursue other options at that time. Following some improvement, Oakhill&#146;s performance recently deteriorated and the board has now served notice of rectification on the operator.</p>

Does he agree&#151;I think he does&#151;that this is a sad state of affairs? The Youth Justice Board says that it has been trying to sort out Oakhill secure training centre for the past four years. For that length of time, the Government have therefore knowingly placed some of the most disadvantaged and difficult children in this country in a setting that is neither safe nor appropriate. In those circumstances, does the Minister not accept that the Chief Inspector of Prisons was quite right to recommend that children should not be held there for the time being? Why did the Government not accept her recommendation and why are 30 children still there today?</p>

Clearly, the safety of the young people in that centre is absolutely paramount. The matter has been carefully monitored since the centre was opened. Interventions have taken place. However, while improvements occurred as a result of the interventions, it is clear that they have not been sustained, hence the rectification notices that have been issued. That is a sign of the Youth Justice Board&#146;s serious intent in this matter.</p>

Although training programmes have been instituted and every effort has been made to ensure that proper co-ordination takes place between the centre and other appropriate local services, there is clearly a long way to go, which is why we wish to see urgent improvements.</p>

They identify a number of issues in relation to recruitment and selection practices, the importance of the role of front-line managers and the need for that to be strengthened, and the fact that, although training programmes may have been instituted, they were not sufficiently regular or ongoing. However, I repeat that the safety of children is absolutely paramount. This centre is monitored on an extremely regular basis and, if it were felt that the safety of children was being compromised, further action would be taken.</p>

Undoubtedly, there is a real problem with Oakhill, the centre in question, which is why it is so important that the rectification process is taken forward.</p>

In the latest year for which figures are available, some 43,000 fixed penalties were issued, which is 10,000 up on the year before, and 77 per cent of that was collected in repayments.

Let us look at a more salubrious part of the country&#146;s roads&#151;for example, junctions 1 and 2 of the M3, which are in an area that is not Labour-controlled, I might add. In April this year on one westbound carriageway&#151;one junction, one month, one collection in one direction on the motorway&#151; 189 bags of rubbish amounting to one tonne were collected. I am told that that is typical of our motorways and of what people turf out of their cars as they travel. Very little of it is due to the wind and it is a disgrace.</p>

It is a fair point because the total expenditure for local authorities in England for street cleaning which is not chargeable to the highways is approximately &#163;500 million, which is a lot of money that could be avoided. The cost to council tax payers of fly-tipping, lack of recycling and collecting such litter is a fortune, but getting that connection to them of what it costs society as a whole and them individually is not easy.</p>

The review will report at the end of June and its findings will be relevant to both domestic and European Union targets.</p>

It is certainly true that the US is keen on promoting biofuels and has made something of a dash for them, along with Brazil, but I think that our cautious approach is right because we need to ensure that we source from sustainable origins. That must be the right approach. There is increased concern over the sustainability of biofuels. We need to be led by the science here and ensure that we take maximum benefit from the second-generation biofuels.</p>

You do not have to be very clever or artful to bring inflation down if that is your target. The Tories demonstrated this marvellously in the early 1980s, when they came to power and doubled the unemployment rate, which they got to over 10 per cent and kept at a high rate for many years. The trick is not just to destroy inflation. Is not the test of your ability improvement in the real economy? Is the Minister aware that some of us, listening to the Governor of the Bank of England, are terrified of the lack of interest in the real economy, as it affects us now and in the near future?</p>

My noble friend will appreciate that this economy is still growing and that the forecast, even in this most difficult of circumstances, is that it will continue to grow when other economies are not able to do so.

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08052040000090"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 160A stands in my name and those of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, and the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands. The report on the Bill by your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the Constitution, published on 28 March, concluded that,</p>
<ul><a name="08052040000289"></a>&#147;the importance of how the opt-ins and opt-outs are used is such that Parliament must be fully involved in their use&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052040000266"></a>It is a matter for regret that the Government have failed to provide their response to the report before Committee stage, as was indicated, although I appreciate the pressure on officials.</p>

<a name="80520-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08052040000091"></a>The committee recommended that the Government obtain approval from both Houses of Parliament before using opt-ins or opt-outs in any policy area. It believed that it would be consistent with the Bill&#146;s policy to require parliamentary approval of the use of the simplified revision procedure and passerelles. In the area of freedom, security and justice, issues of criminal law and policing are being brought into Title V of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union&#151;an innovation that Dr Valsamis Mitsilegas of Queen Mary&#146;s College told your Lordships&#146; committee in evidence amounted to fundamental constitutional change.</p>

<a name="80520-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08052040000092"></a>This amendment includes all possible opt-ins under the proposed new arrangements. The opt-ins are set out in the following parts of the Lisbon treaty: Article 3 of the protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice; Article 4 of that protocol; Article 4 of the protocol on the Schengen acquis integrated into the framework of the European Union; and Article 10(5) of the protocol on transitional provisions. It will later be open to your Lordships to consider scrutiny of the potentially much less controversial opt-outs under Article 5(2) of the Schengen Protocol and Article 10(4) of the protocol on transitional provisions.</p>

<a name="80520-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08052040000093"></a>In parenthesis, in my view it is of great importance to public confidence in our relationship with the European Union that actions such as opting into any part of such fundamental constitutional change are properly approved by Parliament.

<a name="80520-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08052040000094"></a>Your Lordships&#146; European Union Committee, under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, emphasised the importance of ensuring that all opt-in decisions are subject to systematic parliamentary scrutiny, and cautioned that the Government must maintain a proper balance between liberty and security. It took evidence from the noble Baroness the Leader of the House on 13 May on the question of parliamentary scrutiny of possible future opt-ins. I shall not delay your Lordships this afternoon by reiterating the points that were made. Suffice it to say that, in her letter to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, on 29 April&#151;which she kindly copied to me&#151;the Minister described &#147;the Government&#146;s overriding priority&#148; to ensure that, under the Lisbon treaty, the United Kingdom can continue to benefit from valuable JHA co-operation. In my view, this is going to have to be matched by an equally overriding priority of parliamentary scrutiny of possible future opt-ins.</p>

<a name="80520-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08052040000095"></a>The notion that government could take decisions on changes to law, particularly criminal law, on the basis of material not in the public or parliamentary domains may be acceptable to officials, but it will not be acceptable to Parliament. A system of parliamentary controls of individual opt-in decisions need not impede our ability to participate fully in the JHA co-operation. Brussels&#151;I use the word to cover everything that happens there&#151;is fully conscious of our parliamentary timetable, and the likelihood of some ambush being mounted on us by our European partners on the eve of the Summer Recess is frankly negligible if not inconceivable. Our own system of parliamentary business management is admirably flexible&#151;see Northern Rock as a recent example&#151;and these are not going to be frequent occurrences. There is no reason whatever, if the Government of the day have the political will, why an affirmative resolution could not be debated by both Houses within three months. In the Republic of Ireland, both houses approve or disapprove opt-ins as soon as a proposal is published.</p>

<a name="80520-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08052040000096"></a>Moreover&#151;a point not mentioned in the Minister&#146;s letter to which I have referred&#151;Article 4 of the protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in the area of freedom, security and justice allows member states to opt into measures at any time after they have been adopted. So the United Kingdom would not be blocked from such initiatives if for any reason parliamentary approval was not achieved within the three-month period, although it is conceivable&#151;but highly unlikely&#151;that the British and Irish negotiating hand might be marginally affected in such very unlikely circumstances.</p>

<a name="80520-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08052040000097"></a>It is inconceivable that the noble Baroness the Leader of the House is unaware of the seriousness with which noble Lords regard this matter. Before we return to it on Report, let us hope that some of the Government&#146;s advisers attain the same level of enlightenment; may the truth be seen by many. Lines in the sand may be washed away by the tides of history but they should not be washed away by the tides of bureaucracy&#151;nor should public confidence. I beg to move.</p>

He has set out the case for parliamentary scrutiny and I would find it very odd if this Chamber did not provide the machinery for appropriate parliamentary scrutiny of very important decisions. The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, who chairs the Select Committee of the European Union, very appropriately wrote,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08052040000290"></a>&#147;There is no separate scrutiny on whether or not to opt-in to measures under TEC Title 4; decisions are mentioned in the Explanatory Memorandum and are dealt with simply as part of the scrutiny of the proposal&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052040000267"></a>He promises in his letter&#151;since that time he has heard evidence from the noble Baroness&#151;to consider whether the scrutiny offered is adequate. He underlines the need to know what the Government&#146;s thinking is and, secondly, what parliamentary control should be available so that we can be sure that we are moving in the right direction.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08052040000099"></a>I have read the reply of the Leader of the House and, frankly, I am not impressed by it. It has, I fear, been put up to her by the Foreign Office and I understand fully that it represents the view of Her Majesty&#146;s Government. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08052040000279"></a>&#147;Parliamentary control on individual opt-in decisions ... would impede our ability to participate fully and effectively&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052040000268"></a>I should like to know a little more on that. What a nuisance Parliament is to our man in Brussels. Like the man in Whitehall in the 1940s, he knows best. Are we not part of the legitimate democratic machinery that is available at the moment in this country? Should not we&#151;I speak not for the Commons&#151;have our opportunity to scrutinise?</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08052040000100"></a>The noble Baroness goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08052040000291"></a>&#147;The timetable is very tight&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052040000269"></a>Why was three months put in during the negotiations? Why was not a longer period put in? That question was put to the Leader of the House by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, during questioning, but I do not think there was any real answer. Why did anyone think that there are different parliamentary procedures in each part of the European Union? Some of them can move swiftly and others take a little more time. I do not think we can be faulted on that basis.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08052040000101"></a>The noble Baroness set out in her evidence to the committee her experience&#151;substantial experience, if I may say so&#151;of how fast-moving discussions are in Brussels. I heard the noble Lord, Lord Owen, tell us of his experience last night; other noble Lords have had a similar experience. Decisions are taken very late in the night; decisions are taken as a result of negotiation. We should, however, be able to have the Government&#146;s thinking and be able to anticipate in what way we are going to be tied down by such an agreement. We are in new territory and the Leader of the House says that it would be extremely difficult to have machinery of this kind. Very wisely, she says that it is not impossible. I am sure if there was a danger of missing a particular deadline that Parliament would find the means, double quick, to ensure that it played its part in the process and that we would not be prejudiced in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08052040000102"></a>It was Churchill who said that democracy is a poor way of running a country but he could not think of any better. I paraphrase and borrow some of that sentiment in emphasising to the Chamber the need for appropriate parliamentary control. I support the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="08052040000103"></a><a name="80520-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80520-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08052040000707"></a>Lord Grenfell:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, mentioned, the noble Baroness the Lord President appeared before the Select Committee to give evidence on this just a week ago today. I note that this was after the exchange of letters between herself and myself from which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, has just extensively quoted.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08052040000104"></a>The Lord President was very helpful to the committee. We made the point very strongly that we regard proper parliamentary scrutiny of opt-ins as crucial and the Lord President clearly took the point. We will be discussing with government departments, and maybe taking further evidence on, how this can best be done. There are some very important issues regarding timing, given the 90-day restriction that has been mentioned. We will need to begin our scrutiny as soon as possible after the proposal reaches Parliament direct from the European Commission. We need and expect a Government Explanatory Memorandum as soon as possible, giving the Government&#146;s intentions on opting in and the reasons for that. However, we may not necessarily want to wait for their final views before beginning the scrutiny process. In those circumstances, the presentation to the Government of our committee&#146;s own emerging conclusions might prove helpful to the Government in their deliberations.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08052040000105"></a>Our bottom line is that the normal scrutiny process must be pursued. If the Government were to opt in before the scrutiny process was complete, that would be viewed very seriously by the committee and I am sure on the Floor of the House as well. We need time to decide how the present scrutiny system can be adapted, if it needs to be, to take into account these new requirements. We should therefore not rush into this too hastily.</p>

<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="08052040000106"></a><a name="80520-0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80520-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08052040000708"></a>Lord Rowlands:</b> I support the amendment. Since I was first involved in European Union legislation&#151;it was with the very first Bill, the European Communities Act 1972&#151;I have applied a parliamentary sovereignty test to any such Bill that has come before us, including those relating to Maastricht, Amsterdam and Lisbon. Although it sounds old-fashioned, I do not think that it is a bad test for any parliamentarian to apply. To what extent, if we agree to these treaty arrangements, will there be some concession of parliamentary sovereignty or, if one prefers the phrase, pooling of sovereignty?</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08052040000107"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, pointed out, the evidence we received about the Lisbon treaty is that it is a major treaty that effects fundamental changes. It alters fundamentally the European architecture that emerged from Maastricht. It collapses one of the three pillars that emerged from Maastricht and brings the areas of justice and home affairs into the acquis communautaire, Commission-driven policy, ordinary procedure, QMV and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1361"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1361</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80520-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08052040000108"></a>Had this protocol not been in the treaty, I would not have been able to support the Bill, because the change to our constitution and issues of sovereignty is so fundamental. Fortunately, however, the Government have negotiated a protocol that represents some of the deepest red lines of their original negotiating position. The admirable analysis of the justice and home affairs area by the European Committee&#151;dealing with opt-ins and opt-outs, past, present and future&#151;demonstrates that the Government have achieved a very robust, comprehensive protocol, which has safeguarded not only the Executive&#146;s position but that of parliamentary sovereignty.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08052040000109"></a>Because I attach such significance to the protocol&#151;it is the reason I will be able to support the Bill&#151;if, at any time, this or a future Government should seek to introduce or opt in to significant parts of the justice and home affairs area, as the protocol allows, express approval should be sought before doing so. We may assent to the Bill and therefore assent to the ratification of the treaty; future Governments may decide to opt in and surrender a degree of sovereignty as a result, but such action should be subject to express parliamentary approval.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08052040000110"></a>There are two specific reasons why that should be so. First, when the Government of the day negotiate an opt-in, they are not negotiating away their sovereignty in the process of negotiating away Parliament&#146;s sovereignty. It is not just a question of an Executive action; the consequence of that Executive action is the surrender of parliamentary sovereignty as well as of Executive sovereignty. In that respect, I was somewhat surprised by my noble friend&#146;s response to Question 2 in the European Committee&#146;s evidence session when she said that she thought that final decisions and opt-ins rest with Ministers and the Executive. I know that they are Executive decisions, but surely they have to be subject to some kind of parliamentary debate and approval. We are not swapping royal prerogatives for Executive prerogatives. I do not think that one can say so baldly that this is for the Executive to decide and that Parliament does not have the right to seek approval.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08052040000111"></a>The second reason for accepting the principle behind the amendment is that, whether we like it or not, Parliament can do and undo things at will, as it were. But in practical political terms, once the Government opt in to any of these major measures, they opt in for good. It is a permanent and irrevocable decision. That is the second reason, along with that of parliamentary sovereignty, why I believe that such decisions should be subject to express parliamentary approval.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08052040000112"></a>My noble friend described vividly in a letter to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, how Parliaments complicate and sometimes inconvenience ministerial negotiations. There are enough of us here to know that Parliaments can make life difficult for the Administrations of the day, even in the negotiating process. But that is a price worth paying for parliamentary democracy. Even if it does make life more complicated and issues of confidentiality arise, nevertheless, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, said, parliamentary scrutiny and approval are an overriding priority.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08052040000113"></a>I was rather interested in an exchange in the European Union Committee where the noble Lord, Lord Kerr&#151;I hope I am not going to put words in his mouth&#151;suggested to my noble friend that there would not be an insuperable problem, that a UK Minister is talking to European-equivalent Ministers, all who come from parliamentary democracies. He or she should be able to explain the quirks of the UK parliamentary system or the difficulties that might arise. This is the reason therefore why fellow Ministers in the European Union should accommodate the need for a process of parliamentary approval, because others might have a very similar problem. I accept, however, that ours is unique because we are the only opting-in party.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08052040000114"></a>I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, suggested in his question to my noble friend that from his own immense experience in negotiating in Brussels and Utrecht, it would not be very difficult to come to an arrangement with fellow European Ministers to ensure that, in the timescales concerned, we could build in this parliamentary approval procedure. He indicated that it would be in the interest of fellow European Ministers to accommodate the United Kingdom because they would want us to be opting-in at that stage. They should therefore be able to accommodate us in the issue of parliamentary approval.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08052040000115"></a>I gently suggest to my noble friend that the principles behind the amendment are in true keeping with the spirit and the thrust of the new constitutional renewal programme that the Government have embarked upon in the past six months. In my view, it is part and parcel of and very much in keeping and in tune with, the whole of the Government&#146;s&#151;I cheer them in this respect&#151;constitutional renewal programme. After years of suffering a kind of executive phobia about the idea that Parliament might get involved in having to approve the waging of war, that problem has suddenly been overcome. As a result of the Government&#146;s determination, we shall now have a parliamentary approval procedure for the waging of war. We will have the parliamentary approval procedure for the dissolution of Parliament and an enhanced parliamentary procedure for treaty making. It will be rather curious if we now suddenly decide that opt-ins, in the context of the European process, are somehow to be excluded from this concept of enhanced parliamentary responsibility, supervision and oversight.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08052040000116"></a>I therefore suggest to my noble friend that the principle behind the amendment is chiming with the whole of the Government&#146;s view of constitutional renewal and, in particular, the right of Parliament to assert themselves on key issues such as those involved in opt-in. I strongly support the amendment.</p>

Indeed, we have listened today with interest to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad. As the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, said, last week we were able to get useful evidence from the Lord President. We were most grateful to her for what she said on that occasion. However, it is important to look carefully at these instruments on which the  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1363"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1363</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government will be deciding to opt in. In some respects, they are like any other European Union instruments and it will therefore be appropriate for them to go through the scrutiny process like any other instrument on any other area of European Union policy before a decision is made in the Council.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08052040000118"></a>The particularity of these instruments, however, is that the UK will participate in negotiations only if it decides to opt into them. The question is, therefore, what arrangements should be made to deal with them. Noble Lords may have seen on page 165 of its impact assessment report that the European Union Committee suggested that we needed to think of a more systematic approach to deal with opt-ins than had been undertaken in the past&#151;we have had opt-ins for some time, of course. That was the subject of our discussions with the Lord President last week.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08052040000119"></a>The Lord President agreed that it would be important for us to begin scrutiny as soon as possible after the arrival of the instrument. I hope that that process, whereby the European Union Committee would carry out its own inquiry and give its conclusions to the Government, would contribute to their decision on whether to opt in. We would be making a contribution at that stage of an important parliamentary kind. It would also be possible, as always, for the committee to make a report for debate in the House, either at that stage or after the Government had made their decision on whether to opt in.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08052040000120"></a>There are various options available to Parliament in considering how to deal with these European instruments, which will come to us in the future as they have in the past. One option&#151;this may be to misinterpret the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad&#151;would be an affirmative resolution procedure alone. An alternative would be a scrutiny process, which could be either the normal scrutiny process, as is the case with every other instrument, or a scrutiny process followed by some other form of parliamentary procedure. That is for the House to consider with some care.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08052040000121"></a>However, from my experience of European Union Committee work, I believe that it would be a great pity if the House were to make its decision purely on the basis of a relatively short debate, either in the House or in Grand Committee, without having had the scrutiny process. Therefore, I hope that we will hear from the noble Lord, Lord Goodland, that that was not his intention in the amendment. We would also be interested to hear from the Lord President how the Government see these matters and how far they feel that it is possible for us to involve Parliament effectively in the consideration of these important instruments.</p>

First, opt-ins are not just a question of opting into a particular measure and incorporating it into UK law. By opting into any measure, we are importing into the UK justice system the supremacy of the European Court of Justice in areas of criminal law and justice. It would be not only the original measure into which we opted; once we had opted in, any amendment made to that measure, which could be by qualified majority voting, would also be subject to interpretation by the European

That is why the opt-ins are particularly important: not only are they about an individual measure, but they open up a whole new constitutional significance.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08052040000123"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Grenfell and Lord Roper, spoke about the scrutiny procedure. Everyone would accept that it is ideal for both Houses to be able to use their scrutiny processes to maximum effect, but that does not in any way conflict with there being a parliamentary procedure following it. I do not think that anyone would assume that the role of the scrutiny committees is to pre-empt the judgment of the House on important issues; the role of the committees is to inform the House, which they do very well. However, it is for the House at the end of the day to be given the chance to take its view, as the other place, on issues that have major constitutional significance. The scrutiny and parliamentary procedures are therefore complementary.</p>

<a name="08052040000124"></a><a name="80520-0003.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80520-0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08052040000711"></a>Lord Harrison:</b> It behoves us to pay attention to the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, when he speaks, not only because of his vast experience in these matters but also because he is a good man from Cheshire. I support not only the Government but also the advice given to us by our chair, the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, and supported by the noble Lord, Lord Roper, that the appropriate instrument by which these matters, especially of opt-ins, can be scrutinised and understood is perhaps through your Lordships&#146; committee designated for that purpose. I hope that, when she replies, my noble friend will indicate how we are setting about that task of ensuring that the expertise and experience found within the European Union Committee can aid and abet the Government in reaching their decisions.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08052040000125"></a>I have two further points. The first is in answer to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris, who asked whether we could introduce more delay to ensure that the proper parliamentary scrutiny procedures take place. At this point, we should remind ourselves what the Government achieved with the various red lines, protocols and so on in the negotiations on the Lisbon treaty. We are blessed with a series of exceptions and allowances of one sort or another not visited on or granted to other countries. Therefore, it behoves us also to remind ourselves that, in reaching our conclusions on opt-ins or on other matters, we should be reasonably speedy, without frustrating the proper scrutiny process, to conform to our comity with the other 26 European Union members.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08052040000126"></a>My second point, which some may find distasteful, is about the practices of this House. As we have joined the European Union, we are required to modernise ourselves as a Parliament if we are to do an effective job of scrutinising important issues that come before us from it. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris, mentioned the 90 days given for such scrutiny. I remind your Lordships that the pattern of work in your Lordships&#146; House has remained largely unaltered and is not necessarily geared to respond to the pressing needs outside. After all, a few years ago, we introduced a September session of Parliament, which I thought had great utility, as it meant that we were here in Parliament to be able to respond to

Therefore, it is also a matter of, &#147;Physician, heal thyself&#148;. If we want to perform the valuable task, which I believe we can, of scrutinising on behalf of the British people matters that come to us from Brussels and Strasbourg, we need to reform ourselves, too.</p>

Like the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, I was alarmed when I read the evidence of the Leader of the House&#151;I am afraid that I was not able to be here last week&#151;particularly the sentence that he read out, in which she said in answer to the second question that she thought that the final decision on opt-ins rested with Ministers and the Executive.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08052040000128"></a>I will make one brief point this afternoon. Unless we have a firm system of parliamentary scrutiny, particularly with regard to opt-ins, Parliament as a whole will look foolish. I say that as someone who was a member of the Select Committee on the Merits of Statutory Instruments for the first three years of its life. One saw the whole range of statutory instruments that required, through the affirmative process, a resolution of both Houses. Frankly, many of the potential opt-ins&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, referred to this&#151;are infinitely more important than some of the statutory instruments that come before both Houses and which demand an affirmative resolution. If we do not have that type of strong parliamentary control over these opt-ins, that will be a negation of what Parliament should be about. For that reason, I am strongly in favour of the amendment.</p>

In producing a report on the Schengen agreement, we managed, for the first time, to get hold of and publish what was then known as the Schengen acquis, which had been accepted in the Amsterdam treaty but without being seen by several of the delegations that had accepted it. We published several reports on British opt-outs, pointing out that the British had opted out formally and then opted back into an awful lot of things in detail. We tried hard to get first the media and then your Lordships&#146; House to take an interest in this and, indeed, managed to find time for some of our reports to be debated in an empty House late at night. We have to be a little more honest with ourselves about the level of interest that we have had in the past 11 years in this development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08052040000130"></a>I can take my awareness of this matter back further. When I was still on the staff of Chatham House in 1988, I was asked to chair a conference of senior policemen on co-operation between the British police and their opposite numbers on the Continent. A very senior policeman from a county force in southern England commented at one point that he had just signed an agreement with his opposite numbers in France about the levels of co-operation on each other&#146;s

The Home Office told him that it was thoroughly in favour of this agreement but that it would prefer not to know too much about it. For the past 20 years, we have had a much higher level of co-operation between the British police and their opposite numbers on the Continent and, increasingly, between British prosecuting authorities and their opposite numbers on the Continent than Governments have wished to admit, the media to know about or Parliament to pay sufficient attention to.</p>

<a name="80520-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08052040000131"></a>I regret some of the tone of this debate. The image of Brussels as hostile territory, of the European Court of Justice as being a threat and of British sovereignty being surrendered suggests that we see the European Union as something of which we are a deeply reluctant member. Several million British citizens live in other member states in the European Union, most of them highly law-abiding&#151;although the <I>Observer</I> last Sunday carried an interesting article on the Liverpool criminal network, its activities in Amsterdam and its holiday homes in Marbella. Crime and therefore police co-operation&#151;and the co-operation of prosecuting authorities&#151;have to follow the extent to which we are becoming increasingly internationalised, which has implications for how British law enforcement authorities and British legal authorities work within a clear framework with their partners across the Channel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08052040000132"></a>We on these Benches regret the intense complexity that opt-outs and opt-ins have now achieved. That seems to us to be a general obfuscation and, once this Bill is complete, the Government would do better to publish a White Paper explaining it to us. We believe that the United Kingdom&#146;s interests are best served by opting in much more vigorously than we have done so far. We also accept the views of the Lord President about staying out of negotiations and then discovering at the end of them that what has been agreed does not entirely fit British national interests and is not actually in British national interests. We therefore accept the views of the EU Committee on this. We recognise that we have to engage in these co-operative activities and that closer co-operation among law enforcement and other legal authorities in a European framework has been, and continues to be, in Britain&#146;s long-term national interest.</p>

The view of the Government is that they should make the decision after discussion in the parliamentary committees, but with no opportunity for Parliament, meeting as a Parliament, to make the final decision on whether we should opt in. That is what worries me and the supporters of the amendment. It is not good enough for the Government to say, &#147;You can have discussions. We gave you all the assurances during the passage of the Bill through both Houses but now, without any further ado, we are going to agree to opt in where we had opted out&#148;. I hope that the Government will think further about that if they wish to protect the power of Parliament.</p>

But we have heard extremely wise words, based on a very wise report from enormously experienced parliamentarians&#151;experienced in both places&#151;such as my noble friend Lord Goodlad, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, and the noble Lords, Lord Rowlands and Lord Jopling.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08052040000140"></a>We ought to ponder very carefully on the propositions that they have put forward. The propositions seem to me to carry considerable weight. What they are talking about in the name of Parliament, at a time when many fine speeches are being made about the need to restore parliamentary authority and accountability, is not just the need for improved scrutiny. I recognise that fully when the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, talks about the time he needs to develop further methods. We have been talking now for more than two or three years&#151;for five or seven years&#151;about beefing up the whole scrutiny process, reducing the number of exceptions and loopholes that the Government can use to bypass scrutiny, and generally strengthening the entire system. There is very widespread concern that Parliament as a whole has not been doing its job. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, on that. Although many people, especially in this House, have done an enormous amount of work trying to improve the system, it is not yet good enough.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08052040000141"></a>We are looking beyond that. We are looking at the need for clear accountability in very important matters and changes affecting people&#146;s lives. That is what the report from our own Constitution Committee addresses very squarely. I sensed in earlier debates some suggestion that we could perhaps slightly downgrade reports from committees in another place and that we must rest on our own reports. But here we have, with the full authority of its members, the Constitution Committee&#146;s report. It clearly says, in heavy black type, what amendments are necessary to the Bill. Why does it talk about &#147;amendments&#148; to the Bill? It is seeking affirmative

It is seeking approval&#151;more than just scrutiny, approval&#151;of proposals on the opt-ins and opt-outs in the justice and home affairs area, and indeed in wider areas as well.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08052040000142"></a>I concede that last night I was standing at the Dispatch Box arguing that we should go further than mere affirmative resolutions on the new passerelles&#151;which are not similar to but more extended than the old ones&#151;and there should be an Act of Parliament before a great change was made moving from unanimity to QMV in important new areas. That did not seem to command vast support in this Committee, although the matter is so important that I think we will return to it. However, this report seeks something short of that; namely the affirmative resolutions about which we have heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08052040000143"></a>If, as the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, says, we need more time to work out how this is all going to work, that is a strong argument indeed for having a requirement in the Bill to ensure that we do not just roll ahead with the whole treaty and the whole Bill before this matter has even been worked out. That is a very important argument indeed.</p>

Obviously, one looks eagerly at treaty proposals that come along to see whether they will genuinely enhance the role of national parliaments or whether they put forward large formulae which in practice do not add up to very much.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08052040000149"></a>We have debated this matter and it was debated in the other place, and a lot of doubts and question marks rest over the proposition that the position of national parliaments will be restored by this treaty. Many people would argue&#151;not on any wild basis but on a very clear basis&#151;that national parliaments do not in practice emerge very much stronger out of this than they were before; if anything, they come out a little weaker. Therefore, the case of the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, is immensely powerful, and it was supported with equal power by my noble friend Lord Jopling. Even if they had not spoken, I have before me the words of our committee and its members, who are very distinguished Members of your Lordships&#146; House:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08052040000280"></a>&#147;We conclude that the importance of how the opt-ins and opt-outs are used is such that Parliament must be fully involved in their use. We therefore recommend that the European Union (Amendment) Bill be amended so as to require the Government to obtain approval from both Houses of Parliament before using opt-ins or opt-outs in any policy area&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052040000270"></a>That could not be more plain, more obvious or more justified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08052040000150"></a>We will now need from the Government and from those who say that there may be other ways of doing this some very clear expositions to satisfy us that somehow we should turn aside from these recommendations. They are in the interests not just of party but of Parliament, our democracy and the European system, which itself is under considerable attack and lacks enormous popularity and contact with the people. We should give our full support to amendments of this kind and I hope that we will hear full support for them from the Government.</p>

I refer not only to the more obvious ways in which we collaborate across police forces concerning criminal activity and so on but also, speaking from my experience on the Justice and Home Affairs Council, to collaboration on civil and family justice issues. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, talked about the number of people from the UK who live all over the European Union, and certainly every year millions of UK citizens live, work, travel, study  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1370"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1370</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and buy and sell in the EU. Therefore, ensuring that protection exists for them&#151;for example, if they have faulty goods or debts that need to be repaid&#151;is very important. A lot of the UK Government&#146;s work in justice and home affairs&#151;particularly but not only during our presidency&#151;has been on ensuring that we provide the right level of protection for our citizens and indeed for citizens across the European Union. I make that point because this is an important area. Of course, opt-ins in this area have been around since Maastricht and I have certainly exercised opt-ins, or have exercised a decision not to opt in, on a number of occasions.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08052040000153"></a>The second starting point is that I agree with much of what has been said about the importance of real scrutiny. I have listened with great care to noble Lords who have raised questions on how to ensure that we do that. I hope to allay some of the noble Lords&#146; concerns. Having alarmed the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, with my evidence, I am not sure how to put that to rest, but I shall certainly try.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08052040000154"></a>I am extremely grateful to noble Lords who were able to attend the committee last week. I hope they will agree that we had an interesting and quite detailed discussion about how the process might work and how we might reinforce or enhance the committee&#146;s work. I agree with those noble Lords who have said that the committee is the appropriate place to scrutinise these issues. Having attended and provided evidence to the Select Committee, I speak from personal experience. I know only too well the expertise and knowledge that has grown up in the membership of the committee and indeed in those who service the committee. I can assure noble Lords, although I do not think that I need to, that the House is well served by the work of the committee and the sub-committee. I also take the point about ensuring that we involve Parliament appropriately.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08052040000155"></a>As a Minister, I have taken 17 pieces of legislation and a plethora of statutory instruments through your Lordships&#146; House. I know only too well that, late at night, our deliberations may not carry the expertise that noble Lords would wish to see. It is therefore important to ensure that when we are discussing issues of scrutiny, we recognise the importance and value of the committee and seek to ensure that that is where the key scrutiny takes place. When talking to the committee I was also keen to ensure that we thought more carefully about how we scrutinise these issues in the light of much of what noble Lords have said about their concerns to ensure that the committee can participate and consider the issues in greater detail.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08052040000156"></a>I shall say a little more about the process and answer some of the questions that have been raised. We are sometimes aware of issues in justice and home affairs that have come along from the Commission or which may have been bubbling under the surface because of specific issues that have been around for some time. Until we receive a fully formed proposal from the Commission we cannot start the process ourselves. That process within government involves consultation across the departments that have an interest, the devolved Administrations and other stakeholders. Noble Lords will be able to think of  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1371"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1371</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>examples, particularly on issues of civil justice, when it was appropriate to fully consult organisations to get their views on how they saw a particular proposal.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08052040000157"></a>Having done that, the Government will make their decision. I think that 90 days is appropriate. They have to give us some timetable, and three months from the date of the full proposal is quite generous because it gives us time to look properly at the issues. The Government commit considerable resources to considering the issues properly. For those who think that 90 days to end up with a proposal that will become law is not long enough, I should say that that is the opening negotiating position. Negotiations can take many months on particular proposals, and at the end of that time we will probably be seeking to amend them.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08052040000158"></a>At the beginning we ask whether the proposal is in the UK&#146;s interests&#151;whether it would be beneficial for the UK to opt into it or whether we would be in danger of damaging UK interests by opting in. Within that negotiating position there will be issues that we would wish to strengthen, to change or to discuss with colleagues across the European Union to see whether we might make them more effective. On the order for payment, for example, we might want to ensure that the ability to reclaim money is set at a level that is of use to our citizens rather than at a lower level that is of benefit to other nation states but of less use to us, and so on. That is how the process begins. It is not an end in itself but is a process of negotiation. That is very important.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08052040000159"></a>When it comes to parliamentary scrutiny and the role of the committee I am keen to ensure that we &#147;use&#148; the committee and the expertise I have described as effectively as possible. I have therefore been talking with officials in the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Attorney-General&#146;s office to see what more might be done. As noble Lords who have read my evidence will see, I have clearly accepted the importance of finding ways of collaborating as effectively as possible.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08052040000160"></a>In working with the committee over the next short while, we will try to see whether we can be clear that we will lay an explanatory memorandum as swiftly as possible. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Roper, felt strongly about that in my evidence-giving last week. We would make sure that the Government put the proposed position as clearly and swiftly as possible. As noble Lords will know, sometimes when these issues are obvious the Government can be pretty clear with the committee on which way we would expect to go, while other times the consultation process needs to take place first.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08052040000161"></a>We would then wish to give the committee some time within the 90-day framework to enable it to have discussions without the Government pre-empting those. Although we will have to discuss how many weeks that might be, I have a commitment from my right honourable friends in another place on wanting to do this, thus enabling the committee to have those deliberations and indeed to call evidence and invite Ministers before it to have those discussions. We will need to ensure that we set that out appropriately. How that can best be achieved is a matter for discussion with the noble  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1372"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1372</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord, Lord Grenfell, and the committee. I want to make it absolutely clear that I accept it is very important for the scrutiny to be appropriate and at the right level and for the Government to put it forward with the committee in the best way.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08052040000162"></a>I want to end on a more fundamental point regarding the whole area of justice and home affairs. As we move beyond the Lisbon treaty and into post-ratification, it will be important for the Government to consider their strategic approach to this area, as they would normally do. Indeed, as noble Lords will know, the Commission will no doubt produce post-Lisbon papers about the general approach that it might take to justice and home affairs. There are areas of collaboration where it would seek to work with member states to develop important areas of legislation, or indeed of policy. We will have to think carefully about what our approach would be. That will have implications for how we handle individual opt-ins. Those may come in all sorts of guises but they need to be part of a strategic approach. The Government should seek to do that in the spirit of wanting to be a participant in the European Union in this area.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08052040000163"></a>It is important that Parliament should look at the strategy for government as part of that strategic approach. We will have to consider how best to do that. For example, perhaps government Ministers will initially outline that approach to the Select Committee and the Select Committee will then, through the usual channels, invite the House to debate such a strategy. In itself that will give a sense of direction and some detail on where the Government would go. To be blunt, however, I would not be in favour of the salami-slicing of individual opt-in decisions. I said that in my evidence, and I believe it from my own experience. The decisions do not come in packages, but they are often inter-related within a general approach on civil justice, criminal justice and so on. Decisions need to be taken in that way.</p>

<a name="80520-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08052040000164"></a>Finally, in all this process, regardless of whether the Government ultimately decide to opt in or out&#151;as I indicated, I have done both&#151;one always seeks to do so in a spirit of being part of Europe, of collaboration and co-operation with our European partners. It is possible that, having not opted in at the end of the process, one can then ask the Commission and the Council about doing so if the proposal becomes acceptable. Indeed, a consultation is now out on Rome I&#151;on which I was the Minister responsible for not opting in&#151;concerning whether it is at the point where we could opt in. We spent a huge amount of time looking closely at the working groups, but that was exceptional.</p>

It is about an affirmative resolution proposition for certain opt-in and opt-out activities that the Government and the Executive are proposing. The Minister has not addressed that, even though she has covered the scrutiny issue in great detail. She must address it before she sits down.</p>

I was addressing the issues that noble Lords raised in their deliberations that I thought gave rise to concerns that, for some noble Lords, were the reasons why they were supporting the amendment, because they feel that the Government have not done enough to consider scrutiny. However, the noble Lord is right, and I am grateful to him. I shall address his point but I shall finish the one I was making about the scrutiny procedure, because I do not think noble Lords can reach a decision on this amendment without me putting forward how the process currently works and some of the issues that we need to consider for the future. I was saying that it is rare to be able to look again at the possibilities of opting in, but it is possible. It would not be a strategy to be pursued in the main. I mention that because it was raised in the committee and I felt that this Committee should also hear that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08052040000167"></a>However, it is time for me to wind up my remarks. I do not believe that the way forward is this amendment. I tried to indicate that by talking about the need to think strategically about justice and home affairs. Our approach to individual opt-ins would be governed to a degree by how that strategy is developed. I do not believe that the House would be best served by individual discussions on individual opt-ins. I believe it is well served and best served by the committee, which can take the strategic overview that is the most appropriate way forward. It has the power to bring forward to the House, if it so wishes, issues of concern and to suggest to the House that it should debate them. I know that noble Lords will not underestimate the importance and value of the committee; nor should they underestimate the value that the committee has within government. Noble Lords will be aware that those of us who have had the privilege of working with the committee in this area take great note and pay great attention to what is being said.</p>

<a name="80520-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08052040000168"></a>My response to the amendment was not just to be negative about it but to look for alternative ways in which we can ensure the best possible scrutiny, so that noble Lords can rest assured that the House will play an appropriate role. We believe that that is through the committee. I therefore hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

They understand the perception of our relationship with Europe from outside Parliament and how the way we react to the Bill will be affected by it.

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08052040000170"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roper, in a typically perceptive speech, expressed the hope that what is proposed in this amendment would not be mutually exclusive with scrutiny in the European committee.

<a name="80520-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08052040000171"></a>Perhaps an excess of delicacy prevented me addressing the Minister&#146;s remarks to the committee. These were alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, and my noble friend Lord Jopling, in talking about the final word on opt-ins remaining with the Executive. I am sure that it was not the Minister&#146;s intention to throw down the gauntlet to Parliament. Governments who have done that in the past tend to find that, in the end, Parliament prevails. We await the Government&#146;s detailed response to the committee&#146;s report. We will think carefully about that and return to the matter on Report.

</ul>
<a name="80520-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08052040000174"></a>The noble Lord said: I hope this amendment will be relatively uncontentious. I will therefore keep my opening remarks fairly brief. The treaty of Lisbon inserts into the relevant protocol a provision that Her Majesty&#146;s Government may notify the European Council at any time of their intent to join the euro. The treaty is, of course, silent on what process may go on within the United Kingdom before the Government make that notification. Fortunately, for the last decade we have had cross-party agreement in the United Kingdom that no decision to join the euro would be taken without being the subject of a referendum. It has been a sensible policy to uphold in this country because of the recognition of how important a step joining the euro, were we ever to do so, would be.</p>

<a name="80520-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08052040000175"></a>There are a couple of reasons for that. This is not the place to discuss the pros and cons of the euro, but most people would accept that it has both economic and political significance. The economic benefits have been argued by many, but equally there are those&#151;among whom I include myself&#151;who believe that floating exchange rates were one of the great successes of the second half of the last century, and that they have worked greatly in the UK&#146;s favour by enabling our  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1375"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1375</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>economy to adjust in periods of turbulence. Indeed, you could argue that the only periods when the UK has had real trouble have been when it has attempted to link its exchange rate permanently to some other grouping. I happen to be in favour of maintaining floating exchange rates. Whichever side of the argument you come down on, most people would agree that these are serious and deep economic arguments that run across party lines. There are people of both persuasions in all parties and, indeed, in no party.</p>

<a name="80520-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08052040000176"></a>Similarly, on political grounds, a number of eminent people gave evidence to the recent House of Lords European Union Committee report on the euro. Most accepted&#151;or indeed made&#151;the point that because monetary policy is intimately linked with fiscal policy and therefore overall economic policy, and because of the impact that overall policy has on the way economic development affects the country and the individuals in it, it is very difficult to proceed to monetary union without that carrying with it some degree of political union. That factor has been one of the driving forces behind the adoption and development of the euro as part of a project of European integration. Therefore, any decision by the UK to join the euro would, most would accept, have implications for the level of pooling of sovereignty in a number of areas that that carried with it.</p>

<a name="80520-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08052040000177"></a>For economic reasons and reasons of sovereignty, and the important point that these arguments have run across party lines in the United Kingdom for many years, there has been a common policy of accepting that any decision on something so important should be adopted through a referendum.</p>

<a name="80520-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08052040000178"></a>One might ask why we need this commitment in this Bill. To be delicate, the public might have reason, as a result of recent debates, to be suspicious of whether commitments to referendums made by parties in manifestos have the level of value and confidence that they might have believed them to have. It is not for me to enlarge on that point. But, with this Bill including the provision to notify the Council of a decision to join the euro, it would be sensible for us to put beyond doubt that all parties in this Parliament, and those who are not of any party but are here to uphold the constitution, still subscribe to the view that a decision of this importance should be subject to a referendum. Including this provision takes it once and for all out of the political debate. It would be settled and decided that that is the view of all involved in this question.</p>

<a name="80520-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08052040000179"></a>I do not think any member of any political party would want it thought that, having made a commitment to a referendum, there was any doubt about that commitment. Therefore, it would be helpful to all political parties to have that written into the treaty so that no one can ever question their commitment. That is why I believe this is, I hope, an uncontentious amendment that should have the support of all sides of the Committee. I look forward to it being received in that manner. I beg to move.</p>

I have no difficulty with the substance of what he is saying. I believe that I support a Government whose position in relation to the euro remains unchanged.

But to locate that in this Bill to enable the ratification of the Lisbon treaty would be an act of complete folly with no logic. The only argument used to sustain it is to say that, because people might not trust the Government when they talk about referenda, anything on which we may need to have a referendum should be grounded in this Bill. That is a nonsense which needs to be opposed. I am sure that on sober reflection, knowing the cross-party agreement and consensus that the noble Lord has on the content, he will withdraw his amendment, knowing that this is the wrong place to put it.</p>

I have always greatly admired his erudition and sophistication in his arguments, even if I have not always agreed. But to say that to have or to propose a referendum on any subject takes the matter out of political debate seems to fly completely in the face of the facts of the history. Every time a referendum has been held or suggested, it has been a political act of the highest order, designed not from high constitutional motives but because the people who propose or oppose it wish to achieve a particular political objective which they do not think they can achieve any other way. To say that having a referendum on this issue will take it out of the political debate flies in the face of history and reality.</p>

She referred to the importance of coherence&#151;of not just having an ad hoc policy but one that makes sense taken together, one item with another. My idea of coherence is one of support for the concept of parliamentary democracy. That is why, if the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Goodlad had been put to the vote, I would have unhesitatingly supported it. We have to be serious about these matters and not just pick and choose which particular procedural or constitutional device we want according to whether it will get us the right answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08052040000185"></a>By the same token, you ought to continue the process of parliamentary democracy by refusing to resort to the essentially Bonapartist device of a referendum, however popular that might be. That is inconsistent with the whole tradition of representative parliamentary democracy. Whoever has said it; however often it has been said; however many political parties have wanted to say it, have felt it convenient to say it, been pushed to say it or been pressed by sections of the press to say it, those who are true parliamentarians and believe in our representative democracy will not support the concept of a referendum, however unpopular that may be in certain quarters and however much they may be traduced for supporting the supremacy of Parliament rather than populist devices in some sections of the press.

He said, &#147;We&#146;ll have a referendum and members of the Cabinet can campaign on both sides. I am in favour&#148;. He pulled the trick off and I am glad of the outcome, but the device was a shabby one. It will go down in the annals of the history of Parliament as one that put us on the wrong road.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08052040000191"></a>One has to ask why, when the treaties of Amsterdam and Nice were ratified, no one thought it necessary to put in such a provision. It is not relevant. If we had been ratifying the constitutional treaty, it is just conceivable that you could have mounted a case saying it was necessary. Because the constitutional treaty completely rewrote all the instruments&#151;although some of them were kept virtually identical&#151;you could have argued that, for the avoidance of all doubt, it was desirable to make clear that the commitment by all three parties for a referendum on the euro applied to the new constitutional treaty. But we are not talking about the constitutional treaty; we are talking about a treaty which acts by amendment. It has not amended the provision on which the three parties have said they are committed to a referendum&#151;that is, a decision to join the euro. The amendment is unnecessary. I hope the noble Lord will come to the same conclusion and will withdraw his amendment.</p>

We can all agree with that because all the main parties have promised a referendum before signing up to the euro.

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08052040000193"></a>If the Government mean to escape their manifesto commitment on the currency, some sophistry would obviously be required to bolster the claim that circumstances had changed. That is not impossible. Europe does not like referendums&#151;it has lost 11 or 12 of them&#151;and has already shown that it is glad to co-operate in avoiding a vote if that helps promote integration. The kind of thing that might happen is that the basic objectives of the European monetary policy, which are in, I think, Article 127, could be revised to put more emphasis on growth and employment&#151;Sarkozy would like that&#151;and it might help the argument that the single currency was no longer quite the same economic animal as before. Maybe the Court of Justice could offer a more prescriptive interpretation of Article 4, a new article brought in by the Lisbon treaty which flatly states that the Union&#146;s currency is the euro, or a passerelle might be invoked&#151;I do not know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08052040000194"></a>However, I know that the British people trust politicians less and less. It is very sad but that is how it is. The supremacy of the Court of Justice, which was so cogently and brilliantly expounded last week by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, and the noble Lord, Lord Lester, must put in doubt governmental reassurances on the treaties, even when given in perfect good faith.

The virtue of a referendum is that it cuts across party lines. Manifestos have rival packages of attractive and less attractive policies and you have to choose which package, on balance, you prefer. But a referendum comes pure and unbundled. Voters are not muddled by conflicting preferences or open to pressures from the Whips, who can sometimes coerce and cajole all but the bravest MPs to vote against their consciences. The secrecy of the polling booth can be a great protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08052040000196"></a>In a referendum both sides are given equal airtime. The Government cannot make their case unanswered. Television editors cannot put their own slant on the story and people soon become surprisingly well informed. When I hear people talk about it in the House, I often think they do not realise that. During the Maastricht referendum, an enterprising academic asked 10 questions to a random sample of Danish voters&#151;</p>

They were not very demanding questions&#151;ones such as &#147;Who is the EU president?&#148; and &#147;Which country holds the presidency?&#148;. The voters got more answers right than the MPs. An internal Eurobarometer study confirmed that result. It showed that citizens in those countries that have held referendums on European integration know nearly twice as much about Europe as citizens in the other countries. One of the countries that came up surprisingly well was Switzerland, which of course is not even in the EU.</p>

The noble Lord has not, however, referred to the experience in France and the Netherlands a mere two years ago, when it was fairly clearly demonstrated that the voters were voting about not the text that was before them but whether or not they liked Monsieur Chirac. That undercuts his argument. The debate on this provision is in any case about not whether referendums are a good thing&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Brittan, referred to that&#151;but whether it makes sense and is necessary to put a reference into this Bill to the three parties&#146; commitment to a referendum on the euro.

The ordinary voter has a pretty good grasp of what is really at stake here. Travel abroad shows them different conditions in Germany and Spain; prices and the jobs market give them a pretty good feel for the trade-off between inflation and recession at home. The only real reason to oppose this amendment would be to clear the way to adopt the euro without consulting the people. As recently as last September, Gordon Brown and David Miliband both repeated their promise that they would not do that. I was glad of that. For reasons not quite clear to me, they said that the currency was of even more constitutional significance than the Lisbon treaty.

It is, rather, that it is not for Parliament to give away the powers which have been entrusted to it by the people without the people&#146;s consent. There is no question that the treaty achieves that and, were we to join the euro, there would be a massive transfer of power in an irreversible direction which could not be put right by a Government at subsequent general elections. That requires the consent of the people. So my noble friend is right to insist that this is included in the legislation.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Brittan, perhaps rather mischievously, provoked noble Lords into the wider debate about referendums. It may be of interest, since I am never going to write my memoirs, that I was there in 1975&#151;in fact, I was there two or three years before 1975&#151;when Mr Anthony Wedgwood Benn, as he then was, proposed to the National Executive of the Labour Party a referendum on Europe as a way of healing the party&#146;s divisions. He could not find a seconder to that proposal in the National Executive, because its members, like most parliamentarians, at that time saw a referendum as basically undermining the sovereignty and authority of Parliament.</p>

It is strange how at one point during this debate we are made to be concerned about the sovereignty of Parliament and then, at another, urged to use the referendum as a kind of opt-out.</p>

It is in the wrong place and for that reason we will not be supporting it. Finally, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, that we are, at last, reaching a breathtaking consensus. We are about to see the noble Lords, Lord Blackwell and Lord Hunt, marching shoulder to shoulder on the same amendment. That is consensus indeed.</p>

Well, I think that often it takes it out of party-political debate and enables the issue, either for or against, properly to be discussed. But I was not sure whether he was dismissing it as a Bonapartist device or a populist device. It was interesting to note that he described both those aspects with some derision&#151;</p>

That has been followed by his successors through the ages. The two are not alternatives.</p>

A populist device is one in which politicians, for their own ends, choose to manipulate the people; it is not an instrument of democracy. We have evolved over quite a few centuries a procedure known as Parliament, which is meant to filter and sift the process and enable the representatives of the people&#151;Burke will be familiar to the noble Lord as a notable example&#151;to exercise their judgment.

There is a great deal of evidence better than my anecdotal evidence that the large number of French people who support the National Front&#151;the neo-fascists&#151;and the large number of French people who support the Trotskyite wing of the socialist party, who made up the backbone of the no vote, were not voting about the treaty at all. That evidence has been confirmed by any number of sources.

As I said, we will debate the issues surrounding that when we come to the next group of amendments. I am clear that, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said, there is a commitment from all three parties to put the important issue of the euro to the British people for a variety of reasons, whether to do with handing over control or to do with the significance and symbolism of such a move, which is an important aspect.</p>

I queried it, not because it is not a perfectly reasonable issue to debate but because I did not think that it was relevant to the Bill. That remains my view. The amendment got through on a technicality in a sense, because there are some technical changes to preserve the UK opt-in and ensure that we are clear on a number of monetary policy issues, on to which the amendment has quite reasonably been hung. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, made sure that it was appropriate, so I say nothing to him on that. None the less, I was surprised.

Those who believe that should clearly oppose the amendment. I disagree with them for the reasons eloquently set out by my noble friend Lord Leach, but clearly if you think that a referendum on the euro is wrong, you will oppose the amendment.

<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1389"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1389</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government can notify the Council of their decision to enter the euro. We are debating a treaty on Europe, and the provisions on monetary union are a major feature of the European Community and its development. If there is any doubt about the UK Government&#146;s policies on that and other issues and about the way in which the powers in the treaties should be exercised, the Bill implementing this treaty is exactly the right place to set those matters straight. Therefore, I cannot see any argument for saying that this is the wrong place for my amendment. If the Government were to offer a separate Bill to deal with the matter, I should be happy to accept it, but it seems to me convenient and perfectly in line with the purpose of these treaties to make the amendment here, as is the case with any of the other amendments that we have discussed to do with other passerelle provisions, other opt-ins and so on.</p>

<a name="80520-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08052040000258"></a>The other argument, put forward by the noble Lords, Lord Tomlinson, Lord McNally and Lord Hannay, is that the amendment is unnecessary. This goes back to the point about trust. I was delighted to hear the Minister reaffirm the Government&#146;s commitment to a referendum on the euro and I was delighted to hear the noble Lord, Lord McNally, on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench confirm, under interrogation, that the Liberal policy to support a referendum on the euro is unchanged. However, as I said in my opening remarks, it would not be surprising if the public were suspicious about commitments to referendums being met, which is why I think it necessary, in the interests of public trust, to include this in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80520-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08052040000259"></a>I wish to clarify a point made by my noble friend Lord Brittan. He said that I had suggested that a referendum on the issue would take the matter out of political debate. I did not suggest that a commitment to a referendum would make the issue non-political; I suggested that, if it were clear that all parties were committed to a referendum, the question whether or not to have a referendum would be taken out of political debate. However, there are clearly those in this Chamber who, despite agreeing with the notion of a referendum on the euro, want to find a reason for not including it in the Bill. If there are any doubters, I should make it clear that agreeing to this amendment would not in any way invalidate the treaty or prevent it from being ratified; it would simply be a procedural issue within the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80520-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08052040000260"></a>Those who oppose the amendment must accept that they open themselves up to the electorate questioning whether their reason for doing so is that they wish to leave themselves some degree of freedom. That may not be their intent but I do not think that they can blame anyone but themselves if that is what people read into their motives. That is a decision for them. I think that it is in the interests of political trust and democracy in this country that we make it clear that, before we enter the euro, all parties are committed to a referendum on the matter. For that reason, I wish to test the opinion of the Committee.</p>

I have no doubt that we will come to it again. We all know what it is. These Benches question why the present Government resist a referendum on the Lisbon treaty while we believe more strongly than ever that there should be one. I say &#147;more strongly than ever&#148; because perhaps I did not start with enough faith and commitment, as I should have done, about the nature of this treaty text. When I have read it through line by line as we have come to the amendments and looked at Open Europe&#146;s <I>The Lisbon Treaty and the European Constitution: A </I><I>s</I><I>ide-by-side </I><I>c</I><I>omparison</I>, I have been absolutely staggered by the fact that word after word, line after line, sentence after sentence and paragraph after paragraph are exactly the same.

He announced very firmly that all&#151;I emphasise all&#151;of the earlier proposals were in the new text, although he did candidly admit that some of them would be disguised. The point was also happily and enthusiastically conceded by a whole range of European Union leaders. In fact, almost all of them did except our own in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08052047000007"></a>It is curious to be told day after day that something is not which clearly is. It is as though the Government&#146;s case has fallen into the hands of some child fantasy storyteller, and not a very good one at that. The story seems to zigzag from argument to argument and scene to scene in different parts of the forest. First we are told that it is different because the constitution concept has been abandoned; then we are told that, anyway, even if it is a constitution, the red lines will protect us. That, of course, is the classic Billy Bunter argument: &#147;I did not steal the currant cake, and anyway it did not have currants in it&#148;. Anyway, the European Scrutiny Committee in the other place said that the red lines leaked &#147;like a sieve&#148;. It said that the opt-out from the charter was non-existent, which turns out to be true; that the tax danger was mostly never there, at any rate not for direct taxation; and that the protection for foreign policy is highly debatable. Anyway, the Government made all those claims last time for the constitutional treaty which preceded this one.</p>

<a name="80520-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08052047000008"></a>Then, we were told: &#147;Never mind about that. If that doesn&#146;t stand up, it&#146;s not constitutional&#148;. Well, it transparently is constitutional, and our own Constitution Committee confirms it. It says that it has inevitable constitutional implications. Are we to dismiss our own House of Lords committee on that? Then, the Government said: &#147;Well, even if it&#146;s constitutional, we should not really go for referendums&#148;. I admit, having listened to the earlier debate and the stentorian arguments of my noble friend Lord Brittan of Spennithorne, that I am not a fan of referendums either. I must confess that I took a referendum Bill for Northern Ireland through the House of Commons many years ago, with the total support of all my colleagues, even those who were not very keen on referendums. Nevertheless, it was felt to be justified in that case. Heaven knows that we have had enough of them recently. The current Government have used the referendum weapon very frequently, and now I understand that it is proposed to use it in Scotland. That is what I read in the newspapers. If people do not like referendums, that is understandable; but if it is raised into being a principle against referendums, it becomes totally unintelligible.</p>

<a name="80520-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08052047000009"></a>If that argument does not stand, then it is argued that other countries are not having a referendum. Well, Ireland is having one very shortly. And do we always have to be the copycats? Do we always have to say, &#147;If they are not doing it, we must follow suit&#148;? Then, we are told that it is too complicated for the British people to understand, although the Irish are apparently managing to understand it and the French and the Dutch managed to understand it. I know that some lively words were exchanged on that in the previous debate, and I do not want to stir them up again. However, I do not think that that proposition can survive for two seconds without raising questions about the intellectual capacities and sheer shrewdness of the people when carefully and properly consulted about an issue.</p>

<a name="80520-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08052047000010"></a>As for the concept of the constitution being abandoned, this is where we reach the edges of credulity. We know that it is just the wrapping that has been abandoned. I am all for pretty wrapping and doing up parcels beautifully. When I visit Japan I think how marvellous  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1394"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1394</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they are at wrapping things up. But it is what is inside that matters. It really is wearying constantly to be told that two and two does not make four and that black is white. In the words of my right honourable friend Kenneth Clarke, with whom I have worked closely in the past, will the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="08052047000078"></a>&#147;stop all this nonsense about its being different from the constitution when it is plainly the same in substance&#148;?&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 5/3/08; col. 1785.]</ul>
<p><a name="08052047000068"></a>That seems pretty definite.</p>

<a name="80520-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08052047000011"></a>Having listed all those arguments that are paraded, there is one reason above all why none of these pleas should be accepted: the Government promised a referendum, as did the Liberal Democrats and my own party. We did it in our manifestos in 2005. The parties went even further than the promises in the manifestos. In the <I>Sun</I>, the former Primer Minister, Tony Blair, said,</p>
<ul><a name="08052047000079"></a>&#147;we will have a referendum on the constitution in any event&#151;and that is a government promise&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08052047000012"></a>As for the Liberal Democrats&#151;I was going to say the dear old Lib Dems, but I am not sure those are quite the right words&#151;we are getting used to their vagaries. My colleague William Hague had a few words for the anatomical state of their party in the Commons debates. I shall spare their blushes here; I think that these matters are much too vulgar for your Lordships&#146; House. However, their new leader, Mr Clegg, said at their party conference:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08052047000074"></a>&#147;Any proposals which involve significant change in the relationship between the Union, the member states and its citizens should be approved in Britain through a referendum&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052047000069"></a>What could be plainer than that?</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08052047000013"></a>Every independent analysis confirms that the two treaties are virtual replicas. According to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, a very distinguished committee, as I know, 240 of the 250 proposals in the constitutional treaty are reproduced identically in this one. That very distinguished committee&#151;by no means dominated by the Opposition; on the contrary, it is dominated by the Government&#151;said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08052047000080"></a>&#147;there is no material difference between the provisions on foreign affairs in the Constitutional Treaty, which the Government made subject to approval in a referendum and those in the Lisbon Treaty on which a referendum is being denied&#148;.</ul>

He and his Front-Bench colleagues have often used the words of Mr Hague&#146;s fascinating amendments for the text of some of their own amendments in this place. But does he agree that William Hague was regarded as a spectacularly incompetent and unsuccessful national leader in the general election campaign, mainly because he invoked the fear of Europe as his main plank&#151;10 days to save the pound&#151;and that he did very badly in that election? Does he also agree that there is an interesting comparison between the absence of his leader in the Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, who was here only on the first occasion, and the presence of the leader of the Labour Party on the government Benches and the leader of the Liberal Democrat Party on the Liberal Democrat Benches? Is there some significance in the absence of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde? Is it a fear of a William Hague repetition?</p>

I want to rely heavily on evidence that has been produced in this House before. I remember, in particular, the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, taking us through some of the arguments that were produced by the Dutch Council of State, an independent body in the Netherlands advising the Dutch Government and the Dutch Parliament about the decisions that they had to make. I shall briefly quote two paragraphs from its report because they are pertinent. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="08052047000075"></a>&#147;Unlike the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe [the reform treaty] provides no arguments for a gradual expansion of the EU towards a more explicit state or federation. The purpose of these changes, taken together, is to rid the proposed Reform Treaty as far as possible of the elements from the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe which could have formed a basis for the development of the EU into a more explicit state or federation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052047000070"></a>It concluded:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08052047000076"></a>&#147;All this means that the proposed Reform Treaty is substantially different from the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80520-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08052047000018"></a>This is high-quality independent legal advice, given to a parliament and Government that had to face up to the decision of a referendum on the constitutional treaty. Anybody who has read the whole report on the Dutch decision will be totally convinced by the argument. The facts are there for anybody in the Committee to read; they have been referred to frequently in previous debates. I assert absolutely and clearly that anybody who says that there is no difference between the rejected constitutional treaty and the current reform treaty is flying in the face of all the available evidence. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, knows this and is embarrassed.</p>

I have no such evidence of ever having used what I regard as an essentially fatuous argument. I am not going to give way again because we have plenty of points of substance to debate, rather than these childish debating points. I have told the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, that I will not give way to him because his are always childish debating points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08052047000021"></a>What I have said is very clear. There is a difference between the constitutional treaty that was rejected and the reform treaty that we have before us. The referendum pledge was made in relation to one and not the other. I believe that the pledge was wrong and said so in this Chamber at the time. My right honourable friend Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, made a major error of judgment in that decision. The pledge that was made at that time is not transferable to these completely different and new circumstances. I hope that, if the noble Lord does not have a flash of common sense before the end of the debate and does not withdraw his amendment, it will be resoundingly defeated.</p>

I have always been impatient with those who talk of this House adding value to the legislative process as though our function were merely to make the legislative sausage-machine churn out Bills of better quality and in greater quantity. In fact, we have far more important functions, such as preventing the House of Commons from unilaterally extending the life of a Parliament or otherwise abusing the constitution.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08052047000023"></a>Today we have a duty of enormous constitutional significance. Surely we have a duty to make Members of the other place honour the promises that they all made to their constituents that there would be a referendum on the matters formerly in the constitutional treaty and now in the treaty of Lisbon. I put it in that way because I am shocked and amazed at the way in which some people have suggested that MPs and the Government are freed from their promises because the constitutional treaty no longer exists. Common sense and decency tell us that we should look at the substance, not the form.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08052047000024"></a>We are talking of the Government&#146;s promise to hold a referendum on specific matters that would alter the functioning and scope of the activities of the European Union. These are matters formerly in the constitutional treaty and now in the Lisbon treaty, such as a full-time President of the European Council, barred from holding a national office; the Council becoming a formal EU institution, subject to jurisdiction of the Court; the coming into existence a Foreign Minister in all but name and an EU diplomatic service; the treaty being amendable without a formal treaty negotiation; the EU getting explicit legal personality; the Court having jurisdiction over justice and home affairs; the Charter of Fundamental Rights; and the abandonment of the veto in some 40 to 60 areas. Those are some of the matters in respect of which a referendum was promised and those are matters in respect of which a referendum is being denied.</p>

My noble friend Lord Roberts of Llandudno tells me that the Welsh question is not entirely the same as the English question. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, as a fluent Welsh speaker, will recognise that.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08052047000027"></a>Let us leave that aside for one moment, however, and address the underlying question. Is this really the treaty to end all treaties, or is it, like the Amsterdam and Nice treaties, a further amendment of the treaty of Rome, which it is therefore appropriate for Parliament to ratify?</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08052047000028"></a>We have heard a lot from Members on the Conservative Front Bench over the past six days, occasionally trying to make fun of the Liberal Democrats, often to cover what seemed to be their confusion. Some rather rambling speeches have resulted from their lack of conviction and the fact that the arguments that they have been asked to make are not ones in which they believe. We have had a Front Bench wavering between the Conservatives&#146; Eurosceptic supporters and the remaining, but distinguished and committed, Europeans on their Benches, without much guidance from their party leadership as to what their party&#146;s overall position should be. I recall that, in the ratification debates on the Amsterdam and Nice treaties, William Hague was bitterly Eurosceptic, telling us that this would lead to the immediate creation of a European army and warning of dreadful consequences if each was passed. Much more sensibly, David Cameron has avoided making his overall policy on the European Union at all clear.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08052047000029"></a>I note from <I>eurofacts</I>, that valuable source of information on the European Union, the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, telling us that this is a treaty that,</p>
<ul><a name="08052047000081"></a>&#147;will fundamentally and finally tilt the balance of power away from the nation states to the unelected Eurocracy in Brussels&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052047000030"></a>I am not quite sure whether the noble Lord, Lord Howell, agrees with that or whether he thinks that it is not entirely the case. I heard the noble Lord on a previous day say that we were playing cricket while others were looking after their own interests. I was reminded of that wonderful cartoon from, I think, 1972, which showed the other members of the European Community putting on their soccer kit and Sir Alec Douglas-Home putting on his pads&#151;the decent Englishman going into bat with these foreigners who do not understand how to play by our rules.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08052047000031"></a>We see this as an amending treaty. It is not the European constitution. There are some significant and important differences between what was originally proposed in the overhyped convention and what is in this amending treaty. Many of us, myself included, have been through ratification debates on a series of amending treaties and have listened to the likes of the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, and others telling us

They have not.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08052047000032"></a>We recognise that, as the world changes, as this country becomes increasingly tied in with its partners on the Continent and as, in a whole host of ways, our economy and our society require international co-operation, some changes need to be made. We also recognise the justification for this amending treaty. The European Union now consists of 27 member states and will, within the next five years, consist of more than 30 member states, which also will require a number of amendments. For those reasons, we on these Benches will not support this rather dishonest Conservative amendment, which, like many others, is a means of covering over the deep divisions within the Conservative ranks.</p>

It is not a treaty at all. No one could answer the referendum question in Welsh. Substituting a &#147;t&#148; for the &#147;f&#148; makes a big difference, like the one between a constitution and a treaty. Somehow or other, the Conservative Front Bench must sort this out.

I support these amendments. From UKIP&#146;s point of view, a referendum on the Lisbon treaty is second best. However, even if we were to get such a referendum and win it, it is difficult to see how we would be wholly released from our ensnarement in the project of European integration.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08052047000038"></a>Since the leaders of all three main political parties favour staying in the European Union, at any cost it would seem, it is not difficult to foresee the sort of things that would happen straight after the British people had voted down this treaty by a massive majority, as of course they would if given the chance. The first thing that would happen is that the Prime Minister would crawl off to Brussels with his tail between his legs to patch up the situation as best he could and to beg for mercy from our Eurocratic masters. He would be supported in this degrading venture by the Liberal Democrats, with, I suspect, the Conservatives making uncertain noises in the wings. None of them would say that they wanted to take the opportunity of the British people&#146;s expression of their view to leave the European Union.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08052047000039"></a>There would then be two probable ways forward. First, the Eurocrats might agree that the treaty could not go ahead without British participation and that,  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1399"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1399</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>therefore, another period of reflection was called for, as it was after the French and Dutch rejections of the constitution. The project would carry on pretty well regardless, stretching clauses in the existing treaty to a credibility achieved only by the judicial activism of the Luxembourg Court. After all, Brussels legislated 25 per cent faster after the French and Dutch rejections than it did before. The claim that the EU cannot function without this treaty, given all its new members, will prove just as deceitful this time as it did last time. Another treaty will probably be slowly cooked up. It might be more beguiling and even more confusing than this one, giving even greater scope for development after it is passed. That is one way forward.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08052047000040"></a>The other way forward is that a special protocol will somehow be cooked up to accommodate the wishes of the surly and ungrateful British people. The other countries will go ahead with the treaty. Over time, the judgments of the Court will wear us down piecemeal and we will gradually be wholly devoured by the corrupt octopus. Members of the Committee who are nervous of a referendum on the Lisbon treaty, because they fear that it might lead to our early departure from the European Union, may relax. That will not happen, which is why we say that a referendum on Lisbon is second best and why we want a referendum on whether we stay in or leave the European Union. I shall speak to that liberating prospect under Amendment No. 167A.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08052047000041"></a>Of course, a referendum on Lisbon would be better than nothing. From our point of view, it would have two great advantages. First, the campaign would at last enlighten the British people as to the true extent of their entrapment in this project of European integration. It would enlighten them as to its colossal economic cost and the burdens that it places on them in their trade with the great wide world outside the sclerotic European economy. That would be a step in the right direction. Secondly, in spite of the fact that the project would somehow struggle on, the UK&#146;s rejection of the treaty might cause a genuine debate in Brussels, from which some genuine reform might emerge. Brussels might even be forced to revisit the laudable aim of the Laeken declaration of bringing Europe closer to the people, whereas the constitution that emerged from that declaration and this treaty, which mirrors it precisely, go in the opposite direction.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08052047000042"></a>I fear that this beast in Brussels is not that sort of animal. An octopus does not easily become a dolphin, but it might, just a little bit. Anyway, the confusion would be another step in the right direction. I support the amendment.</p>

The nub of the Government&#146;s dilemma comes down to whether the treaty of Lisbon is, in effect, the same as the constitutional treaty on which they promised a referendum. I must return to the point that has been made repeatedly; namely, that the two differ because the Lisbon treaty, it is claimed, is an amending treaty and the constitutional treaty was not. However, the  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1400"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1400</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>constitutional treaty was just as much an amending treaty as the Lisbon treaty is, because they both would make amendments to the existing treaty text.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08052047000044"></a>When the constitutional treaty was published, the Government made it clear that most of its text was the same as that of the existing treaties but was published with the amendments incorporated in it. To claim that the Lisbon treaty is different because the treaty only lists the amendments is to play with words. You have to look at the text side by side once the amendments have been included. Amendments were incorporated in the constitutional treaty and amendments have been incorporated in the Lisbon treaty. The two texts both have amendments incorporated. That is what we need to concentrate on.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08052047000045"></a>At an earlier stage, I made the claim that, having looked at the two texts side by side, I could find only two articles in the constitutional text that were not reproduced in whole or in part in the Lisbon consolidated text. The Leader of the House kindly wrote to me following that. While she declined to provide her own analysis, she attached analysis of the two texts by Professor Steve Peers for Statewatch. The analysis that she provided lists 35 differences between the constitutional text and the Lisbon text. That is of itself interesting; it gets us to the ground where we can at least talk about those individual differences and how significant they are. Many of them are insignificant. If anything, the analysis reinforces the point that, if we are now able to compare the two texts and look at the differences, as the Minister has invited me to do, we see that those differences are minor.</p>

<a name="80520-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08052047000046"></a>What is more significant is that, as I go through the 35 differences provided to me, I can find only two articles in the constitutional text that are not reproduced in whole or in part in the Lisbon text. I wrote to the Minister on 8 May to make that point. On the basis of the information that she has provided me, is she prepared to accept that? If she accepts it, as I think she must, surely it fundamentally blows away the argument that these texts are different in kind or in substance. The differences can be reduced to a small list and few of them have any significant effect.</p>

I have discerned that, whatever happens in the referendum, it will be decided not because of the content of either treaty, but because of the popularity or lack of it of Brian Cowen&#146;s Government and any resentment or lack of it towards the enlargement of Europe involving eastern Europe. It will be a referendum not on the treaty but on wider political considerations. It is uncertain which way the referendum will go but it will not at all be a barometer of support for the matters now being debated. I very much regret that it was ever decided to make a promise about a referendum and that in order to change policy all three parties, to some extent, are having to walk upon their hands. But the main thing is the merits rather than the legalistic arguments of the kind that we sometimes hear.</p>

The reality is that over the past 10 years, with the use of programming&#151;particularly, in the context of this Bill&#151;Members of Parliament have not been given adequate time to fulfil the function they ought to do. Therefore, given the way in which this Bill has been treated in another place, there is a strong argument&#151;regardless of whatever view one may take about whether the constitution is the same as the treaty and so on&#151;for giving the public an opportunity to express a view which has not been reflected adequately in another place because of the way in which the Government have inhibited debate.</p>

Those previous treaties neither replaced nor repealed their predecessors&#151;and that is the fundamental difference between the Lisbon treaty and the rejected constitutional treaty. That is what makes the difference and that is why going back to a promise made in regard to a constitutional treaty does not wash when we are now debating the rightness or wrongness of a referendum. The constitutional treaty would have done something quite different to what this treaty does in constitutional terms for all of us.</p>

I cannot imagine why anyone else in this House, other than his noble friend opposite and the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, would wish to go on that journey with him, even for a step in the right direction.

This is a totally non-partisan, non-party body of eminent lawyers and others which gives advice to the Dutch Parliament and the Dutch Government. What it states is not a textual analysis saying that there are six changes, 12 changes or 14 changes, but that the whole nature of the constitutional treaty&#151;this is the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Symons&#151;was completely different from the Lisbon treaty. Its thrust and intention were totally different and that is why the two are not the same. It is not based on the numbers of dots and commas that have or have not been changed. I doubt that we shall ever get closure on this but I wish one or two people might read that opinion. It is only 15 pages long and it is quite cogent. It may not convince everyone but it is really quite cogent.</p>

It is one which we are having here today and, despite having been called a bureaucrat 13 years after I ceased to be one, I have no hesitation in stating that, in my view, there is no foundation whatever for arguing that a decision on a document such as this, which consists of several hundred pages of complex prose, is democratically more legitimate if it is submitted to a referendum than if it is voted on in

The arguments for going ahead with parliamentary ratification and for not accepting the amendment are extremely powerful. Moreover, when we have tried a referendum in this country we were told at the time that it was going to clear the air and finish the argument for ever. I wish it had. But it has not, of course, and the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, and many of his friends are determined that it never shall. We should have no illusions about going down the referendum route; it would be damaging. It is less good and less democratically legitimate than, after very full scrutiny&#151;with seven days in Committee and several days on Report to come&#151;taking a decision in this House which does not involve a referendum.</p>

At the end of the day&#151;this is a point made in the previous debate by the noble Lord, Lord Brittan&#151;we are a parliamentary democracy and I respect the right of the Government to decide to bring the treaty for parliamentary ratification.

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08052053000002"></a>Opinion polls and other ways of determining popular opinion show quite a strong undercurrent against membership of the European Union or, at least, against certain consequences of our membership. In the months and years to come that should be addressed very seriously; otherwise, the fact that we have not had a referendum will be a running sore. There is a place for referendums in a democracy&#151;I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Brittan, would agree with this&#151;and there have been referendums on other occasions: in either 1975 or 1976; there will be one in Scotland apparently over the question of whether the union should continue; and there was one in Wales some years ago on whether pubs should open on a Sunday, which was obviously a matter of deep constitutional importance and came to a sensible conclusion. I am told by Government representatives that if there was a proposal to change the voting system for Parliament, for example, that might very properly be put in a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08052053000003"></a>The problem underlying the popular hostility to Parliament and to the European Union is, to a degree, a lack of confidence in politicians. That is partly the way in which politics is reported from the other place. I say in parenthesis that in my five or six years as a Member of this House I have observed a slight deterioration in standards. Earlier in the debate we  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1405"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1405</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>had a suggestion that somebody had contempt for the people and there was a reference to childish debating points. I wonder whether these ways of expressing ourselves are the best way forward. At Question Time I often hear people shouting to get in rather than allowing the natural process to determine who should speak. There are real issues about how politics is conducted which I hope we will attend to.</p>

<a name="80520-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08052053000004"></a>I often go back to Lord Hailsham&#146;s Dimbleby lecture 20 years ago where he spoke about the emergence in our country of what he called an &#147;elective dictatorship&#148;. The Committee stage of this Bill is not the time to go into that in detail but one could instance all sorts of ways in which that prophecy, when there was a Conservative Government, has come true. For example, the absence of free votes on questions where there ought to be free votes and the tendency for decisions to be made by the elected Government who do not take enough account of other institutions in our society. A democracy requires both elected representatives and strong institutions which the Executive know to defer to and to consult. In the years to come, although we may not have a referendum on this question, there are profound questions about how our democracy works and, unless they are attended to, there will be further calls for a referendum.</p>

<a name="80520-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08052053000005"></a>On the substance of the question, my impression is that the European Union is going less in the direction of a superstate than it used to be, partly as a consequence of expanded membership. One hardly ever hears today the mantra &#147;ever-closer union&#148;; that seems to have been quietly dropped. The treaty of Lisbon seems to be largely a response to the fact that the Union has grown so large. In many ways it has a more intrinsic recognition of the nation states within than previously might have been assumed to be the case.</p>

<a name="80520-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08052053000006"></a>There is a cumulative effect from having the different treaties over the years. If I felt that the treaty of Lisbon really was doing what the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, who is no longer in her place, was saying just now, I would come down narrowly on the side of going for a referendum, even in the face of the Government&#146;s opposition. In view of what she and others&#151;I refer to the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay&#151;have said, I come narrowly down on the view that we should not try to force a referendum on the country. It would be deeply damaging and in practice it would be a very difficult process to see through. There are, however, profound issues that underlie the reason why the Prime Minister and other party leaders gave that assurance foolishly at the last election. If we do not attend to these issues in the years to come we will find that this question will come back to us again.</p>

Ireland in fact had two referendums. The first referendum was on the approval or otherwise of the constitutional treaty and that was lost. The second referendum had two questions that were locked together. The first question was the same as had occurred in the first referendum; the second question was, &#147;Do you believe that Ireland should continue its

He said certain things that have not been said by anybody else about the problem of connecting with the people; he also said that the Government&#151;the Labour Party in this case&#151;and maybe the Liberal Democrats are doing themselves short-term damage. This is very important. It may well be that the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats are doing themselves some short-term damage but why are they doing it? They are doing it because they think the strategic position of this country demands that we stay and play a very active part in the European Union. What is on the table is an incremental treaty&#151;I do not know what other word would make some people happier or more afraid; it involves incrementalism. Although the treaty cannot be held responsible for this, we have seen, in the last year alone, several issues&#151;Russia and energy policy through problems of justice and home affairs to migration and so on&#151;in which it has become increasingly apparent that we need an extension of co-operation, of QMV and so on.</p>

<a name="80520-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08052053000009"></a>The question therefore becomes, &#147;Is this something in a parliamentary democracy that is easy to judge by referendum?&#148;. I echo my noble friend Lord Tomlinson in saying that I thought that the Prime Minister made the wrong decision four or five years ago to go for a referendum. He was perhaps on better terms with Rupert Murdoch at that time. The substantive reason is that if we look at the sort of campaign that we would run on a referendum it would be a xenophobic, one-sided, misrepresentation of what is happening in Europe. That would not enhance the value of parliamentary democracy and it would be a mad example of a reversion to populism such as would have been associated with a referendum in 1953 on capital punishment.</p>

<a name="80520-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08052053000010"></a>Parliamentary democracy requires a lot of things to make it work. It requires some balance of different priorities on expenditure along with the budget. It requires a balance between freedom of speech&#151;as we were discussing the other day&#151;and not allowing people freely to intimidate other people in the community. Every day of the week we have to get these things right through parliamentary democracy. If we allowed this to go forward this time and said, &#147;This is how we operate parliamentary democracy in this country&#148;, it would be a precedent that would come back to haunt us. Certainly we have to make the case; certainly on doorsteps there may be an issue at the moment because of a Pavlovian reaction to the question, &#147;What happened to our referendum?&#148;. That is where the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, is coming from; he wants to get out of the whole thing. That is not my paranoia; it is what the noble Lord has just said, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, pointed out. That is why I believe that we should stand up for parliamentary democracy.</p>

Conservatives know that they cannot deliver the manifesto that they will cobble together on this topic, so where does that leave the sanctity of manifestos? As a trade union-oriented Member of the House, I point out that the Conservative Party is opposing the temporary and agency workers proposals.

We do not make our laws in isolation. I agree that it is difficult to explain that in a pub in Burton on Trent, but that is separate from the question that we are being asked to consider tonight.

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08052056000006"></a>We were totally opposed to referenda; suddenly the Conservative Party is saying that they are a good thing. I think that they are a complete and utter waste of time unless you have consulted the people. There are many ways of consulting, such as an election. What a stupid thing to do&#151;we nearly had an election before Christmas. I am a bit worried about the right reverend Prelate because something will be happening in his patch fairly shortly; I wondered whether he was making a political speech, but I am sure that he was not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08052056000007"></a>My view is fairly simple. I have spent my life working in and around the EU, but I have always fought and competed with it; I have never colluded. I always thought that treaties were about making peace. I hate all this bureaucracy and these pieces of paper that nobody understands. If you asked the electorate tomorrow what this is all about, they would probably sound a little like the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, and say that it is about surrendering power. I have always regarded things as an opportunity. I worry now that the Government may not have consulted and do not know what they should consult about. I have a feeling that, within the bones of the country, there would be opposition to what is proposed if people knew what that was.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08052056000008"></a>I believe in elected representatives. Roughly 106,000 people in this country are elected representatives, from parish councils through to regional councils and various other bodies. I rang various associations today to ask which of them had been consulted on this. The answer was none. Perhaps we are democratic. Then I thought, &#147;I am one of the elected ones in this place, so perhaps that takes the number up by another 92&#148;. But I am still not sure how I can equate my feeling that referenda are wrong with my feeling that the Government have not consulted. I do not believe that the Government are with it at the moment. I wish them well, but sometimes there are things that you can do from within and sometimes you can do them from without.</p>

I welcome the amendment, but it surprises me that the noble Lord, Lord Lea, is so negative about referendums. He seems to think&#151;in common, perhaps, with the noble Lord, Lord Hannay&#151;that the people do not really understand the issue and cannot be trusted to make their mind up. He said that the campaign would be xenophobic and one-sided. That is not true. Both sides have an equal chance to put their case under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. It is all set down in statute. It will be a perfectly open and reasonable debate, so I really cannot accept that it would be either one-sided or too complicated for people to understand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08052056000010"></a>Nor can I accept the notion that the French were not voting on the issues before them. I, too, was in France during the referendum and it was interesting to see the various reasons. There were agreements among various parties, but that is the beauty of referendums; they bring people together on a single issue. There was no doubt that they voted against the constitution; they were not voting about the colour of Mr Chirac&#146;s socks or anything else. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, was quite right: a few days later, the Dutch voted overwhelmingly against the constitution. I do not think that they could be criticised for voting on something that was not in the constitution. They definitely voted against the constitution. I do not think that it is right to say that we dare not trust the people of this country with the issues arising from the constitution or from this reform treaty, which, as has been pointed out, is the same as the constitution.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08052056000011"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Pearson that this is a very good first step but a first step only. If the people of this country are given the vote on a referendum&#151;and the opinion polls tell us that they will certainly reject the treaty&#151;we are still left with what we have got, which is where the EU is right now. We have a lot of experts here, and the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, will tell me if I am wrong, but that means that we would have to fall back on the provisions set out in the Nice treaty. That is how the EU is operating at the moment. From the point of view of those of us who believe that we would be better off out of the EU, we would still have the acquis communautaire, we would still have the Commission as sole legislator, telling us what we can grow on our land and what we can fish out of our seas, and we would still be paying the EU &#163;14 billion a year of our taxpayers&#146; money. That would be the position even if the treaty were put to a referendum.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08052056000012"></a>It would be wonderful to have such a referendum. It may be liberating and it may, as my noble friend said, wake people up if they have an open debate about our relationship with the European Union. But it may not. They may say, &#147;Is this right? Are we going down the right road here towards further integration? Is it what we really want?&#148;. They have not been consulted on our relationship with the European Union for many years&#151;the last time was the 1975 referendum. So it would be an open debate. I do not see why noble Lords are frightened of having open debate in the country about our relationship with the European Union; it must be healthier to do that. As far as it goes, I strongly support the amendment and I hope that, if it comes to a vote tonight, it will be carried.</p>

I feared that there would be nothing new, as we have already touched on so many of the issues, not least in the extensive Second Reading debate, through Oral Questions that I have answered and through a number of debates since. In particular, on the first day in Committee, we scanned the horizon of lots of issues that were to be debated again. I do not intend to take noble Lords&#146; time by repeating what has been said in the debate tonight or previously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08052056000014"></a>Having feared that there would be nothing new, I did not bank on the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, and his contribution on the Welsh language. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, will take that on board. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts; it is nice to see him in his place. Also, the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, described in an interesting way his desire to see a referendum because of the use of programme Motions. The Labour Government did not invent those changes in the House of Commons. The noble Lord may feel that they have been extended, but your Lordships will know that timetabling Motions have been around for some time.</p>

Previously, if progress needed to be made on a Bill, for reasons of urgency or to avoid filibustering, there had to be a half-day debate to justify that. That was completely different from the automatic programming of everything that goes through.</p>

<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="08052056000016"></a><a name="80520-0010.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80520-0010.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08052056000037"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> I do not accept that it is completely different, although I accept that it is different. My point is that it is not new to have timetabling in the House of Commons. The noble Lord believes that this is substantially different. That is his view, which is absolutely fine. However, in your Lordships&#146; House we do not have that impediment to our deliberations. Some noble Lords may on occasion wish that we did, but I am not one of those.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08052056000017"></a>We began by looking at what the constitution sought to do. My noble friend Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean set out clearly in a superb speech what a constitution is. Noble Lords who recall questions that I have answered in your Lordships&#146; House about a constitution will know that the fundamental essence of a constitution is, as my noble friend said, that everything that went before disappears and that it is a statement, as well as a fact, that we have created something new that is of deep and enormous significance. Some noble Lords may disagree with the decision that was taken but, rightly or wrongly, the Government decided that, because this was legally unprecedented&#151;not just a new phenomenon but also a substantially different approach&#151;there should be a referendum.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08052056000018"></a>Noble Lords know what happened only too well. We have discussed what happened in the Netherlands and in France and what was subsequently determined by the Council. The constitution was withdrawn. It is defunct; it is no more. We will get into the dead parrot sketch with amazing ease if I continue with that. Instead, after some deliberations and delay, what came and now sits before your Lordships&#146; House is a treaty that is reminiscent of treaties that have gone before. It is, as my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall said, an incremental treaty. That is the fundamental difference between the constitution and the reform treaty.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08052056000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, wrote to me on 8 May, as he said. I was grateful for the letter. I have not formally replied to him yet, but I will. When we look at the letter, we will see that the substantive point is that this is a fundamentally different proposition:  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1411"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1411</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the reform treaty is not the constitution. The noble Lord is, slightly uncharacteristically, somewhat selective in the examples that he uses to define what is new and different. For example, to leave out the opt-out on criminal justice in comparing the two treaties is to overlook something fundamentally different. However, the noble Lord is at liberty to disagree completely with me.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08052056000020"></a>Noble Lords have talked about other countries. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, prayed in aid a number of quotations from European leaders. Noble Lords will know that in my speeches I refer only to statements made either here or in another place or to the work of committees. That is simply because I have 50 A4 sides of quotations and I am sure that other noble Lords have the same number. We could bandy them around all day, but it does not necessarily help us.</p>

<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="08052056000021"></a><a name="80520-0010.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80520-0010.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08052056000038"></a>Lord Pearson of Rannoch:</b> Would it be helpful if the Minister were to write to those who have been involved and send those 50 sides of foolscap with these quotations that go against the quotations used by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart? That might be helpful.</p>

<a name="08052056000022"></a><a name="80520-0010.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80520-0010.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08052056000039"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> It was A4, not foolscap. But no, it would not be of benefit. The noble Lord can find them; I am sure that they are scattered among the literature that he has in any event. I am afraid that we are all in danger of selectivity in our quotations and I do not think that they help. What matters are the deliberations on the Floor of your Lordships&#146; House and the work that is done in this Parliament. That is why I have stuck, as far as I possibly can, to that.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08052056000023"></a>However, there is one fact that I wish to throw into this equation. Noble Lords who have used quotations&#151;particularly the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart&#151;from European leaders have said, &#147;You see, that proves it. These people have said that it is the same&#148;. But they&#151;I believe there are nine countries&#151;would have had referendums on the constitutional treaty. Poland, Portugal, Denmark, Spain, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg did. If this was substantively or exactly the same, they would have had a referendum on it. But they did not. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, may quote selectively from the words of European leaders, but the proof of the pudding is that, had they believed that this was exactly the same, there would have been a referendum. The only country that is having a referendum is Ireland. That is for constitutional reasons that nobody in your Lordships&#146; House has disputed, as far as I am aware.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08052056000026"></a>The Government believe, for the reasons that I have given, that the treaty is fundamentally different. I understand why noble Lords will not agree with that politically. There are those who believe that we should not have a referendum whatever happens, which is a perfectly reasonable position to hold. There are those who believe that anything that has the words &#147;European Union&#148; attached to it should in any event be opposed and that Britain should be &#147;liberated&#148;, which I think is the word that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, would use. There are those who genuinely think that the treaties are the same. Sometimes there may be a bit of political expediency lurking in the undergrowth. Those are the different reasons. I do not think that I am standing here and convincing anybody, because we have been debating the undercurrent of this for weeks. I have a suspicion that noble Lords are pretty clear in their own minds.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08052056000027"></a>The same is true of referendums. Some people think that they are a good idea, because the people get to choose in a particular way and get the chance to debate, as do political parties. There are those who think that referendums are a bad idea, because making these decisions should be the role of democratically elected representatives in fulfilling their obligations to the people who put them here and who pay them to fulfil that role. There are also those who say that is difficult to have in a referendum a question that makes sense. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, spoke about his next-door neighbour in France, who found it difficult to read through such a lengthy and complicated document and make up his mind without the benefit of much more information. That is reasonable, too. A little bit of political expediency is in there, too, because it is sometimes useful to want a referendum for other reasons.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08052056000028"></a>The position of the Government is clear; we know exactly where they stand. We know exactly where the Liberal Democrats stand. I am still a little confused about where the Conservative Party will be post-ratification. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, will kill off once and for all&#151;because it has been lurking in the undergrowth&#151;the question whether the Conservative Party would accept ratification, because many of its members have a long history and tradition of support for and work in the European Union and I pay tribute to them. I will leave that for the noble Lord to address.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08052056000029"></a>The amendment should be withdrawn. We have before us an important treaty that will help 27 member states to collaborate and work more effectively in the European Union. More important, it is time that we moved to ratify this treaty so that we can get on with the business of Europe, where there is much to do to support our citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08052061000003"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, whose robust interventions I always enjoy, said that I was embarrassed by the evidence. But we are not flying in the face of that at all, because authority after authority&#151;the Dutch state council excepted&#151;has said the obvious; that is, that the treaty is a replica. I am a little embarrassed at hearing the contortions of people whom I greatly admire and even befriend in trying to tell us that black is white. Contrary to some people&#146;s impressions, I can read, and I have read this treaty and the previous treaty; I even had a dip into the Dutch state council&#146;s efforts. I have read a lot of other things as well&#151;there are so many piles of documents that one would need a wheelbarrow to bring them into this Chamber. They all state that the sentences are the same. It is very difficult to be told by people whom one respects that they are different. We think that they are the same; we think that there was a promise; we think, as my noble friend Lord Waddington robustly said, that it is the role of your Lordships&#146; House to respect the manifestos of parties and see that they are not departed from, or try to do so in accordance with the Salisbury convention.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08052061000004"></a>I am not sure that the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, was implying it, but we do not think that it is the treaty to end all treaties&#151;on the contrary. Although the Prime Minister seemed to imply that it might be and that there would be no other institutional reform, it is perfectly obvious that there will be more institutional reform if the Bill and the treaty go through following all the passerelle provisions which we have debated and will do so again. Beyond that, there will also be other treaties. People are already talking about others to take Europe forward, backwards, sideways or whichever way one views it. Let us leave aside the earthquake effects&#151;I admit that it is a decade or so away&#151;of Turkey joining the European Union and succeeding Germany as its most populous country. Huge changes are ahead, and huge opportunities will arise for wise people with a clear vision of the kind of regional Union that Europe should be, of its wider role and of what part we should play in it to make an effective contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08052061000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, was absolutely right. I can stand here only as an ersatz Welshman. Someone once told me with glorious exaggeration that I was descended from the kings of Wales, but I cannot speak a word of the Welsh language. I felt very small in being put in my place by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, for getting a word wrong. I assure him that we will get that word right on Report and all further stages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08052061000006"></a>Overall, the difficulty for some of us, and the hardest thing to accept, is that we know that the treaty is a trick. We know that because so many of the European leaders&#151;I am not going to quote them&#151;have said it is a trick. The proof-of-the-pudding argument which the noble Baroness put forward just does not work. The reason other countries are not having referenda is precisely as the leaders of Europe have explained, because they have succeeded in making the treaty unintelligible and wrapping it up differently. Therefore, &#147;This time it&#146;ll be all right. We&#146;ll get by without a referendum&#148;. That is exactly what they have all said. It

They are able to wrap it up in various ways so that it is not intelligible and does not look like the previous treaty.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08052061000007"></a>It has been asked how much one should use referenda to consult people in the modern times. They are tricky instruments. They should be used with the greatest care. But I think that there is a sort of failure to understand in some people&#146;s minds, and in the minds of those who appear to be patronising about the &#147;complexity&#148; of the issue and the difficulties of consulting people today, that we are living in the internet age. We have had an information technology revolution. It is possible to mobilise 1 million signatures in an afternoon through an internet flash constituency or some other device. We are living in an interactive age where, night after night, the television tells you that you can speak back to what is coming out of the television set. This just is not the age when one could say in court, &#147;My Lords, in the hills of Connemara they think of nothing else&#148;, and get a good laugh. You cannot do that any more, because in the hills of Connemara now they are probably fully wired up with mobile telephones and interactive technology and they are all on the world websites discussing these issues in great detail, not only in Ireland but in England and across the whole of Europe and other continents as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08052061000010"></a>I was going to say, finally, that&#151;we must be frank&#151;the reason why our views do not meet with each other is that there are much deeper feelings behind all this. The noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, always teases us, the Conservatives, by saying that we do not have any views about Europe. As a matter of fact, over the past 10 years of opposition my party has toiled away with all sorts of ideas and developments. I have written here that &#147;my filing cabinet is full of plans for exactly

The Liberal Democrats may laugh. They can keep their doors open because there is nothing inside that anyone would want to steal.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08052061000011"></a>The answer is that we have an enormous range of ideas. Obviously, they are not finalised to the precise moment because, as far as I know, unless the Prime Minister decides, we are not about to have an election, alas. After the Maastricht treaty we did have an election, and an offer for a referendum on the euro as well. If the offer now is to have an election, then our pressures for a referendum probably would greatly reduce. But that is not on offer as far as I know. We would be very happy to have that, but I do not think that that is what is proposed. I suspect that we are not going to see an election for another two years or so.</p>

<a name="80520-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08052061000012"></a>Instead, we say that the people should have their say. That is what was promised. That would uphold the dignity of Parliament, and perhaps restore the trust in Parliament as a whole as well as possibly the trust in the Government&#146;s position, which does not look terribly healthy at the moment. That is why we have put forward this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08052061000021"></a>For the third time lucky. As far as I can see, but it is a swiftly moving target, it is also the policy of the Liberal Democrat Party. So it is an unusual pleasure to be teamed up with it, for a change. I gather that its leader, Mr Clegg, flounced out of the Commons when he was not allowed to debate this amendment, which he supported, there.</p>

<a name="80520-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08052061000022"></a>I happened to hear Mr Clegg confirming this happy state of affairs on the &#147;Today&#148; programme at 8.12 am on the morning of 25 April this year. I fear it is worth quoting the relevant extract. Mr Clegg had just finished saying that he had always brought to politics,</p>
<ul><a name="08052061000110"></a>&#147;energy, authenticity and a great deal of energy and enthusiasm&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08052061000090"></a>&#151;that was his repetition. He was being interviewed by John Humphrys, who is worth quoting:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="08052061000105"></a>&#147;Authenticity&#151;in terms of Europe, you have a strong position on Europe, or all Liberal Democrats should have a strong position on Europe, clearly it&#146;s an important issue for you and your party, and you are meant to have a clear position. But you fudged it over the one important debate that there was in the House of Commons, that&#146;s to say the referendum debate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052061000091"></a>To which Mr Clegg replied,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08052061000106"></a>&#147;The positional we took was that the referendum, which we wanted to see take place, was a referendum on the big question about Europe, which is whether we stay in or out. What we disagreed with, as the party, was the Conservative proposal to have a referendum&#151;a very narrow referendum&#151;only on this Lisbon Treaty. And even if the Tories had got their way and there was a referendum, it had then been rejected, it wouldn&#146;t have changed a thing to the way in which the European Union is presently organised. So we wanted the serious debate on the underlying issue, the underlying angst, if you like, in the European issue. We were thwarted in our attempt to even have that debate in the House of Commons, we made our ... I made my sort of, you know, frustration about that perfectly plain&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052061000092"></a>By which I think he was referring to walking out of the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08052061000026"></a>That leaves us with the Conservatives, who I fear will oppose this amendment. One of their problems is their belief that William Hague lost a general election because he indulged in &#147;too much Europe&#148;; in other words he played the European card. I have to put it to my erstwhile Conservative friends that he did not. He played the currency card. He said that the election was a last minute referendum on our membership of the currency. That was not so because everyone knew by then that we were going to get a referendum on the currency. So I dispute the fact that William Hague played the Europe card.</p>

<a name="80520-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08052061000027"></a>To be very charitable to my old friends, I think their continued affection for our membership of the European Union may stem from base ignorance, an ignorance inspired no doubt by their guilt at having led us into this quagmire in the first place back in 1972. So I have another quote for your Lordships, this time from the leader of the Conservative Party, Mr David Cameron. He was attending a public meeting on 17 April in Leeds, organised by the <I>Yorkshire Post</I>. The meeting went on for one and a quarter hours but only one question, to Mr Cameron, was applauded by the audience. The question went as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="08052061000107"></a>&#147;Why would you rather be in Europe rather than govern? Why don&#146;t you want a landslide victory that that policy would give you?&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052061000093"></a>that is, governing and not being enslaved to the European Union. Mr Cameron&#146;s answer is enlightening:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="08052061000108"></a>&#147;The vast majority of the British people want to stay in the EU. From the very next day&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052061000094"></a>after we left&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08052061000111"></a>&#147;our businesses will flounder and be unable to export to the European Union&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052061000095"></a>I assume that Mr Cameron believes that. If so, it shows a degree of ignorance about our relationship with the European Union which can only be described as oceanic.</p>

<a name="80520-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08052061000028"></a>As my noble friends and I have pointed out to your Lordships many times over recent years, the United Kingdom is the EU&#146;s largest client. We buy far more from them than they do from us. I will not go into it all again now, but even the most pessimistic analysis carried out over the past 10 years concludes that leaving the political construct of the European Union and continuing in free trade and firm collaboration with our good friends in Europe would be at the very worst trade-neutral&#151;and, therefore, jobs-neutral. In fact, our business would be set free from Brussels over-regulation, which is put at some 6 per cent of the&#151;</p>

Indeed, Norway and the European Union live in a free trade relationship, but it is not the case that Norway is free from what the noble Lord calls Brussels regulation. Instead of participating in making the regulations, which we do as a member, the Norwegians get theirs by fax machine. They are sent from Brussels and they have to adopt them&#151;otherwise, as the noble Lord will see if he studies the European economic area agreement,

So would the noble Lord please not perpetrate the untruth that, if we came out, we would be free of the regulation of Brussels and free to have free trade with the European Union? We would have to put one or the other at risk&#151;and it would be more honest if he were to admit that.</p>

We do not advocate that the United Kingdom would stay in the European economic area, either; we would prefer a position akin to Switzerland&#146;s. As a matter of fact, because we are the EU&#146;s largest client&#151;the EU exports some 18 per cent of its GDP to the United Kingdom and only 16 per cent to the United States of America, which is second&#151;and because we would continue to be very friendly with the EU, we could do as good or better a deal than the Swiss.

Why would the Germans stop selling us motor cars? Would the French stop selling us wine? Just because the politicians are allowed to carry on with their crazy project in Brussels and we are set free to benefit from the new global position, that would not stop a single item of trade between us and the European Union. In fact, nobody trades with the European Union&#151;except, possibly, the Mafia. We all have our trade with individual clients in the individual countries of the European Union. Personally, I trade with every one of them, and I know that none of that trade would be affected if we left the unfortunate political arrangements of the European Union.</p>

Last year, great swathes of this country suffered considerable flooding. I live and farm near Brize Norton, which suffered some of the highest recorded rainfall in the UK. Our river rose around 15 feet in little over five hours, causing much damage to local homes and infrastructure. Indeed, a month&#146;s worth of rain fell in just 24 hours in some places in the UK. The UK flood statistics show that five people died, 600 were injured, 3,500 people were rescued, 27,000 houses were flooded, 6,710 of these households by March this year were still displaced, 5,000 businesses were flooded, 858 schools were damaged, and 42,000 hectares of agricultural land were flooded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08052061000042"></a>The fire brigade&#146;s rescue efforts were described as the biggest in peacetime Britain. These floods led to the biggest loss of critical infrastructure since World War II. Ministerial estimates last August put the cost of the flood damage at &#163;2.7 billion. The insurance industry has concerns that this is not a one-off but a worsening trend. Claims in the UK for storm and flood damage in the five years up to 2003 were &#163;6.2 billion, double the figure for the previous five years, and it is estimated that these costs could triple by 2050.</p>

A further four planning applications have been called in under the direction where flooding was a main issue. Yet in 2005, 21 major planning applications were approved against the Environment Agency&#146;s guidance. Further, a proportion of the 3 million houses talked about in the Government&#146;s July 2006 housing Green Paper will be built on flood plains, notably in the Thames Gateway. It is laughable, but it is true. I understand that the Government&#146;s stated policy is to avoid inappropriate development in flood-risk areas. Has that policy changed?</p>

<a name="80520-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08052061000044"></a>The Environment Agency is responsible for strategic overview of all flood and coastal erosion risk management, and, as of January this year, the inland flooding role was still being developed. The management of large rivers and areas of low-lying coastline are its responsibility. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Defra, delegates to the EA the management of rivers in the interest of wildlife and having regard to flooding. There is limited clarity on what course should be taken when the needs of wildlife conflict directly with the interests of human communities. I wonder if those 27,000 home owners who were flooded out believe that the EA has the balance correct. They could be forgiven for thinking that the needs of wildlife come before humans.</p>

<a name="80520-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08052061000045"></a>Those of us who are riparian owners, or who take an interest in the management of our rivers, cannot fail to observe that our rivers have become clogged up and ill tended in recent years. In its time the National Rivers Authority, the NRA, kept the drainage system of our land&#151;its rivers&#151;in good repair.</p>

<a name="80520-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08052061000046"></a>Ministers have asserted that the EA will undertake prioritised programmes of maintenance work on watercourses, including cleaning and dredging where appropriate, but that responsibility otherwise rests with the individual landowner. For each urban stream there could easily be 200 riparian owners. Rural rivers too have multiple riparian owners, making inadequate the effective and overall management of a stream or a river. Speaking as a riparian owner, I doubt that most owners have the ability or finance to carry out their responsibilities. I hope that the Minister will commit to review the arrangements and to address this problem.</p>

<a name="80520-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08052061000047"></a>The Environment Agency estimates that it will have spent &#163;65 million in support of flood-risk management in the last financial year. In the current financial year some &#163;439 million has been allocated to the EA for flood-risk management, and a further &#163;21 million to local authorities and internal drainage boards for capital improvement projects to reduce flood risk. I understand that other funding is available from the Department for Communities and Local Government for non-capital flood-risk management activities and from Defra to local authorities for capital projects to reduce the risk of coastal erosion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08052061000050"></a>Not surprisingly, the National Audit Office report of June 2007 found that the proportion of the flood-defence structures in good condition was just 57 per cent, down from 61 per cent six years previously. It also took the view that the agency could reduce the need for additional funding by improving cost effectiveness. Fundamentally, there are legitimate questions to be asked about how the money is spent and what the appropriate regulatory architecture should be.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="08052061000109"></a>&#147;Following the summer 2007 floods the Environment Agency continued to carry out feasibility studies to consider the viability of proposed new flood defence schemes, which look to reduce flood risk where it is cost-effective, practical and environmentally appropriate&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 18/2/08; col. 267W-68W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052061000096"></a>It is disappointing that there is so much head-scratching going on and little action at this time. Will the Minister say what action is taking place to mitigate future floods?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08052061000052"></a>Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s interim report contained 72 recommendations, of which 15 were considered urgent for action by the Government, their agencies and others to take. Will the Minister provide an update on those 15 urgent actions and on the estimated cost of those 72 recommendations? Will the &#163;34.5 million to fund the work arising from the review announced by the Secretary of State in the ministerial Statement of 4 February 2008 really be sufficient?</p>

<a name="80520-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08052061000053"></a>Further to this, the Pitt review&#146;s interim conclusions found a number of surprising failings, including no national flood emergency plan, no clear responsibility for dealing with urban flooding, and no systematic stockpiling of emergency equipment, such as boats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08052061000054"></a>By any definition, last year&#146;s floods were a major disaster for a great many people. A significant proportion of the blame has been attached to the Environment Agency. But how much blame should be apportioned to the Government for designing these muddled and conflicting structures that are responsible for looking after the UK&#146;s inland rivers? One thing is certain: the impact on public confidence is predictable, and the situation is unsatisfactory.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08052061000056"></a>My own interest in this subject was stimulated when I was director of the Met Office and I visited some Chinese villages which are regularly flooded. They recover and are flooded again. We can learn some things from that. I am also a visiting professor at Delft. In the Netherlands they have some radical ideas. It is surprising that the House of Commons committee went to France but did not visit and hear about these quite radical ideas emerging from the Netherlands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08052061000057"></a>All these areas of Europe of course will be subject to the changing climate that we now expect. Not only will there be intense rain events, but it is likely that we may have the sort of blocking conditions such as they had in the United States in the 1990s when you have many days of persistent rain, which of course will lead to serious consequences.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08052061000058"></a>The first point to make is that the Environment Agency&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Young, I am sure will explain this&#151;is not widely understood in the UK. It changed its policy from flood defence to flood-risk management. I was interviewed by Canadian television and asked if this really was the policy. I went to a government department in Whitehall&#151;Communities and Local Government&#151;just a few months ago and many of its officials were unaware of this change, which was surprising because of course it has a very important implication: that there will be floods, and that we have to design our houses, roads and infrastructure for floods. Therefore, we need to have a completely different approach. Building regulations, the community warning systems and the telephone systems will have to be in that form. This is a major change to how communities and individuals need to think about their houses.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08052061000059"></a>I attended a meeting last year of CABE, which is an organisation considering buildings and design. A distinguished engineer from a major consultancy was asking whether we are now really going to build buildings where we are to assume that the ground floor can be flooded, whereas in the past the ground floor of a high-rise was a desirable part for people to live in. Is this really the case? If so, it requires quite a different approach.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08052061000060"></a>As discussed in the report, many of the utilities are only just facing up to running their systems to cope with floods in the streets of London. I have heard that they have had various exercises, which for some utilities did not succeed very well. Imperial College is doing an important study of how the infrastructure will withstand the kinds of extreme events that will happen more in the future, as discussed in the Climate Change Bill.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08052061000061"></a>I refer your Lordships to the interesting Chinese experience. They have warnings, as we have warnings here. Then, in these concrete-type buildings, party workers&#151;who are not trying to get people out for by-elections in China but are helping them in floods&#151;knock on the doors and take people upstairs with their furniture. Of course, all the electrics are at a higher level. The flood comes through and, in some  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1423"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1423</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cases, people rather relish this as it provides extra material to go on their allotments and gardens. After the flood has happened, people move down. The community must then restore the city completely on its own. I am not saying that this is a model for how we shall be in the UK, but that is the kind of situation that may happen more often in cities here.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08052061000062"></a>The interesting point about the Dutch exploration of new building concepts is that they are looking for buildings that may be prone to flooding, such as buildings on stilts. Indeed, a suggestion of Dutch engineers, to avoid the high currents between buildings that we saw in Gloucester and in extreme conditions that may happen more in the future, is to have buildings the ground floor of which collapses inwards so that water can flow through them. This is a drastic look at the future but perhaps less drastic than having floating houses, which has also been suggested.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08052061000063"></a>The other important point in the Pitt review was that we need good warning systems. These are developing. The Environment Agency and, originally, the BBC provide warning systems. Now, however, with the use of computers, radar and satellites we should be able to inform people of the kind of flooding that might be expected on a street-by-street level. Street-by-street level air pollution warnings are now provided in London, so we should be able to provide that for flooding by mobile phones to individuals at risk. In India, they provide warnings of flooding in 14 different languages through computer systems. We should be able to follow that approach.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08052061000064"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, pointed out, the country faces a changed and drastic situation. The Government must be bold in saying that we are moving into new waters. They would do well to encourage individuals, communities and industry to prepare for the future very realistically.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08052061000066"></a>However, flooding is not an absolute. There is a temptation to believe that flooding happens on flood plains and nowhere else. The excellent briefing from the Environment Agency, however, refers to &#147;flood-risk areas&#148; without qualification. Even the Environment Agency talks about three broad risk levels. I suggest that the whole thing must become much more sophisticated; it is much more complex than that. Any particular place is liable to flood at any time&#151;it is just that the probability and type of flooding is different in different places. Indeed, the same briefing says that the risk of flooding is &#147;ever present&#148;. That is the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08052061000067"></a>I live in a village on the edge of Colne that is built on a steep hillside. We were astonished one day to look out and see water pouring out of the front doors of the terrace of houses above us. After a lot of rain, springs had opened up in the steep field above and flowed down into their back yards, through their houses, out of the front doors and then fortunately  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1424"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1424</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>diverted into the lane going up the hill and avoided us. Nobody in their right mind would have thought that that was a high risk of flooding, but it happened. It can happen anywhere. It is important to avoid hysteria and absolutes in this, although nobody should pretend that when flooding happens, to anybody in any place, it is not very nasty indeed. People who have not experienced flooding may feel that it is just water and you can clear that up, but it also involves everything else that comes in with the water and develops when it is there.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08052061000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, referred to rural flooding and the position of farmers. More transparent decision-making is required on farms. The management of farmland and the countryside is crucial, as we know, to the management of catchment areas of river basins generally. That is the strategic level at which the Environment Agency must be particularly involved.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08052061000069"></a>However, many of the problem watercourses which occur during flooding are not the big rivers but the ditches, the little streams and the becks. It is currently far from clear who is responsible for things like weed clearance, tree cutting and keeping the channels clear. The number of these channels is so huge that the Environment Agency would have to be a much bigger organisation if it were to take on those jobs. If farmers are to be involved, the obvious mechanism is through developing farm plans and integrating single-farm payments into what farmers are expected to do on their land. We must remember that in some cases we want the water to leave that farmland as quickly as possible, particularly high quality farmland with key crops. In other cases, we want the water to stay there because it is acting as a reservoir. Not long ago, when I was travelling on the train down the Aire Valley, I heard a conversation among some people who looked out of the window at the floods on the flood plain at the valley bottom, which normally take place in the winter anyway. They said, &#147;Look at all that flooding. It&#146;s terrible, isn&#146;t it?&#148;. Being me, I joined in the conversation and said, &#147;No. That flooding is stopping Shipley and the middle of Leeds being flooded. It is holding the water there, as it has for countless generations past&#148;. It is accepted that farmers understand that that will the case on that pastureland. However, if far more farmers will be expected to manage their land in ways which holds the water in order to protect areas downstream, perhaps they need to be compensated for that. They certainly need to understand their role. If their job is to clear the watercourses and get the water moving, they need to know that too.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08052061000070"></a>On urban flooding, the Environment Agency have said that it wants,</p>
<ul><a name="08052061000113"></a>&#147;a clear overview role for ... flooding from all sources&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052061000097"></a>That is absolutely right. Equally, however, we cannot expect the Environment Agency, a large national organisation, to do all the work on the ground. There is strategic role&#151;particularly at river basin and aerial level, and in the case of integrated catchment area management&#151;but local solutions that fit into that general strategic pattern are required in the local areas on the ground in many cases. The obvious bodies to be

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08052061000071"></a>I am concerned that many of the streams now classified as main rivers are what in our part of the world would be called &#147;nobbut a bit of a beck&#148;; they are little streams.

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08052061000073"></a>At the outset, I congratulate my noble friend Lord Rotherwick on securing this debate on issues concerning flooding and on his excellent presentation. As a practising insurance broker and underwriter, I see at first hand the misery caused to many of our policyholders by the awful effects of flooding. Flood damage is not something that can be reinstated quickly, as it takes many months for the drying-out process to be completed. It is important that the Government do everything that they can to prevent flooding in the first instance and to support local authorities and victims when flood defences fail.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08052061000074"></a>It is essential that we respond to the problems of future flooding as we face the threat of increasing urbanisation and climate change, which means that the problems will unfortunately get worse. In my opinion, flooding is one of the biggest risks to the United Kingdom. The human suffering, financial loss and interruption to business are devastating, and it is estimated that last summer&#146;s floods cost the country &#163;5 billion, of which &#163;3 billion was absorbed by the insurance industry.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08052061000075"></a>My understanding of the current situation is that no single body is responsible for surface-water flooding, yet this was one of the main causes of the problem in the summer of 2007. I feel that the Government should appoint one single body with the authority to take responsibility for the risk of flooding and to co-ordinate with various stakeholders to ensure that action is taken to protect existing and future properties in the UK. I believe that the Environment Agency should be that body and that it should be empowered appropriately.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08052061000076"></a>Providing the Environment Agency with the authority to exercise an advisory and regulatory role may prove to be the best way forward. As an adviser, the agency should prepare a national high-level, surface-water flood-risk map that local authorities can use as the basis for their own efforts and more detailed analysis. This should include the impact of underground water infrastructure on surface-water flooding.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08052061000077"></a>Regarding the regulatory role, the Environment Agency should ensure that local authorities complete surface-water management plans and provide public feedback on them, including identifying areas for improvement. It is imperative that developers and housebuilders consult the Environment Agency and

Where developments proceed in areas of high risk, the minimum standards should include in-design features to provide protection against flooding with a focus on minimising the effects. Applying routine national standards is insufficient in high-risk areas.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08052061000078"></a>On planning, the Department for Communities and Local Government&#146;s planning guidance PPS 25 is most welcome. I congratulate Sir Michael Pitt on his excellent interim report, <I>Learning </I><I>L</I><I>essons from </I><I>the </I><I>2007 Floods</I>, and I urge the Government to agree to 72 interim conclusions, many of which can be achieved at little or no cost. I also ask for information about flooding to be made available to members of the public on a wide scale and for the information to include details of flood defences. By doing that, we will provide the opportunity for members of the pubic to be assisted in making informed decisions about flood-prevention measures for their properties, and people will get more involved in the national discussions about flood management. I am, however, pleased that an automated flood-warning system is available free of charge.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08052061000079"></a>In regard to construction, it is very disappointing that, against the advice of the Environment Agency, last year planning permission was granted for 13 major developments in areas of high flooding risk. I should make the point that in order for the insurance industry to continue to cover flood-prone properties, along with buildings in high-risk areas, it is important that the Government act now to provide adequate and continuing funding for flood defences and flood-risk schemes. Without adequate flood protection, the insurance industry will struggle to continue to offer competitive insurance for all. I therefore ask the Minister to inform your Lordships&#146; House of proposals for the current and future funding of flood defences.</p>

However, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, for the opportunity to raise particular policy issues on flood-risk management. I do not think that it is appropriate for me to respond in detail to the points that he made about the Environment Agency; that is very much a matter for the Minister.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08052061000082"></a>Before I raise my points, I want to welcome the noble Lord, Lord Smith, who is in his place. The Environment Agency is, indeed, very fortunate that he will be joining it as its new chairman in the middle of July. At this precise moment, he may be thinking that he has made a big mistake in his choice; nevertheless, I can assure him that he will be very welcome, and his environmental credentials are there for all to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08052061000083"></a>In spite of the fact that I said that I would not respond to any of the points that the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, made, I want to riposte in an overall  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1427"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1427</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sense to his remark that a significant proportion of the blame for last summer&#146;s floods lies with the Environment Agency. I do not think that any of the reports outlining lessons learnt at either a national or a local level have come to that conclusion. Indeed, since the summer floods, many of them have proposed additional roles for the Environment Agency, and the Government have granted the overall coastal overview role to the agency from 1 April. That does not seem to me to be the act of organisations, reporters or Governments who think that the Environment Agency was a basket case last year. As I have remarked before, the Environment Agency did not flood the nation last summer; the unprecedented level of rain did.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08052061000084"></a>I should like to use the very valuable opportunity that the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, has allowed us to talk about four big policy issues, several of which have been raised already. The first is the issue of prioritising resources according to risk. Inevitably, that means that the built environment, where the higher risk of loss of life and property occurs, will take precedence over agricultural land. That is how government policy currently produces prioritisation results. If that is to be adjusted because of the increasing importance of agricultural land, there will need to be a shift in policy. Therefore, I do not think that the Environment Agency can stand in the dock accused of having abandoned the rural environment; we have been prioritising in line with government wishes.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08052061000085"></a>However, it does mean that in a rural setting the key role of riparian owners is crucial. I think that that needs clarification so that people understand their responsibilities. The same applies to the role of dredging and maintenance. When maintenance and dredging are urged on the Environment Agency, there is often a risk that it will simply speed water downstream and flood other communities, particularly built communities.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08052061000086"></a>Several noble Lords talked about urban floods. Indeed, they are very complex and come from a variety of sources&#151;rivers, ground and surface water, drains and roads&#151;and are influenced by many players, such as local authorities, water companies, developers, redevelopers, highways authorities, and others, as well as the Environment Agency&#146;s own responsibilities for flooding from rivers. There is a pressing need for clarity of responsibility in the urban setting for flooding from all sources, and we very much welcome the Government&#146;s commitment to clarify that responsibility. I appreciate several noble Lords saying that the Environment Agency should have that national overview with local authorities taking a leadership role on a local basis with their ability to hold levers such as the planning, development and redevelopment systems, which makes them key players locally. The Environment Agency could provide a national overview with its tools, techniques and expertise.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08052061000087"></a>The third issue I want to raise is that of critical infrastructure. Noble Lords may recall that we spoke at length in the Climate Change Bill about the importance of protecting our infrastructure from floods in the future. The water and energy companies have taken some lessons from last year and we now need them to be picked up by some of the other critical infrastructure providers, particularly health care premises, roads and

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08052061000088"></a>Fourthly, the noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Greaves, talked about warning systems. We are increasingly able to consider how such systems can be extended to warn of surface and ground water. We are working closely with the Meteorological Office but we must be careful not to promise more certainty than the technologies can currently provide. We must not overpromise the public on our reactions; we still have a long way to go before the public can have a clear plan for doing something effective when a flood is coming. That is a big ask that we must work on that to improve public response.</p>

<a name="80520-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08052061000089"></a>I shall finish on some statistics. Last year the Environment Agency exceeded by 20 per cent the number of properties it defended within its capital budget. Since the summer we have built 37 new defences and protected an additional 30,000 homes. We have signed up another 50,000 properties to our flood warning systems. Every flood has a silver lining. The public are now much more alert to the problems of flooding but the four areas of policy that I have outlined need to be addressed.</p>

One thing is clear: we shall be discussing flooding many times in the future. It is a fact of life, I am afraid, and will be increasingly so. As the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said, the issue is about water&#151;precipitation. We shall have not only irregular meteorological events in the future due largely to global warming, but rising sea levels. I was at an industrial conference last week and reminded people that if, as is starting to look more possible, we lose the Greenland ice shelf, there will be a rise in sea levels of something like 6 metres, but that if a similar thing happens in Antarctica, sea levels will rise by 200 feet. That starts to change the whole issue, but we are talking about rivers this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08052068000003"></a>Although 50,000 households and 7,000 businesses were affected by flooding last year, Burma showed the devastation that a combination of flooding and high wind can do to populations. We have never suffered from that, but we can see how important the issue is. It is clear that we cannot just build our way out of this problem. We have miles of sea defences and all sorts of different facilities, but maintaining those is already a stretch for government budgets, which were, quite wrongly, cut recently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08052068000004"></a>I was pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, mentioned this. Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s report recommended adaptation not just generally in the economy but in the way in which we build residences, houses and buildings in this country. One of the recommendations that struck me was that building regulations should say that lower floors should allow flooding and recovery at minimum cost. We have to move towards that sort of thinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08052068000005"></a>We hear a lot of loose talk about building on flood plains. In the Netherlands, 95 per cent of all houses are built on flood plains because the country is a  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1429"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1429</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>flood plain. I cannot imagine our saying that building on flood plains must not be allowed, but we have to minimise it where possible. Local authorities under Section 106 agreements should invest in areas that are less prone to flooding, but we will not get away from building on flood plains or the risk of flooding. As my noble friend Lord Greaves said, flooding is a part of life in certain areas. When I travel back to the south-west by train, I regularly see fields flooded in the Somerset Levels, which is part of the ecology and way of life of that area. We have learnt to manage that in the past, so we must regain some of those skills.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08052068000006"></a>Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s report on strategic management is logical and right. At a strategic level, there needs to be a body such as the Environment Agency to ensure that the system works from a national point of view, but clearly the best people in this respect are principal local authorities. They know the local patch; they have the resources and the authority. I was particularly persuaded by my noble friend&#146;s idea of using the single farm payment in rural areas, perhaps through cross-compliance procedures for farmers, as they are the best people to look after their areas and should be remunerated for it. The Government should think about that further, which is rather different from the French view on CAP expenditure.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08052068000007"></a>I ask the Government to consider the recommendations of Sir Michael Pitt on building regulations. Will we start to change those, albeit perhaps not so drastically as towards the idea of collapsing lower walls and floors in flood areas? However, it is important to have something like that. What lessons have the Government learnt from the Netherlands and other parts of Europe? What are they doing about rationalising strategic and local powers? Are they confident that Defra funding on maintenance will not be cut again? I know that the capital expenditure programme was not cut; it is great to build things but, if we do not maintain them, they will be of little use in the future. I should also be interested to know whether local authorities are using Section 106 agreements to make sure that we have better investment in individual projects on flood plains.</p>

The terms in which noble Lords have contributed make it clear that the House has much to offer in providing constructive advice on this subject, as each of your Lordships, not least my noble friend, has had a lot to say. I find myself in the same position. There is a need for action, as Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s interim report makes clear, and a need&#151;in many urban areas, above all&#151;to deal with the neglect and lack of maintenance of storm water drainage, which lay at the bottom of many immediate problems in the flooding last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08052068000009"></a>I begin by declaring my interests. I am a member of a family with a high-value, intensive farming and horticultural business in the Lincolnshire fenland silts. None of it lies more than 3 metres above sea level and it is as flat as the sea itself. It has not, however, been  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1430"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1430</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>flooded for many centuries, so I hope to reassure noble Lords that low elevation and flatness are not necessarily a flood risk. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, explained that; he also explained the role of wash lands, as did the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. This is a complex issue, not simply a matter of how low-lying the land is.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08052068000010"></a>At home, we are entirely dependent on managed water through the internal drainage board, formed itself some time ago from many smaller bodies. While not active in drainage management, I am reasonably informed and feel that I can contribute to this debate from a practical point of view as well as a political one. I am grateful for the help that I have received from many sources, particularly from John Honnor, a retired drainage board engineer of considerable standing. As noble Lords would expect, land drainage plays an important part in fenland communities, where the skills, experience, knowledge and expertise of the engineering profession are highly regarded. As those communities live more or less at sea level, that might not be surprising, but I hold the view that the key to flood prevention everywhere lies in good management, clear lines of responsibility and engineering skill.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08052068000011"></a>Currently, responsibility is complex and divided. The Environment Agency does the main river and sea defences, having taken over from the NRA, which, in turn, took over from the river catchment-based authorities. At local level in many parts of the country, as I have mentioned, and particularly in low-lying rural areas with a flood risk, responsibilities lie with IDBs. Those have a strong engineering base and, in the main, work well. Currently, they are being encouraged to merge. Although that may be a good way of reducing overheads, it will be disastrous if it is at the expense of local knowledge. In the recent floods, I know for certain of a situation that was averted by local action being taken despite indecision at a higher level.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08052068000012"></a>There is a division of responsibility. We have mentioned the Environment Agency and the internal drainage boards, but much flood control is still in the hands of local authorities&#151;the drainage authorities where there is no internal drainage board. Water companies are responsible for urban storm water systems. Within the complexity of planning systems for sewerage and water there are considerable responsibilities in urban areas. Highway authorities do the storm water systems and dykes adjoining highways, while Network Rail is responsible for culverts under railway lines. Above all, riparian owners are responsible for much of the drainage responsibility at a higher level, although many have no idea that they are. I will praise the Environment Agency for its publication, <I>Living on the Edge</I>. It tries to make clear to riparian owners how they fit into this drainage pattern. Many a situation arises where planning permission is given and a house is allowed to be developed; what then happens, perhaps, is that the dyke gets culverted at the back with nobody realising that riparian owners have joint responsibility for maintaining it.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08052068000013"></a>In my view, the greatest flood risk is not from climate change but from catchment change. Every new building, new road and change in land use produces additional run-off, which is cumulative and not noted until the flood event. Skilled hydrologists  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1431"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1431</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can predict it, but they are not listened to. We have either to enlarge the capacity of the watercourses or to retain the water on site and release it slowly&#151;or both. All new building consents should consider the downstream effects of increased run-off, but that is difficult. I wonder whether planning often takes those responsibilities fully into account. I hope that this debate will serve as a useful forum to discuss these issues. Clearly, there is much that we could be saying on this subject and there will, no doubt, be other opportunities to do so.</p>

I did not agree with every statement that he made, but he did the House a great service by drawing attention to the challenges that we face. I think that your Lordships would also want to express sympathy with all those who suffered so grievously last summer in the devastating flood events. We all know that flooding is one of the most devastating events that can occur in people&#146;s homes and that many suffered then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08052068000015"></a>The weather conditions last year were exceptional. We had the clearest indications from my noble friend Lord Hunt of Chesterton of what the rainfall was in a limited period and we respect not just his weather forecasting abilities but his predictive abilities with regard to aspects of climate change. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, was right to reiterate what several other noble Lords had said. This is about not just climate change but catchment areas, planning and the whole question of how we construct our dwellings with regard to the water drainage problem. Nevertheless, climate change has its part to play in that. We must anticipate, as my noble friend said, the incidence of heavy water flows in regular rainfalls of a continuous kind, which present us with real challenges in managing our environment. It is obvious that the Government need to respond to those challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08052068000016"></a>The part of the speech by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, that I was not so sure about was his criticism of the Environment Agency. The noble Baroness, Lady Young, was reserved in her response, as she is well aware of her responsibilities as far as the Environment Agency is concerned, but I shall take up the cudgels on her behalf. The Environment Agency is not held responsible by the Pitt review or any other body for the problems of last summer, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh. We look to the Environment Agency to deal with coastal erosion problems, which are not part of this evening&#146;s debate. I thought that the noble Baroness, Lady Young, indicated that my noble friend Lord Smith might be taking on a poisoned chalice, although a chalice is a rather small vessel for the amount of water that we are suggesting he might have to cope with in his role with the Environment Agency, in which we wish him well. The agency clearly has a significant part to play, but there are important wider government policy initiatives.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08052068000017"></a>I want to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, who was very fair and right to congratulate the insurance industry on the extent to which it responded to the

That does not mean that every citizen felt that to be the case or that everybody experienced prompt attention to their problems, but the flood problems were a massive challenge to the insurance industry and the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, is right to draw attention to that. I assure him that the Government are in the closest discussions with the industry to ensure that we provide adequate insurance provision for the future. That requires householders to change attitudes. With major problems, agencies can play their part and the Government have a critical role to play, but we need to condition the public&#146;s response and increase awareness of what is necessary so that people can safeguard their properties. We need to have due regard to the way in which construction takes place in order to minimise problems.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08052068000018"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is right that this is a question not about hilly ground or level ground but about management. He farms in Lincolnshire, an outstanding example of water management on flat land. I live next to the River Lee, which represents another form of water management. It supplies water to London. It is carefully managed, as it has been over many years. The issues are not the contours of the land, although they are conducive to the creation of problems, but the way in which we manage that land. </p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08052068000019"></a>I like the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that perhaps we ought to look at agricultural funding so that landowners are more aware of the necessity for water management in the development of their land. He will recognise that payments to farmers and the structure of the way in which landowners and farmers are remunerated are massive problems. This dimension is yet another complicating factor that causes all Governments to scratch their head. This Government are scratching their head over those issues as much as any other. However, it is an interesting proposal and I assure him that it will be looked at carefully.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08052068000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is right that, if we look at a country such as the Netherlands, we can see buildings and structures that reflect water management over centuries. They show how to cope with water and still provide civilised living in extensive and often congested circumstances. I hear what he said about the role of local authorities. That is important, not least with regard to water management but also with regard to building policies. I am not going to shy away from building on flood plains. There is no way in which we can house our people and pretend that we will not build on flood plains. The issue is how we manage water matters in areas that we create. Due regard must be paid to this dimension of the problem when building new housing.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08052068000021"></a>I emphasise that the Government are extremely active in efforts to improve the way in which flood risk is managed. We have been for some years, but we need to increase those efforts. I emphasise that we intend to devote the resources. Several noble Lords referred to the resources devoted to this. Defra&#146;s resources are no more unlimited than the Government&#146;s, on which there are many demands. Nevertheless, we intend to increase expenditure in this area, mindful of the fact that the problems require us to address the issues creatively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08052068000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, raised the issue first, but he was not the only noble Lord to mention the Pitt review and to talk about its recommendations in assertive terms. The Government accept those recommendations. Implementing them is a longer-term objective and strategy. We have begun work on 15 pilot projects to identify improvements in surface water drainage, which was, after all, the biggest problem during last year&#146;s floods. I do not underestimate the challenge that that represents. We have a &#163;500,000 pilot project, in partnership with local authorities in six areas, to explore the feasibility of some form of financial assistance for those households where the community defence cannot be justified, but we need to make their homes more flood-resistant.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08052068000023"></a>The Chamber will recognise that, in response to an intense debate on a subject of such significance, the 12 minutes allotted to me, which are already close to being exhausted, are not adequate to cover all the issues. I apologise for that. I emphasise that we intend to spend &#163;650 million this year, &#163;700 million in 2009-10 and &#163;800 million in 2010-11 on resources relating to the problems of flooding and coastal erosion, which the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, was particularly concerned about. That is some indication of the seriousness with which the Government address these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08052068000024"></a>Will we be able to guarantee that all our homes have adequate protection against floods in the future? Of course we cannot. We cannot even predict weather and surface flooding, such as occurred last year. All we know is that such flooding is likely to increase. That is why greater defences have to be erected. We have the agencies in place. I resist the criticism of the Environment Agency; it will continue to do a very good job. We are also spending more money on flood warning, which is a key issue in minimising damage. Householders need to be prepared for the challenges that are presented. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, for this debate, which has thrown light on some important issues.</p>

I call this the &#147;cat out of the bag&#148; amendment. This is what the two noble Lords opposite and a third noble Lord behind me&#151;which is always dangerous&#151;have been waiting for. This is their big moment. All the other amendments that they have moved are, basically, beside the point.

That is not the point. They want to leave it. This is their moment because they are able to say that. They have become, if you like, honest men. Now we are debating, for them, the big issue. This is, of course, official UKIP policy. There are a number of well known Conservative fellow travellers who have tabled amendments, particularly in the other place. It has been claimed that too many mainstream Conservatives are allowing themselves to be pushed along by this kind of pressure. I would not say that at all. I certainly would not go along with those who might allege that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, whom I have known for a long time and have much respect for, is a Cash with a human face. I would not call him that at all. He has his own face, which is charming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08052068000029"></a>I am strongly in favour of British membership. The European Union is one of the great achievements of the post-war world and has certainly been a force for good on the Continent of Europe. It has led to prosperity for the peoples of Europe. It has led to greater security, particularly because the old quarrel between France and Germany has, I hope, been healed for ever. Of course, it has also led to the strengthening of democracy on the Continent of Europe. To qualify to be a member of the European Union, states have to be a democracy, which is why the former dictatorships of Spain, Portugal and Greece are now democracies and the countries of central and eastern Europe, which were brought in in 2004, are now flourishing democracies. The whole of the Continent of Europe has basically been transformed by the European Union.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08052068000030"></a>I also strongly believe that British membership is good for Britain. I would not expect Members of the Committee opposite to agree: I shall not ask them to intervene because they have intervened quite enough on my speeches already. In material terms, the European Union has been very good for British exporters, British consumers, and certainly for British travellers and British workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08052068000031"></a>Of course, the much broader argument is that UK interests are served by us working together with our neighbours on trade, on the environment, and on foreign policy, defence and security. Those underlying, really strong reasons are why it would be a total disaster if Britain left the European Union. If it came to a referendum, I do not believe that the British people would vote for leaving the EU. But it is wrong to propose, as this amendment does, that we should have a referendum on British membership. I am very glad that, as I understand it, the Liberal Democrats will not support this amendment. It would be a retrograde step.</p>

<a name="80520-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08052068000032"></a>To sum up, I am strongly in favour of the European Union, which has been good for Britain, for Europe and for the citizens of Britain and of Europe. I hope very much that the Committee will reject this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08052068000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Radice, is right. The European Union has been very good for Europe in many ways. I have no quarrel with that. There is a mistaken view, which I hope is not shared by the Liberal Democrats, that UKIP wants to destroy it. That simply is not the case. Our case is that it is not good for Britain or necessary for Britain to be a member. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Radice, that it has been good for democracy in Europe and has made other countries in Europe richer, partly&#151;I hope he would admit&#151;with some of our taxpayers&#146; money; for instance, French agriculture and Spain. None the less, it has had very good effects for certain countries in Europe, if not all, but not necessarily for Britain. That is where we part company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08052068000035"></a>In 1975, we had the referendum, which we talked about on earlier amendments, on the Common Market. There was no question of having a European army, qualified majority voting or even a European Parliament. It was on purely whether we wished to remain in&#151;</p>

If he had, he would have seen that qualified majority voting was provided for in that treaty, which was negotiated in 1957 and entered into force in 1958, for all budgetary, agricultural and trade matters. It is no good his saying that. The speeches from himself and his noble friend are sometimes fantasies that leave all of us gasping at their extraordinary nature. It is important that you get the facts right. Qualified majority voting was part of the treaty of Rome when it was founded and ratified. It was part of the treaty that we acceded to in 1972. It was not invented later.</p>

We were told by our leaders then that there would be no loss of central sovereignty. That does not sit happily with what has happened since. The noble Lord takes a different view from me and that is right, but it is time we lanced the boil and set this matter to rest by having a referendum. I believe that is the Liberal Democrat position. I hope they will support this amendment on whether we should be in the European Union. It would be healthy to have that debate. We do not want to have it just across the Chamber here with people who cannot agree even about what we are talking about.</p>

If there was a referendum, would he accept the result? The record on that point in the past has not been too encouraging. I remember that Mr Anthony Wedgwood Benn was a strong supporter of a referendum. Within six years of losing the first referendum, he was calling for another one.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Radice, has raised the issue of whether UKIP or this side&#151;let us call them Eurosceptics to use an awful shorthand&#151;would accept the result of a referendum. Yes, of course we would&#151;unlike the European Union.</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08052068000040"></a>During the interesting debates earlier, I made a short list of the referendums that have occurred within the European Union, or just without it, in the last few years. The Danish referendum on Maastricht voted it down. The European Union did not accept that; they had to have another go and then come up with the right answer. They were given a protocol on something, a bribe to vote yes&#151;which they did. Next&#151;these are not necessarily in chronological order; there were so many defeats of the European Union in democratic elections I cannot remember which order they came in&#151;there was the Irish referendum on the Nice treaty. They voted that down and were given a bribe, told to go away and have another think. They did so. The Danish voted down the euro; they were asked to think again a couple of years later, then they voted it down again. There is nothing like a Dane.</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08052068000041"></a>Then we had the Swedish referendum on the euro; that was voted down. The French voted down the constitutional treaty, as did the Dutch. The Norwegians have repeatedly voted against joining Europe, despite, according to the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, apparently being run by fax-democracy from Europe. Of course they are not; they are not in the agricultural policy or the fisheries policy. They do roughly what they want and put into law what is required. Just to mention the Swiss again, they have repeatedly by large majority voted against joining the European Union.</p>

The European Parliament has said it will override any decision of the people of Ireland which would make the treaty null and void. But, of course, it will not because it never does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08052068000045"></a>It is not right to say that the European Union has the monopoly on democracy. All noble Lords who have spoken against referendums largely seem to be a part of the &#147;eurocracy&#148; and they do not like losing democratic referendums. That is what has happened and so, of course, they certainly do not want a referendum on the treaty&#151;and not even on in or out&#151;because they might not welcome the result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08052068000046"></a>Let me remind noble Lords of the striking and groundbreaking speech yesterday of the noble Lord, Lord Owen, who was, after all, a Labour Party Foreign Secretary. He said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08052068000072"></a>It is worth reflecting on what the noble Lord said. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester said rather the same thing today.</p>

There was a party that put a specific question during that period. In 1983 the Labour Party fought a general election on withdrawing from Europe albeit only eight years after a referendum, and it received its worst result since 1918. Again, does not the noble Lord think the British people were saying something when they had the chance?</p>

It was nothing to do with the Common Market or Europe; it was everything to do with the fact that at that time Labour Party policy was to get rid of the independent nuclear deterrent. I know that because on every doorstep that was the main issue that was raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08052068000053"></a>I cannot see why it is so odd, so objectionable and so extreme to ask the British people finally to have their say. After all, 33 years ago they were asked for their opinion in a referendum on what was then the Common Market. I will not go into details but we all must agree that it is a very different animal now from what it was 33 years ago. Everything that has gone through since then has gone through without the British people being able to have a say. The Liberal Democrats are absolutely right to seek a referendum on whether we should be in or out and, yes, I think that UKIP would accept the result of such a referendum. It would be very healthy to have that. I do not understand why the Liberal Democrats are against it. They should support this. It is, after all, their policy.</p>

If the noble Lord is asking me to go into the Lobby with UKIP, I reply that I am not going to do it and I recommend to my friends not to. We spent several days listening to tales such as that the European gendarmerie is designed to operate on the shores of the United Kingdom to suppress honest British citizens or the suggestion that the xenophobic dimension of the treaty is intended to stop British citizens criticising Brussels, let alone burning the European flag. I am very sorry that we have not heard the story I came across in Eurofax the other day: that there is a new directive that will inhibit the rights of spiritualist workers to operate within the European Union by subjecting them to the test of whether their work as mediums achieves the results they claim.

Let me spell out, however, where the Liberal Democrats stand. Nick Clegg is a clear and gut European.

As I have told this House so many times before, I was never in favour of going into the Common Market, and I believe that it would be in our interests now to leave the European Union. So my position has been clear practically all my life. I have quite enjoyed being involved in this debate&#151;one of very many in which I have taken part over the past 30 or 40 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08052068000064"></a>What do noble Lords who do not support the amendment have against referendums? Why is it all right for the Scots to have a referendum on devolution and, indeed, on whether to leave the United Kingdom? Why is it so special that they should be allowed to have a referendum on whether they leave the United Kingdom, yet the United Kingdom cannot have a referendum on whether it should continue to be members of the European Union?</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08052068000065"></a>The amendment sets out a respectable position. The time probably will come when we have to have a referendum on whether we remain in the European Union. After all, things are not everlasting. The British people may very well insist at some time in the future that we have a referendum, so the current situation is by no means certain. Indeed, I believe it is perfectly respectable for people to call for a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08052068000066"></a>Under our constitution, referendums are advisory. They in no way undermine the sovereignty of Parliament. As we have so often said, Parliament, in the last analysis, by repealing the European Communities Act

But it is good to get the opinion of the people.</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08052068000067"></a>I believe that we should leave the European Union. I have said so in this House many times before. I do not think that our membership brings the benefits which the noble Lord, Lord Radice, described. We were told that it would increase our trade and be good for our economy and our industries. But since 1973, our industrial capacity has fallen from 32 per cent of GDP to 13 per cent, and great industries have been destroyed during that time.</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08052068000068"></a>If you look at our position vis- -vis the European Union in trade terms, we run a constant deficit with it in goods and services of about &#163;40 billion per year. It is by no means certain that we make a profit by trading with the EU. In fact, we make a big loss. In addition, we pay about &#163;12 billion a year via the exchanges as a contribution to this so-called club. Yet only 9 per cent of our total economy is involved with Europe. So we are by no means get the trading benefits but we are increasingly getting a reduction in the opportunities that Parliament has for deciding the course of this country. As the Government themselves admit, 70 per cent of all legislation emanates from Europe. It is no good the noble Lord, Lord Radice, shaking his head. Those are government figures and I am only quoting them. We are increasingly losing control of our destiny and being ruled by people whom we do not elect and we cannot dismiss.</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08052068000069"></a>The world is a much bigger place than Europe. People say that if you leave Europe you will be sidelined. Why should this country be sidelined? It built a big empire from a much smaller base than we have now. The world is a big trading place and the big opportunities for trade and co-operation are not in Europe; they are outside Europe, as all Members of this House know. They are in China, with a population of 1.3 billion and in India which is burgeoning as a great nation and a population of over a billion. There lie the opportunities for our industrialists, for the people who have things to sell and with whom we should be co-operating. There are vast opportunities throughout the world; we do not have to be confined to the backyard of Europe.</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08052068000070"></a>I wish that people would not accuse those who believe that we would do better out of Europe as being nasty little xenophobes and little Englanders because that is not the case. It is possible for Britain, with its great history and abilities, to co-operate freely with all the countries of the world, but it is constrained because of the regulation, decision and control from Brussels.</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08052068000071"></a>That is my view of the situation. I can certainly talk for a very long time, but I shall leave it at that. Most of us in this Chamber have spent many hours, late at night, discussing the Bill. I am grateful to the Government for giving so much time to discussion of this very important Bill and the treaty. We are going to have more days on it than we had on Maastricht. I believe that that is an achievement and would like to conclude by thanking the noble Baroness and the Government for allowing this Chamber to have a very full and open discussion.</p>

<a name="0805213000001"></a><a name="80520-0014.htm_spnew26"></a><b><a name="80520-0014.htm_spnew27"></a><a name="0805213000086"></a>Lord Hamilton of Epsom:</b> I have put my name to the amendment because it really is time that we asked the British people again whether they think that they should be in the EU. We last asked them in 1975, which is too long a time ago. I remember the words of the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, who said that the UK is seen as an increasingly reluctant member of the EU. That is right: it is the way that the British people see it and they should be asked again.</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="0805213000002"></a>However, I do not support the amendment because I think that the country will vote to pull out. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Radice, that all the evidence is that the country will vote quite substantially to stay in. I accept the argument that one referendum does not solve the problem, but for those who want this country to stay in the EU, it buys a certain amount of time, and I do not quite understand all the reluctance to have a referendum because it would settle the issue for a few years.</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="0805213000003"></a>The real benefit of a vote in a referendum which said that the United Kingdom wanted to stay in the EU is that it would destroy the last vestiges of credibility of the United Kingdom Independence Party. How could it stand in future elections saying, &#147;We believe that we should pull out of the EU&#148;, when a vote had just taken place saying that the country did not want to pull out? That would be extremely helpful.</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="0805213000004"></a>I agree that I speak in rather party political terms for the Conservative Party, because we have suffered in endless elections from the spoiling tactics of UKIP, which has achieved nothing in terms of its objectives. What have the achievements been? In any constituency it has always taken very many more votes of Tories than of anybody else, the result of which has been that Labour Governments have had bigger majorities than would otherwise have been the case. And let&#146;s face it, this Labour Government have probably been the most Europhile Government in the history of this country.</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="0805213000005"></a>UKIP has always talked with a forked tongue about not putting up candidates against Eurosceptic Tory Members. I just think of the plight of my right honourable friend in the other place, David Heathcoat-Amory, whose Eurosceptic credentials could hardly be surpassed. In his rather marginal constituency he has a majority of 3,000, which he has had for the previous two elections. If UKIP had succeeded in standing against him&#151;it did not; it managed to poll only 1,000 votes&#151;it would have removed him in favour of a Liberal who, like all our Liberals, would have been a rampant Europhile. That is not terribly clever politics. One really wonders what UKIP is up to.</p>

<a name="80520-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="0805213000006"></a>The timing of my erstwhile noble friends who have moved over to UKIP could hardly be worse. They have joined the party at a time of infighting, misappropriation of funds and unauthorised donations, and it seems to be a question of the rats joining a sinking ship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="0805213000009"></a>A notable omission from the supporters of the amendment is the Liberal Democrats. As it was Liberal Democrat policy to have a referendum on &#147;in or out&#148;, I was quite confident that there would have been supporters for the amendment. I do not accept the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, that he did not want to join in with UKIP&#151;I am not a member of UKIP, as I have probably indicated already. Why did the Liberal Democrats not support the amendment? It used to be party policy. But of course that is too much to hope of the Lib Dems. Their party policy changes so quickly, does it not? It was their party policy a few weeks ago, but now it no longer is.</p>

I am getting a little tired of hearing those who have waved and wobbled about Europe for the whole of their political careers talk about these Benches not having a policy. We have not only a policy but a principle on Europe, which could well be a lesson to some of the parties around this Chamber.</p>

As I have already explained, many of those in favour of Europe in today&#146;s Committee believe that they would win a referendum on &#147;in or out&#148;, so I do not know why the Liberal Democrats are worried about it. Nevertheless, they then decided that they would not do that after all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="0805213000012"></a>The Liberal Democrats&#146; extraordinary flip-flopping on policy is unbelievable. I am not sure that it is doing them much good. It follows their approach to the constitution. They started off by promising a referendum in their manifesto. Next, they said that everybody in this Chamber and the other place should abstain. Not everybody did, and those who did not voted for a referendum. Now, they are going to vote against a referendum on the constitution. It is extremely difficult to keep up with Liberal policy because it changes so quickly. The Liberal Democrats certainly do not allow principle to weigh too heavily on their shoulders.</p>

<a name="80520-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="0805213000013"></a>The trouble about all this is that the Liberal Democrats treat policies as other people treat clothes: they put them on and take them off as it suits the changing patterns of the political weather. Moreover, they are famous for policies which vary across the country. They have certain policies to woo voters in Labour constituencies in the north&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="0805213000020"></a>Let us look at other areas. I was referring to the problem that Liberals say one thing to Labour constituencies in the north while quite different messages seem to come over in Conservative areas in the south-west. It suggests that the Liberals have got political opportunism down to a fine art.</p>

I cannot claim to be a confidante of David Cameron. All I know is that the EU has promised&#151;though not many people believe it&#151;that there will not be another treaty for another 10 years. I think that we are going to get another one far earlier than that. I suspect that at the next election the Conservative Party will make a commitment&#151;the Labour Party may do as well&#151;that there will be a referendum on the next treaty. If that comes down the line in about five years&#146; time, I am confident that at that point there will be a Conservative Government. I am also confident that at that point no treaty would get through the House of Commons, even with a referendum in the country. Something has got to snap somewhere. You will have to watch this space to see where the strain tells. I believe that we are on the threshold of change and am enormously encouraged by the fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="0805213000025"></a>First, there is an assumption that because we are in the European Community we are disadvantaged in our trade with China, India and other countries. There is nothing inconsistent in being present in a single market of considerable importance&#151;although that is not often referred to by opponents of that market&#151;in the European Union, and at the same time being capable of exploiting the possibilities in new markets in India, China&#151;</p>

I heard the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, advance the argument that Asia is the continent of the 21st century, which is a very strong argument, but I do not think that I have heard anybody say that this country would be disadvantaged in its trade with Asia by its ties with the European Union. Maybe somebody has said that but, if so, it has passed me by.</p>

He will see that the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart&#151;and I was trying not to mention him by name, because I wanted to make my point in general&#151;made that point. He referred very disparagingly to the internal market by comparison with the other markets. As I say, they are not inconsistent; it is perfectly possible to trade worldwide from the United Kingdom within the European Union.</p>

<a name="80520-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="0805213000028"></a>My second point is that it is very frequently said that the United Kingdom makes huge budget contributions to the European Union. The implication is that we are paying for most or a very large part of it. This argument is often advanced. I have a long reputation, I think, of being very averse to spending the taxpayer&#146;s money, which is why I feel that it is useful for me to intervene briefly on this point.</p>

<a name="80520-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="0805213000029"></a>The budget of the European Union is 2.1 per cent of public expenditure in the European Union member states, which is a very low figure. The division of contributions, as they are called, between the member states, is certainly not in line with the impression that is often given. I have the budget report for 2006; the figures indicate the operating budgetary balances&#151;that is, the difference between the operating expenditure, which goes into a member state, such as the agricultural fund, the regional fund and so on, and the own resources payments, which is what a member state pays in, in the form of a VAT contribution, and so on. That takes account, as it should, of the budget rebate, which is part of the system that was brilliantly negotiated by the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher. The UK operating budgetary balance on this basis is &#8364;2,143 million. We are 10th in the list of countries expressed as a percentage of gross national income. France, for example, contributes &#8364;3,017.8 million, which is 0.17 per cent of gross national income.</p>

<a name="80520-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="0805213000030"></a>I do not make much of this point. I would much prefer it if the expenditure on the European Union budget was lower and if what we put in was less. That would suit me extremely well. But I do not want the impression to be left that somehow we are bailing out the rest of the European Union and that others are

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="0805213000034"></a>I spoke on Second Reading though I have not spoken so far in Committee. But I feel compelled to rise to my feet on this amendment. I have listened to many of the debates of the debates and read with great care the ones that I have not listened to. It is fascinating that, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, reminded us, the Labour Party is the only party that has actually wanted to withdraw from Europe since I have been a Member of this House. I have heard senior members of that party&#151;they were in another place at the time but are now in this House&#151;standing up and giving us their European credentials. But never once did they explain how they managed to stay within that party in 1983 or give any excuses why they did so.</p>

That is a formidable achievement, if the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, can actually find plans to create that set of circumstances.</p>

However, on balance, I disagree with them all them slightly for different reasons. There is a strong majority in this country in favour of remaining within the EU, as my noble friends Lord Astor and Lord Hamilton said, but that majority is becoming increasingly worried that the EU is moving towards becoming a kind of federal state. That is not the EU that it originally wanted to join. There is therefore an overwhelming and growing feeling in the country that we have had enough Europe. It may be all right, but we do not want any more.</p>

<a name="80520-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="0805213000044"></a>It is often said that Britain should be at the heart of Europe. Well, we are more able to influence developments at the heart of Europe now than we will be if the Lisbon treaty is ratified. With the move towards more qualified majority voting in so many areas, we pool a much greater amount of our sovereignty whether we admit it or not. It is difficult to see how we can get it back. We currently have the influence and ability to persuade our European partners to do it a bit differently. Our influence to achieve that after the treaty is ratified will be diminished.</p>

I do not deny that the single market has been hugely successful. I spent a lot of time in Tokyo, in the 1980s and 1990s, telling everybody how wonderful having this single market was, but I did not say that it ever meant that we were going to give up crucial parts of our national sovereignty to Brussels, where we will be only one of 26 or 27.</p>

<a name="80520-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="0805213000046"></a>I worry particularly about financial services. Having spent 2006 working in Brussels, as the director-general of the European Fund and Asset Management Association, I know very well that many of our continental competitors are quite jealous of London&#146;s success. They are more concerned with harmonisation than with the continuing success of London, the United Kingdom&#146;s financial services capital. Although we try to say that London is Europe&#146;s and the United Kingdom&#146;s financial services capital, London will nevertheless suffer as a result of pressure towards harmonisation of financial regulation. MFID has had some undesirable consequences. The financial services action plan is expensive. We must be careful in this area. The more we surrender our ability to decide our own regulation and financial legislation, the more threatened London&#146;s position will be.</p>

All the people whom one talks to in the City of London are very keen on all these entities getting together and creating greater strength from the collectivity as well from the success of London as the primordial financial centre. This country has a low manufacturing base, unfortunately, and therefore we tend to have a trade deficit with most other advanced countries, including within the EU, but we make up for it with the surplus from financial and other services and from Stock Exchange transactions and all the rest of the City&#146;s financial transactions. That is a huge asset, and there is no fear in the City that that will be taken away by greater co-operation with other Europeans.</p>

I now work for a Japanese one but at least it has a London subsidiary.</p>

<a name="80520-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0805213000049"></a>We have to be very careful.

Thereby, we would persuade the EU to allow for a two-tier system where member states that wanted to retain their sovereignty could retain some kind of associated status and outer ring, and those who wanted political union could go ahead and achieve that. When I worked in Brussels in 2006, I was absolutely persuaded that that is what very many people in Europe want, but the British people do not think that that is what Europe is about. Therefore, I think that we have a dilemma. In these circumstances, it was right that all political parties promised a referendum and I think it is wrong that we should now try to fudge the situation and cancel the promises that were made.</p>

I greatly admire his knowledge and persistence in pursuing a course in which he passionately believes. We are all familiar with the arguments for and against further integration into the European Union. As we know, more than 70 per cent of our laws come from Brussels and we scrutinise thousands of regulations from it each year. We have no power to alter any of them and no evidence has been given to this House that we have done so.</p>

<a name="80520-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0805213000052"></a>If employees of Brussels speak out against the corruption that occurs, they are dismissed. You can lose your pension if you speak out against the Union. Do we want to belong to an organisation which is so unsure of its own authority? As the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, and others have said, we have a trade deficit with the EU. It needs us more than we need it. We are integrating further with an area with static, declining and ageing populations and with no adequate pension provisions. This country has a growing population, although sadly, thanks to the Government, one of the finest pension provision systems in the world has been virtually destroyed. None the less, we remain demographically much better off than our European neighbours.</p>

<a name="80520-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0805213000053"></a>The constitution&#151;sorry, treaty&#151;is yet another direct and creeping takeover of British sovereignty. We discuss it as though it is a static document. It is, as history indicates, yet another way for the EU to take over the running of more of our lives. Even though it is not yet passed, some decisions are already being pre-empted, such as the setting up of diplomatic missions. Health and safety, which we blithely entered into, extended its tentacles into areas we had never foreseen. Indeed, some Members have already indicated that further integration is on the agenda. An example of health and safety is the draft proposal that golf courses should have toilets at regular intervals all round them. My source is a toilet manufacturer in the UK. Is that sort of interference in our daily lives really necessary? The country has failed to renegotiate any major areas of conflict&#151;the fisheries policy for one. We are barely supported by the EU in Afghanistan. The endless bureaucracy, the levelling down and desire to lower UK standards to EU ones, and the wish to make the City less competitive are all reasons why the time has come to review our whole relationship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0805213000061"></a>Of course, a case can be made for supporting the amendment. If it were carried and there was an in or out referendum, I agree totally with those who said that the vast majority of this country want to stay in the EU. That leaves open the question of what type of EU and what way it is going. We in the Conservative Party would campaign vigorously to stay in the European Union, and I am in favour of membership of this grouping.</p>

I do not think that we have been at all clever in recent times in playing the European Union hand. We have missed every opportunity after the rejection of the constitution. Hampton Court was claimed to be a great success but it was a feeble disaster and bypassed all sorts of opportunities for the UK. I find that quite shaming. Generally, our negotiations in these matters during the convention were a disaster, which I repeat many of us foresaw from the beginning because it was a top-down arrangement and not a bottom-up calling together of the great national parliaments and the great states of Europe. The negotiating was abysmal and landed the British Government with all sorts of commitments they did not want. Much of that has flowed into the Lisbon treaty where many of the undertakings still reside. That is not a good story, but in no way does it detract from our wish to see a strong, modern European Union adjust to the networked world, revolutionised by information technology and globalisation, that is now before us. It is completely

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0805213000063"></a>It is true that the EU serves not our interests, as the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, said, but some of our interests. Close co-operation in the European Union undoubtedly serves some interests, but not all, and in a fast-changing world the pattern of those interests is also changing fast. Noble Lords opposite or, perhaps, all round, were wrong to be too mocking of that part of the speech by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, and others. They rightly said not that the new world of Asia is a substitute for, and opposite from, being members of the European Union&#151;it was not at all right for the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, to seem to set those two against each other when, on the contrary, they go together&#151;but that there are vast opportunities growing outside the European Union. Those who say that the European Union is our destiny&#151; we do not hear quite so much from them at the moment, and that phrase seems to have disappeared, thank goodness&#151;or that it is the only game in town do not understand that what is happening now in the world is very different.</p>

<a name="80520-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0805213000064"></a>I hope that that message has reached some parts of the Government, such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which was, for years, very much convinced that we were on the losing side in Europe and had to be involved by giving everything to the European system in order not to be outwitted by the clever Quai d&#146;Orsay and the Auswrtiges Amt, and so on. I think that that message is reaching the Foreign Office: its latest annual report is an interesting document showing real signs of appreciating the strength of our position in the world network, and that we cannot rely totally on our European partners by seeing everything through that prism in dealing with the world. It still has not got the message on the Commonwealth&#151;the most powerful network of the future&#151;but I am happy that it is making progress.</p>

The great majority want to stay in, just as they also appear to want a referendum. About our Liberal Democrat colleagues, I feel that enough has been said.</p>

Many others in France and Germany and in the UK have said that we should now be thinking about moving on to the next treaty. Some say we need further integration, and other people say that centralisation is out of date and we need a new direction. There are a lot of opportunities, and they have to be taken.</p>

I cannot possibly forecast that, and he cannot expect me to answer. I can tell him that the Europe of tomorrow will be in perpetual flux. There will be new regulations, new provisions and attempts to change the treaty through the passerelle and possibly through new institutions. We shall not let the matter rest but will do a great deal. As my colleague William Hague said, we shall work hard to think of new constitutional safeguards in the future, and we shall see that any further proposed transfers of power or competences from the United Kingdom to the European Union would be subject to a referendum of the British people.

Although they talk about a referendum, which most people think is an in-or-out referendum, they want a referendum on Lisbon but want to stay in Europe. That is useful to know because it is not what is often implied in Conservative leaflets and Conservative propaganda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0805213000076"></a>While we are at it, I noticed that BBC News website has a comment on our vote earlier today:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="0805213000080"></a>It is fascinating to read. Until a few minutes ago, one of the great mysteries of this debate was where the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, was. I hope that the noble Lord can assure us that when we come to Report, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, will be brought to the Front Bench to join him in explaining Conservative policy because we have missed him over these seven long days.</p>

As to the need to be here at various stages in the Bill, it is possible that he will be and it is possible that those of us who are looking after the Bill will be able to guide the noble Lord and his friends through the quagmire into which he seems to have led them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0805213000078"></a>I was about to say that I was not going to say anything nice about the Liberal Democrats or anything nasty either. I want to assert that we are not trying to lead them into another trap because they have become a self-trapping party. As one of my noble colleagues said, they are permanently wedged in a situation that must be extremely uncomfortable and excites, in a way&#151;from one Member of this House to others and from one fellow ex-MP to others&#151;some sympathy. It is very difficult for them. For the rest of us, this amendment is not necessary. I have heard the views of some of my noble friends, and they can make up their own minds. The vast majority of the country is in favour of staying in, and of working probably rather harder than the Government have worked to improve and modernise the European Union. Therefore, a referendum on that issue is not necessary, although it is in the view of the Liberal Democrats. I would advise my noble friends to vote against it this evening. That is where we stand. We have a very clear view of the kind

<a name="0805217000002"></a><a name="80520-0016.htm_spnew34"></a><b><a name="80520-0016.htm_spnew35"></a><a name="0805217000123"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> I do not doubt for a moment the passion and conviction that noble Lords have brought to this final debate in our deliberations in Committee. I congratulate all noble Lords who have spoken or intervened. I have sometimes felt as though I am intruding, slightly, on some conversations that have taken place. I know that this issue is the pinnacle, in a sense, of the issues for the noble Lords who have tabled this amendment. It would be very good for us to be able to vote this evening, although that does not rest with me.</p>

<a name="80520-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0805217000003"></a>For me, one of the big issues has been to try to recognise the description of Europe that has been put forward by some noble Lords, not least because, as noble Lords know, I had the privilege of playing a tiny part through my work with the European Justice and Home Affairs Council. Indeed, when I was away this weekend, I spent time with Mr Solana, who is the high representative, Mr Barossa and colleagues from Italy, Malta, Slovakia, Sweden and so on, with whom I served on the Justice and Home Affairs Council. It was a great privilege to meet them again and reminisce about our discussions and deliberations about Europe. It is clear that what matters, above everything, when we have ratified this treaty, is that we get on to the agenda for Europe and our role in it, working with our 26 partner nations to tackle the issues that our people expect us to tackle, whether we are Government, Opposition or Parliament. Our responsibility as politicians must be to provide the people of this country with solutions to some of the big issues that face them.</p>

<a name="80520-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="0805217000004"></a>Noble Lords will know, because we talked about this on the first day in Committee, if not at Second Reading, about the agendas for the European Council, which have looked at such issues as the economic questions facing the globe, particularly the European response to them, and issues to do with climate change. We have worked together on the international situation, not least my noble friend Lord Malloch-Brown, who has just returned from Burma, having been the first British Minister to go there since 1986. These are the issues that we, working closely with our European Union allies, should be part of. I take nothing away from the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, in his commitment to the Commonwealth. I said at Second Reading that the Commonwealth is an important part of the work that we do internationally. I see the European Union and the Commonwealth as both/and, not as either/or. I know that the noble Lord feels strongly about that; I support him in so doing.</p>

<a name="80520-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="0805217000005"></a>I have also enjoyed the history debates. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, was there for many of these debates and, sadly, will not be writing his memoirs. Perhaps he will; you never know. It would be interesting to read them. I encroached on some party grief for the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, whose erstwhile friends are now in the UK Independence Party. That was  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1454"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1454</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>interesting as we look across the complete spectrum of opinion on the opposition Benches. We have, I would argue, a complete spectrum of opinion sitting on the Conservative Benches. Although the noble Lord was kind enough to open his filing cabinet and get a little bit out for us to look at, there are some serious issues for the Opposition to consider. I say this with great sincerity. I look at the quality of debate and understanding of the European Union, but also at the breadth and depth of disagreement that exists within the party in your Lordships&#146; House and, equally, in another place. That will be incredibly difficult for Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition to resolve.</p>

<a name="80520-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="0805217000006"></a>For me, the big issue is what this Bill seeks to do, which is a separate question. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, suggested that we had to have this debate because we somehow had not managed to do what we should have done on the treaty. I shall not repeat everything that I have said about the constitution and the treaty. I suspect that we will go through that at least one more time before we get to a resolution. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, was suggesting to me that we might even do that twice.</p>

<a name="80520-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="0805217000007"></a>I do not buy the two-tier system of Europe. For me, it is pretty hopeless. You are either part of it, working together and collaborating effectively, or you are not. I shall not repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, said on those countries that trade and work with Europe and would find themselves having to simply ratify or deal with regulations over which they had no control, no say and no participation. I do not want to be part of that Europe. It would be inappropriate and not right for the British people.</p>

<a name="80520-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="0805217000008"></a>During past weeks, we have talked about the benefits of being part of the European Union&#151;for instance, the jobs, the trade and the benefits to pensioners who live in other parts of the EU. That also applies to the City. On Rome I, the contract law, I had the privilege of working with many City firms, which were incredibly helpful as we moved towards the position where we are able to consult on opting in, having originally not opted in. I know the value and importance that the City of London places on trade with Europe within the right context. I am sure that the noble Lord would agree that in our contract law we did not risk losing the market to either America or the Far East, which we have successfully not done, by making sure that we have the capacity to separate out if we need to or to join in if we can. But I do not doubt the commitment of the City of London to this in anything that I have seen.</p>

<a name="80520-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="0805217000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, is right that we need a national debate. I put my hands up if I have failed to spend my time discussing Europe. All I can say is that I spent a huge amount of time in the presidency trying to interest our media outlets in what I was doing on civil justice issues, albeit to little avail. It was incredibly difficult to get them to take seriously what I felt was important provision for our citizens. But I do not take anything away. A national debate is quite different from setting up a referendum, on which the quality of debate may not be as good.</p>

<a name="80520-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0805217000010"></a>Members of the Committee have referred to opinion polls. I often say: how long have you got? If  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1455"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column 1455</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>you ask people about a referendum on anything, they will say that they want one. People feel that that is an important part of being involved, as noble Lords have said. But if you also ask people what we should not concentrate on, the EU treaty comes second in a long list. I will tell noble Lords later what comes first. Perhaps we can play a guessing game on that.</p>

<a name="80520-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0805217000011"></a>I accept that polls are important. I would say to the UK Independence Party that the poll that matters is the general election. The UK Independence Party is a political party. It will put up candidates. It will stand for election on a manifesto that will have as its centrepiece&#151;I have no idea what else might be in it&#151;the idea that Europe does not benefit this nation. Then the UK population can go out and vote. Noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches and on these Benches will campaign for people to say, &#147;Actually, we would like to be in Europe, given what Europe means for us&#148;. That is what I recommend, ultimately, the UK Independence Party does.</p>

<a name="80520-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0805217000012"></a>I have enjoyed listening to these debates. I hope that the noble Lord will test the opinion of the Committee, because that would be important. None the less, if he does not do that, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.</p>

I shall say just a few words about the contributions of those who did not. The noble Lord, Lord Radice, was generous in calling me an honest man and saying that I had finally let the cat out of the bag. However, I have been in favour of leaving the European Union since I was somewhat surprisingly put on your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the European Communities in 1992, when I made the mistake of reading and understanding the treaties of Rome. Ever since, I have been firmly convinced that this country must get out of the organisation as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="80520-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="0805217000014"></a>I shall leave the Liberal Democrats to the end. I shall deal first with the remarks made by my noble friend Lord Stoddart, who rightly says that, compared to him, I and the UK Independence Party are Johnnies-come-lately in this matter of our EU membership. He wisely made the point, as I would remark to the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that only 9 per cent of our economy trades with the European Union; 11 per cent trades with the rest of the world and some 80 per cent trades in the domestic economy. The mangy 9 per cent tail is wagging the 91 per cent healthy dog.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0805217000015"></a>The views of my noble and very old friend Lord Hamilton of Epsom were to some extent shared by my noble friends Lord Trenchard and Lord Astor. I am afraid that he descended into the well known Conservative position that UKIP is damaging the Conservative Party. That is flattering but always requires the rejoinder, &#147;What about the country? Which do we put first&#151;your party or the country?&#148;. I know which I would put first. My noble friends were also firm that, if there were to be a referendum on whether we should stay in the European Union, the country would vote to stay in. That would depend on leadership and vision, two

<a name="80520-0017.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0805217000016"></a>My position is nearer that taken by my noble friend Lord Blackwell, who cannot be with us this evening, as chairman of the Global Vision think tank, which is that we should return to a relationship of simple free trade with the European Union and abandon the rest of the political baggage. That means leaving the European Union, although Global Vision does not put it quite like that. I agree that when you put to the people the question, &#147;Do you want to leave the European Union?&#148;, the percentage wanting to goes down to 40 per cent, whereas if you say, &#147;Do you want to return to a simple free trade relationship?&#148;, you are up in the 80s. It is a question of education, leadership and the debate that would take place in this country were we to have the referendum that this amendment suggests.</p>

<a name="80520-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0805217000017"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that I did not accuse the entire Conservative Front Bench of being ignorant about matters European. I accuse the current leadership of that and the party of guilt in having taken us into this quagmire. The noble Lord said that the Conservative Party wants to see a strong EU responding to the networked world. He wants to see the kind of Europe that, he says, we would want to work for. I say to him that, while we stay in the European Union, with some 8 per cent of the votes and the rest of them determined to do something else, we have not a hope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0805217000018"></a>Finally, on the Liberal Democrats, I will concentrate my remarks on those of the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire&#151;</p>

I am most grateful to him for that and hope that he will test the opinion of the Committee. We will then make the treaty enter into force.</p>

That is why the amendment is worded as the noble Lord sees it on the Marshalled List. For myself, I would not even bother with a referendum. If I were the Conservative Party I would simply go into a general election saying, &#147;If we win we will come out&#148;, and it would do very well. I hope that answers his question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="0805217000024"></a>I must reaffirm to the noble Lord, Lord Lea, that I am a good European. I speak fluent Italian; I have 157 Italian cousins from my first wife; several dozen Austrians from my second wife; and I have business in every European country. I am a good European and I love the Europe of nation states. I just do not like the project so favoured by him and the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, and his Europhile and Eurocrat friends. That is the difference.</p>

<a name="80520-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="0805217000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, declared that he was unembarrassable and therefore he could not go into the Lobby with the UK Independence Party, by which I think he meant he would be too embarrassed to do so. I do not quite follow his logic there. He had a dig at the <I>e</I><I>urofacts</I> magazine&#151;which should be very much commended to your Lordships as a beacon of light and truth in this somewhat murky debate&#151;and he accused it of suggesting that the EU was about to inhibit the rights of spiritual mediums. I have not the faintest idea whether or not it is, but I would not put it past it. The EU has, after all, invaded the whole field of food supplements and herbal medicines to the detriment of our health food stores and so on. I am not suggesting that they are in the same category but it has passed many absurd directives, including the working at heights directive&#151;or the ladders directive&#151;which stops you climbing a ladder unless you have someone holding the bottom of it; and you cannot build a rocking horse if it is over two and a half feet high, or whatever that is in metres, and so on. The European Union is guilty of the most absurd legislation and interference in our national life.</p>

<a name="80520-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="0805217000026"></a>We were told by my noble friend&#151;as he then was&#151;Lord Hurd that Maastricht was the high watermark of integration; that no longer was the European Union going to interfere in the nooks and crannies of our public life. But, as I mentioned earlier, since then we have had the vibration directive, which refers to driving tractors and so on, and the 56-page condom directive. The beast is incorrigible. It goes on spewing out legislation because it has nothing else to do, which is extremely damaging to people on the receiving end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="0805217000028"></a>Finally, the Liberal Democrats say that their leader, Mr Clegg, is absolutely clear that he despairs of getting a proper debate on the European Union. The noble Baroness the Leader of the House also says it is difficult to get a proper debate on our membership of the European Union. So why do not the Liberal Democrats at least support a referendum on Lisbon? That would give a national debate. As I mentioned earlier, it would not go as far as we in the UK Independence Party want, but it would be a start and it would give that debate. I have to conclude that the Liberal Democrats do not want this debate. They want the project to proceed with as much bureaucratic and political shenanigan and support as they can

<h4 align="center"><a name="08052045000012"></a>The Committee met at half-past three.</h4>


<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000013"></a>[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Viscount Allenby of Megiddo) in the Chair.]</p>

I should make it clear that the Motion to approve the Statutory Instrument will be moved in Chamber in the normal way.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="08052045000003"></a>Parliamentary Constituencies (Northern Ireland) Order 2008</h3>

<p><a name="08052045000015"></a><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08052045000283"></a>Lord Rooker</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Parliamentary Constituencies (Northern Ireland) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000016"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of this order is to give effect, without modification, to the recommendations made by the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, which were received by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in September last year. The report was laid before Parliament on 31 March this year with this order, in line with the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000017"></a>The commission&#146;s report recommends that Northern Ireland should retain its 18 constituencies, with modifications recommended to the boundaries of 12 of them. In line with the statutory rules for the redistribution of seats, the recommendations seek to balance improvements in electoral equality with the preservation of community ties.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000018"></a>Extensive consultation has been carried out in relation to those recommendations. The commission published its provisional recommendations as long ago as spring 2004. The representations received on those recommendations led the commission to hold three public local inquiries, all of which took place in September 2005. The commission accepted the recommendations of the local inquiries wherever practicable, and, in doing so, acknowledged the importance of preserving community identity.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000019"></a>Following on from those local inquiries, the commission published its revised recommendations in May 2006. These recommended that Northern Ireland should have 18 constituencies with revisions made to the boundaries of 12 of them. Those became the commission&#146;s final recommendations to the Secretary of State and he has accepted them without modification. Therefore, subject to Parliament approving the order before us today, the new constituency boundaries will take effect upon the dissolution of Parliament prior to the next general election.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000020"></a>I thank the Boundary Commission&#151;that is, the chairman, Mr Speaker; the deputy chairman, Mr Justice Coghlin; his fellow commissioners, Mrs Joan Ruddock and Mr Dick Mackenzie; and their advisers and secretariat&#151;for its work. I am satisfied that the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Boundary Commission has carried out its work thoroughly and that all affected parties have had the opportunity to raise any concerns that they may have had, although they may not always have liked the answers. Having been on the receiving end of Boundary Commission inquiries myself over 27 years, I realise the sensitivities of boundaries for elected Members of Parliament. They probably are the rawest aspect of their role, particularly when their boundaries are being changed by someone else. Nevertheless, we have an independent rule and a set of recommendations from the commission that have been accepted without modification. I commend the order to the Committee and I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000021"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Parliamentary Constituencies (Northern Ireland) Order 2008. <I>17th report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.</I>&#151;(<I>Lord Rooker</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="08052045000022"></a><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08052045000284"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I thank the Minister for bringing this order before us. As he said, there is little to say once a Boundary Commission has ruled. I once tried, as a consultee, to contest a ruling when it was trying to lump a whole lot of wild countryside into an urban authority. My complaint had no effect and the said urban authority has never caught up in managing the countryside. There we are. I am concerned that we have increased the number of MPs from 12 to 18 but I do not think that is a matter for this debate&#151;it is the way life is. We are already overgoverned and this makes us even more overgoverned. I support the order.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000023"></a><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08052045000285"></a>Lord Smith of Clifton:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for introducing this order. I have two comments to make, one by way of a question. First, can the Minister give me guidance on the extent of coterminosity between the Northern Ireland Assembly seats and the parliamentary constituencies? Is this a criterion which the Boundary Commission bears in mind? Secondly, although the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, commented on the number of Westminster seats in Northern Ireland, and said that this is not an appropriate occasion on which to raise this question, there are very few appropriate occasions on which to raise it. Bearing in mind, thank goodness, that we now have a sustained devolutionary settlement in Northern Ireland with the working of the Assembly, to what extent is Northern Ireland overrepresented in Westminster compared with, say, England?</p>

<p><a name="08052045000024"></a><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08052045000286"></a>Lord Laird:</b> I thank the Minister for outlining this mostly non-controversial order. I join him in thanking the people who worked on the Boundary Commission for the good work that they did and the time they put in. I have a couple of questions. Is it possible to get the number of electors in constituencies; for example, Foyle, Newry and Armagh? The Minister referred to community identities as one consideration and numbers as another. Those are two very important considerations, but which has precedence? Is it community identities  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC485"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC485</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or numbers? It seems to me that some areas were taken out of Foyle because it was said to be too big but, if I read the matter correctly, areas were added to Newry and Armagh, which makes it considerably bigger. Is that issue being looked at under community identities because it makes that constituency disproportionately big? When were changes made previously? I listened very closely to what he said about whether Northern Ireland is over-represented in the House of Commons. If I understand the situation correctly, we now share equal representation with people in Scotland, who, as part of an agreement of 1801, were overrepresented even before they got their devolved Parliament. We broadly agree with the order.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000025"></a><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="08052045000287"></a>Lord Browne of Belmont:</b> I take this opportunity to congratulate the chief commissioner, Richard Mackenzie, and the other staff in the commission on their work in bringing forward the review of the parliamentary boundaries in Northern Ireland. Arriving at the final recommendations is an exhaustive process which takes considerable time, especially if you consider that the provisional recommendations were announced in April 2004 and the review was announced in 2003. During this exercise there has been good co-operation with the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland, the Valuation and Lands Agency, the Statistics and Research Agency and, of course, the Ordnance Survey. I particularly welcome the recommendation to retain the 18 parliamentary seats in Northern Ireland. Of course, some difficulties arose from the postponement in the appointment of a local government boundaries commissioner and the uncertainties about the proposed restructuring of local government in Northern Ireland. Therefore, I particularly welcome the Northern Ireland Assembly&#146;s recent agreement to the review of public administration resulting in the rationalisation of the current 26 local councils to 11.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000026"></a>It is difficult to comment on the 12 constituencies in which the changes have been made. I do not intend to do that, but I refer to Belfast, which has undergone some demographic changes over a number of years. It is important, however, that the natural boundaries of Belfast are reflected in the boundaries of the constituency. I welcome the fact that the commissioner has taken into account that the system is to be built on the wards.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000027"></a>Finally, my noble friend Lord Morrow and I welcome the revisions, and so support the order.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000028"></a><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="08052045000288"></a>Lord Lyell:</b> I hesitate to take up 30 seconds of the Minister&#146;s time, but will he be kind enough to confirm that there are no major changes to the particular geographical areas, or wards, in the schedules? I seem to remember when I served in what is now the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&#151;in my time, it was called the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&#151;that a matter of 100 metres or so of boundaries could affect the water supply and other aspects of the environment as well as restrictions on particular areas.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000029"></a>I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to line 3 of paragraph 2 at the bottom of page 5. Am I right in thinking that Audley&#146;s Acre in South Down, the  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC486"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC486</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>county constituency, is not a complete island but is in the vicinity of a particular area, which I think was known as Audley&#146;s Castle or Audley&#146;s Point, at the south end of Strangford Loch by Strangford village? Will he confirm that it is there and not an island elsewhere? Certainly from my memory and from reading about these wards, I do not think that there should be any major differences or shake-up. I do not want to waste his time or that of the Committee. If he has the answer, wonderful: if not, perhaps he could write to me. I thank him.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000030"></a><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="08052045000289"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> On the latter point, before I receive any advice, we are talking about complete wards, so whatever the boundaries are, Audley&#146;s Acre is a complete ward. It is what it says. The wards have boundaries. The order says,</p>
<ul><a name="08052045000266"></a>&#147;the following wards of Down local government district&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08052045000257"></a>and mentions the names of the wards. Audley&#146;s Acre is therefore a complete ward. Whatever it is, it is already an electoral building block, as it were. There are no divided-up wards.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000031"></a>I hope that I can answer all the questions that I have been asked. I should add that we will have taken a number of these questions in the elected place. The commission was required to adjust the boundaries of between 16 and 18 constituencies, and it has chosen 18. The electoral quota is not being considered at present. The quota used in this review for Northern Ireland was 61,000&#151;or 60,999, to be precise. The quota for England and Scotland is about 70,000, and the quota for Wales is 56,000. The boundaries are looked at every eight to 12 years. They are more or less within the quota&#151;less than minus 10 per cent and no greater than plus 15 per cent. There will be big and small&#151;that is unavoidable&#151;but there must be a range. There is nothing way out.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000032"></a>I think that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, made a slip of the tongue. Some minor changes have been made to 12 of the 18 existing constituencies, but the number of constituencies has not changed; it remains at 18. In answer to another question, the constituencies were last reviewed in 1995.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000033"></a>There is no problem with coterminosity with the Assembly. There will be six Assembly seats per Westminster constituency, and they will be designed to fit into the arrangements there. There is therefore a degree of coterminosity. In other words, no Assembly Member will cover more than one Westminster constituency, which is quite important.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Laird, asked about Foyle. We can produce statistics for this. The electorate for Foyle will be 60,823, and the electorate for Newry and Armagh will be 68,730. So, the figure is just over 10 per cent greater, but it is not a massive difference&#151;certainly not like the differences that there can be in England.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000035"></a>A local government review is underway and if ward boundaries change, there may be an interim review at some time to tweak them; but by and large, once agreed today, because the House of Commons has agreed the order, these will be the boundaries for the next general election to the Westminster Parliament. There is no equivocation whatever about  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC487"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC487</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that; everyone knows exactly where they stand, they know exactly what the electorates are, they know where the boundaries are and so they can go campaigning. There is always an uncertainty for Members of Parliament until the orders have been approved. I think that I have covered all the questions.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000036"></a><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew15"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="08052045000290"></a>Lord Laird:</b> I am still trying to work something out. As I understand it, areas were taken out of Foyle, because it was seen to be too big. Areas were put into Newry and Mourne, which is now some 8,000 electors larger than Foyle. Obviously the areas were not moved from one to the other, because they are at different ends of the country. However, I return to the point on which the Minister may wish to comment&#151;which is more important, numbers or community identities? I am trying to discover why areas were put into Newry and Armagh, while areas were taken out of Foyle. The reasons may not be the same in Foyle as those for Newry and Mourne.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000037"></a><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew17"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0001.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="08052045000291"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I am not here to second-judge the independent Boundary Commission. Its report has been accepted without modification by the Secretary of State. The commission&#146;s report and the public inquiries are a matter of record and they explain the position, on balance. It is not the case that a Minister or anyone else can argue that this was judged on numbers, rather than communities. One has to strike a balance between them and that is what the Boundary Commission has done. It can justify its decisions. Those decisions have been accepted by the Secretary of State and, I hope, by Parliament, so the electorate knows that it was not the politicians who fixed the boundaries&#151;it was the independent parliamentary Boundary Commission.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000040"></a>The noble Lord said: I am pleased to speak to the Grand Committee about the regulations which make important and necessary changes to the original Mutilations (Permitted Procedures) (England) Regulations 2007. The 2007 regulations provide exemptions to the general provision in Section 5 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 that all mutilation of animals other than for medical treatment is prohibited. By &#147;mutilation&#148; I mean the carrying out of a procedure,</p>
<ul><a name="08052045000267"></a>&#147;which involves interference with the sensitive tissues or bone structure of the animal&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000041"></a>Before making the 2007 regulations, we consulted stakeholders widely on any procedures that should or should not be allowed. When the regulations came into force, we believed that in most cases the status  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC488"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC488</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>quo in common practice had been replicated where a procedure was felt to have a long-term welfare or management benefit.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000042"></a>However, after the 2007 regulations came into force, we were made aware of certain procedures that were in common practice before the Animal Welfare Act and the 2007 mutilations regulations came into force, but which were not highlighted by the relevant sectors during the original consultation. After consideration of the welfare costs and benefits of the procedures, it was judged that they were in the long-term welfare or management benefit of the animals involved and that they should, therefore, be added to the list of permitted procedures. It is to this end that these amending regulations have been produced.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000043"></a>In parenthesis, I should say that the same rules apply in Scotland and Wales, which will amend their regulations in due course. In other words, the relevant bodies and stakeholders did not come forward in any part of Great Britain to alert those who drafted the original regulations.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000044"></a>The amending regulations will have a number of beneficial effects on animal welfare and conservation. They will allow certain artificial insemination techniques to be used in sheep and goats for breed improvement programmes, which will facilitate the continued genetic development of the sheep and goat flocks, including in resistance to scrapie.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000045"></a>The regulations will allow the wing and web-tagging of birds to be used for conservation and research purposes, which will in particular aid certain wild bird reintroduction programmes. We also intend to introduce an exemption order under the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 to allow conservationists other than veterinary surgeons to perform those procedures. Initial informal consultation with officials at the royal college suggests that that would be uncontroversial, and we hope to have the exemption order in place by the autumn of this year. Lastly, the regulations will allow poultry and duck breeders to wing-tag, web-tag, neck-tag and web-notch birds involved in breed improvement programmes, therefore permitting breeders to use the most welfare-friendly forms of identification of breeding birds.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000046"></a>In conclusion, the mutilations listed in the amending regulations will have a positive effect on animal welfare, management and conservation. I regret that I have had to come forward with these amending regulations during the passage of the other regulations. Following widespread consultation, those techniques were not highlighted as being required for exemptions. Nevertheless, it is best that we do this as soon as possible. I beg to move.</p>

We value the fact that the Government have reviewed the operation of the 2007 regulations and been prepared to revisit them to ensure that practices with long-term welfare management benefits for the animals involved will be permitted. They are later in being laid than the consultation paper intended. What does the Minister consider to be the consequences of that delay? As my honourable friend Mr Wiggin pointed out in another place, it has already resulted in a loss of income to the farm veterinary profession, which already has pressures on it and is short of recruits.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000049"></a>The danger with this sort of legislation is that, short of constant updating, procedures become outdated as new ideas and practices developed elsewhere. The failure to recognise sheep and goats in the first permitted procedures has disadvantaged British producers. One can see from the internet that this is a fast developing area of scientific advance. It would be a disservice to our livestock sector if those advances were prevented from being incorporated into our industry by an overly restrictive regime.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000050"></a>The Minister accepts that the consultation process held before the introduction of the 2007 regulations failed to pick up on these issues. He made it clear that he thought that the industry should have been able to present them to the Government at the time. Were the Government sufficiently practical in seeking advice on those issues? What were the Government's advisers saying on the inclusion of sheep and goats in the regulations, for example? What steps are the Government taking to ensure that when regulations of this type of consequence on primary legislation come into effect, we sweep up all the issues that are likely to be involved, so that we do not have to revisit regulations in so short a time?</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000051"></a>There is in principle a danger in relying on a regulatory regime that defines in detail permitted procedures but which, by definition, excludes all others. If the permitted procedure is not defined, it is by definition not allowed. It can mean that progress is dependent on a new regulation coming in to permit the new scientific advance. Given the high animal welfare standards in this country&#151;I am sure that the noble Lord agrees&#151;the regulation could be amended to reflect the current animal health and welfare requirements, while retaining the flexibility to use new and innovative techniques as they become available. In other words, is a prescriptive regulatory regime the best way of dealing with such issues? The deficiency of playing catch-up is best demonstrated by the ovum transplantation and other artificial insemination methods being extended to include sheep and goats.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000052"></a>New techniques can be highly beneficial to animal welfare and good management. What about camelids, such as alpacas and llamas? In the US, the research into transplantation and embryo transfer is much more advanced than here and includes frozen blastocysts. That could have considerable advantages for breeders in this area of animal husbandry, particularly as artificial insemination in camelids is impracticable, the collection of semen from males is difficult and camelids are induced ovulators.</p>

How do the Government propose to ensure that the procedures in the proposed A2 and A3 in Schedule 4 may only be carried out within 36 hours of hatching?

I have one question, since this provision has been updated to cover areas that were not formerly included. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill is going through Parliament. Ova are collected from cattle, and human DNA is used with cattle ovum. Is the recovery of the ova from cattle covered by the regulations, or will we have to come back to that later?</p>

I want to speak briefly about wing-tagging. It is a good development in the law to permit it. Many years ago, I was concerned with some research looking at gulls and terns in East Anglia. There, the common method of tagging of chicks was with leg bands. The mortality from that was remarkable, simply because the rings caught on grass and debris on the ground, and the chicks died. Wing-tagging is very much more effective. Frankly, I cannot understand why the RSPCA should object to it. It is a very good development, which will result in much more effective information on a range of wild birds for research and breeding purposes, and it will be safer than leg tags.</p>

I should like to seek clarification on that point.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000059"></a>Secondly, my noble friend referred to alpacas and llamas. Have the Government changed their view on making a list of places where alpacas and llamas are actually being kept? Some of them are in quite big herds and clearly their welfare is a concern to us all. I should hate us to pass regulations and then say, &#147;My goodness, why did we not think of that at the time?&#148;.

<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC491"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC491</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08052045000061"></a><a name="80520-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08052045000297"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I am grateful for the comments of noble Lords and I shall do my best to answer the questions put to me. On the consequences of delay and the resulting loss of income to vets raised by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, there was an original plan that these regulations would come into force in April 2008, but the date was moved forward to June in order to allow the consultation period to be extended. The consultation was deemed necessary as the original consultation brought up too many issues which we felt that stakeholders should be given the opportunity to comment on. The regulations were changed to reflect those issues. Web-tagging was added to the list of permitted procedures and the purposes for which wing and web-tagging can be performed were extended to include breed improvement programmes. When making the decision to extend the consultation, stakeholders in the sheep and goat breeding industry were consulted, and we were informed that moving the coming-into-force date to June would have no significant effect.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000062"></a>We have had no information on the impact of the fact that these procedures have effectively been about since last year, or at least I do not have a note to that effect. I personally have heard nothing from the RSPCA. The department may have had something, but as a Peer you disappear off the radar when you are a Minister. Some of these organisations do not send you anything. I open my own post, so I know that I have had nothing about these regulations. I do not know why the RSPCA is upset, but frankly all the information we have is from welfare organisations. Moreover, as the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, said and it has been explained to me, it is much more welfare-friendly to avoid having to ring the legs of chicks for breeding programmes. The chicks are so tiny that by definition the band has to be very small. It can restrict growth as well as risk causing damage if it snags. There are major issues of welfare improvement here.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000063"></a>The noble Lord asked about the reason for the 36-hour limit. This provision concerns welfare in a breed improvement programme, so it is quite specific about when neck-tagging or web-notching can be carried out since they are legally classified as mutilation procedures. It may be because the skin at that age is very loose so it is easy to insert a small tag into the chick&#146;s neck. Later it becomes more difficult. We have been informed by the industry that it is not done any later, so the regulations are following advice. </p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000064"></a>Both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord asked about camelids, a question also raised in the other place. For a mutilation to be added to the list of permitted procedures, we consider that it needs to be shown that it has a welfare or management benefit, and that such a benefit could be weighed against any welfare costs. During the consultation, we were not presented with sufficient evidence to show that there are welfare or management benefits associated with the artificial insemination of any species other than sheep and goats. Several stakeholders did raise the issue of allowing certain artificial insemination techniques in camelids, but stated that research in this area is still at an early stage. We do not think that there is enough evidence to justify including camelids in the regulations. However, if in the future the artificial insemination of camelids or any other

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000065"></a>We may have covered all the techniques currently in use&#151;the regulations are bringing us up-to-date with techniques currently in use that were missed out of the exemptions. Other scientific research on new techniques&#151;we can always improve and get new techniques&#151;is likely to be covered by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act and a licence for research granted under that Act. That would alert us to possible new techniques, which we may want to cover in the permitted exemptions. So it is not as though some new technique will be invented and put into industrial use without our knowing about it, because a research licence must be issued in the first place and that will alert us to a new technique. As I said, the amendments are essentially covering existing techniques that were missed from the regulations when they were originally brought forward.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000066"></a>The noble Lord mentioned that wing-tagging was much improved. The type of tags vary according to the size of bird. I must tell the noble Baroness that I have nothing whatever to say about sheep identification&#151;well, I have a lot to say, but I have no brief in front of me, and I am not going to speak off the top of my head.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000067"></a>The granddaddy of all questions, to which I have not had an answer, came from the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale. I did not expect to be discussing the embryology Bill currently being debated on the Floor in the other place this afternoon. All I can assume is that all the techniques covered by that Bill are fully regulated for all concerned, whether the animals or the humans, by the authority set up by Parliament to deal with that. I do not think it is a matter for Defra, but if I am wrong I will write to the noble Lord. I have to say: 10 out of 10 for the question.</p>

There will be a formal consultation before the exemption order under the Veterinary Surgeons Act is made, but the indications from our discussion with officials of the royal college is that it will be uncontroversial to allow non-vets to carry out some of these procedures, and we will need to change the law for that. That will require consultation, which will take place in autumn this year.</p>

I am not seeking to apportion blame, but the somehow something quite significant in ensuring that the regulations worked&#151;we are now addressing the deficiency&#151;went wrong. Has the department looked at that and should the department have a more proactive role in ensuring that it stimulates the necessary response?</p>

That is why they did not respond. It is not that they were unaware when the Animal Welfare Bill was going through the House: it was of major concern to all keepers of animals. They simply did not consider this to be covered by the mutilation provisions for the exemption order. It was not a failure, because we had consulted. We have hundreds of consultees on the address list, it is amazing, but we do not know everything.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000074"></a>The fact is that, as I have discovered in other issues, especially with mercury in barometers, industry does not always respond. In this case, it was genuine in the sense that it did not think that it was covered and we did not know about that aspect. I am hopeful that there will be no more cases, that what is being done to bring these regulations to the House will have alerted anyone to any other issues. I know that the matter has been raised in the other place as well. It is something that we will have to watch for, because techniques are employed, and people bring new techniques in from abroad and think it is perfectly all right to do so. We need to know about these things. We will see whether we can redouble our efforts on consultation to spell things out. If people have a doubt about the technique, or about whether what they are doing is covered, they at least should be proactive and ask whether it is covered, so that we can take advice when we are drafting the regulations. It is a fair point, and we will see that it is followed through.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000077"></a>The noble Lord said: As noble Lords will recall, the financial assistance scheme&#151;FAS&#151;offers help to certain people whose benefit occupational pension schemes have not provided them with the pension that they were expecting. The regulations present the first key steps towards the delivery of the full package of reforms to the FAS that we announced in December last year.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC494"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC494</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000078"></a>As noble Lords may be aware, the December announcement covered changes to the structure of the FAS as well as to the benefits that will be paid. Where schemes were not already committed to buying annuities from insurers, we announced that the Government would take in the residual assets of those schemes and make associated payments as they fell due. Taking in those assets helps finance greater benefits to existing FAS members, which will be broadly comparable to those provided by the Pension Protection Fund. The residual assets will also help provide for assistance to be extended to those members of schemes connected to solvent employers.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000079"></a>In December, we guaranteed that all members would receive 90 per cent of their accrued pension, subject to the cap, instead of 80 per cent as before. We also said that we would pay assistance from a member&#146;s normal retirement age, or 60 if their normal retirement age was earlier, rather than from 65. We said that certain members would be able to apply for early reduced payments on ill health grounds. We also committed to indexing FAS assistance broadly in line with PPF rules. We said that we would ensure that members whose scheme assets were taken into the Government would not be denied the lump sum that they could otherwise have expected to receive from those assets.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000080"></a>While some of those changes are relatively simple to deliver, others are complex. Earlier this year, I wrote to the noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Oakeshott, detailing our plans to deliver the reforms in phases to help ensure that changes are made as quickly as possible. First, the regulations before us today will implement the first two cornerstones of the reforms: payment at the 90 per cent rate and payment from the NRA. It is important to realise that for many current FAS recipients those changes alone will make FAS assistance broadly comparable to PPF compensation, but there is still some way to go to deliver the full reform package for all beneficiaries.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000081"></a>Next, I expect to bring a further package of regulations to your Lordships before the Summer Recess. That package will allow early access to payments on ill health grounds, subject to actuarial reduction, extend the scheme to certain solvent employer schemes and prepare the ground for further PPF involvement in designing and implementing the reformed scheme. Finally, by the end of this year, we intend to consult on further regulations to deliver the full package of changes. In addition, to support the changes that we intend to make through regulations, we also plan some amendments to primary legislation through the Pensions Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000082"></a>I thank the FAS Operational Unit for its continuing work to deliver payments in a rapidly evolving environment. Your Lordships may recall some of the issues we have faced in the past whereby eligible FAS members have not received payment because information has not been provided to the Operational Unit by pension schemes. Your Lordships may also recall the review carried out last year by Mercer Human Resource Consulting, which reported that the process of gathering  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC495"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>data to operate the FAS is fit for purpose and is managed in a satisfactory manner. That conclusion is ably supported by the number of payments now being made.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000083"></a>As of 9 May 2008, 5,531 beneficiaries are in receipt of FAS payments and a total of around &#163;18.5 million has been paid to date. This is a step change in comparison to the position at the same time last year when around 1,100 people were in payment and around &#163;4.4 million had been paid out. Passage of these regulations will help increase payments further. The operational unit has assessed more than 1,500 members who will be eligible for payment when they reach their NRA. Of these, more than 300 will be eligible for payment immediately when these draft regulations come into force. We estimate that some 5,000 people are currently between their NRA and 65, and thus stand to benefit in the coming months as their information is provided to us.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000084"></a>As well as delivering the 90 per cent rate from NRA, the draft regulations make a number of changes to FAS legislation to support those enhancements. Complementary changes are made to the Pensions Act 2007 to ensure that primary legislation is consistent with the changes we are making to secondary legislation. The draft regulations also include some amendments to FAS revaluation rules and transitional protection for certain members affected by those changes. Under current FAS rules, assistance payments are revalued to 65, regardless of the member&#146;s NRA. Revaluation from NRA to 65 was a feature of the original FAS as we felt that it would be unfair to expect people to wait up to five years from their NRA to receive assistance without that assistance benefiting from some form of index-linking.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000085"></a>Under the changes to FAS made by these draft regulations, FAS payments will now be made from NRA or, if later, age 60. This means that assistance payments for some people already receiving FAS will be reassessed and new entitlements will be paid for the period from NRA. The bringing forward of payments for those members means that the period of revaluation will be shorter. In some cases, where there is a significant period between NRA and 65, the reduction of the period of revaluation may mean that ongoing payments will not increase significantly when payments are reassessed from 80 per cent to 90 per cent. In extreme cases, ongoing payments might even fall. However, any members in this position will receive significant payments to cover the period from their NRA.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000086"></a>The draft regulations also include related changes to the revaluation that applies to deferred members&#146; accrued pensions. In certain current cases, such revaluation can apply beyond the age of 65. Changes are made by the draft regulations to ensure that accrued pensions cannot revalue beyond that age. These changes might mean that some beneficiaries whose entitlement dates do not change may not see a significant increase in their ongoing payments. It is unlikely that such members will see their existing payments fall as a result of the changes. However, in the event that members might otherwise be in this position, the draft regulations provide transitional

The draft regulations also amend payment ages for certain FAS beneficiaries who qualify as a result of death benefits payable by qualifying schemes.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000087"></a>Depending on individual pension scheme rules, some spouses, unmarried partners or dependent children of members of pension schemes who die before the start of scheme wind-up qualify for pensions from their schemes. Under current FAS rules, such members, in common with other qualifying members, receive payment from age 65. In order to reflect the revised payment rules that will apply to other FAS members, such people will be eligible for payment from the later of 14 May 2004 and the date that they became eligible for payment under the qualifying scheme&#146;s rules.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000088"></a>Some of these recipients may have qualified for payments as dependent children. Under typical pension scheme rules, payments to dependent children are made only until a fixed age; that is, 18 or until they leave full time education. To reflect such arrangements, the regulations specify that assistance payments to any such recipients end on the date that they would have stopped receiving their pension from their pension scheme.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000089"></a>As your Lordships may recall, opposition spokesmen in the other place agreed to proposals made by the Minister of State for Pensions for a written consultation period of two weeks for these regulations. This helped to facilitate their speedy implementation. We have published a full response to the issues raised during that consultation period, and two substantive matters were raised that may be of interest to your Lordships.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000090"></a>First, it was noted by some respondents that FAS payments will continue to be made only from 14 May 2004&#151;the date FAS was first announced&#151;even if members reached their NRA before that age. We continue to believe that it is right that FAS payments relate only to periods after the date FAS was first announced. And retaining the 14 May 2004 date assists in current administrative delivery and helps control costs. However, we will continue to consider this point before consulting on further draft regulations later this year.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000091"></a>Secondly, it was noted that the definition of NRA used in the draft regulations might not reflect members&#146; expectations of the age at which they would have been able to take some or all of their scheme pension. We will continue to consider the issues raised in relation to the definition of NRA in the context of achieving broad comparability with the PPF, subject to further consultation and draft regulations later in the year. However, we have retained the definition of NRA in the draft regulations to enable enhanced payments to be delivered as quickly as possible, using information already held by the operational unit.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000092"></a>We have built strongly on the foundations provided by the Young review. The announcement that we made in December will ensure all of the estimated 140,000 people who have suffered pension losses as a consequence   


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC497"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC497</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of their schemes winding-up underfunded between 1 January 1997 and the advent of the Pension Protection Fund will receive benefits broadly comparable to the PPF. We are maintaining momentum by these regulations which will deliver key elements of the reforms to the immediate benefit of many members.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000093"></a>In my view, these regulations are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and I therefore commend them to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000094"></a>Moved, that the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Financial Assistance Scheme (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2008. <I>18th report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.</I>&#151;(<I>Lord McKenzie of Luton</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="08052045000095"></a><a name="80520-gc0002.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0002.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="08052045000305"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> I thank the Minister for his introduction of these regulations. I welcome the order as an important step in a five-year battle by 125,000 of the earliest victims of the Prime Minister&#146;s economic incompetence to get as much as possible of the pensions they were due. Let me remind the Committee that during that time some died, others had to work beyond normal retirement age, sometimes with serious medical conditions, and all faced the prospect of penury.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000096"></a>I would not usually rehearse the history of this unhappy matter, but the circumstances surrounding it are exceptional. The measures in the regulations could have happened much earlier if the Government had not chosen to reject out of hand the Conservatives&#146; lifeboat fund amendments to the Pensions Act 2007, which your Lordships supported. Those amendments could have raised the compensation by the FAS to the 90 per cent offered by the Pensions Protection Fund. The treasury would have immediately made a loan to ensure that higher payments could be distributed as soon as possible. That loan would then have been paid back fully out of unclaimed assets, ensuring no cost to taxpayers.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80520-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000097"></a>What happened instead was the Government&#146;s hurried announcement that unclaimed assets should be spent on youth centres, and that our policy was an unfunded spending commitment. The Lords amendment was duly rejected by another place on the grounds of financial privilege, and we in this House could not push the issue further.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000098"></a>It has taken nearly a year to happen, but once again the Government have adopted a Conservative policy to repair the disastrous consequences of Labour financial mismanagement. It has taken constant pressure from my party, and even more from dedicated lobby groups, before the Government have finally realised the scale of the problem. They have still not accepted their own part in its creation. The Prime Minister&#146;s tax rise on pension funds, the department&#146;s misleading leaflets, the Government&#146;s refusal to accept the independent ombudsman&#146;s report&#151;they have denied it all, delaying and quibbling over every solution that has eventually been forced on them. They have had to accept that they grossly underestimated the number of people affected by the crisis that they have created. They had to commit to funding the FAS properly, and now,

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000099"></a>It is imperative that there are no more delays. Prior to last year&#146;s election that never was, my party promised that, if we won, we would ensure within three months of taking office that payments reached those who were waiting. Will the Minister give us a clear idea of when the Government will implement this U-turn and when the pensioners will finally get what is due to them?</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000100"></a>During the consultation on the regulations, questions were asked as to whether the Government would continue to hold the view that the FAS payments relate only to periods after the date on which the FAS was first announced. Although it has previously been made clear that enhanced payments would be made only for the period from 14 May 2004, the consultation document disclosed that the Government would continue to consider this point. Will the Minister expand on the department&#146;s current thinking?</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000101"></a>A number of respondents were also concerned about the implications of maintaining the existing definition of the normal retirement age in the draft regulations. It is possible that doing so will enable the enhanced payments to be delivered more quickly, easing the administrative burden. However, does the department have plans to alter the definition of the normal retirement age? If so, will the Minister elaborate on the process?</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000102"></a>It is also worth taking a moment to consider the wider pensions picture. Although today&#146;s measures repair the damage caused to individual families, the lasting impact of this sorry story on confidence in the pensions system still remains unknown. Years of headlines detailing pensioners battling with the Government to receive compensation will undoubtedly have influence on a younger generation&#146;s investment habits. I fear that the consequences of the Government&#146;s resistance to compensate these victims of the pensions crisis are far from over. It is therefore essential that we rebuild confidence in our pensions system and restore the prospect of security in retirement to millions of people.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000103"></a>Finally, I once more pay my respects to all the campaigners who have spent their time and money trying to get this Government to write their pension wrongs. For most, there will be few victory celebrations, but there will at least be the welcome satisfaction of at last receiving the compensation that they deserve.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000105"></a>I think I can say that I feel fortunate not to have had to take part in all the debates in the past five years that finally led to the Statement on 17 December 2007. We on these Benches felt, as did the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that the Government took a very long time to reach a sensible position. They have finally done so. The regulations and their provisions are long overdue, so we welcome them.</p>

I, too, acknowledge the effort that campaigners have put into what has been a very solid campaign, and I hope that, however we see the history of this matter, we agree that we have ended up in a good place. One of the challenges of government is dealing with public finances. The cash cost of where we ended up is some &#163;12.5 billion and the net present value is around &#163;2.9 billion, so this is a significant use of public resources.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, referred to financial mismanagement and economic incompetence. I reject those charges, of course. We have had debates in the past, particularly around these regulations, against the pensions backdrop. A good starting point for an objective and proper analysis of that are the reports of the noble Lord, Lord Turner, and his commission, which set out the real reasoning behind the challenges that the pensions industry has faced and faces in the future, such as issues of longevity and overestimating the long-term financial returns from investments. Those are the root causes of the situation we face.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000108"></a>There is a statistic, and if I can remember it rightly I will bore the Committee with it. I think it comes from Department for Work and Pensions statisticians, who estimated a possibility, or maybe a probability, that there is a person alive today aged 59, likely to be a woman, who could live to be 120.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000109"></a><a name="80520-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08052045000308"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> It is me.</p>

Next year, that person would be entitled to their old-age pension halfway through their life. That starkly illustrates the challenges that not only state pension provision but private sector provision faces. Broadly, on the legislation that we debated last year, and we will shortly be debating the second Pensions Bill, there is a broad consensus underlying where we are heading on these matters.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000111"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, referred to the lifeboat fund. We do not resile from the criticism that we made at the time that, due to a technical matter, it was a rather leaky lifeboat. We went the right way to seeing how we could make better use of the assets in those schemes, and Andy Young&#146;s report was helpful in enabling us to improve the package that we have reflected in part in these regulations.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000112"></a>The noble Lord asked about the timetable. I can best illustrate it as follows. In June this year, we hope to have these first regulations in force and the first payments at 90 per cent, and first payments from NRA or 60 rather than 65, will start to flow. By the end of July we expect the second regulations package to come into force, which will cover ill-health payments, certain solvent schemes being included in FAS and the groundwork for greater PPF involvement and speeding up payments. In August,  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC500"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC500</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we hope that the first of those ill-health payments will be flowing. By the end of the year, we propose to consult on further regulations to deliver the full December package. That will include the post-1997 indexation payment of FAS lump sums and the bringing of assets into government to enable these wider benefits to be provided. From April 2009, there will be a phased implementation of the full package. There is a lot of technical stuff that has to be addressed between now and getting that full package implemented, which is why we wanted to get these regulations under way as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000113"></a><a name="80520-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08052045000310"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> Is the Minister happy that that is the tightest possible timetable for implementation? It means, effectively, that there will be a 12-month delay before many people are fully in the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000114"></a><a name="80520-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08052045000311"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> As I indicated earlier, there is the prospect of several thousand people coming into the scheme much more quickly than that, because the 90 per cent payment and the NRA change will be important. This is a realistic and effective way to proceed. I stress that there are quite a lot of technical and operational issues here, and we need to make sure that we get it right. That is why it is right that we invested in setting up the FAS effectively right from the start. We were criticised at one stage about the funding that had gone in, in relation to the payments that were then flowing. Our point then&#151;which is valid and important now&#151;was that if we had not put that infrastructure in place, it would be even more challenging to get some of the subsequent improvements to the scheme properly in place. That is an effective timetable, and we are working to it.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000115"></a>The noble Lord asked about the May 2004 cut-off point. I touched on that in my opening remarks. It is right to retain it, because it is the date that the FAS was announced, but we will continue to consult. As I outlined, we have a number of consultations lined up for the future, and we will keep that under review. At the moment, we are sticking to that date. Similarly, in relation to the NRA, it is right to keep the definition that we have but to keep it under review to make sure that we have effectively covered all the reasonable and appropriate circumstances that exist. The challenges around those two areas emphasise how complex some of this is and why we need to take the appropriate time to make sure that it is absolutely right. I hope that I have dealt with the questions that have been raised. I am grateful for the support that the two opposition parties have given to the regulations.</p>

<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC501"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC501</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000118"></a>The noble Lord said: The order derives from the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 which contains powers that enable the Government, by way of an order, to remove existing statutory barriers that may prevent building societies from accessing emergency financial assistance from the Bank of England.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000119"></a>The building society sector continues to provide highly regarded services to members and customers throughout the United Kingdom. During the passage of the Bill, the Government promised, as a precaution, to put such an order before Parliament as soon as possible. I am pleased that we are fulfilling that promise and that Members of the Committee have an opportunity to debate the order. I remind the Committee that the Government are fully committed to legislative reforms that will improve financial stability and depositor protection generally. Global financial markets remain turbulent, and it is important that we have a strengthened framework in place both for now and for the future. The order forms a part of that programme of reform.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000120"></a>In January, the Government&#146;s proposals were published. They included measures to improve building societies&#146; access to emergency financial assistance from the Bank of England, both in the range of methods that the Bank can use and the amount of assistance that building societies can potentially draw on. I should make it clear that in this regard the proposals are purely precautionary. They are intended to place building societies on a similar footing to banks, not single them out for special treatment. We regard the order before the Committee as sensible and prudent contingency planning on the part of the authorities, and it would be relied on only where there was a serious threat to the financial stability of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000121"></a>The Committee will also be interested to know that in response to consultation on the policy that this order will enact, the overwhelming majority was supportive. The Building Societies Association has made it clear that it welcomes steps to put building societies in the same position as banks. Improving building societies&#146; access to emergency funding from the Bank of England strengthens the resilience of an institution against failure, and thus protects against the consequent distress and hardship that this might bring to depositors and members.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000122"></a>The key elements of the order are as follows: under the Building Societies Act 1986, at least 75 per cent of the business assets of a building society must be residential mortgage loans. The order, if passed, will suspend this lending limit where the consequences of financial assistance from the Bank of England would cause the building society to be in breach of this requirement. The lending limit is restored after one year or, if later, once the financial assistance from the Bank of England has ended. Every building society is currently required by the Building Societies Act 1986 to ensure that at least 50 per cent of its funding is from its own members&#146; deposits. This is referred to as the &#147;funding limit&#148;. Certain items may be disregarded from the funding limit and the order will add financial assistance provided by the Bank of England to that list. Of course, building societies can and do take part in the Bank of England&#146;s lending facilities  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC502"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC502</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>during the course of normal business, and the normal funding limit in these circumstances will continue to apply.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000123"></a>Suspending the lending limit and excluding financial assistance from the Bank of England from the funding limit apply only in the case where there is a threat to financial stability. In these circumstances, the nature and extent of the financial assistance will differ from that of the usual money market operations that the Bank of England conducts. As I have said, suspending the lending limit and adding to the items that are excluded from the funding limit will allow building societies to be placed on a similar footing to that of banks.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000124"></a>The Bank of England, like a commercial bank, has a responsibility to ensure that its lending is prudent, especially where there is a risk to financial stability. Accordingly, in order for the Bank of England to provide emergency financial assistance to either a bank or a building society, it needs to ensure that its position as a creditor is not jeopardised. It does this by taking effective security. The order will remove statutory barriers that could jeopardise the Bank&#146;s position as a creditor of a building society and therefore constrain speedy action in a crisis. I will explain a little more about these barriers. They include Section 9B of the Building Societies Act 1986, under which a building society may not create a floating charge, and Schedule 15A to that Act, which effectively prevents the appointment of an administrative receiver under a floating charge.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000125"></a>When providing financial assistance, the Bank of England needs to be able to secure its lending against the assets and undertakings of the bank or building society. This is wholly consistent with the Bank&#146;s policy for lending in circumstances where there may be a threat to financial stability. This order will modify the restriction in Section 9B to allow a building society to grant a floating charge to the Bank of England over its assets. Again, I stress that a building society would be able to do this only where the Bank had provided financial assistance in extreme circumstances. There is no change to the restrictions on the normal business of a building society. It will remain impossible for a building society to create a floating charge in favour of other creditors.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000126"></a>The order applies the law on administrative receivers to building societies so that, should a building society to which the Bank of England has provided emergency financial assistance secured by a floating charge default, the Bank could appoint an administrative receiver. I should stress that in the circumstances we are debating, it is highly unlikely that the Bank would need to appoint an administrative receiver, but the Government believe it is sensible that the Bank, which would become a major creditor of a troubled building society for reasons of maintaining financial stability, should have the additional safeguards provided by this right.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000127"></a>Finally, a number of technical and consequential provisions will ensure that various other provisions of the Building Societies Act 1986 are consistent with this order.

This has been widely supported by stakeholders, including the building societies. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000129"></a><a name="80520-gc0003.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0003.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08052045000313"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the order. Given the sweeping powers that the Government took in the Banking (Special Provisions) Act earlier this year, the activation of the building society powers in this order, under Section 11 of that Act, should not delay us long. However the Minister would not expect me to let anything connected with the Northern Rock debacle pass through this Grand Committee without some further comment.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000130"></a>I start with the timing of the order. When the Banking (Special Provisions) Bill was considered by your Lordships&#146; House, the Treasury submitted a memorandum to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in relation to Clause 11. The Treasury stated that it intended to make an order under this power &#147;as soon as possible&#148; after the passing of the Bill. It received Royal Assent on 21 February&#151;some three months ago. Can the Minister explain why the Treasury has taken so long to do something that it asserted it would do as soon as possible? We are all accustomed to the peculiar use that the Government put to words such as &#147;shortly&#148; or &#147;very soon&#148;. I venture to suggest that no ordinary person, let alone an ordinary parliamentarian, would think that three months to produce an order that was to be made &#147;as soon as possible&#148; was reasonable. That is especially the case in the context of a Bill that was passed through both Houses of Parliament using the urgent and accelerated procedure. Can the Minister explain the reason for the delay?</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000131"></a>Why has the order been produced without consultation? Once the heat of Northern Rock had passed in February, it seemed that the sense of urgency dissipated. I can understand why the Treasury would want to draw up a draft order for building societies, but I cannot understand how, given that the urgency has passed, it thought it appropriate to dispense with consultation. The Minister referred to consultation in his opening remarks, and I may have got this wrong, but paragraph 7.5 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the order states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052045000263"></a>&#147;There was no public consultation on the Order&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052045000258"></a>Why have the Government bypassed the normal processes of consultation? That leads me to suppose that there may be something specific&#151;perhaps a specific building society&#151;behind this order. Is this order being rushed through because the Treasury thinks that one or more building societies may need to rely on the provisions of the order? If that is not the case, it is clear that the Treasury should follow the normal consultation provisions. Either way, we should be told.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000132"></a>Can the Minister comment on the contents of the banking reform Bill announced last week in the draft Queen&#146;s Speech? The commentary on the Ministry of Justice&#146;s website refers to that Bill as covering only banks. The Treasury&#146;s website, as far as I could see, contained absolutely nothing about the Bill. Will it apply to building societies as well or do the Government intend for all time to rely on secondary legislation powers in the Banking (Special Provisions) Act or perhaps the banking reform Bill? It will take a lot to persuade us that relying on secondary legislation as the long-term way of legislating for building societies is the correct way to proceed.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000133"></a>Finally, will the Minister update noble Lords on the implementation of the Building Societies (Funding) and Mutual Societies (Transfers) Act 2007? It allows, inter alia, for the proportion of wholesale finance that building societies can accept on a routine basis&#151;not the Bank of England facilities but ordinary facilities, to rise from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. In a sense, this is intimately related to the order.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000134"></a>I am sure that the Minister will recall the passage of that Act. It originated as a Private Member&#146;s Bill introduced in another place by my honourable friend Sir John Butterfill and was passed at a time of turmoil in the credit markets, so much so that the Minister made a quite extraordinary statement from the Dispatch Box on the debate on Bill do now Pass on 12 October 2007. Perhaps I may remind him that he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08052045000264"></a>&#147;The Bill allows flexibility for the future in relation to wholesale funding as the Treasury would be able to use the power in Clause 1 to increase by order the maximum level which building societies can borrow from wholesale markets to 75 per cent. Clearly, in the light of recent events in the wider financial markets, we will want to consider carefully whether such a power should be used&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/10/07; col. 457.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08052045000259"></a>As I understand it, there has been no implementation yet of that Act. It remains in limbo waiting to be brought to life by the Government. What is the Government&#146;s thinking on this? Will the Act be activated, and if not, why not?</p>

<p><a name="08052045000135"></a><a name="80520-gc0003.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0003.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08052045000314"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My questions on the order which&#151;as both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord said&#151;was predicted, again largely relate to timing. Indeed, the noble Baroness has asked most of the questions, so I will not repeat them. The phrasing of the Explanatory Memorandum is slightly alarming in that it states that the order has to be introduced as soon as possible as an important contingency measure, so there has been no time for consultation. As the noble Baroness said, it should, first, have been possible to start a consultation considerably sooner than today, because it is not a particularly long order. </p>

<p><a name="08052045000136"></a>Secondly, that raises the spectre that one of the major building societies might be in difficulty. Because the terms of the order are such that only those building societies which, if they got into real difficulties, might have an effect on the financial system as a whole, are covered, the number of building societies that are in fact potential beneficiaries of this provision is small. The inevitable conclusion, on reading the terms of the order, is that the Government, the Bank, or both, are worried about one or more of the societies. So, as the  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC505"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC505</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Baroness said, it would be extremely helpful to have some clarity on that, if only in the form of reassurance. I suspect that this is one of those cases where, had there been consultation, given the nature of the order, there would not have been a huge raft of criticism. However, the way in which the consultation, or lack of it, has been dealt with is a cause for concern.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000137"></a>The other point that I wish to raise was also mentioned by the noble Baroness and concerns the banking reform Bill. My understanding three months ago, when we were discussing Northern Rock, was that the Bill was going to be brought forward significantly sooner than is now the case. I thought that the Government had said that it would be brought forward in this Session. Can the Minister explain why there has been such a delay that it is possible that the Bill will not be brought forward until at least 12 months from now? Certainly all the language used by Ministers implied that we could expect it before the summer.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000138"></a><a name="80520-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08052045000315"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> As usual, I am grateful to the two noble Lords who have spoken, and I shall do my best to answer their questions. However, there is a hare being set to run that ought not to be released. No building society is in trouble. We are not bringing forward this order because of any anxiety or emergency. Indeed, I do not see that I can be chided by the noble Baroness on the one hand for being a little tardy in bringing forward the order, while on the other hand she is suggesting that it has been prompted by anxieties that a building society will need to avail itself of these provisions, and that is why the order is before us at all.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000139"></a>Neither of those positions is sustainable. The Government said during the passage of the Banking (Special Provisions) Act that it provided for us also to address protection for building societies in circumstances about which we all know. The noble Baroness has been kind enough to keep her remarks about Northern Rock to the absolute minimum, so I shall produce my riposte in minimalist terms. The Government acted effectively under that Act against a background where, we all recognise, the credit crunch is producing an enormous crisis for the financial sector. The Government have put in place the necessary protections against outstanding difficulties for institutions, of which Northern Rock was clearly one that required immediate action.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000140"></a>That is not so with other banks, nor with building societies. The Government made a facility available to the banks to increase liquidity&#151;a position that did not draw much criticism from elsewhere. When we passed the Act, we said that we would extend its provisions on access to credit from the Bank of England to the building society sector. Did we consult? We did not go through a widespread public consultation, because it was a specific objective derivative from the Act, but we did talk to the Building Societies Association. That is why, in my opening speech, I was able to indicate its support for the order.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000141"></a>We have brought the measure forward at the proper point. I might be a little more concerned about the timing if I did not think that the noble Baroness  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC506"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC506</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>had advanced a totally contradictory position on it. It is either too early or too late; that is dear old Morton&#146;s fork, by which I am bound to be impaled on one spike on the other. I do not think that Morton&#146;s fork exists here; this is a proper derivative from the Act that we introduced in January, which received Royal Assent in February. We have brought forward an order that the main representative body of the societies affected is entirely happy with.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000142"></a>Neither on timing, nor on the nature of the consultation, are the Government open to criticism. It is clear&#151;as we recognised in the passing of the Act&#151;that the building societies have a different legal framework. We had to have due regard to that, and we are producing an order that responds to it. I take criticism in good part, because I know that it is always constructive criticism from the noble Lord and, even more so, from the noble Baroness, but I am not going to let the canard flourish&#151;I started off with a hare running, so I am getting my animal and bird metaphors mixed&#151;that this is an emergency provision just before some institution declares that it is in great difficulty. Not so; this is an orderly process that we had foreseen and a protective process.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000143"></a>It is necessary, as I was forced to declare to the House earlier today in answer to a Question, because there is an international crisis in the financial sector unprecedented since the Great Depression. We are all facing challenges of whether our legal and institutional provision can cope with the difficulties. I reassure the Committee that this is a modest building block in that necessary rampart of support addressed to the building societies, and there is nothing more sinister in it.</p>
<h5><a name="08052045000276"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000144"></a>As for where we are with regard to the banking Bill, the noble Lord, Lord Newby, always shows enormous enthusiasm for any proposal from the Government and wants to see it in the light of day as rapidly as possible; and I would like on many occasions to meet his enthusiasm. He will recognise, like the noble Baroness, that it is a significant Bill, which involves enormous amounts of preparation and consultation. We never said as a definitive statement when the legislation would see the light of day.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000145"></a>We indicated that it was necessary for us to go beyond the emergency position in the Act passed in February to a more substantial position for the whole financial sector. It is a significant undertaking against a challenging background, and noble Lords will have to contain their impatience a little. The Government intend that the Bill will be produced this year. I cannot be any more precise about the timing. If I am chided about the absence of consultation on an order that is derived from an Act that everyone recognised, having been passed through both Houses of Parliament in two days, probably deserved the status of an emergency measure, I am certainly not going to be chided about the length of consultation time before we produce the banking Bill.</p>

The powers in the 2008 Act relating to a failing bank expire on 21 February 2009. That is why everyone believed that the next Bill to replace the special provisions on a longer-term basis would be introduced before the beginning of the next Session, because in practical terms, especially given the likely timing of the Queen&#146;s Speech, it is not possible to get through such a potentially contentious Act&#151;it is certainly significant&#151;any other way. Will the Minister clarify when the legislation is expected to see the light of day?</p>

<p><a name="08052045000147"></a><a name="80520-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08052045000317"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> That is a good try, but I am not going to be drawn into detail about a Bill that is still being prepared. The noble Baroness, with her usual accuracy, has identified when the provisions of the Act will conclude. The Government, having proposed that timescale, are mindful of it, and that is why the Bill has been promised for this year and will be produced this year for consideration.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000148"></a>I would be the last member of the Government to be presumptuous about how rapidly we could get through a financial measure of such significance; unless the noble Baroness is offering on behalf of her party a level of co-operation unparalleled in the past so that we can see the Bill rapidly translated into legislation. The timing is an unknown factor as far as I am concerned and, in all honesty, it is probably an unknown factor as far as she is concerned. She cannot tie me down to dates regarding Royal Assent to a Bill that is still at the stage of consultation and preparation.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000149"></a>On the Butterfill changes and the Bill that her honourable friend in the other place introduced, the proposed changes to the funding limits for building societies form an integral part of the Butterfill Bill, and during debates in that House we promised to offer MPs and Peers the opportunity to comment further. We will do so at a later date, when we seek to finalise the rest of the provisions before we implement the provisions of the Butterfill Bill. There is unfinished business here, but we indicated that we would offer further opportunities for consultation, and we intend to do so as far as that measure is concerned. In the mean time, I think it might be regarded by the rather more neutral observers of our exchanges that we have strayed quite a long way from the order before us.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000152"></a>The noble Lord said: I bring forward this order with a certain degree of trembling apprehension. If we could extend the last order to quite a significant  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC508"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC508</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>debate, this order deals both with issues related to building societies and European directives. I see that my noble friend is already present for the next business, but I can only say to him that it may be a little delayed if every opportunity to extend the implications of this order is taken up. However, it may be that we stick fairly close to the terms of the order, which is quite limited in its objectives. It will form part of the UK&#146;s implementation of two EC directives, namely directives 2006/43 on the statutory audit directive and 2006/46 on amending the EC accounting directives.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000153"></a>The overall objectives of these directives are to help to improve the credibility of financial statements provided by businesses in the EU, establish some basic sets of principles for the conduct of statutory audits and to engender good corporate governance practice. Before I move on to the substantive issues included in the order, it may be useful for me to explain the background to the directives. They have their genesis in the European Commission&#146;s broader programme of company law reform aimed at enhancing the credibility of financial statements and annual accounts published by European businesses and, more significantly, in the need for accurate, reliable information in the aftermath of certain corporate financial scandals in the EU such as Parmalat. The directives focus on the linked objectives of increasing confidence in corporate governance frameworks, improving investor confidence through increased transparency and requiring better information from businesses. The measures contained in them are consistent with Government policy and contribute to several of the aims that this Government believe are important to UK industry such as stability, market confidence, better information and improved access to capital.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000154"></a>I must stress the obvious in that UK legislation is already in place for a significant proportion of the areas covered by the directives. However there are some areas where specific provision needs to be made in the legislative framework for UK entities. The Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has made specific statutory instruments to give full effect to the requirements of these directives in so far as they relate to companies. The Treasury has been working closely with BERR to implement the directives&#146; provisions for mutual societies for which it has policy responsibility; namely, for building societies and friendly societies. This order relates only to building societies.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000155"></a>I must explain that in relation to these directives a total of four orders have been laid by the Treasury, two for friendly societies and two for building societies. Three of the orders are by the negative resolution procedure. However, this order related to building societies is required to be dealt with under the affirmative resolution procedure, which is why we are considering it today. The power allows the Treasury to modify the Building Societies Act 1986 to reflect changes in company law.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000156"></a>The order makes appropriate amendments to the 1986 Act concerning disclosures relating to off-balance sheet arrangements, disclosure of auditor remuneration, certain safeguards for auditor independence and security, and procedures for the removal and resignation of  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC509"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC509</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>auditors. Many of these changes simply bring building societies legislation into line with companies legislation. In addition, the order makes an amendment to the definition of EEA state in the 1986 Act.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000157"></a>I shall explain briefly which changes the order will make and what they are intended to achieve. On the disclosure relating to off-balance sheet arrangements, the order includes a requirement for building societies to give certain information on off-balance sheet arrangements in the notes to their annual accounts. At present, they are not required by law to give this information. The Committee will agree that this is a helpful addition to building society legislation. It will increase transparency, and the information provided to members, as well as to other interested parties, will help them to take more informed decisions.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000158"></a>On the disclosure of auditor remuneration, the order updates the current requirements on the disclosure of auditor remuneration. Under these changes, building societies will have to specify separately in the notes to the accounts the fees paid to the statutory auditor for several categories of services, such as tax and internal audit services, in addition to the fees for the statutory audit. This will show at a glance what other services the auditor has performed for the client and will alert interested stakeholders to any possible conflicts of interest.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000159"></a>It is clear that auditor independence, and indeed the security of the audit, is paramount to the provision of reliable information. The order includes safeguards for auditor independence and security. Accordingly, it requires the auditor&#146;s report to be signed by the senior statutory auditor in his own name, but provides exemptions to the requirement on security grounds. It amends the rules on the removal and resignation of auditors, requiring the building society and the auditor to notify the audit authority of any removal or resignation and to give reasons. It also gives building society members and the Financial Services Authority a right to apply to court for an order under which an auditor was dismissed on improper grounds. These changes implement various requirements of the audit directive, and whenever possible bring building society law into line with company law.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000160"></a>Finally, the order will amend the definition of a European economic area state in the Building Societies Act 1986. The current definition excludes Bulgaria and Romania, which became Community member states on 1 January 2007. The new definition includes all Community members.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000161"></a>I am sure the Committee will agree that the proposed changes are necessary and proportionate. They will help further to enhance confidence in the financial statements and annual reports published by building societies and to engender good corporate governance standards. They will help to protect the rights and the independence of auditors and ensure that they are not unduly coerced into giving favourable, or indeed misleading, accounts. I commend the proposals to the Committee, and I beg to move.</p>

In addition, will he say whether there will be any further building-society catching-up, if I can put it that way, with Companies Act legislation? It would be helpful to know whether we should expect any more.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000165"></a><a name="80520-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08052045000320"></a>Lord Newby:</b> The Minister said that there were four bits of secondary legislation relating to building societies in this area, three of which were going through under the negative resolution arrangements while this one is under the affirmative procedure. It is not immediately obvious why this needed an affirmative resolution because it does not appear to have any major issues of principle within it and has no significant cost involvement. I was amused to see in the impact assessment that the cost of these provisions was estimated in the range of &#163;14,080 to &#163;44,600. Spread over the whole raft of building societies that will have to implement the legislation, that is as near to zero as makes no difference. Here we have a modest set of provisions that bring building societies, as the Minister says, into line with banks and other companies at a modest cost, so I am happy to support them.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000167"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether there is any difference between the requirements so far as building societies and companies are concerned. There is a technicality in that respect, which I will spell out as accurately as I can. The audit directive requires member states to ensure that auditors shall not be dismissed on improper grounds. For companies, that requirement is implemented by an amendment to provisions of company law on petitions brought by company members. There is no equivalent of these

<p><a name="08052045000168"></a>I do not think I have anything else to add on the question of catching up on legislation in this matter. As I say, we are reflecting directives that have definite implications for member states. I end on the fact that I am grateful for the succinctness of the comments on this matter. I say to the noble Baroness that, as much as she missed me on the Companies Act, that was nothing to my loss when we did the Banking (Special Provisions) Act and she was unfortunately detained when we most needed her.</p>

<h5><a name="08052045000278"></a>5.17 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08052045000170"></a><a name="80520-gc0004.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0004.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08052045000322"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Cash Ratio Deposits (Value Bands and Ratios) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000171"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the order is to reduce from 0.15 per cent to 0.11 per cent the ratio that is applied within the cash ratio deposit scheme, which is itself defined in the Bank of England Act 1998. In so doing, it will revoke the Cash Ratio Deposits (Value Bands and Ratios) Order 2004. The ratio applies to eligible liabilities above the &#163;500 million minimum threshold, and this change will benefit all institutions that make such deposits with the Bank. It is estimated that the change will result in a one-off reduction in the amount of cash ratio deposits held of around &#163;700 million.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000172"></a>It may help the Committee if I briefly outline what the cash ratio deposit scheme is. Before 1998, banks maintained cash ratio deposits at the Bank of England on a voluntary basis. As part of the 1998 reforms of the Bank of England, the Government confirmed that they believed it was right that those who benefited from the relevant operations of the Bank should make a financial contribution to its costs. They therefore placed the cash ratio deposit scheme on a statutory footing.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000173"></a>Under Schedule 2 to the Bank of England Act 1998, eligible institutions&#151;broadly, banks and building societies&#151;may be required to place non-interest bearing deposits, known as cash ratio deposits, with the Bank of England. The Bank then invests these deposits and the income earned on them is used to fund its monetary policy and financial stability policy functions. Under Schedule 2(4) the amount that an eligible institution must deposit with the Bank is calculated by multiplying so much of its average liability base as falls into each of the different value bands of the scheme by the ratio applicable to that band, and then taking the sum of those amounts.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000174"></a>The scheme was last reviewed in 2003, and at that time the minimum threshold of the scheme was increased from the figure of &#163;400 million that was set  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC512"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC512</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in 1998 to &#163;500 million. This change to the scheme was enacted through the Cash Ratio Deposits (Value Bands and Ratios) Order 2004. As part of the 2003 review, the Government committed to conducting a further review by 2008 at the latest.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000175"></a>The review was conducted last year in consultation with the Bank of England. As part of the review, the Treasury conducted an informal consultation with all institutions currently eligible for the scheme and a formal 12-week consultation. To the former it received 66 responses and to the latter four responses, two of which were from the British Bankers&#146; Association and the Building Societies Association.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80520-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000176"></a>The review reached the following conclusions. The cash ratio deposit scheme continues to be a suitable method of funding the Bank of England&#146;s monetary policy and financial stability operations. The ratio applied to those eligible liabilities above the &#163;500 million threshold should be changed from 0.15 per cent to 0.11 per cent but all other variables should stay the same. As an input to reaching this conclusion, the Court of the Bank of England, which is responsible for ensuring the most efficient use of the Bank&#146;s resources, endorsed as a working assumption for the review an estimate of the costs of the Bank&#146;s policy functions of &#163;563 million over the five-year period, which is based on 2 per cent annual spending growth. The investment yield has been forecast to average 5 per cent over this timeframe, and the future growth of eligible liabilities has been assumed to be 4.5 per cent. Under these assumptions, changing the ratio to 0.11 per cent, while maintaining the minimum threshold at &#163;500 million, would result in forecast income from the CRD scheme of &#163;575 million, which is very close to the &#163;563 million required.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000177"></a>A number of the assumptions made in reaching this conclusion are subject to uncertainty, which is why the Government have committed to keeping the parameters of the scheme under active review. This uncertainty is in part reflected through the outcome of the previous five-year period. The previous review projected that &#163;575 million would be required to fund the policy functions of the Bank but the outcome was only &#163;531 million. This is principally attributable to the Bank of England taking steps to focus on core activities and improve efficiency. In addition, the cash ratio deposit income for the same period was higher than expected, in the region of &#163;613 million, which is mainly as a result of the growth in eligible liabilities being higher than expected.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000178"></a>In the published response to the consultation the Government stated that, subject to parliamentary approval, which this order seeks, they would aim for the change to the ratio to come into force on 2 June this year. Not to meet this date would mean delaying the implementation of this change and for the Bank of England to continue holding a higher level of deposits than it requires. Therefore, I hope that noble Lords will see the merit of the order. I beg to move.</p>

I will not give him a lot of trouble on it but I have one or two questions. I was grateful for his clear explanation of cash ratio deposits which are one of the more arcane bits of the Bank of England&#146;s arrangements, representing a compulsory, interest-free deposit by the banking community with the Bank. If CRDs did not exist, clearly the Bank would have to be funded in some other way and since it is not selling any service that anyone would voluntarily buy, the only likely alternatives would be a statutory levy or grant in aid. The rather convenient argument for CRDs is that they enhance the independence of the Bank but the truth is that they avoid explicit and doubtless controversial charging mechanisms or, alternatively, increasing public expenditure.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000181"></a>It is also an especially convenient outcome from CRDs that if they are set at a level which produces a surplus, which they have, the Treasury gets to grab half the surplus as a dividend. The Minister did not mention that in his explanation of the financial system which applies in the Bank of England. So the Treasury has an incentive to set CRD levels at too high a level in order to create a surplus. Indeed, the Bank may well have an incentive to maintain the CRD level because it avoids getting into all those messy discussions with the financial community about what your level of costs should be. The Minister explained that the Treasury did some kind of consultation on the CRD system.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000182"></a><a name="80520-gc0005.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0005.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08052045000324"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Haskel):</b> A Division has been called. The Committee stands adjourned for 10 minutes.</p>

The summary of responses produced by the Treasury also noted that respondents advocated that either changes should be made to other parameters of the scheme or the CRD scheme should be replaced by alternative arrangements. But it was clear from the consultation document that other changes and alternatives were not at all to the Treasury&#146;s taste and were not pursued. So much for consultation.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000185"></a>I have mentioned that the Bank has achieved surpluses of income over expenditure. As the Minister mentioned, that was due in part to overachievement against the forecasts that were produced when CRDs were last set. The total of the surplus, which I do not think the Minister mentioned, was &#163;100 million. Even after paying quasi-dividends to the Treasury, the Bank increased its retained earnings by around &#163;50 million, which is not a small sum. The Bank&#146;s reserves in its most recent audited accounts to the end of March 2007 stood at around &#163;1.7 billion, and there have to be questions asked about whether the Bank needs to be in such a comfortable financial position. My question, therefore,  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC514"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is: have the Government looked at whether the Bank could operate on a leaner financial basis and reduce the annual call it makes on the financial community via CRDs? I am conscious, however, that the Bank may well have to adjust its activities upwards as a consequence of the Northern Rock failures, where we are clear that the tripartite arrangements, which included the Bank of England, failed at their first real test. While most of the opprobrium is aimed at the FSA, who by the account of its own internal audit department handled Northern Rock very badly, I do not think anyone would pretend that the Bank&#146;s procedures were perfect.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000186"></a>The Treasury&#146;s plans were set out in the financial stability consultation document in January. They included strengthening the Bank of England, although it was not clear precisely what that would involve in practice. To me it is clear that it will not involve doing less and spending less; it is likely to involve doing more and spending more. In addition, the Treasury Select Committee in another place was clear that the Bank rather than the FSA should be in charge of the special resolution regime for failing banks. That is the regime proposed in the document which came out in January. If the Government accept that, it would potentially increase the Bank&#146;s costs still further. Perhaps the Minister would share with the Committee the Government&#146;s current thinking on how the special resolution regime will operate and, indeed, how it will be funded.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000187"></a>Does the Minister believe that the CRD funding scheme is robust enough to cope with future scope changes in the Bank&#146;s activities? Do the Government expect to look again at funding mechanisms or indeed the quantum in the light of the emerging financial stability proposals? If they are doing that, it is rather odd that we are bothering with the order before us.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000188"></a><a name="80520-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08052045000326"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness and for the benefit informally of the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, on this order, which he is not able to present since he has to be elsewhere. I know that he shares some of the anxieties of the noble Baroness about it. Perhaps I may make the obvious point that of course there is more than one way of funding the Bank of England. Central banks are funded in different ways in different administrations. However, we are basically of the view that the main beneficiaries of the monetary policy and financial stability functions of the Bank should continue to contribute towards it. So we are broadly in favour of the present scheme.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000189"></a>I marked carefully what the noble Baroness had to say. Last time round, the Bank&#146;s actual costs were lower than predicted&#151;the take was higher, as it were, the product was higher&#151;after it had limited its activities more to core activities and improved efficiency. But we live in different times. As the noble Baroness rightly suggested, the Bank may have a more intensive and extensive role to play, which could involve higher costs. Any significant change to the scheme will certainly be considered within the framework of the consultation and the work being done on the banking reform Bill, which is in process,  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC515"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but at this stage, we have had a review of the mechanism, which clearly indicated that the Bank could be operated on a lower impost that had obtained before, which is what the order involves.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000190"></a>Will the forecast position be better then it was last time? Forecasting in this area is always hazardous, as the noble Baroness will recognise. In any case, we have a second all-encompassing and comprehensive look at the role of the Bank and regulation of financial institutions to be contained in the Bill, so those issues will be considered within that framework. For the moment, it is clear that there is a case for adjustment, which is all that the order proposes.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000191"></a>I hear what the noble Baroness says: that the Treasury may have an interest in the surplus, because it receives a percentage of it. The mechanism was not designed to yield surplus but to meet necessary costs. This reduction is against that background. She herself has suggested that that may be an underestimate of the amount of work that the Bank of England has to do. If it were, she would then be saying that the Treasury had made a proposal that was not directly in its interest by being overgenerous about the potential gap between the two. If the Bank of England's costs increase, there will be a reduction for the institutions paying. By definition, the surplus is likely to be more limited.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000192"></a>This is a modest adjustment to a scheme which is viable, which works and which gets the necessary functions of the Bank of England paid for in a way that avoids exactly the issues that the noble Baroness rightly identified would come from any other funding. We propose to continue with the scheme. Of course she is right that there may be a much more extensive revision of the position of the Bank of England in the Bill, on which the Government's conclusions are not yet ready to be made public, which may change the framework of the scheme. For the time being, we must work with the certainties we have, which are that we do not need the same amount of resources from the institutions for the work of the Bank of England as we thought that we did four years ago. That is why the order is here to reduce the levy.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000195"></a>The noble Lord said: These draft rules are an important building block in creating a system of electronic conveyancing in England and Wales, as envisaged by the Land Registration Act 2002. The creation of a legal framework for electronic conveyancing was perhaps the most important single purpose of the Land Registration Act 2002. In a joint consultation by the Law Commission and the Land Registry, which preceded the drafting of that Act, the  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC516"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concept was supported in principle by almost 80 per cent of respondents. The Act enables the Land Registry to set up a land registry network to be used for electronic conveyancing. It provides that a person who is not a member of the Land Registry staff may have access to the network only if authorised by a network access agreement entered into with the Chief Land Registrar. These draft rules make provision about those network access agreements.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000196"></a>The Information Commissioner&#146;s Office has been consulted on the rules and is comfortable with the measures that are being made at this stage of design and development to minimise the data protection risks. The office is pleased that the Land Registry has attached importance to data protection compliance in the development of this work, and it will continue to provide advice and guidance as it progresses. A draft of these rules was the subject of a public consultation in the first half of last year. Amendments have been made to the rules to take account of concerns expressed by respondents. Further details are given in the report on the responses to the consultation paper. Copies of this report have been placed in the Library, and an electronic copy is available on the Land Registry&#146;s website.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000197"></a>The most common concern expressed by respondents related to the proposed provisions for the limitation and exclusion of liability which the rules required to be included in network access agreements. As well as making some modifications to the draft rules to meet many of these concerns, the Land Registry proposes to set up a scheme under which ex gratia payments would be made to people, other than professional conveyancers, who suffer loss in the event of problems with the network caused by an error or fault on the Land Registry&#146;s part. It will therefore benefit the conveyancers&#146; clients&#151;the actual sellers or buyers, mortgagers and so forth.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000198"></a>Once these rules are in force and the network is in place, electronic conveyancing by way of the network will be introduced in stages and will be piloted on a voluntary basis. These rules need to be in place before the first of these stages, so that professional conveyancers can enter into network access agreements in readiness for undertaking transactions on the network.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000260"></a>If this draft is approved by Parliament, it is planned that, from later this summer, certain applications will be able to be made by way of the network. The first stage of electronic conveyancing, which is currently planned to start by the end of this year, will involve electronic charges for use in remortgages and second mortgages of registered land. Rules, subject to the negative procedure, will make provision that allows these charges to be created in electronic form using the network. They will also make provision as to how to go about transactions carried on by means of the network. Further rules, subject to the negative procedure, will deal with the procedure for appealing against a decision by the registrar on entry into, or termination of, a network access agreement. Both these sets of rules were the subject of a public consultation in the latter part of last year. In the second stage, which is due to begin in 2009-10, the intention is to introduce transfers of registered land.

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000203"></a>My next question relates to cost. I am grateful that it is made clear there will be no charge for entering into such an agreement, but does the Minister think that in due course it will bring down the fairly considerable cost of registering land with the Land Registry? Does he think&#151;it is obviously not necessarily the Government who should answer this question&#151;that it might have an effect on what solicitors would charge the individual who has to register land? The Minister will be aware that it costs a considerable amount of money to register land.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000204"></a>My third question regards timing, which I think the Minister touched on in his explanation. We have been registering land for some time now, and it is envisaged that a lot more will be on the register by 2012. When these rules come into effect, that will all be done electronically. At the same time, will the Land Registry be putting all the old paper stuff on to the electronic network? If so, when, and when will those who will be entitled to have access to the Land Registry get the chance to go back and look at the old stuff that was registered in a paper manner?</p>

<p><a name="08052045000205"></a><a name="80520-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08052045000329"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Henley, makes a good point about the electronic registration of existing entries on the register. I think that registration was introduced in 1925; certainly it was operative on a voluntary basis when I was  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC518"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC518</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>engaged in conveyancing in the 1960s, and it was extended gradually over the country. I note that, even now, not all interests have to be registered. Presumably there are some areas of land that do not require registration now. Accordingly, it will be a very big job to cover the existing records. I imagine that it will happen as it did with registered land originally: registration will take place electronically only when there is some disposition of the property in question. </p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000206"></a>Electronic conveyancing sounds very good, but what happens if the system crashes? I have been trying to find out where the liability lies from Schedule 2 of the agreement. The Monitor in this Room has failed at least twice today, and that is a good warning about what can go wrong. If there is no absolutely failsafe procedure as a backup to the electronic registration of land, all I can say is that future lawyers are going to make a fortune and I wish I could be there to see it.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000207"></a>My next question to the Minister is about the voluntary nature of registration. It says in the Explanatory Notes that the intention is to have pilot schemes on a voluntary basis. Is it envisaged that at some point it will become compulsory to work through electronic conveyancing? I was at a breakfast meeting this morning at the Law Society, where the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, was promising us a technological future that will greatly increase the profits of lawyers; or was it that it would help consumers? I cannot quite remember. Something along those lines was said. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, raised the issue of whether it will be less expensive to convey property in the future.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000208"></a>One other area of interest is the position of people who wish to do their own conveyancing. I have done so myself. I do not see any provision in the rules that deals with the position of a person who says, &#147;I think it is a very simple procedure now that it is being done electronically. I am a whizz with the computer. I can do it myself and avoid having to pay the expenses of a solicitor&#148;. It is a considerable temptation to people in this day and age to do precisely that. Again, that is usually profitable to the legal profession, but still people should have the choice.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000209"></a>Finally, it is all very well to have an electronic system, but a piece of paper in the hand is valuable and makes you think that you actually own the property. The deeds of my house in Gresford go back to 1805 and there are some wonderful parchments from that date that are prized. It makes you think that you own the place. I recall when I started in the 1950s and 1960s, the managing clerk had beautiful copperplate handwriting to engross conveyances. That gave a sense of ownership.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000210"></a>However, there is a practical side to it. When one has a dispute with a neighbour about who must repair a fence that has blown down, it is handy to have immediate access to a piece of paper with a plan attached either to a land certificate or to a conveyance and to look at what exactly is there. Under the electronic conveyancing provisions, it looks as though one will have to go to a lawyer to get access to the system, so the lawyer can look and tell you, and he will charge you for that privilege. All sorts of practical

They are only paving the way for more regulations in the future. Subject to that, we do not intend to object to the passing of the rules, but we would like clarification on my points.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000211"></a><a name="80520-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08052045000330"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> I am grateful for those comments and for the general welcome for the rules, although I sense that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, is rather suspicious of these modern methods. He prayed in aid the collapse of our system earlier this afternoon, which meant that we could not see the results of the Division in the Chamber.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000212"></a>The development of electronic conveyancing, none the less, has many advantages for customers, and I hope that we are first and foremost thinking of the public. A paper will still be kept, so I do not think that the parchment is under threat. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, accepts that the parchments will continue to be there, but he was arguing that if anyone wanted to get hold of them they would have to go through a process in parallel to the electronic system. We have to accept that. Overall, there surely are advantages to be had in electronic conveyancing.</p>
<h5><a name="08052045000280"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="80520-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000213"></a>I understand the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, about data security and protection. As I said in my opening remarks, we have consulted the Information Commissioner&#146;s office. The Land Registry has for many years held databases, including personal data, so the need to keep data secure is not a new obligation. All Land Registry information systems meet the international security management standard ISO 27001, with which I am sure we are all familiar. The systems are also subject to a comprehensive and robust auditing and monitoring regime. In particular, at least every six months, the Land Registry commissions independent penetration testing firms to test the security of its systems, including the latest hacker techniques. Any weakness is detected and dealt with in priority order. There is then a retesting to ensure that no residual weakness is present. These tests will also be applied to the electronic conveyancing network when it is established.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80520-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000214"></a>On the very relevant question of data backup, all Land Registry data are continuously backed up, whereby three copies of all its data are held in mainframe computers on separate sites. In addition, a fourth copy is made once a day. Full backups of systems are kept on tape, and changes that occur during the day are logged. This ensures that the registry can continue to operate, even if one of its data centres is lost or unavailable. The Land Registry operates strict controls as to how changes to its IT infrastructure are managed, risk-assessed and tested prior to deployment. The network is a closed system. </p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000215"></a>Access will be possible only for Land Registry employees and individuals, firms and organisations that have entered into a network access agreement. The term used for them in the draft rule is &#147;subscribers&#148;. The full network access agreement used by conveyancing  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC520"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>professionals provided to the subscriber may allow others and, broadly, their staff access to a set of services appropriate to their job function. Among other requirements, the details of those users have to be supplied to the registrar. They must be supervised by a qualified person and the subscriber and their staff are obliged to keep secure all their security measures, including their log-on names, passwords and so on. The full network access agreement provides for the subscriber to allow individual parties to a transaction, whose identification they will have checked, to access the network either by way of a read-only network access agreement or a signature network access agreement with the registrar. The Land Registry will issue the individual with user identification and passwords. There will be no anonymous access to the network. The client or borrower will have access only to information relating to the particular transaction with which they are involved.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000216"></a>I accept that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was concerned that, even if the security is okay, if the system goes down, the advantage of electronic conveyancing is lost. I agree with him. I am not going to make any foolish commitments; I have been for too long involved with and responsible for various IT projects to do that, but I am satisfied that the Land Registry, which is an efficient organisation, will do everything that it can to ensure that there are no crashes and that when there are, it will be up and running. However, from a security point of view&#151;and one has to be careful about the guarantees that one can give&#151;the Land Registry has gone through a full process which has been checked out with the office of the Information Commissioner, which has made it clear that it will continue to take a close interest and that the Land Registry can look to it for advice.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000217"></a>There are two points in relation to the media. The register has been open to the media since December 1990. The noble Lord suggested a way in which a solicitor might allow a member of the media to gain access to inappropriate information. I will pray in aid my admiration for the integrity of the profession, whom I dearly love, and there are additional safeguards within the profession&#146;s standards and all that goes with them.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000218"></a>I understand the point raised about costs. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, referred to possible failures in the system which would lead to lawyers earning lots of fees. He will know from my current fascinating debates on legal aid that lawyers are looking for every sort of fee they can get, and no doubt they will take note of what he has said. I understand the point about costs, of course, but the system of land registration is extremely effective and I pay tribute to the work of the Land Registry. In 2007-08, 97.2 per cent of Land Registry customers rated the overall service they received as excellent, very good or good, which is a pretty good record. The electronic conveyancing programme is designed to improve the existing system further. It is far bigger than just an electronic form-filling activity, and over time it will bring benefits in terms of time and cost savings to businesses beyond those measured during  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC521"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC521</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the administrative burden exercise, and obviously the cost situation will be kept under close review.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000219"></a>On the timetable, I have already alluded to the need for caution in introducing the system, which is only right. It has always been the view of the Government, the Land Registry and, indeed, the registry&#146;s customers that this is a change that could not happen overnight and needs to be done in stages. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, pointed out, the existing paper-based system has developed over very many years, if not centuries, and we would certainly be worried about a &#147;big bang&#148; approach and the potential harm that that could cause to the housing market. Therefore, it is being brought forward in stages. Towards the end of this year it will be possible to create electronic charges using the network and for parties to sign up to them using electronic signatures. In 2009-10, the ability to create electronic transfers will be added. This will normally involve two conveyancers, one for the seller and one for the buyer, and further transaction types will be added subsequently.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000220"></a>I turn to mandatory matters. Section 93 of the Land Registration Act 2002 contains a provision for rules that would mandate the use of electronic dispositions. Such rules can be made only following consultation and would require the affirmative resolution of both Houses. However, at this stage I do not have any proposals to bring forward on that matter.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000221"></a>The issue of DIY conveyances was raised in the other place when this order was debated. The Land Registration Act 2002 specifically recognises the interests of those who wish to do their own conveyancing. Paragraph 7 of Schedule 5 to the Act imposes on the chief land registrar,</p>
<ul><a name="08052045000268"></a>&#147;a duty to provide such assistance as he thinks appropriate for the purpose of enabling persons ... who wish to do their own conveyancing to do so by means of the network&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08052045000262"></a>It is the registrar&#146;s intention to make such provision in due course, but this is an early stage and the system is being introduced incrementally. It will be some time before the full range of transactions can be carried out on the network. That is why current energies are better devoted to building the best basic system and then increasing the range of transactions, but I can assure noble Lords that we will not forget the importance of ensuring that this system becomes accessible to DIY conveyancers in the future.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000230"></a>The noble Lord said: This statutory instrument expands on two specific areas of the regulatory framework established to regulate claims management services under Part 2 of the Compensation Act 2006. The first area relates to professional indemnity insurance as a condition of authorisation and the second relates to the power to take possession of written or electronic records found pursuant to a search authorised by a search warrant.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000231"></a>The Compensation Act received Royal Assent in July 2006. The regulatory framework came fully into force in April 2007, when it became an offence to provide regulated claims management services without authorisation or exemption. The Compensation (Claims Management Services) Regulations 2006 provide further details of the regulatory arrangements.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000232"></a>The regulatory regime brought previously unregulated claims management businesses within the regulatory net and requires that they comply with rules of conduct. I am delighted to say that good progress has been made in the first year of regulation. Activities previously associated with some of these businesses, such as  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC523"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC523</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>leaflet-dropping in medical facilities and cold-calling in person, have been virtually eradicated. The regulation has helped to raise the standards of services in the industry.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000233"></a>Later this week, the department will publish a review of the first year of regulation and an evaluation of its impact. This will be placed in the Library. One of the general points this evaluation will highlight is that, despite introducing this new regulatory regime at some speed, the department has adhered closely to the principles of better regulation, and in particular those contained in the statutory code of practice for regulators. For example, our enforcement policy reflects the principles of the Macrory and Hampton reviews and has guided enforcement actions to ensure that they are proportionate and risk-based.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000234"></a>We have been careful to minimise the regulatory burdens on businesses, and adjusted the fee scales for claims management regulation after one year of operation by reducing the fees payable for businesses with a very low turnover. This addressed specific concerns that had been raised predominantly by sole traders and helped ensure that the fee levels were proportionate. The same principles were applied to the development of the professional indemnity insurance requirement.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000235"></a>The annual review also sets out the priorities for the second year of claims management regulation. One of these will be to tackle unauthorised trading&#151;in other words, businesses that are providing claims management services without authorisation, either knowingly or unknowingly. The consumer, however, remains at the heart of regulation and we will also be continuing our efforts to ensure that client contracts are fair.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000236"></a>These regulations are made under the power in Sections 8(8), 9 and 15 of the schedule to the Compensation Act. Regulation 21 of the Compensation (Claims Management Services) Regulations 2006 provides that the regulator may require an authorised person to take out a policy of professional indemnity insurance. However, we did not insist on professional indemnity insurance for authorised persons at the outset. It was clear from a previous consultation undertaken during the summer of 2006 that, although there was general support for this requirement, there were also concerns, particularly about the difficulties in obtaining cover at a reasonable cost in such a short timeframe.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000237"></a>It was necessary to ensure that the requirement was appropriately introduced and that there was sufficient market capacity to provide the relevant insurance. We specifically consulted on this requirement in February 2007 and commissioned an independent insurance expert to advise and produce a report on the insurance market for professional indemnity insurance. This helped determine that it would not be appropriate to impose this requirement on all claims management businesses. Authorised businesses and insurers had also expressed concern at the levels of cover required. We also sought the views of the regulatory consultative group, which includes representatives from the key industry interests, the Association of British Insurers, the Financial Services Authority and the Claims Standards Council, as well as of individual insurers, to address their concerns  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC524"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC524</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about the sector. The final requirement was adjusted to take account of the views and comments received and was published in November 2007.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000238"></a>The requirement has been restricted to those businesses that represent clients in the personal injury sector because this is where the greatest risk to consumers has been identified. An authorised business would therefore need to have professional indemnity insurance if it represented a client in relation to a claim for compensation. For example, if an authorised business deals directly with the insurance company of the person the client was claiming from and agrees a settlement, professional indemnity insurance would be needed in case the business were negligent. We believe that limiting the requirement in this way balances appropriate consumer protection with a proportionate impact on businesses. This is a carefully considered decision, based on a thorough consultation and supported by an independent insurance report and views from key stakeholders, including those likely to be affected by this requirement. If an authorised business is unable to meet its liabilities, the provisions will ensure that appropriate compensation is available where, for example, claims have been lost as a result of negligence.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000239"></a>The draft regulations introduce minimum terms to ensure that authorised claims management businesses have a minimum level of professional indemnity insurance. The minimum terms include a minimum level of indemnity of &#163;250,000, a maximum level of excess of &#163;10,000 for a single claim and cover for legal defence costs. Discussions with insurers and insurance brokers over the months since the 2007 consultation have indicated that a number of insurers will be able to provide cover exceeding the minimum terms. The minimum terms covering the levels of excess and indemnity were adjusted in light of the conclusions of the independent insurance report and the consultation exercise to make sure the requirement did not impact disproportionately on small businesses.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000240"></a>Insurers wishing to provide professional indemnity insurance to claims management businesses must be based within a &#147;Zone A&#148; country, if outside the UK or its dependencies. This means a country that is either a European Economic Area state, a full member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or a country that has concluded special arrangements with the International Monetary Fund&#146;s general arrangements to borrow. We have issued draft guidance which provides more detail for businesses on how to identify a country that falls within the definition. The department will review the professional indemnity requirement after one year to evaluate its impact and consider whether it should be extended to other regulated claims management sectors, reduced in scope or left unchanged.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000241"></a>As regards the power to seize records, under the Compensation Act, the regulator has various investigative powers to review compliance with the regulatory regime. The 2006 regulations make provision for warrants for entry and search of premises in limited circumstances to ensure that claims management regulation can effectively be enforced. These powers are modelled on those in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the relevant codes of practice under that Act. The

<p><a name="08052045000242"></a>The power to take possession of records may be necessary when a large amount of relevant records is found during an authorised search of premises. The power will enable officers to take possession of relevant records for the purpose of photocopying, which will reduce the amount of time that officers spend on the premises that are being searched. However, we recognise that powers of entry and seizure must always be fully and clearly justified before they are used because they may interfere with an occupier&#146;s privacy or personal property. The exercise of the power to take possession of records is therefore subject to certain safeguards, including the relevant codes of practice issued by the Home Secretary under the PACE legislation. This will help to ensure that officers acting on behalf of the regulator act reasonably and proportionately in all circumstances.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000243"></a>The regulations expand on the regulatory framework that we have already put into place to regulate the provision of claims management services, and I commend them to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000244"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee has considered the Compensation (Claims Management Services) (Amendment) Regulations 2008. <I>17th r</I><I>eport from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments</I>.&#151;(<I>Lord Hunt of King</I><I>s Heath.</I>)</p>

<p><a name="08052045000245"></a><a name="80520-gc0006.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0006.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08052045000338"></a>Lord Henley:</b> Again, I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the regulations. I hope that I can be fairly brief, but as I saw the large team of officials that came in to offer him assistance, I was reminded of a Permanent Secretary in a department in which I served some time ago who, on seeing a similar sight, said, &#147;Ah, large team, weak case&#148;. I just hope that the case is not weak on this occasion.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000246"></a>First, the Minister actually gave a firm time when he said that the department will publish its review into these matters later this week. I look forward to that coming out before we break up on Thursday. I hope he will ensure that a copy is sent to me as speedily as possible, and that the department will manage to produce other items that it has promised on time and when it says that it will.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000247"></a>Secondly, will the Minister say a word or two about the regulatory impact assessment? The Explanatory Memorandum made it clear that a regulatory impact assessment of this statutory instrument has not been produced. A full regulatory impact assessment for claims management regulation was published to accompany the Compensation Bill, details of which are given on the website. I looked at it on the website. It was signed off by the Minister&#146;s predecessor, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, who is now the Leader of the House, in late 2005, and it put forward various options that imposed quite high costs on the claims management companies. No doubt that has all been  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC526"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column GC526</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>dealt with. Am I right that no further costs are being added under the regulations, and that the costs referred to in the 2005-06 regulatory impact assessment are already there?</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000248"></a>Thirdly, and briefly, is the Minister happy about the &#163;250,000 for a single claim and &#163;500,000 for aggregated claims in new Regulation 21B, &#147;Minimum terms of professional indemnity insurance&#148;? Will he say a little more about what consultation they had and whom they consulted to reach those figures?</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000249"></a>Finally, on the power in the final regulation to seize records, I take it that no power of entry is being granted to officials at this stage and that it is merely a power to seize records where necessary and to return them in due course, as set out in the regulations. I have no further questions.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000250"></a><a name="80520-gc0006.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0006.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08052045000339"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> The Liberal Democrats have supported the principle of the regulation of the claims management services. It is a very good thing, and we are very pleased that compulsory insurance is being introduced&#151;a necessary corollary of that regulation. I have nothing to add. We welcome these regulations.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000251"></a><a name="80520-gc0006.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80520-gc0006.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08052045000340"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> I thank both noble Lords for the general welcome they have given to these regulations. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, that this provision was much needed, and the indications are that it has been effective. I know I was not present during the debate, but I was part of the ministerial group considering what is loosely called the &#147;compensation culture&#148; issue. The Committee will know that during the work undertaken by central government it was difficult to find absolute proof of a compensation culture, but the problem is that there is such a perception. I hope that the necessary regulation of the services is but one element in changing that general perception.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000252"></a>I always welcome the pithy comments of the noble Lord, Lord Henley. I have noted what he said about large teams and weak cases. I am glad to have the support of my colleagues behind me, but I think the case is pretty strong. He pressed me to define what &#147;later this week&#148; means in Ministry of Justice terms. He knows that this is a matter that I have resisted and will continue to resist, but I will ensure that both noble Lords receive the report as soon as it is published. Should we be so unkind as to publish it on Friday, if he lets me know where his holiday home is, we will guarantee to send it to him so that he can thoroughly enjoy his holiday.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000253"></a>Regarding the minimum terms, in my opening remarks I read out&#151;or at least referred to&#151;the list of organisations that have been consulted. The general view is that the minimum terms are satisfactory. There was always a balance here between increasing cost and better regulation. That is why a proportionate approach has been taken and the decision was made to identify only part of the business that is to be covered by the current provisions. The other point to make to the noble Lord is that discussions with insurers and insurance brokers have indicated that a number of insurers will be able to provide cover exceeding the minimum terms as well. Those terms

We have attempted to strike the right balance.</p>

<a name="80520-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08052045000254"></a>The noble Lord is right about the power of entry. The power under the current law enables records to be taken, photocopied and returned. It does not advance the law further than that.</p>

<p><a name="08052045000255"></a>Regarding professional indemnity and the RIA, the provisions before the Committee do not go outwith the original work that was undertaken under the RIA.

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08052037000012"></a>I am pleased to inform the House we have completed the necessary alignment of work schedule, commercial arrangements and planned annual expenditure, in relation to the future aircraft carriers.   This enables us to move ahead with the companies of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance to progress the contract for the manufacture of the two carriers to be named HMS &#147;Queen Elizabeth&#148; and HMS &#147;Prince of Wales&#148;, which will enter service in 2014 and 2016 respectively.   Following finalisation of legal arrangements and the formation of the planned naval shipbuilding and support joint venture company, formal contract signature will take place.  We have given our written assurance to the VT Group and BAE Systems of our intention to sign the contract once the company has formed.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08052037000013"></a>The carriers will provide our frontline forces with the modern, world-class capabilities they will need over the coming decades. The work on the carriers will create or sustain 10,000 jobs across UK at the peak of its production.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="08052037000014"></a><a name="80520-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80520-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08052037000081"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08052037000015"></a>The provision of battlefield helicopter capability in Iraq and Afghanistan has attracted considerable interest amongst honourable Members and the British public. I therefore felt it would be helpful to set out in some detail, within the constraints of operational security, the current position, and our future intentions.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08052037000016"></a>This Statement does not cover our wider plans on helicopters: it is focused on our plans relating to current operations over the next two years. At the same time, I am keen that honourable Members appreciate the wider context. While we are focused on providing as much helicopter support as we can to troops on operations, we must also manage our helicopter fleet to ensure that we maintain a sustainable capability in the future. One question often asked by honourable Members is why the number of helicopters deployed is significantly less than the number in our inventory. The answer is that the number deployed is limited by the need to keep the burden on our airframes, crews and ground support staff at a sustainable level over time.  We also have to make aircraft available in the UK for training,  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS80"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column WS80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>maintenance and essential modification programmes. This means that, as a rule of thumb, it takes three additional helicopters to sustain the deployment of a single helicopter on operations.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08052037000017"></a>To this first principle we have added recently a second principle, which is that, if possible, each helicopter type should be deployed in only one operational theatre at any time. Concurrent deployment of a single type in both theatres increases the pressure on crews and supervisory staff, with implications for our ability to train them effectively between deployments, for harmony ratios, and ultimately the risk of them leaving the service. On the positive side, focusing each helicopter type in one theatre has allowed us to rationalise our logistics and support arrangements. We have  completed the process of consolidating our medium and heavy fleets across the two theatres, with Merlin and Puma in Iraq, and Chinook and Sea King in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08052037000018"></a>Against the background of these two principles, we are making significant progress in enhancing UK helicopter capability for operational commanders. I have approved the decision to commit the Merlin fleet (alongside Puma) to Iraq, to support our continuing efforts to train and mentor the Iraqi army, and maintaining the ability to re-intervene in extreme circumstances. We intend to deploy a further two Merlin to Iraq towards the end of this summer.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08052037000019"></a>Turning to Afghanistan, the drawdown in Iraq has enabled us to remove Sea King from Iraq and, working with AgustaWestland, to fit those helicopters with new, state-of-the-art main and tail rotor blades to deliver improved performance in hot and high conditions, and deploy them to Afghanistan.  They are performing extremely well, and a further two helicopters deployed last month.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08052037000020"></a>Through the deployment of the Sea Kings, and improvements to support and crewing arrangements for Chinook and Apache (assisted by the consolidation of types in one theatre), we have increased the total amount of flying time&#151;measured by the number of hours per month&#151;available to commanders in the south of Afghanistan by over a third since last March. (We do not release the total number of helicopters or hours for reasons of operational security: it would allow others to infer too much about our overall capability.) But we are clear that commanders on the ground will always be able to use more helicopters, and we are determined to continue to make every effort to give them the options they need.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08052037000021"></a>Chinook is the UK support helicopter best suited to the demanding hot and high conditions in Afghanistan.  In the past six months, we have ramped up the maintenance regime and logistics support to increase the HC2/2a Chinook flying rate on operations by 20 per cent.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08052037000022"></a>In relation to Apache in Afghanistan, we are clear about the importance of ensuring that we maximise this proven battle-winning capability. We deployed the Apache on operations three years ahead of schedule, and have been increasing steadily on the number of Apache flying hours available to commanders each month&#151;most recently by a further 15 per cent at the end of March. We aim to increase flying hours by a further 25 per cent by early next year, by deploying  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS81"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column WS81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>additional helicopters, and we are building the logistic support required in terms of spare parts and personnel, particularly engineering manpower, to enable this.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08052037000023"></a>Finally in relation to Afghanistan, it is important to recognise that we are operating there as part of a wider NATO effort, and we draw significantly on helicopter assets provided by allies.  We continue to work with allies to identify opportunities for further increases in the capability of the overall NATO fleet. For example, the UK and France have undertaken to support initiatives to set up training courses for crews, and to upgrade aircraft&#151;and recently we established, and agreed to provide seed funding for, a helicopter fund to help improve the availability of NATO and EU helicopters on operations. There were expressions of interest in this latter initiative from several countries at the recent NATO summit in Bucharest, and we are following these up. </p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08052037000024"></a>In addition, since February 2008, NATO has had in place a commercial helicopter contract designed to enable the movement of freight across the whole of Afghanistan. This contract was recently replaced in the south of Afghanistan by a new contract specifically to deliver the movement of up to 10,000 kilograms of freight per day for the Kandahar hub in Regional Command (South), freeing up a significant number of flying hours for Chinook (and the Apache which support them) for higher priority tasks. In the hotter summer months, this can enable the equivalent of an additional four Chinook sorties per day. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the contracts closely and assess whether there are opportunities to shift any more of our helicopter tasking on to contractors. </p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08052037000025"></a>That completes the summary of current initiatives on operations. In relation to additional capacity for the future, in March 2007 the Prime Minister and I announced we would be investing in additional support helicopters,purchasing six Merlins from Denmark, and modifying eight Chinook HC3 helicopters to a support role. We stated at the time that this choice of projects had been based on their potential to generate additional capability for operations over the following two years. In relation to Merlin, it should be noted that this sort of timeline&#151;under two years from procurement to fielding&#151;is much shorter than the standard either in the UK or internationally.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08052037000026"></a>Rightly, we have set ourselves challenging targets; and we are making progress towards meeting those targets.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08052037000027"></a>Since the delivery of additional Danish Merlins to the UK last July, the aircraft have been undergoing a complex conversion to meet the UK standard, carried out in partnership with AgustaWestland. We have been modifying the aircraft to a standard where they are suitable for operations in Iraq, including the installation of improved communications systems and state-of-the-art main rotor blades. Three have now been delivered to the RAF for training purposes. The remaining three will be delivered this summer. The addition of these six helicopters will increase the Merlin battlefield helicopter fleet by 25 per cent, and will enable us to deploy the further two Merlin to Iraq  


<notus-date day="20" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS82"></a><b>20 May 2008 : Column WS82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this summer referred to above. In the longer-term it remains our intention to deploy Merlin to Afghanistan, and we are looking at what further steps we can take now to shorten the lead-in times ahead of any possible deployment.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08052037000028"></a>We are also making progress with the HC3 Chinooks. This conversion programme involves a redesign of the cockpit area and avionics bays, as well as the modifications necessary to operate in Afghanistan. A contract is in place with Boeing to carry out the conversion work, and we have secured funding from the reserve for the additional theatre-specific modifications necessary for Afghanistan.  The project is on schedule for the first converted Chinook to be fielded in late 2009, allowing the Chinook force to begin deploying more helicopters to theatre.  The remaining seven will become available over the following months, the last one entering service during the first half of 2010. This is some two years in advance of previous options to field these aircraft. All other enabling personnel and support issues have been planned and funded to coincide with the delivery of the modified aircraft to the front line, thus ensuring that we are ready to deploy them at the earliest opportunity. </p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08052037000029"></a>I hope that honourable Members will recognise from this short summary that despite the challenges and constraints in this area, we have made significant progress both in delivering additional capability from within our existing assets, and in procuring and adapting additional assets to give operational commanders additional options over the next two years. This is not an area where we can ever afford complacency, but I believe this summary demonstrates that we are on the right path.</p>

These children and young people are currently provided for either in local-authority-run pupil referral units or in other alternative provision commissioned by local authorities and schools. Only 1 per cent of 15 year-olds in pupil referral units gain five or more good GCSE examination results.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08052037000037"></a>The Government are publishing a White Paper which will transform alternative provision into a vibrant and successful part of the whole education system, working in close partnership with mainstream schools, special schools, with children&#146;s services and other agencies, to meet the needs of young people more effectively.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08052037000038"></a>Some of the most vulnerable children and young people are in some kind of alternative provision, and they have as much right as any other pupil to a good education that allows them to realise their potential and sets them on the path to success. The White Paper emphasises the key role for schools in identifying children with challenging behaviour early on, and being able to access the right support before they reach the point of permanent exclusion.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08052037000039"></a>We recognise that there is much good practice in pupil referral units and other forms of alternative provision. However, we are determined to bring all providers of alternative provision and other support for children and young people up to the standard of the best so that we achieve a step change improvement in standards overall. Our proposals include:</p>
intervening when pupil referral units fail, by requiring local authorities to replace them with a specified alternative, as announced in the draft legislative programme;requiring a local authority, when necessary, to hold a competition to find the best provider of the specific alternative model that has been identified to replace a failing pupil referral unit; collecting and publishing data annually on attendance at pupil referral units;

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08052037000040"></a>We are confident that the proposals in this White Paper will address the weaknesses in the system and help young people get successfully back on track by creating a culture of early intervention, quality of provision, and strengthened accountability.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08052037000042"></a>We want to see a modern, efficient and secure electoral system, so that voting for all electors is as convenient and as straightforward as possible. In 2009, many electors are due to vote on two occasions within a space of four weeks: first, in local council elections on 7 May, and, secondly, for the European Parliament on 4 June.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08052037000043"></a>Accordingly, I am today publishing a consultation document, inviting views on whether or not we should, subject to parliamentary approval, move the date of the English local elections from Thursday 7 May 2009 to Thursday 4 June 2009, the same day as the European parliamentary election. This consultation meets the statutory requirement set out in Section 60 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, which makes provision for the Secretary of State by order to make such a change in the local election date.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08052037000044"></a>In launching this consultation we have had regard to the experience in 2004 when local and European parliamentary elections were held on the same date. The turnout at those European elections was significantly higher than in previous years&#151;up from 24 per cent in 1999 to 38.5 per cent. We have also had regard to the Electoral Commission&#146;s conclusions in 2004 that the combination of the elections was an important factor in the improved turnout. It commented that before the next European parliamentary elections in 2009, further consideration would need to be given to the potential impact of the combination of elections.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08052037000045"></a>In particular we are seeking views on:</p>
 whether the local elections in 2009 should be moved from 7 May to 4 June, so that they are held on the same day as the European parliamentary elections;

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08052037000050"></a>National statistics published today demonstrate the substantial contribution tax credits are making to deliver guaranteed minimum incomes for working families and families with children, reducing child poverty, and helping more people into employment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08052037000051"></a>The statistics published by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) show that in 2006-07 the child and working tax credits were benefiting around 6 million families and 10 million children.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08052037000052"></a>The statistics also show that in 2006-07:</p>
more working people on low incomes without children received tax credits than ever before, with 305,000 receiving support through the working tax credit, up by 12 per cent on 2005-06;384,000 families benefited from the childcare element of the working tax credit, a 13 per cent increase compared with 2005-06, thereby making childcare more affordable and giving parents more choice in how they balance work and family life; and

<a name="80520-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08052037000053"></a>Significantly, the figures show that efforts to reduce overpayments of tax credits have resulted in a &#163;700 million reduction in overpayments since 2005-06. The level of overpayments is now less than half the level in 2003-04.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08052037000054"></a>There has also been a corresponding decline in the numbers of overpaid awards, from 1,879,000 in 2003-04 to 1,291,000 in 2006-07.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08052037000055"></a>The Government remain committed to the current responsive system of tax credits, which in 2006-07 provided additional support to the 720,000 families experiencing an income fall. Whilst this progress is welcome, I recognise that there is more to do, building on the success of the measures put in place since 2005. That is why the Government are today publishing a number of proposals to continue improvements to the tax credits system, drawing on lessons learnt from the first five years of tax credits in the UK, and the experience of similar systems in Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>

<a name="80520-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08052037000057"></a>First, HMRC is introducing further operational improvements aimed at tailoring support more closely to individuals' needs and making it easier for customers to claim, receive and renew tax credits, to reduce the scope for error.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08052037000058"></a>Secondly, the document sets out a number of proposals that retain the ability for tax credits to provide additional, timely support to customers whose income falls or whose circumstances change, while giving customers greater certainty and more control over how they manage their tax credits affairs.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08052037000059"></a>Thirdly, it sets out a range of possible options to reform the delivery of financial support for childcare through tax credits, simplifying the system as far as possible for customers.</p>

<a name="80520-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08052037000060"></a>Some of these reforms are already being introduced and are delivering improvements for tax credit customers. Others will be brought forward in the next few years; while some of the proposed reforms, particularly to the system of childcare support, are much longer term. The Government are therefore keen to seek views, in order to inform longer-term policy development.</p>

With regard to TSE infectivity in the environment, recent studies have suggested TSE-associated prion protein adheres to soil minerals and remains infectious, even after a number of years. Defra-funded scientific research investigating the persistence of TSE infectivity in the environment is ongoing and details can be found on the Defra website.</p>

The DCMS has not issued guidance to local authorities which opt to use a leisure trust model for the management of local leisure facilities. However, every local authority is under a statutory duty to establish an adequate and effective system of financial management and arrangements for the management of risk. The authority's chief finance officer also has duties to report to the council on proposed decisions or actions that would be unlawful or likely to cause a loss.</p>

<a name="80520w0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a><a name="08052054000078"></a>The duty of best value, as laid down in legislation, requires authorities to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the way in which they exercise their functions, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. It is for them to decide, in the first place, whether the duty of best value can only be met by conducting a tendering exercise. Following the recent consultation exercise, current best-value guidance set out in ODPM Circular 03/2003 will be replaced by the new <I>Creating Strong, Safe and Prosperous Communities</I> guidance. The draft consultation guidance made clear that local authorities should adopt practices that are fair and open&#151;that is, neutral between different types of providers&#151;and should ensure that any procurement decision, including retaining services in-house, is undertaken and justified in an open and transparent way. Any specific complaints that best value is not being met in a particular set of circumstances would need to be addressed in the first instance to the authority's external auditor.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_36"></a>In respect of the rail franchise change of control policy statement issued on 28 March (a) which organisations were consulted on the proposals; (b) on what basis the administration fee will be assessed and charged; (c) what is the legal basis for the proposed charge of the greater of &#163;1 million or 5 per cent of the value of the change to the vendor; and (d) what is the purpose of levying that charge. [HL3551]</p>

The Department for Transport did not seek the views of any organisation on this contractual matter.</p>

<a name="80520w0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_19"></a><a name="08052054000117"></a>(b) The administration fee (which is separate from the facilitation fee) will represent the costs of processing the application for consent to the change of control. This will vary from case to case.</p>

<a name="80520w0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_20"></a><a name="08052054000118"></a>(c) Under the franchise agreements between the Secretary of State and train operating companies, the Secretary of State's power to grant or refuse permission for a change of control is essentially unfettered. Therefore, as a matter of private law rights and by reason of the statutory duties imposed on the Secretary of State, including the duty to promote improvements in railway service performance, the Secretary of State, acting in the public interest, is entitled to require a payment in return for her consent.</p>

<a name="80520w0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_21"></a><a name="08052054000119"></a>(d) The purpose of the facilitation fee is to allow the public to benefit from a change of control. The value of franchises is often a product of substantial public subsidy or investment. It is therefore reasonable that the Secretary of State should have the opportunity to ensure that passengers and the public purse receive some benefit when franchises change hands.</p>
