<h4 align=center><a name="hd_0"></a>The House met at half-past two of the clock: The LORD CHANCELLOR on the Woolsack.</h4>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </b>  My Lords, before public business begins, may I take the opportunity to inform the House that I am to undertake a ministerial visit to Chester on Friday, 21 May, when the House will sit? Accordingly, I trust that the House will grant me leave of absence.

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Redesdale </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether they expect the Iraq Survey Group to have completed its work by 30 June 2004.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, Her Majesty&#039;s Government fully expect the work of the Iraq Survey Group in uncovering Iraq&#039;s intentions towards and programmes for weapons of mass destruction to continue beyond June, until all reasonable avenues of investigation have been explored.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   My Lords, could the Minister expand on what he means by &quot;all reasonable avenues&quot; have been explored? It appears that the Iraq Survey Group is not fulfilling any meaningful function. Will he also explain whether the Government now believe that there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and say whether they will publish all the findings that have so far come out since the resignation of the head of the Iraq Survey Group?
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, a huge amount of information is being analysed at present. It is clear that the group&#039;s work is very far from complete. Noble Lords will recognise that the difficult security situation in Iraq has not been conducive to the group fulfilling its role as fully as it would have expected and hoped to do. Nevertheless, it is on course to continue its work and will, as I indicated in my original Answer, continue beyond June.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Astor of Hever: </b>   My Lords, following the Minister&#039;s response, will he confirm that the reason the survey group has found, and will find, no convincing evidence of weapons of mass destruction is because there was none to find?
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, some very interesting material indeed is emerging about the intentions of the regime and the potential threats that it posed. We are not in a position to reach conclusions <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_508"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 508</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on that at present. However, the group has uncovered substantial degrees of evidence of programmes for which Saddam Hussein&#039;s government were responsible. It is important that the group be given the opportunity to fulfil its remit, which is what it intends to do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, is it not curious that some Members of the House seem to believe that weapons of mass destruction programmes do not pose a threat?
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is right. The whole House will recognise not only that Saddam Hussein was capable of being brutal towards his own people but also that he clearly had ambitions as regards his regional role. There was direct evidence of that in the first Gulf War when he was restrained in relation to Kuwait. As my noble friend has indicated, Saddam Hussein clearly had ambitions and was prepared to pursue certain strategies, which would very much be against the interests of all in the Middle East and in the West, to help to fulfil those ambitions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Marsh: </b>   My Lords, would the Minister consider it reasonable for noble Lords to ask him &quot;to come off it&quot;? Is he not fully aware that there are literally dozens of countries around the world today with programmes of all kinds of weapons of mass destruction? If we are to deal with them all, surely we shall have a bit of a problem.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a problem, but we should take joy in the fact when we are able to restrain some who otherwise would have presented such a danger. I believe that we can take some satisfaction from the fact that Libya has withdrawn from a position that it had pursued for a number of years, as can the people of Iraq, and the wider world, from the destruction of the Saddam Hussein regime.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Lamont of Lerwick: </b>   My Lords, do the Government still agree with a view expressed by the Prime Minister that the regime change by itself could never be an adequate justification for the invasion of Iraq?
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, as far as the Government are concerned, it was absolutely clear that the regime of Saddam Hussein, and his ambitions, presented a threat both to his own people and to the wider world. Therefore, it is also clear that whatever the difficulties&#151;who would seek to underestimate the enormous difficulties that face the forces in Iraq at present?&#151;the fact that Saddam Hussein&#039;s regime is no more is of conspicuous benefit to the Iraqi people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that we did not go to war on the basis of the intentions that he mentioned in an earlier answer, nor did the Prime Minister mention ambitions? He <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_509"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 509</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mentioned 45 minutes. Can the Minister say at what point the Government will accept that there are no weapons of mass destruction, nor were there any?
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, it is too early to say that with the conviction indicated by the noble Baroness. That is not the position of the Iraq Survey Group. It has unearthed a welter of evidence about the malign intentions and capabilities of the regime. Therefore, within the prevailing security difficulties that the group faces at present, which we all hope will improve as a consequence of the transfer to the new arrangements at the end of June, it is absolutely right that it should be able to pursue its work with vigour and reach its conclusions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, does my memory serve me wrong or is it a fact that the Government went to war in Iraq on the basis that it had weapons of mass destruction that were a threat to British interests, particularly in Cyprus, and could be used in 45 minutes? Does not the noble Lord agree that that was wrong and that, in the light of what is happening in Iraq at present, it would be best if British troops were withdrawn?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, it is rash and bold for the noble Lord to suggest that the withdrawal of British troops would benefit the Iraqi people. It must be recognised that dissident forces in Iraq are constantly perpetrating outrages, not least the one this morning, which took the life of the president of the Iraqi Governing Council. We all regret the outcome of that horror and sympathise with Ezzedine Salim&#039;s family. However, there is a job of restoring security in Iraq. It is clear that British forces play their role in that at present and will need to do so until we can achieve new arrangements in which the Iraqi people will determine their own future. Even under those new arrangements, external assistance may well be needed until full Iraqi security capacity has been developed.

<a name="40517-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord St John of Bletso </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What measures they are taking to assist in securing political and economic sustainable development in Sierra Leone.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My Lords, the UK is the largest bilateral donor to Sierra Leone. We have set out our commitment to support Sierra Leone&#039;s long-term reconstruction and development in a 10-year memorandum of understanding under which we will provide up to &#163;120 million over the first three years. This assistance takes the form of support for security sector reform, improved economic and political governance and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_510"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 510</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

direct budgetary aid. In addition, UK forces are providing training and advice to the Sierra Leone armed forces.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40517-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord St John of Bletso: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness the Leader of the House for that extremely encouraging reply. Her Majesty&#039;s Government are to be congratulated on the pivotal role that our Armed Forces have played in restoring peace and stability in that country. Can the noble Baroness outline the drawdown schedule of the United Nations troops, British troops and military observers in the light of the fragility of peace in and along the borders with Liberia? How confident are Her Majesty&#039;s Government that the Royal Sierra Leone Military Forces and police are sufficiently trained and equipped to avert a resurrection of violence, whether it be through banditry or is organised?
</p>

<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord will be aware that an agreement has been made to extend UNAMSIL&#039;s presence in Sierra Leone until 2005, so some 3,500 troops will remain until then. On our own contribution, through the British Military Advisory and Training Team we are giving advice to the Sierra Leone armed forces on security sector reform. The Sierra Leoneans are currently heading up a review on that, which we are assisting. We are confident that the training that we are giving with others in this area will mean that the security sector in Sierra Leone will be able to take on board over a period the considerable difficulties regarding the security environment in Sierra Leone.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister give us any idea of how much is being done to restore the infrastructure&#151;roads, power and water&#151;so that agricultural development can take place? One hopes that Sierra Leone will then become, if not exactly self-supporting, at least hopeful of being so. What is being done in that regard?
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness touches on a very important point. Over 10 years of civil war the infrastructure was ruined. The World Bank and the European Union in particular have taken the lead in this area, which has included work on roads. I would be happy to send the noble Baroness further details on the specific projects supported by those two organisations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Northover: </b>   My Lords, what help is being given to Sierra Leone to combat its growing health crisis, which has resulted from the increasing incidence of HIV/AIDS and in particular drug-resistant malaria?
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, will know that health is one of the areas on which we have depended particularly on the work of civil society organisations such as Oxfam, Action Aid and Save the Children because the health infrastructure in Sierra Leone is so poor. The figures <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_511"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 511</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for the percentage of those infected with the HIV/AIDS virus differ widely, partly because the data are so poor. We are very conscious that on some of the figures it looks as if Sierra Leone is at that jump-off point from where the infection rates could reach epidemic proportions. We are supporting civil society organisations and looking at ways in which we can support the Government of Sierra Leone themselves to put in place infrastructure to support health.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, can the noble Baroness confirm that the legitimate government now have full control over the diamond mines, and that child soldiers are being effectively rehabilitated?
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, in relation to full control of mines, the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, will know that the sanctions against Sierra Leone have been lifted, as Sierra Leone is now part of the Kimberly process. The percentage of legal exports of minerals has risen considerably, but we are still concerned that this may be only one-fifth or one-quarter of the actual exports from that country. This issue really needs to be tackled.
</p>

<a name="40517-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>With respect to the issue of child soldiers, there is a concern about the high levels of unemployment of young people in Sierra Leone. The United States Government are working with some of the communities in those mineral areas, trying to build community development and promote employment in those areas, but we need to do a great deal more.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest, as my sister was a medical missionary in Sierra Leone, and she worked for a good many years at the hospital in Segbwema, the Nixon Memorial Hospital. That hospital was almost destroyed and members of staff were murdered by the rebels. That hospital had provided great services to the local community. What has been done to restore the services of hospitals such as that in Segbwema in the rural areas of Sierra Leone?
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the rural areas in Sierra Leone are particularly badly served. I said in response to the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, that health is one area where we face particular challenges. That remains the case with respect to hospitals. In rural communities, we have a difficult task in delivering health services. We do that through NGOs. On the specific hospital mentioned by the noble Lord, I will investigate and write to him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Renton: </b>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that Sierra Leone is continuously tropically hot, that the people are divided and somewhat backward, and that it really will be a tremendous effort for this country to secure political and economic sustainable development there? We would need to have large forces, and it would be a considerable task.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is right in that historically Sierra Leone has been divided. It went through 10 years of war. Since <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_512"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 512</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

peace was declared, we have seen national presidential elections, upcoming local elections this weekend, and the intervention by this country&#039;s military to help to ensure security in Sierra Leone, which was important at that point in time. There is no doubt that there are huge challenges ahead, but we remain confident that with the Sierra Leone Government putting poverty at the top of their agenda, and with the work that we and other donors are doing on security, we can help Sierra Leone through these difficult times.

<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Ezra </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What is their response to the conclusion of the recent utilities report by PricewaterhouseCoopers that security of supply is now the leading strategic aspect of the power market.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My Lords, the Government reaffirmed their commitment to the reliability of energy supplies delivered through the market as a key goal in their energy White Paper published in February 2003. We therefore share the report&#039;s view that it is essential that the right signals are being given to the market in relation to ensuring sufficient investment in the required infrastructure. We agree with the PricewaterhouseCoopers head of utilities when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;A consistent and stable regulatory environment is required to make the sector more attractive to investors. Capital will only come with good rates of return&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Ezra: </b>   My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Lord for that reply. Is he aware that in its report, PricewaterhouseCoopers drew attention to the fact that concern over security of supply had risen sharply in 2003, due on the one hand to the prospective withdrawal of aging plant, and on the other hand to the continued increase in electricity demand and a reluctance to invest in new capacity? Furthermore, is he aware that Dr Paul Golby, the chairman of Powergen, estimated that between &#163;50 billion and &#163;70 billion would need to be invested in the electricity sector in the next decade in order to achieve reliability and to cover demand growth? How is that to be achieved?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, the survey is of senior executives around the world, and it actually has rather few specific comments about the UK scene. I think that the UK scene is slightly different; we are well ahead in the field of deregulation, and we have established a stable regulatory environment. Indeed, there were favourable comments in the report, as the noble Lord will have seen, about the National Grid, Transco, and its role in capacity. Of course, at the moment we do not need additional generating capacity. The margins for this year, this winter and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_513"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 513</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

next winter are around 20 per cent, which is what it has been for the past 10 years. In due course, with a stable regulatory environment, we think that investment will come.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, how is the Government&#039;s policy of encouraging large parts of our country&#151;some of the most remote and most beautiful parts&#151;to be covered with windmills, which do not generate power when the wind does not blow, adding to the security of power supply in our country? Is it not the failure of the Government to show the courage to address the nuclear question that is at the root of these difficulties?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40517-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, it is the case, as has been explained many times, that there is more than one objective of our energy policy. There are cost considerations, security considerations and environmental considerations. Any energy policy must take account of these three objectives. Clearly, renewable energy is a key part of the environmental issue. As far as concerns the nuclear question, which we have covered in great detail on innumerable occasions in the past few weeks, it has emerged as clearly as ever that there is not a cheap source of nuclear energy readily available at this point.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040517/text/40517-03.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </b>   My Lords, is it not ironical that within days of the publication of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report to the effect that security of supply is now at the top of the list of priorities the Government should have announced that they are going to repeal Clause 1 of the Energy Bill in another place, where this House laid a firm duty on the Government to ensure security and integrity of the energy supply? It is not surprising that the Government are in a bit of a muddle, because the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said that the clause was not necessary; and the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, accused me of being Stalinist. They cannot both be right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I would never accuse the noble Lord of being Stalinist. As far as concerns this Question, we are not in disagreement about the central importance of security of supply. Indeed, that is stated in both the Electricity Act and the Gas Act. The phrasing of that requirement on the Government is what is in dispute. I am sure that the noble Lord will have seen from the newspapers that the industry is not at all enthusiastic about this amendment, because it thinks that it will make a radical change to the regulatory framework, which it does not want to see, because it wants to see a stable regulatory framework, which is exactly what this report is about.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Haskel: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that the report deals largely with the concerns of the utility companies? Has he seen other parts of the report that deal with the concerns of customers and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_514"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 514</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consumers? The main concerns of consumers are service and price. These were identified as their leading concerns. Does my noble friend agree that the best way to deal with this is with a fully liberalised market?
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, in any sensible energy policy, there must be a balance between the interests of producers and those of customers. Clearly, you can get security of supply by simply having margins of capacity, as we have had sometimes in the past, of over 30 per cent. It is not clear that that is in the interests of consumers, and we have had to take steps through the New Electricity Trading Arrangements to ensure that there is not overcharging of consumers. On the other hand, that must be balanced with making certain that there is a proper flow of investment into the industry, which depends on there being proper returns on capital.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, I ask the Minister to reconsider his reply to my noble friend Lord Forsyth. He said that we had discussed the nuclear industry in the past few weeks. We have discussed it, but we have not had any answers. One of the questions that have not been answered is whether or not nuclear power can be regarded as sustainable, renewable energy, as it is in parts of Canada.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, to be correct, the House has had the answers. There is disagreement about the nature of those answers, which is why they constantly get asked again. We have given the answers, and the position of nuclear energy is clear. With regard to CO2; emissions, nuclear energy is entirely beneficial to the environment, but other aspects of it, such as pollution and waste, are serious environmental hazards. We must take both considerations into account when looking at nuclear energy in the future.

Since the Budget, departments have worked with Sir Peter Gershon and others to develop efficiency proposals for consideration in the spending review.

<a name="40517-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord St John of Bletso: </b>   My Lords, with regard to the Government&#039;s target of &#163;20 billion savings over the next three years, how effective has the Government&#039;s e-government programme been in providing greater efficiencies? What assistance has been given to the Office of the e-Envoy to meet those ends?
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, the Office of the e-Envoy has played a great part in securing the savings that have already been made, to which, I think, the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, was referring. In particular, the Office of Government Commerce has responsibility for taking forward issues that are still important, such as procurement, in information technology.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm recent reports that, as part of the Gershon process, the Government are considering outsourcing certain functions of government to the Indian subcontinent?
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I am not conscious of that. Of course, consideration is always given to outsourcing, but I am not conscious of any particular proposal relating to the Indian subcontinent. I shall write to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, on that point, if I learn anything more.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, what part does improved productivity in the public services play in achieving the savings?
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, if we had a useful definition of productivity in the public service, it would, no doubt, play an important part. As the noble Lord knows from the discussions that we had on the matter last week, existing definitions of productivity in the public sector are not only wrong but perversely wrong and lead in the wrong direction. That is why the National Statistician has appointed Sir Tony Atkinson to consider the matter. When he reports, we can perhaps revisit the issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, can the noble Lord the Deputy Chief Whip tell the House how and why the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_516"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 516</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

headquarters staff of the Home Office have increased so much that they can no longer fit into the new headquarters in Marsham Street?
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I shall ask the Deputy Chief Whip to answer that question when he is asked about the subject. It sounds to me as if there was a mistake in the provision, rather than a mistake in the staffing of the Home Office.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes: </b>   My Lords, without wishing to sound too disingenuous about the difference between savings and efficiency, can the Minister say how the Government became so inefficient as to create such scope for improvement in efficiency, as a result of the report?
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew17"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I thought that I had addressed that issue. The Office of Government Commerce has saved or produced efficiencies of something like &#163;1.6 billion, since it was established in 2000. Some of that is a reduction in inefficiency, but a substantial part&#151;perhaps the majority&#151;is due to improvements in procurement. The improvements in procurement are an ongoing process that, I think, will never reach an end or achieve perfection.
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that one area of the public sector in which we have a useful definition is inflation? It appears that the public sector inflation rate is 7 per cent, which is miles higher than the overall inflation rate or the inflation rate in the private sector. Can the Minister explain how that is arrived at? What steps can be taken to curb that dangerous trend?
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="40517-03_spnew19"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I certainly cannot confirm those figures. The so-called figures for public sector inflation have exactly the same defects as the so-called definitions of public sector productivity to which the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, referred. They are nonsense. There is nothing in them, and there is nothing to be learnt from them.

</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40517-04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury </b>   moved Amendment No. 57A:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>Page 13, line 32, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   Student fees paid to relevant institutions pursuant to this Act shall in principle be additional to and not in replacement of state funding provided directly and indirectly for and in respect of students at such institutions which will be at an annual real level per student not less than that provided previously subject to exceptional macro-economic circumstances.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_57"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 57A, which would amend Clause 27, has been tabled by four university chancellors: the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, from the Conservative Benches; the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, from the Cross Benches; the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, from the Government Benches; and myself. The amendment would put into the Bill the principle of additionality.

</p>

<a name="40517-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>The passage of the Bill, as I need hardly remind the Committee, has been marked by more intense debate and rebellion in the other place than, perhaps, any other measure since 1997. What has united all parties, including the rebels, is the vital importance of higher education and acceptance that the long-standing underfunding of higher education imperils its future quality, particularly as regards academic recruitment. That general conviction overrides other disagreements&#151;all other disagreements&#151;about student fees.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>In opening the Second Reading debate, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, based her entire speech on the assumption that student fees would be an independent source of funding, additional to state funding. She was echoing the repeated assurances in that regard from the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. She said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;We must ensure that higher education has the funding and the independence to fulfil its many roles&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>She referred to what she called,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;a history of underfunding, with a backlog of about &#163;8 billion&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The noble Baroness went on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;it is essential that that underfunding is addressed. That is why the Bill provides greater support to our higher education system&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>She finished by saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;We estimate that it will raise about &#163;1 billion a year in additional income&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 19/4/04; cols. 12&#150;15.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>Nothing could possibly be clearer, so what could be the grounds for opposing an amendment that does no more than take the Government at their own word? So far as I am aware, the only argument advanced is that it would be a relative novelty. Governments, it is said, cannot or should not bind the future spending of their successors. But this is a very particular Bill with a very particular purpose and may be the exception that proves that convention.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>In fact, the taxation provisions in every Finance Bill, for example, bind successor governments unless and until they legislate otherwise. That is precisely what I suggest the vast majority in Parliament want in this case. Surely it would be a deep-dyed farce if, after all <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_518"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 518</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the heat and passion, the very foundation of this contentious Bill rested on a mere ministerial assurance. I say &quot;mere&quot; not to traduce the good intentions of Ministers, but because we all know from hard experience that times and Ministers change, as does government determination to stick by assurances given by other Ministers, let alone by other governments. In any event, assurances can be subject to argument and be diluted.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>One current example of that is the lottery legislation. In introducing the original lottery Bill, Kenneth Baker, as he then was, assured the House of Commons of additionality, yet a few years later we had a different Minister in a different government justifying lottery revenue being devoted in large sums to sustaining the core funding of the NHS by being used to buy replacement X-ray machines, scanners and heaven knows what.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="40517-04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Baker of Dorking: </b>   I thank the noble Lord for allowing me to intervene. It is that experience which has led me strongly to support his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="40517-04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I have never had a more welcome interjection.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>We must not have that here. This amendment is the only way which its movers can think of to ensure that. Without the amendment or something like it, one could find in 2006 policy arguments being adduced&#151;after the next election&#151;to justify a reduction in state spending, which in turn could have the effect of converting student fees into an indirect graduate tax by reducing the contribution of the general tax payer.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>I should explain one or two aspects of the wording of the amendment. I do not claim that it is perfect, but I believe that its purport is clear and common sense. It puts the principle four-square on the face of the Bill. Reference to &quot;exceptional macro-economic circumstances&quot;, while I admit is not a lovely phrase, is a straight lift from Article 9 of the EU Council of Ministers Council Regulation 4253/88, as amended in 1993. I hope that that does not put off some noble Lords. However, that legislates for additionality in relation to EU structural fund support. The exception is designed to protect governments from the effects of economic crisis, allowing them flexibility.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Where the amendment compares real levels of per student funding with those &quot;provided previously&quot; that would, subject to the crisis let-out, require a government to do at least as well in the year concerned as in the previous year. That is exactly what has been promised.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>If the amendment is passed, plainly it would need to be monitored, preferably on a consensual basis, by Universities UK and/or HEFCE, the Treasury and the Department for Education and Skills. I wondered about adding a monitoring provision to the amendment, but that really would not be necessary. I think and hope that we can assume good sense in implementing the statutory principle.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Some have asked whether a breach of this provision would be justiciable. The answer to that is a highly qualified &quot;yes&quot;, but in practice it would be legally <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_519"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 519</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

enforceable only in a very clear and exceptional case. Speculative claims would be inhibited by the potentially huge costs involved in mounting a judicial review of this clause. In any event, one has to have leave from the High Court so to do.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>The wording is intentionally expansive and so I believe that this formula provides a powerful moral marker as well as a practical, proportionate, long-stop safeguard. I beg to move.
<a name="time_4"></a>
<a name="40517-04_time1"></a><h5></h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40517-04_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   At Second Reading I expressed three concerns. The first was better support for part-time students; the second was to ensure that OFFA had no role in admissions; and the third was that the Exchequer should not substitute any part of graduate contributions for Exchequer funding. During that debate the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, outlined an amendment he had in mind to secure the third of those purposes. Afterwards I said to him that if he could successfully draft a clause, I would wish to support it.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The noble Lord knows from our subsequent discussions that I have some reservations. However, our objectives are exactly the same. I thank him and congratulate him on his work and the effort he has put in to bringing forward a clause that makes such sense. My objective, however it is achieved, is to ensure that graduate contributions are used for the good of higher education and not for the benefit of the Exchequer. How could it be otherwise when we are expecting young people, standing on the threshold of their lives, to do so with debts to which we are party?
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Turning to how that is best achieved, the legislative route has the clear attraction that it serves as a roadblock confronting any future government, not just the present one. That is a real attraction because the tenancy of the seat of government is no more than a tenancy, the freehold being owned by the electorate. I expect that the seat will be up for rent well before the graduate contribution part of the Bill ever begins to bite.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>The difficulty lies in drafting something that on the one hand is Treasury-proof&#151;I confess that I was once a practitioner of that dark art whose darkness is its only mystery; it is a troublesome art&#151;while on the other hand is acceptable to a government and does not have unintended consequences.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>I suspect that we all want a safeguard against the possibility that the increased funding will be snitched&#151;I repeat the word I used at Second Reading&#151;by the Chancellor, but the problem is that the Chancellor, whoever he, or she, may be, may feel that having complied with the letter of the clause, he has done his bit. I listened carefully to the words of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, as is his due, and they confirmed my reading of the wording of this clause. This is a chain index-linking, not one linking the unit of funding to what it was in a base year. That gives me cause for concern that the Chancellor, in thinking about an increase, might feel committed indefinitely to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_520"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 520</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the higher figure, which may not be affordable indefinitely. Therefore, he would back off from something we would all want.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>I turn to wheezes and dodges. Although I shall not waste the time of the Committee by outlining them, there are aspects that would mean that the Chancellor would be able to do things that we would very much not want him to do. He could bring things into the reckoning, because the clause refers to direct and indirect funding, embracing matters like funding for the teaching infrastructure and the estate. We are then talking about billions, which could wobble the whole intention.
</p>

<a name="40517-04_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>When thinking of future governments, I note that the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, who sits on the Opposition Front Bench, has added his name to the amendment. I take that to mean that he has every honourable intent, however much he may dislike the Bill in principle, of ensuring that if it goes through, his party will do the decent thing. When the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, spoke to her very principled and well thought-out amendment substituting tax for student contributions, if it were the case that a Liberal government came into office, we would be assured that if there were any student contributions, they would soon go. The noble Baroness nods in assent. Therefore I turn to the Government Front Bench and look forward eagerly to what the Minister has to say.
</p>

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="40517-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I am encouraged by the thought that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, thinks that a future Conservative government would do the decent thing. The decent thing to do with this Bill would be to put it through the shredder because it does not bring in more income than it costs the taxpayer, and it lays open the possibility of the Chancellor&#151;in that marvellous phrase which the noble Lord used&#151;&quot;snitching&quot; the proceeds. I have no experience of the present Chancellor, but when I was in government the previous Chancellor was a twitcher, if not a snitcher. Everything that I have seen of the Treasury over the years under both administrations shows that it does not change its habits.
</p>

<a name="40517-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, on moving this amendment. I was fishing in Scotland about lunchtime on a Friday, and a ghillie came running down the opposite riverbank and said, &quot;There&#039;s an urgent message from Lord Phillips. He has an amendment which you must look at immediately&quot;. The text of this amendment was brought across the water to me and of course I dropped everything to read it. It is an important issue and I very happily added my name to it, although I am not a university vice-chancellor or chancellor, as the noble Lord suggested. Everything that I have learnt in the course of acting on this Bench in respect of this Bill has encouraged me to do everything possible to avoid any invitations of that kind, for the problems are enormous.
</p>

<a name="40517-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>I have one question for the noble Lord, Lord Phillips: does he think that this amendment would have prevented the Government doing what they did in 1998 when they introduced tuition fees? That brought in additional income, but the Government <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_521"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 521</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

then reduced the funding so that the funding per student remained broadly the same. There was therefore no additional benefit of the fee income. In short, this Government have form; this Chancellor has form on snitching the resources from fees. The noble Lord described in his speech the opportunities for challenge in the courts: does he think that this clause would have provided a guarantee in that circumstance?
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="40517-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="40517-05_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   Then it was well worth the ghillie bringing the amendment down to the river! If that is the case, it provides something of merit. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, suggested that it would commit us to the principle of the Bill. I think not. But if universities are to be encouraged to go down the route of having fees, we should at least ensure that what Ministers say will be the position is the position.
</p>

<a name="40517-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Therefore I see no reason at all for the amendment to be rejected, short of the Minister having had an earful from the Treasury on the merits of the proposal. The Treasury never likes anything that smacks of hypothecation or limits its room for manoeuvre. Furthermore, my noble friend Lord Baker fought long and hard for the principle of additionality on the lottery, and once again this Government, not the previous government, have breached that principle. We have seen it, too, in respect of structural funds from the EU.
</p>

<a name="40517-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, on this amendment. I would have thought that, given the rhetoric which we have had from Ministers about this Bill, the Minister should have no trouble at all in accepting it.
</p>

<a name="40517-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>There is one other point which I would like to make, if your Lordships will bear with me. It relates to Universities UK briefing, which seems to parallel Labour research department briefing, which also finds its way into my interest from time to time. In the briefing, Universities UK comments:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;We accept that it is very difficult to commit future governments to levels of expenditure and we understand that Lord Phillips does not intend to press this amendment to a vote&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I am very surprised that Universities UK should not wish to see this on the face of the Bill, for the reasons which the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has explained. I await with interest the Minister&#039;s response and perhaps a contribution from the noble Baroness.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="40517-05_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   My understanding from the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, was that at this stage he did not wish to press the amendment to a vote and I mentioned that to Universities UK.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="40517-05_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   It would be interesting to follow the audit trail of where these things come from. Certainly my support for this amendment was on the basis that it was not a probing debate to discuss the merits or otherwise of additionality and what the Government might say to reassure those people who <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_522"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 522</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are concerned about it. It was because it would put on the face of the Bill a specific legal commitment in line with the rhetoric which we have heard from the Chancellor and other Ministers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="40517-05_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   If I might just intervene to respond to the noble Lords, Lord Dearing and Lord Forsyth, I have never said&#151;and never would say&#151;that that matter will not be put to the vote. It would be rather fruitless to have gone to all this trouble to say that. What I have said and what I expect to continue to say is that we will wait and see what the Government have to say on this amendment at this stage. I look forward to that right now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="40517-05_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   I add my voice to those who have supported this amendment. It is an intensely serious subject and a very topical one because the universities had experience&#151;in 1997 and 1998, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, mentioned&#151;of having the fees that were introduced snitched. Therefore the memory is sharp in their minds. They do not want to see it happen again, for perfectly legitimate reasons, because, frankly, the Bill has no purpose at all if it is merely a transfer of responsibility from the Exchequer to the student. The Bill has purpose at all only if it provides a degree of income and autonomy to the universities. So it is very important what the Minister says in reply, and what her colleagues in another place say if the Bill returns there.
</p>

<a name="40517-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>It is also quite important what the colleagues of the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, in another place say if the Bill returns there, because there was not much sound of that coming from the right honourable gentleman the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer when he was setting out the spending plans for a future Conservative government. He failed to mention higher education at all as a priority. So I am not quite sure where this money is coming from.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="40517-05_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   It would be very odd indeed for the Shadow Chancellor to spell out the outcomes arising from implementing an opposition policy to which we are opposed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="40517-05_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   That is as may be. Nevertheless, his support for this amendment would be deprived of much substance if it were just a verbal pirouette; if it did not in fact bespeak an intention to provide&#151;if there were a Conservative government&#151;greater resources for the universities, perhaps by a different route but nevertheless greater resources. It is important that the Government Benches reply to this amendment, it is hoped by accepting it, or if not, by statements that are a little bit better than simply saying they cannot bind the hands of a future government.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>I have many years of dealing with the Treasury over a matter which the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, mentioned, which was the structural funds of the European Union and additionality there. Anyone who has dealt with the Treasury on this matter is perfectly well aware that the reason the Treasury does not tie its hands is not because it cannot, but because it does not <br>&nbsp;<br>

wish to. It is a matter of will; it is not a matter of law. The day it wishes to, it can come to this House with an amendment which will be absolutely copper-bottomed, and which cannot be got around. It might be a better one than the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has produced. The Treasury could do it any day it liked, but that day has not yet come.
</p>

<a name="40517-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>So it is extremely important that statements are made if, at the end of the day, the Government refuse to accept amendments of a really clear kind. After all, we are having a comprehensive spending review this summer, which will overlap the period when this scheme enters into effect. Are we going to see in that spending review, before this measure enters into law, an absolute commitment not to snitch? I hope so because, if not, many people will feel that they have been led up the garden path.

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="40517-05_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   The amendment does indeed bring us to the heart of the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said, during the debates in this House and in the other place it was widely accepted that higher education is underfunded; the disagreement has been about how that funding gap is to be filled.
</p>

<a name="40517-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>In my view, variable fees are a vital step towards filling that gap. Predictions about how much they may raise have varied but, none the less, it is a fair estimate to say that about half the annual recurrent funding gap for teaching of about &#163;2 billion would be met. Continued increases from the public purse will therefore be essential, as all other speakers have pointed out. If the additional funding from fees is offset by reductions in public funding, then universities will be no better off. Fees must be truly additional.
</p>

<a name="40517-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>As the Committee is aware, the debate on whether the fees introduced in 1998 were truly additional still rages. We have raised the issue again today, as we did in previous discussions. However, I am sure that the fees mitigated the effects of the deep cuts that came in the mid-1990s. Indeed, public funding is now on the increase. The Government have committed themselves to increasing public funding. Let me remind the Committee of the Chancellor&#039;s words in a Budget speech.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I hope the noble Baroness will forgive me for interrupting but she said something which I am sure she did not mean to say. She suggested that funding had been falling under the previous administration. That, of course, is not the position. The funding per student provided by the Government since 1997 has fallen by about 10 per cent; and funding per student under the present administration has been less than in any of the 18 years under the Conservative government. I am sure the noble Baroness would not want to mislead the Committee.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="40517-06_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   I have no intention of misleading the Committee. I was making <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_524"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 524</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the point that when the present Government came to power the threats of cuts for higher education were very substantial indeed. The Government managed to reduce those cuts. I said that the additional resource provided by student support was part of that attempt.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>The Chancellor said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;university and student finance reforms will be matched by rising real- terms funding, to progress towards the 50 per cent target . . . The settlement will maintain the levels of real-terms student funding per head, and ensure the universities receive in full the benefit of additional revenue from the Government&#039;s higher education reforms&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 17/3/04; col. 335.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>That was very welcome, although I would appreciate it if the Minister could confirm that what the Chancellor meant when he said &quot;student funding per head&quot; was funding for institutions and did not include funding for student support.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Having said that, I very much welcome the spirit of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, as an opportunity for the Government to reiterate their commitment and as an attempt to hold future governments in principle to that commitment. We have spent many months wrestling with ideas about the way in which additionality could be ensured. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is to be congratulated on the ingenuity of his amendment and I await the Minister&#039;s response with interest.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I invite the Minister to consider three proposals. First, the Government should agree to work with Universities UK and the English funding council to arrive at an agreed definition of &quot;unit of public funding per student&quot;. It seems that every year, as the Committee may be aware, we get involved in a public dispute about what the unit of funding means. I should like to see, for example, income from private fees clearly identified as a separate and additional element; neither do I think that funding tied to specific projects should be counted in the calculation of unit funding. The Government think differently.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The second proposal is that the Government should undertake to publish an annual report to Parliament on the funding of the sector. Such a report should include three measures: the total public funding for higher education per student, including student support; the total public funding for higher education institutions per student; and the public expenditure on higher education institutions as a percentage of GDP. These measures should be agreed in advance between the Government, Universities UK and other key stakeholders. I accept that Universities UK could do this itself, but the whole purpose is to find a way to strengthen Parliament&#039;s position in holding the Government to account.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Thirdly, as the Government pointed out in last year&#039;s White Paper, <i>The Future of Higher Education</i>, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the USA all contribute 1 per cent of their GDP in public funding to tertiary education institutions. In the UK this is only 0.7 per cent. The conclusion drawn by the White Paper is that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;Our competitors see&#151;as we should&#151;that the developing knowledge economy means the need for more, better trained people in the workforce&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 525</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40517-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>I interpret the phrase &quot;as we should&quot; to mean that the Government recognise the importance of the UK moving towards the OECD average public expenditure on tertiary education. I hope the Minister will be able to confirm this.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>For these reasons, I support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. Unless fees are truly additional to public funding, the whole purpose of the Higher Education Bill, which has been debated with such passion, will be entirely undermined.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="40517-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Baker of Dorking: </b>   The principle of the amendment is very simple. The whole purpose of the Bill is to provide extra money for the universities, otherwise it would not have been introduced or gone through all the trouble it has gone through already. But it has to involve extra money. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, on devising a formula to achieve this. The amendment provides a very sensible solution. If it comes to a vote, possibly at Report stage, I hope it will even be supported by his own Front Bench. I am sure that noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench will not want to pass the whole of the Committee and Report stages without supporting one sensible idea.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>It will be quite difficult to get the simple principle on to the face of the Bill, but perhaps I may offer a suggestion. I am sure that, in reply, the Minister will repeat the words of the Chancellor&#151;that he will undertake to increase the funding of universities in real terms&#151;but, from my own experience, such pledges are written in sand. I said exactly the same in relation to the lottery&#151;that the money from the lottery would be preserved for the original direct beneficiaries&#151;but that was changed, first by a Conservative government and then changed in spades by the present Government. So pledges are not sufficient.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>If the Chancellor&#039;s words are to be implemented, one way of doing so&#151;apart from through the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips&#151;would be simply to say that the teaching grants to universities for art, science and medical students should be increased automatically, in real terms, by the rate of inflation. Such an undertaking could be placed on the face of the Bill. We need something more than a ministerial pledge based on what the Chancellor said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="40517-06_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Neill of Bengarve: </b>   I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, on trying to find a way to address the issue at the heart of the Bill. As the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, said, this is the heart of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>In the universities we have dark days where we believe that we will go through the process of obtaining additional funding streams through variable fees but that we will gain no benefit and our students will gain no benefit. In fact, we will gain a net detriment; namely, the transfer of odium from the Treasury and HEFCE to ourselves. That is our fear.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Nevertheless, we all recognise that the amendment has been very difficult to draft. I do not know how the Minister will respond to it&#151;I am not, I am afraid, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_526"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 526</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

going to help her on that matter&#151;but I have a suggestion for a failsafe approach which will avoid the problems of additionality and hypothecation having to be, in effect, defined on the face of the Bill. It is not an amendment that the Government will like but it will provide a safeguard to universities and students and I would be grateful if the Minister will speak to it when she replies. I suggest that we should consider a system whereby any decline in levels of HEFCE funding per student is compensated for by a reduction in the total student numbers. This would restore the real value of the HEFCE contribution per student.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Any reduction would undermine the ambition to move towards a 50 per cent target, but it is only sensible to have a failsafe provision in the Bill. We cannot make bricks without straw; we cannot go on with a continually reducing unit of resource. If the resource cannot be increased, I believe that we should reduce the numbers so that the resource per student is not reduced.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Indeed, my suggestion might accompany the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, rather than replace it if it is not accepted. For understandable reasons, he has had to consider the serious macro-economic conditions. My proposal would recognise that situation and would be an obstacle to the serving-up of ever thinner degrees in the name of expanding totals.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="40517-06_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   Several noble Lords have referred to the position of the Liberal Democrat Front Bench, so it is appropriate that I should make some statement. There is a law in economics known as the general law of the second best. The Liberal Democrat Front Bench adheres to that law. Our first best solution would be to have no fees at all and for the money to be put into the universities&#039; pot from the Exchequer. We have made it quite clear that that is our first best position. However, if we are confronted by a position in which fees are being levied&#151;and we do not form the Government and are therefore not in a position to get rid of those fees&#151;we would support this amendment on the grounds that it would be a second best position.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Indeed, we exposed the travesty of the situation that took place in relation to the 1998 fees. The fact that the Government were withdrawing money with one hand while taking fees with the other was exposed by a series of Questions put down in the other place by my honourable friend David Rendel, the Member of Parliament for Newbury. Therefore, we have played a considerable part in exposing what has happened and raising awareness of the fact that it is necessary to maintain the real value of the funding per student.
</p>

<a name="40517-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>I point out, both in relation to the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, and what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, that there has been an ambiguity in the unit funding per student, which frequently tends to take the HEFCE funding per student per institution. That includes HEFCE research funding as well as HEFCE funding for teaching. There is an ambiguity in that. It is vitally important that we use the HEFCE funding <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_527"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 527</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

per student for teaching and that that is not linked up with HEFCE research funding. The funding going into institutions from the research councils must also be kept totally distinct. There have been occasions when the Government, considerably to their benefit, put all three together, and the figures looked very good. The latest briefing from Universities UK provided us with figures for the funding per student just before we began the process of debating in this Chamber. I am grateful that at long last we have those useful figures.

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="40517-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Winston: </b>   I rise briefly to support this amendment. I understand very well the concerns that my noble friend the Minister may have, but as an employee of an excellent university, I know the desperate straits in which the higher education sector increasingly finds itself. Unless something like this amendment is supported by the Government or a provision is introduced to reduce student numbers, such as was suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, if this amendment cannot be supported, I will find it difficult to support the Government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="40517-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Wilson of Tillyorn: </b>   I add my voice to those who support this amendment. It is clear that the Bill sets out in the right direction. It is equally clear that, if our universities are to flourish&#151;or to survive in anything like their present form&#151;what is proposed does not go far enough. It would be even worse if what is proposed were then taken away. In one way or another&#151;whether in the form of the wording of this amendment, or the alternatives such as the subtle version proposed by my noble friend Lady O&#039;Neill or with the additions suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp&#151;it is essential that a &quot;no snitch&quot; clause is included in the Bill.

<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="40517-07_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, for ensuring that we have had this interesting debate, which has now become the &quot;no snitch&quot; clause debate. I am sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be thrilled when he hears about it. Listening to noble Lords, I am very conscious of the strength of feeling, which is either born from experience within the university sector or, in relation to the noble Lords, Lord Baker of Dorking and Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, from their experiences as Secretaries of State. I am sorry that they had those experiences in government. I pay tribute to the eloquence with which the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, introduced his amendment.
</p>

<a name="40517-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>I had planned to begin by repeating the words of the Chancellor, but as I repeated them on Thursday and they were also used by my noble friend, Lady Warwick, I will assume that noble Lords heard them on Thursday and today and that there is no need for me say them again. Of course, it is important to recognise within those words&#151;and I was interested to think of this Chancellor as a &quot;mere&quot; Chancellor, which is not a word that I associate with my right honourable friend&#151;that the money raised through variable tuition <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_528"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 528</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

fees will be in addition to the grant paid by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. We hope that our assurances will make noble Lords feel comfortable about the Government&#039;s ambitions for the sector.
</p>

<a name="40517-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>It will be no surprise to hear that I question whether it is right to agree this amendment to the Bill. Much as we endorse the principle and understand the rationale behind what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, argues, we do not believe that it is right to tie the hands of governments present and future for an unspecified time, which would be the impact of this amendment. Furthermore, as the noble Lord would recognise, there are two technical difficulties with the amendment. I understood what he said about Article 9, in terms of exceptional macro-economic circumstances, but there are still issues about what that phraseology would mean in particular circumstances and whether we would be able to gauge whether those circumstances had been reached or breached. It is also unclear whether the amendment would apply at the level of the whole sector or to individual institutions. If it were the latter, that could cause difficulties where the pattern of provision at an institution changes. Noble Lords well versed in education matters, especially at universities, know that HEFCE provides different amounts of funding for different courses, reflecting the different costs of lecture-based and science courses, for example, which is only sensible. However, it also reflects the ebb and flow of students across courses at different institutions. It would be important to allow for the funding adjustments to take account of the changes in course mix and numbers.
</p>

<a name="40517-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, returned to the issue of underfunding by governments. I have been very clear: I have put the figures in your Lordships&#039; House on more than one occasion. I accept that there has been underfunding of the sector. However, I reiterate what my noble friend Lady Blackstone said last week when she indicated the position that faced us when we came to power. The previous administration planned a cut of more than 6 per cent. We were able to reduce that cut to 2 per cent. It was still a cut and I am sorry that that was the case, but it was better than what would have happened. The noble Lord can shake his head. I can quote figures and so can he, but we both agree that governments have underfunded the sector. I would like to stop the argument at that point because it is important that we move forward.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="40517-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   The last thing that I want to do is have a debate about figures with the Minister, but this is an important principle. The Government were elected on a slogan of &quot;Education, Education, Education&quot;, but proceeded to cut university funding on a per-student basis while, at the same time, raising the money in fees&#151;what has been described as &quot;snitching&quot; in this debate. The Minister talks about tying the hands of the Treasury. That is precisely what we want to do. We want to prevent the Treasury taking this money and using it to reduce the amount of money that it would otherwise provide. The Minister must see <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_529"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 529</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that that is central to the whole theory and justification for the introduction of fees and for the Bill itself. It is a central issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="40517-07_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I understand that that is the issue, but I take exception to the fact that the noble Lord implies that the Conservative Party currently has a policy of support for the universities and that everything was rosy in the garden until we took over in 1997. The noble Lord implies that what I described as the position that we inherited was not the case. There would have been substantial cuts. There were cuts, but they were not of the order that the noble Lord&#039;s party would have imposed on universities. We are now in the position of redressing the balance, which is in an important way forward.
</p>

<a name="40517-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I also say to the noble Lord that, as far as I am concerned, what I say on these Benches ties the hands of my colleagues in another place. I therefore expect his support for this amendment ties the hands of his right honourable friend the shadow Chancellor in exactly the same way, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, indicated. I look forward to having some recognition of that in another place as we take this amendment forward and as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, determines whether he wishes to push that or not.
</p>

<a name="40517-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I would like to ask the noble Lord a further question. I do not know what a ghillie is and I hope that at some point he will be able to enlighten me. That shows that I am neither a fisherwoman nor spend enough time in Scotland for those purposes.
</p>

<a name="40517-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>I turn to the points raised by my noble friend Lady Warwick on behalf of Universities UK. I accept the issue about a new measure of unit funding which is something that the universities have wanted for some considerable time. We are going to ask officials in the department to work with Universities UK to look at options to do that; to find the appropriate measure which will go some way towards the kind of transparency that noble Lords have indicated that they would like; and, if we are able to find such a measure, we would be willing to publish that in the annual report. We should put that before Parliament. That is what my noble friend was particularly interested in. We are moving to increase the proportion of GDP that is spent on education.
</p>

<a name="40517-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, made an impassioned plea about the reduction in unit funding and the implications of that. I have listened with great care to what the noble Baroness said, but what is important is the blend within this. I would not want to commit such a straightforward link between one thing and another because of the nature of higher education and the different kinds of students that we have within education, for the unit funding is different in itself. The noble Baroness made an important point on which I would like to reflect further, as did other noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="40517-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>I recognise the strength of feeling in the Chamber. Noble Lords know very well that it is not for me today to commit the Government in this way. It is extremely <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_530"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 530</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

difficult to put things on the face of the Bill that commit this Government and future governments for all time. There are many issues to discuss. I suggest to noble Lords that I am perfectly happy to consider further what we might do on this issue, and, in particular, to talk to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, about his amendment. On that basis I trust that he will withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="40517-07_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   Perhaps I may briefly enlighten the noble Baroness. The relationship between a ghillie and a fisherman is very like the relationship between the Secretary of State for Education and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Secretary of State for Education shows the Chancellor where the money is and the Chancellor then catches it.
</p>

<a name="40517-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>What I have drawn out of the last 45 minutes is a profound sense of sadness at the state that universities have got themselves into&#151;stuck on their knees, begging for every last penny from the Chancellor. I spend a substantial amount of my life at the other end of independent schools asking for my money&#151;not for my children but for other people&#039;s children. A lot of these problems could be solved if sufficient numbers of universities were to assert their independence and stand proud. They have many strong and intelligent people leading them. I find it a great pity that they have come to this pass.

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to all the other amendments grouped with it.
</p>

<a name="40517-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>This group of amendments provides the first opportunity to discuss the director of fair access and the office of fair access. The main purpose of this group of amendments is to question the need for a separate office and a separate director and to ask why the functions proposed could not be subsumed within the existing functions of HEFCE and its Welsh opposite number.
</p>

<a name="40517-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Since this is the first opportunity to discuss OFFA, it is worth spending a little time setting the scene. In this Chamber we have already debated Clauses 22 and 23, which empower the Secretary of State to require the appropriate funding body&#151;either HEFCE of the Teacher Training Agency&#151;to impose conditions on their grants or loans to higher education institutions should the institution either breach the fee regulations or fail to submit an agreed access plan. As we have also discussed, the situation in Wales is somewhat different; at the moment I do not want to go into the complications of the Welsh situation.
</p>

<a name="40517-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>In this group of amendments we come to the mechanism by which the Secretary of State seeks to enforce these conditions. As the Bill currently stands, Clause 28 establishes a new authority with a director. Clause 29 establishes that the director shall be called the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;Director of Fair Access to Higher Education&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Clause 30 sets up the duties of the director. Clause 31 specifies that the Secretary of State can lay down regulations setting out the content of access plans. Clause 32 requires that higher education institutions have to submit their plans to the director of fair access. Clause 33 states that the duration of plans shall be specified by the Secretary of State. Clause 34 states that any variations after plans have been agreed have to be agreed with the director of fair access. Clause 35 empowers the director of fair access to instruct HEFCE to withhold grants and loans in accordance with procedures laid down in Clause 23.
</p>

<a name="40517-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>As we know, higher fees can be charged only if access plans are in place. These plans have to be drawn up by the higher education institutions themselves and submitted to the director of fair access, who will vet and agree them&#151;and presumably negotiate over them&#151;with the institution concerned. He will then monitor their implementation and, should an institution fail to implement its plans as specified, the director has the power to ask HEFCE or the Teacher Training Agency to fine the institution. As became apparent in proceedings in another place, fines of up to &#163;500,000 are possible. Under Clause 23, HEFCE itself has powers to fine any institution which charges fees higher than the basic amount without having an agreed plan in place.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40517-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>These amendments would eliminate the role of the director and the whole set-up of the office of fair access. They would, however, leave in place the whole business of access plans, but require these to be monitored by HEFCE or the TTA, which are the funding bodies defined in Clause 22(2).
</p>

<a name="40517-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>Specifically, the amendments would modify Clause 28 to eliminate references to the director, substituting instead &quot;funding bodies&quot;; eliminate Clause 29, establishing the post of director; modify Clause 30 so that references to the director are changed to &quot;the relevant authority&quot;; leave intact Clauses 31, 32, 33 and 34 in terms of content, procedures and duration of plans; modify Clause 35 to eliminate references to the director but endow HEFCE and the TTA with his powers; and modify Clause 38 to eliminate references to the director. Perhaps I should also refer to dropping Schedule 5, which relates to the director of fair access, although it is not in this group of amendments. 

<a name="time_7"></a>

</p>

<a name="40517-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>Why do we argue that the director&#039;s functions should be subsumed into HEFCE? The case was well made by the Minister for Higher Education in discussion of these amendments in Committee in the other place. He pointed out, first, that OFFA and HEFCE would have to work very closely together, and for that reason would be collocated in Bristol. Indeed, I understand that OFFA will work out of the HEFCE office and in the first instance use HEFCE staff. But he then went on to say&#151;and I believe this to be the most significant statement&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State made it clear, in his guidance letter, that we do not expect universities to do anything differently from what they do now. They have an agenda of widening participation: that will be subsumed into OFFA, and they will produce the same pieces of paper that they currently produce&#151;no extra paper will be going to Bristol. OFFA and HEFCE will have an obligation to exchange information, so if the access agreement is breached, that would be a matter for the director and OFFA&#151;not HEFCE&#151;although HEFCE punishments, including fines, will be imposed&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee H, 2/3/04; col.379.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Our argument, in brief, is that HEFCE is already doing the job and that OFFA is an unnecessary piece of extra bureaucracy. It may cost only &#163;500,000, which is what the Explanatory Notes tell us, but quite frankly that &#163;500,000 could more usefully go directly to the higher education institutions themselves. These institutions already have to have access plans, which have to be agreed with HEFCE. HEFCE monitors those plans, and the universities know very well that it is in their interests to modify and amend the plans in line with requirements laid down by HEFCE. Indeed, HEFCE already has powers to impose fines on universities in breach of the fee regulations laid down under the 1998 Act. However, as the Minister admitted, no institution has actually breached the regulations, and no fines have ever been imposed. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;I do not expect any plans to be breached. Nor do I expect the fee limits to be breached&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee H, 2/3/04; col.380.]</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="column_533"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 533</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40517-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>Vice-chancellors are a law-fearing and law-abiding set of people, and will not knowingly breach their obligations. The Minister may argue that we need to preserve the distinction between funder and regulator, and that HEFCE is the funder and OFFA the regulator. I would be prepared to accept that distinction if we were back in the 1970s. In those days, the University Grants Committee was a genuinely independent organisation, set at arm&#039;s length from government and acting as a buffer between the higher education institutions and Ministers. But those days are long gone. Some of us would like there to be an element of the autonomy of the UGC restored but, for the present, HEFCE is very firmly in the Government&#039;s control, with a direct line of accountability through a director-general of higher education, located in the Department for Education and Skills. Moreover, it is clear from the functions that it has been performing&#151;for example, in policing the charging of fees under the 1998 Act, not to mention the participation agenda&#151;that any suggestion that it has not been acting as a regulator is absurd, to say the least.
</p>

<a name="40517-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>My argument, therefore, is that the functions to be performed by OFFA have already been carried out by HEFCE, which has managed the process perfectly well. There is no need to set up an extra office. The expense and potential bureaucratic complications involved are unnecessary. We should remove any mention of OFFA or its director from the Bill. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="40517-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   The more I listened to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, the more I wondered whether I should support her amendment. However, I fear that I cannot support her, although I agree with several of the points that she made.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>For me, this part of the Bill, which sets up OFFA, is the most offensive and dangerous. OFFA as it is set out in the Bill, with the powers that it has, is an attack on academic freedom. It would be tempting to see the subsuming of OFFA into HEFCE as a way of reducing the unpleasant aspects of its powers, but I fear that there would be a number of disadvantages. First, it would be much more difficult to abolish if there were a change of government. Secondly, it would be extremely difficult to identify the costs of the exercise. I do not know who was responsible for deciding that OFFA would cost &#163;500,000, but if the behaviour of this Government in setting up the many quangos that they have established, along with boards, tsars and all the rest is anything to go by, that &#163;500,000 will not get much beyond paying for the salary of the chief executive and his staff, never mind the fulsome duties being placed on OFFA.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>There is an argument for keeping a separate, stand-alone body, if for no other reason than scrutiny of what it is up to. In addition, however&#151;and uncharacteristically&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, is not really being politically streetwise. What we have to recognise, which is so evident from the briefings that we have had from Universities UK and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_534"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 534</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

others, is that a deal has been done here between the Government and their Back-Benchers in the other place. Those Back-Benchers, because they are principled socialists, do not like the idea of fees. The Government have persuaded them to go along with this by setting up OFFA, which they see as a body that will interfere with the admissions procedures in our universities and discriminate against youngsters who come from what they regard as more privileged backgrounds. That is the nature of the deal.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>The noble Baroness may see this as a Trojan horse, but were we to send the Bill back to the other place without OFFA in place, that deal would collapse and the whole Bill would collapse. Perhaps the noble Baroness is more streetwise than I imagined and that is the tactic that she has in mind. But it is perfectly apparent that the universities, certainly with regard to Universities UK, have entered into a Faustian bargain. That bargain is that the Government will deliver the fees&#151;although we noted in the last debate that that might not amount to very much by the time the Chancellor has finished&#151;and, in return, OFFA will be created, which will have an unprecedented role in interfering in the independence of our universities.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I have much sympathy with the noble Baroness, but I prefer the amendments tabled by my noble friend Lady Perry, which we shall discuss later and which would leave OFFA in place while seeking to limit the degree to which OFFA can interfere and to secure more independence of OFFA. On that basis, I regret being unable to offer support to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="40517-09_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   Like many noble Lords, I have had grave concerns about some aspects of the proposals for the Office for Fair Access, and I know that many or most vice-chancellors share my concern. I should also confess that, when <i>The Future of Higher Education</i> was first published, I, too, thought that OFFA should be part of the funding council. I did not see why it was necessary to create an extra body when the funding council already monitors institutions&#039; widening participation strategies. It seemed to me that it would be administratively tidy, which might help in respect of the possible mushrooming of OFFA&#039;s remit. However, I believe that I was wrong.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>On reflection, I am not convinced that it would be helpful to extend the remit of the funding council in this way. The funding council already exercises considerable power within the sector, particularly in the way in which funding is distributed. OFFA will have the power not only to instruct the funding council to fine institutions if they breach their access plans but also to prevent them charging fees above the basic level in the first place. It would seem excessive and could possibly be to the detriment of all parties involved were these additional powers to be concentrated with those that HEFCE already has. So I am not convinced that this set of amendments produces a solution to the problems which I foresee arising from the proposals.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_535"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 535</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40517-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>However, I would urge your Lordships to focus attention on some of the more pressing matters. First, OFFA should have no remit with regard to admissions. As noble Lords will know, that is the subject of two amendments tabled in my name.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Secondly, the regulations under Clauses 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 should be subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny. The powers to make regulations under those clauses are very wide and should be subject to affirmative resolution procedure. Again, I have tabled amendments on that point.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Thirdly, OFFA should not seek to micro-manage institutions&#039; widening participation strategies, or to require institutions to frame their plans by reference to particular courses of study. My Amendment No. 85A deals with that point.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>Fourthly, there should be an appeals mechanism. The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, has tabled an amendment on that, which I shall certainly support.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>There are other issues, too, but those are my four main concerns. They are covered in detail in briefings distributed by Universities UK. But the problem here is that locating OFFA within the funding council would not address any of the problems with OFFA that I have just mentioned. In fact, there are distinct advantages in locating OFFA outside HEFCE. Not least, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, mentioned, it will allow us to keep an eye on the running costs. That is an important point. But I urge noble Lords who have supported this amendment to reconsider.
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="40517-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   I, too, regret that I cannot support the amendment. I see its point and merit. I want to stress a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, and the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick&#151;the issue of scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>HEFCE does not hold its meetings in public. I declare that I was a member of HEFCE and I have the highest regard for the rigour with which discussions take place. But to put OFFA under the umbrella of HEFCE would to some extent obscure what was going on. That is why I prefer to support later amendments which stress the importance of public access to what is going on and public discussion of how this body is funded and carries out its business.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="40517-09_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Lockwood: </b>   There are a number of amendments on the subject of OFFA. It is difficult to know where to speak on the different aspects. I seek greater clarification of the respective roles of OFFA and HEFCE. Subsuming the widening of participation responsibility into OFFA from HEFCE will make it difficult for OFFA to be a distance organisation. In other words, if it enters the whole question of widening participation, it must use its powers in relation to that matter, which HEFCE does already.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>There are two aspects on widening participation. First, there are those highly qualified A-level students who may or may not receive a fair deal in getting into the so-called top universities. That question was raised in the press today in anticipation of the report which I <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_536"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 536</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

understand will be published in a month&#039;s time, indicating that the state system is not getting its fair share of places in top universities.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>OFFA could carry out that role because it would not involve interference with the policies and programmes of universities.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>On the second aspect of widening access, we are talking about a different group of young people. They are young people from lower social backgrounds who are not motivated to go into higher education. Some of HEFCE&#039;s work has been to support and fund strategies which universities are adopting in order to widen that access and to try and motivate those students at a younger age to have higher expectations of themselves and to work to get qualifications that would enable them to enter universities.
<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="40517-09_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40517-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>HEFCE has considerable powers in relation to funding. It funds strategies which relate not only to what universities do as single institutions, but also to the way they work with other educational organisations, with the LSC and even with employers, who are providing possibilities for study in places of employment. That is a much more detailed approach than surely OFFA could undertake if it were to accept the responsibility of widening participation.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>I should like the Minister in her reply&#151;and perhaps this would be done better in response to later amendments&#151;to tell us where the responsibilities of OFFA will begin and the responsibilities of HEFCE will end. Otherwise, I feel that we are not going to have a straightforward arm&#039;s length position from OFFA and the funding provided by HEFCE will become somewhat blurred as to its purposes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="40517-09_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Warnock: </b>   I strongly support what the noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood, has just said. There has been a tremendous confusion between two groups of people from state schools, some of whom&#151;as reported in today&#039;s press&#151;are not going to the top universities because they did not apply. I think that that is one set of problems.
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>There is a quite different set of problems which comes down to how people in the state system are prepared for higher or further education. It addresses a different problem and is about a different group of people. Can the Minister in her reply clarify in very simple terms&#151;because I find myself totally confused&#151;how OFFA can be said to have no influence on the admissions policy of universities if its remit is to widen access?
</p>

<a name="40517-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>I think I am being very stupid about this, but I simply cannot understand how those two things are compatible. So I should be very grateful if the Minister could say something about that.
</p>

<a name="40517-10_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   We all appreciate that whatever the noble Baroness is, she is certainly not stupid. She has made some very important suggestions without making them too clearly. I am sure the Minister can read what she says.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_537"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 537</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40517-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, that the noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood, put a very good case. It seems to me she was in fact perhaps talking in favour of the amendment, because she was saying that the funding council to a great extent is already doing that which OFFA will do.
</p>

<a name="40517-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>I do not speak with the deep knowledge that noble Lords have of exactly how this system works, but it seems to me that the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, said something very important. He said that the world needs to know what OFFA is doing. It needs to know what OFFA is up to because it is going to be absolutely critical to whether the Bill works or not. It is, to my mind, much the most dangerous part of this Bill. In the end, I suspect the Bill may sink because of it. It is a tragedy that OFFA is in the Bill. If it is going to be there, we need to know what it is up to. I originally argued, at the meeting with Universities UK, that perhaps its function should be subsumed in the funding council. I thought then that was a less bureaucratic option. I now think what the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, has said is very important.
</p>

<a name="40517-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>Universities regard OFFA as the political penalty they have had to pay to get the small amount of their funding from the students. That is the simple fact&#151;they felt they had to accept this. It seems to me that it is the duty of this House either to get rid of OFFA or to make OFFA a good deal less dangerous than it otherwise would be, or we really will not have done much service to the nation in respect of this Bill. It is the crux of the matter. With regret, I cannot support the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment, although I think I would have done so a week or two ago, and I am sorry about that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="40517-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Quirk: </b>   I also began by thinking that whatever role OFFA eventually had it would be better to have it subsumed under HEFCE. Like others, I have also come to the conclusion that that was wrong and that OFFA should be set up independently if it has to be set up at all, if only so that we can keep an eye on it better.
</p>

<a name="40517-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>One of the objections I raised at Second Reading to the existence of OFFA was the danger of &quot;mission creep&quot;, and I still see that as a major danger. As has been pointed out by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, <i>inter alia</i>, if the job is to widen access, then OFFA can, quite legitimately, see widening access as narrowing access to other types of student coming in to university.
</p>

<a name="40517-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>We have seen today the further attack upon independent education in this country, but there is another major area where universities like to recruit and have the freedom to recruit, and have the financial necessity to recruit&#151;overseas students. With some institutions, the number of overseas students&#151;that is, full-fee students, I am not talking about EU students&#151;represent fairly hefty percentages. The Government have repeatedly assured me, when I have brought this up with individual Ministers, that that is not the intention of the role of OFFA. I fully accept that that is not the intention, but it is none the less a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_538"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 538</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

logical development of OFFA. I would therefore like an assurance&#151;not necessarily on the face of the Bill, but at least in <i>Hansard</i>&#151;that the universities will not be penalised if, as penury increasingly hits them, they increase the proportion of students coming from full-fee paying clientele.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="40517-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Eatwell: </b>   The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp may be pleased to know that I support her amendments. I do so for four reasons. First, her set of amendments will save a substantial amount of money&#151;something that has not been referred to in a sector that everyone admits is desperately under-funded. It is surely obvious that the creation of yet another regulator will involve a substantial diversion of resources away from teaching and research, support of students and new outreach programmes, and toward the maintenance of a new bureaucracy in OFFA itself and in the universities responding to OFFA. Suppose, for example, that we accept the Government&#039;s figure that OFFA will cost &#163;500,000. Then let us suppose that each university employs just three new people to deal with relations with OFFA. This costs each university a modest &#163;100,000. Given that there are 130 universities, that means for the sector as a whole, costs will rise by in excess of &#163;13 million, excluding the cost of OFFA itself.
</p>

<a name="40517-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I am sure my noble friend will be aware of the recent report of your Lordship&#039;s Select Committee on the Constitution on the regulatory state. Page nine of this report states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;The recommendations of the Better Regulation Task Force (BRTF) that regulators should produce Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) on all new major policies and initiatives has been accepted by the Government and should be applied throughout the system.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>Could the noble Baroness outline the regulatory impact assessment&#151;particularly its impact on the universities&#151;when she replies? Can she also tell us whether any independent bodies, such as the Audit Commission, have assessed the cost of the creation of OFFA on the university sector as a whole? So the first reason I support the noble Baroness is that her amendment will save a lot of money.
</p>

<a name="40517-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>Secondly, exactly the same goals can be achieved by her amendments. Great note should be taken of the quotation which she read from my right honourable friend Mr Alan Johnson in Committee. What did he say? Let us consider what the noble Baroness repeated for us:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;we do not expect universities to do anything differently from what they do now.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>If universities are not expected to do anything differently, what is the role of this institution? Then Mr Johnson said,


</p>
<ul>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The third reason that I support the noble Baroness&#151;which I regard as the most important&#151;is that I think it is an enormous mistake to create a regulator with such a narrow remit. The Government tell us that OFFA will not have anything to do with admissions, but will concentrate solely on widening the pool of applicants. That is a very important task, but it is but one task and a very limited one. Creating a new regulator for this new task will have one over-riding consequence&#151;the regulator will be looking for things to do. As the noble Lord, Lord Quirk said, there will be mission creep. Like all bureaucracies since time immemorial, it will create things to do. It will demand new surveys, it will continually redefine its terms of reference to make more work, and it will impose ever more elaborate work on the universities. This is exactly what we have already experienced with the TQA. We have already seen this happen in that earlier regulatory disaster that was imposed on the universities. Exactly the same thing will happen with OFFA. It is far better that the role of monitoring access plans should remain where it is now in HEFCE&#151;an institution that already has a very wide range of work to do and will not need to find extra work to justify its existence.
</p>

<a name="40517-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>My fourth reason for supporting the noble Baroness is that I reject the argument&#151;which I know has been made by many noble Lords, and I have listened very carefully to what they have said&#151;that there is a need for some independent director of access outside HEFCE, and that independence is itself important. The only argument I really heard for this was the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, saying that it would be easier to abolish the organisation. I am not a betting man, but I am quite willing to take a substantial bet that this organisation will not exist in five years&#039; time. I believe that this notion of the need for independence is a spurious argument, and one contradicted in the Bill itself. After all, the Bill requires HEFCE to impose various conditions of grant with respect to the setting of fees. How is that in any way different from the conditions of access plans? If HEFCE is perfectly capable of making assessments and imposing financial penalties on such a controversial and complex issue as fees&#151;and many other aspects are monitored by HEFCE&#151;why is it incapable of making assessments and imposing penalties on the issue of access plans?
</p>

<a name="40517-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>By supporting the noble Baroness&#039;s amendments, you can save money, you can do the same thing, you can stop mission creep and you can ensure that HEFCE can continue to monitor access procedure, which it already does very well.

I am slightly baffled by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, and the main strand of his opposition to my noble friend&#039;s amendments, which seems to revolve around the potential danger of the whole proposal about widening access if we have an independent body, as compared with keeping the function within HEFCE. The normal argument would <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40517-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   An argument that I did not mention might help the noble Lord. HEFCE is the funding body; therefore the leverage and power that it can apply in pursuing its interfering practices is greater.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="40517-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   That is a fair point, unless we adopt a variant of what I think the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, are designed to achieve; namely, that if the widening of access remains with HEFCE, that aspect of its functions should have the public transparency and openness for which the noble Lord hopes. There is no reason on earth why that should not prevail within HEFCE.

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>I am also influenced by the extraordinary remarks of Alan Johnson in the other place. It makes all my antennae wobble furiously when we have a Minister saying, &quot;There&#039;s absolutely no purpose in setting up this organisation, so we&#039;re going to set it up&quot;. If that is not a prelude to mission creep, I do not know what is. My noble friend&#039;s amendments serve the purposes of those on the Conservative Front Bench and of a number of other speakers rather better than they think.

Then they merged into the Higher Education Funding Council for England. It is a rather heavy job to be a chief executive, or even the part-time chairman, of such an organisation, and I am worried, first, about whether they could devote the time and thought necessary to this very sensitive issue. Secondly, I worry about the concentration of power. I always worry about that when there is not the clearest of accountabilities. Thirdly, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, about on-the-spot accountability. For those reasons, although I am clear that HEFCE could do the job, it would be safer and better to have a separate organisation.

The clinching reason for me was that given by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth&#151;risk of contamination between the role of HEFCE as the dispenser of very large sums of money to the universities and its remit on widening access. I cannot support the amendments. It is absolutely fundamental, however, that the distinction between OFFA&#039;s activities in respect of applications and its non-activity in respect of <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40517-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>I slightly contest the view that the provisions are a kind of Faustian pact. I am not worried about Faustian pacts between the Government and their Back-Benchers in the House of Commons; that is nothing for consenting adults to worry about. However, I am worried about the suggestion that the universities are entering into a Faustian pact. They are not; they do not for a minute dispute the strategy of widening access. The university with which I am concerned spends a great deal of time and effort attempting to widen access. The universities will continue to do so, OFFA or no OFFA.

<a name="40517-11_para2"></a>

<a name="40517-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   I apologise for speaking again on the topic, but the arguments put forward in favour of the amendment are very good arguments for having no OFFA at all. If that were the proposal, I would be with it. To put OFFA under HEFCE does not in any way guarantee that there will not be mission creep, additional bureaucracy imposed on universities, or additional costs for universities. Consider, for example, the research assessment exercise, which is very significantly under the funding councils. It has increased the bureaucracy on universities dramatically, year on year. I thoroughly accept that there are attempts to slim it down, but the exercise did not have the beneficial effect suggested. Full-time people are employed, certainly at universities, to deal with the research assessment exercise as an additional cost.

However, I frequently agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock. I want to amplify what she said in rather less delicate language. Those who think that there is a difference between widening the pool of applicants and admissions criteria are living in cloud cuckoo land.
</p>

<a name="40517-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>We should look at some of the problems with access at the moment. In order to read architecture at Cambridge, when someone applies for admission they have to show a wide knowledge of architecture. That is a very clear set of prejudices against anyone coming from inner-city Manchester who simply happens to think that there is something inspiring about the built environment; they may never have come across architecture textbooks on the reading list compulsory even for consideration by Cambridge. That is an admissions criterion. If we want to widen the pool of applicants for architecture at Cambridge, we have to change the admissions criteria.

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>If we want to get people from comprehensive schools to study more languages at our great universities, we have to offer courses that have rather more relevance to the modern world than some of those offered at Oxford and Cambridge.

There would not be any problem at all, except for a little more work for academics, in compressing most degree courses into two years&#151;apart from the fact that students would have much less fun. People from backgrounds in which they want to get on with life and work, whose priority is not faffing around playing sport, drinking or whatever else might take their fancy, might like to have access to two-year courses at the great universities. If they are not offered, that affects the pool of applicants for those universities.

If that creature is to influence fair access, that is what it has to do. The only sensible relationship between a university and a government on the matter is one of a conversation of equals. For universities to lie prone on their backs, waiting for the eagle to tear their liver out, is a terrible shame.

Our experience of the evidence we took of other regulators was that that was a highly desirable feature of a regulator now with the power that regulators have. We shall return to that issue later. I accept entirely the point about mission creep, but not just mission creep. It is the pressure from outside on regulators to move into other areas.

<a name="40517-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>There is a danger that new regulations may come from the Government on what OFFA might do. They might be in response to other pressures from those who want to see OFFA moving from access into admissions. As the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, pointed out, it is a narrow remit. It would be tempting to anyone taking on that role to wish to expand his remit as time goes on. I agree with all the points that he forcefully made, but that led me to the same conclusion as the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, that we should not have that body at all.

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>All the vibes I get from the universities indicate that they did not want the body either but felt that they had to accept it as a political compromise for the tuition fees that they wanted. The danger is that, as the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, properly pointed out, it is for the universities to deal with wider access, which they are doing anyway. Anything in that area can only further compromise the independence of the universities in that regard, about which I feel strongly. For the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, I am with the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, and not the amendment. He put the points very well.

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I shall begin by saying to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, that we shall be looking later, without heralding too much, at amendments concerning admissions. I am categoric in saying that there is a big difference between applications and admissions; they are not the same thing. If one happens to live and go to a particular school in the beautiful city of Manchester, which I know and love well and which has some of the greatest architecture in the country, one is capable of reading the books and understanding the beauty of architecture wherever one goes. What matters is that one has the opportunity to get the books and to understand how to do that.
</p>

<a name="40517-12_para2"></a>

<a name="40517-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>We thought carefully about whether we should introduce a new body into the legislation and in particular whether the role could be carried out by HEFCE. As noble Lords have said, HEFCE is capable of carrying out that role, but we thought that a separate body was the right approach for a variety of reasons. I am reluctant to rehearse them all again because noble Lords have indicated them, not least the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, in his description of the wider role of HEFCE and the role of the Secretary of State in terms of the relationship between government and HEFCE, which is different from that proposed for OFFA.
</p>

<a name="40517-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The clear distinction between the two bodies is that HEFCE is primarily a funding body and OFFA is a regulatory body. We were concerned that if HEFCE undertook the role of the regulatory body, it might find itself in a conflict of interests. The responsibility towards the financial health of the sector is critical. Perhaps HEFCE could one day be asking itself whether the activities it funded which were carried out according to its guidance were adequate to justify charging higher fees, particularly if it knew how acutely an institution was in need of extra resources.

But we have said that in doing so it is important that we do not duplicate the resources within HEFCE that could be of value to the director. We have said that we do not want cumbersome new bureaucratic machinery and that we expect it to cost about &#163;5,000 per year, as noble Lords have said. We hope that we will obtain the best of both worlds, with the director making use of HEFCE&#039;s staff and its systems but with a remit to make clear and independent decisions.

As a Minister I certainly do so and I know that my colleagues do, too. My noble friend asked me specifically about the cost to the university. The assessment says that compliance costs will vary according to the institutions&#039; progress in widening participation and the needs of their students and potential students. Institutions will know OFFA&#039;s expectations in advance and will be able to plan accordingly.

Service post&#151;a servant of the Crown, appointed through the Civil Service Commission and paid out of the parliamentary vote with pay and conditions according to the Civil Service rules. For such a key post, we feel that that political independence and integrity is absolutely essential.
</p>

<a name="40517-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>I was very struck by an interview with the noble Baroness, Lady Prashar&#151;our first Civil Service Commissioner&#151;in the press at the weekend in which she described the importance of the involvement of the Civil Service Commission in public appointments of this kind of seniority. She said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;we are custodians of the civil service core values of integrity and honesty. We also ensure that it remains impartial&#151;that there is no political patronage&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>I should like to see the director of OFFA in exactly that kind of role&#151;independent of any political interference or political choice. I should like to see a director of OFFA who is neither a creature nor a crony of the Secretary of State. On the face of the Bill at present, the director will not be independent in that way. She or he will be appointed by the Secretary of State and will take directions from the Secretary of State, and his or her pay and conditions will be determined by the Secretary of State. I do not believe that that is right.
</p>

<a name="40517-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>As other noble Lords said earlier, tradition has rightly insisted on an arm&#039;s length relationship between government and universities. These amendments take a step in that direction by ensuring that the director is a servant of the Crown and is independent in that way. We are making no change to the reporting mechanism. We recognise that the Secretary of State will need to report and answer to Parliament for what is happening in this area, and we accept that. However, we do not believe that the crucial appointment of the director should be subject to any political influence whatever. I hope that these amendments will go a long way towards ensuring that. I beg to move.

<a name="40517-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   I support Amendment No. 62 and, consequentially, Amendments Nos. 64 and 65. To extend the metaphor that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, developed with great skill, teeth are here, and if Jaws is alive and well in the cool water of academe, perhaps drawing some teeth is an important consequent. If we are to have a regulator, we must make two consequential decisions that are absolutely fundamental.
</p>

<a name="40517-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>First, as the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, pointed out very well, the independence of the appointment is critical. This individual must not be conceived to be, be seen to be, be thought to be or actually be an extension of any political office. He or she must be someone who speaks with independence. Equally, there must be independence in the manner in which the duties are carried out, and those duties must be subject to independent scrutiny. The two consequential amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 64 and 65&#151;as well as much that will come later, suggest a way of ensuring that that scrutiny can take place.

</p>

<a name="40517-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I have been a regulator and I was reassured by the independence of my appointment&#151;indeed, it was a Crown appointment. I had very good relations with both Secretaries of State, but that was because the basic independence was there in the first place. I have resisted bullying from political advisers both pre and post-1997. It does happen. Again, unless there is independence both in the manner of the appointment and in the way in which reporting is carried out&#151;and, indeed, in the financing of the appointment&#151;there will be consequential risks. Therefore, the amendments are tabled on the assumption that, if we are to have such a post, we must watch very carefully how it is set up and how the duties are carried out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="40517-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I find this image of the access regulator much more comforting than either the one posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, or the one posed by the Government. I do not think that one should downplay the power of a person who has the power of publicity, the power of advice and the power of knowing that, if he is ignored, the Government will do something to ensure that whatever obstacles are placed in his path are removed. Over the past few years, we have had many examples of legislation being set out in that way, with the Government setting up or endorsing something which is advisory, voluntary or supportive with the clear understanding that, if it fails, regulatory action will follow. There is no particular reason why, in setting out the functions in this Bill, we should not make it clear that the powers of enforcement will not be brought into effect unless they turn out to be necessary because due progress is not being made. There is certainly no reason why we cannot build in a concept of independence.
</p>

<a name="40517-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>A regulator like that should be capable of ranging much more widely. After all, if all one is offering is advice, there is no reason to keep him out of areas of university life, out of decisions being taken in universities or out of the way in which universities are being run, because all he can do is offer advice. It is not a matter of outside direction, but of someone being able to see the whole picture, so that what is done in universities to improve access for everyone is viewed in the round. It is not as though there are separate pots, one called &quot;access&quot;, another called &quot;admissions&quot; and another called &quot;the courses we offer&quot;, including all the other support arrangements that take place in and before university. If we have someone who is independent and whose powers are in abeyance, we shall have a much more effective regulator. We shall have to wait to see whether such a matter will go through the other place.

<a name="40517-13_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My noble friend should read precisely what is to be done by the regulator before he concludes that the regulator is there only to give advice. He will actually regulate. All kinds of things can happen to universities, including being fined if they do not do what they are supposed to do. He will accept the terms and so on. I believe that he will be in a much stronger position.

<a name="40517-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>I rather like the idea of such a person being reinforced in his or her independence by being a civil servant. That may help, not that I have observed civil servants always being impervious to the will of Ministers. The way in which they react to Ministers is different from the way in which a regulator, appointed under the Bill, will react, as the relationship will be different. I rather like the idea, but I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about this matter. It is an interesting proposition.

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40517-13_spnew3"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </b>   This is not the kind of amendment over which I shall go to the stake, but it merits careful consideration. Whatever the colour of the government in power, the independence of the post is very important.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="40517-13_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   On a number of occasions when a Minister I recall that the view of my noble friend Lady Carnegy was that Ministers were too inclined not to be impervious to the views of civil servants. I welcome these amendments and congratulate my noble friend Lady Perry, not just on this amendment but on the group. The Minister will be relieved to hear that I do not plan to talk to the later amendments, but it is important to see them as a package. It is clear that what is being done here is to give a degree of independence to the regulator, which must be worth while.
</p>

<a name="40517-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>I apologise that I keep taking pot shots at Universities UK, but I was struck that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said that there was no Faustian pact between the universities and the Government. I read the briefing from Universities UK which says on this amendment:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;This amendment, together with a package of consequential amendments to Schedule 5 seeks to make the Director of OFFA a crown appointment. This would impose constraints on the Secretary of State&#039;s power to influence the Director of OFFA and influence the mechanism for appointment. The Director would be directly accountable to Parliament&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>That sounds a good idea, but the rest of the briefing goes on to reject the amendment for reasons with which I shall not weary the Committee.
</p>

<a name="40517-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>It is apparent that a deal has been done, which, in terms, is even referred to at private meetings, whereby universities feel that they cannot upset the position in the Bill with respect to the regulator. I do not believe that there should be an OFFA at all, but I recognise that it is in the Bill and that the Government are the government and I believe that this amendment from my noble friend has merit. No doubt the Minister may say that there will be other ways of achieving the end, or whatever, but the key matter is independence. Certainly, Universities UK seems to think that the amendment works in terms of its intention. I certainly welcome the spirit behind it and agree with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland. Independence and accountability have to be the hallmark of the regulator and that hallmark needs to be stamped on the bottom of the Bill.

<a name="40517-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   From the outset I share the thought that the critical issue is independence. The right <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_550"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 550</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reverend Prelate made the point in a few words and it is at the heart of many of the contributions to the debate. I shall deal with that point in talking to the amendments. Many of the other issues, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, has said, will be raised under other amendments and are probably best dealt with later.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>I fear that these amendments, as tabled, are unlikely to achieve what I believe have been the expressed concerns of noble Lords, in particular the noble Baroness, Lady Perry. I agree that everyone is rightly keen to ensure that the Director of Fair Access is not subject to government control in the way that he or she is appointed and carries out the task that has been assigned. I wholly share those concerns and I hope that what I say illustrates why the Government have chosen to go in one direction when it is true that other directions were not impossible.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>Amendments No. 62, 64 and 65 as tabled would make the Director of Fair Access into an organisation staffed by civil servants and directly funded by Parliament. The normal implication of that, taken as a whole, would be to create a new non-ministerial government department and I do not think that that is what everyone wants. It is likely that a body of that kind will be disproportionately bureaucratic for the size and role of the Director of Fair Access and indeed, from the discussion that we have had, I am sure that that is not the intent. No one is trying to build a bureaucracy. I see noble Lords shaking their heads with some grief that that may be the outcome.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I shall seek to offer reassurance to the Committee that the Director of Fair Access will indeed be independent. That is the test that I want to apply. In thinking about creating the Director of Fair Access a number of organisational possibilities were considered. We were advised by the Cabinet Office that an executive non-departmental public body was the right structure for the director, as we envisaged it, because it would be a small, focused, regulatory body.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The executive non-departmental public body model is a commonly accepted means of dealing with such a conundrum. Government often need to create organisations that will act independently and in the public interest, but which also need public funding and ultimate accountability to Parliament. Regulatory bodies are classic examples: the Office of the Rail Regulator, for example, or the Commission for Racial Equality.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Therefore, there are standard and recognised models and rules that govern how those who run NDPBs are appointed and their relationship with their sponsor departments. We have based the principles on which the director will be established around those key principles. On the appointment of the director, for example, Clause 29(2) provides that the appointment will be made by the Secretary of State. However, as an NDPB, the appointment is subject to the code of practice of ministerial appointments to public bodies, which is overseen by the Commissioner for Public Appointments.

<a name="40517-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I hope that noble Lords will bear with me for a moment while I cite the guidance that Dame Rennie Fritchie has expressed as being the underpinning of the work that she carries out in that regard. It is a useful description of someone who I believe we all feel has exercised the functions with a great deal of innovation and originality and total independence. I quote her briefly:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;My task is to ensure that all government departments have systems for public appointments which are visible, fair and open. Further, that all appointments within my remit are made on merit and contribute to the development of strong and balanced boards and public bodies.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>I believe that having visible, fair and open systems is fundamentally important. However I also believe that public confidence in the process is paramount and that one cannot stand without the other. This requires constant and consistent effort by a wide range of people to deliver this goal&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>That seems to have the watermark of Dame Rennie Fritchie&#039;s approach to those matters.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>The code that will be used was developed precisely to ensure that some core principles were followed in public appointments. Those principles are listed in the code, with which I know Members of the Committee are very familiar. In a nutshell, the key elements of the code are: that all public appointments should be governed by the overriding principle of selection based on merit; that no appointment will take place without first being scrutinised by an independent panel, or by a group including membership independent of the department filling the post; that the principles of open government must be applied to the appointments process; and that those appointed must be committed to the principles and values of public service, and perform their duties with integrity.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>Ultimate ministerial responsibility for appointments is exercised in accordance with those principles. Departments are responsible for ensuring that the principles are followed in actual recruitment exercises&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="40517-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I am sorry to interrupt the Minister. Is an executive non-departmental public body, which is how he described OFFA, the same thing as what we used to call an executive quango? If so, is that not a league away from an appointment made by the Civil Service Commission; for example, that of the chairman of the Crown Estate? The Minister appeared to dismiss my noble friend&#039;s model by suggesting that that would create a government department that equalled a bureaucracy. Surely there is a distinction between a quango and an appointment made by the Crown?
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="40517-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I will outline in more detail the distinction made earlier. I certainly do not intend in any cavalier way to dismiss the propositions, because they should be weighed seriously one against the other. I find it difficult to answer the noble Lord&#039;s question about whether it was what he used to call an executive quango because I am not sure what he used to call an executive quango.

<a name="40517-14_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. I used to call an executive quango what the Civil Service called a non-departmental public body, large numbers of which the noble Lord&#039;s party pledged to abolish when it was elected in 1997.
</p>




<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="40517-14_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   If the noble Lord is in the happy position of having to find both ends of the equation, no doubt his definition will be accurate in his own terms. I do not know whether it will help us greatly in this debate.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>The principles that we want to follow in appointing the Director of Fair Access are very similar to those used by the Civil Service Commission for appointing civil servants, but they are adapted to the fact that appointees to NDPBs&#151;whether or not some call them executive quangos&#151;are not to be civil servants. They will not, for example, owe a duty of loyalty to the Government. The important principle is that the Government should not have that degree of control.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Amendment No. 64 would make the Director of Fair Access and his or her staff servants or agents of the Crown. That status for the director and staff is incompatible with an executive NDPB, the status that we envisage as most appropriate for the director. If the director and staff are to be servants or agents of the Crown then the organisational structures within which they would normally operate will be a government department. I wish to make the distinction about why the choice was made. It was not the Government&#039;s preference, because we believed that whoever was responsible for approving and monitoring access plans must be independent of government and of higher education institutions.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>There was the option of a non-ministerial government department akin to Ofsted. Other such examples include the Inland Revenue and the Office for Fair Trading&#151;large and complex organisations with broad remits. Although that option certainly offers the necessary independence from government and institutions, it would involve the kind of organisation that I described as a disproportionately bureaucratic way of organising the very targeted function that we expect the Director of Fair Access to perform. It has been the will of the Committee in the debate so far to ensure that it is focused in precisely that way. I have heard no Member of the Committee argue that it should get into any form of drift. I am sure that Members of the Committee would not want all the machinery that goes with a non-ministerial government department.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>Amendment No. 62 would mean that the Director of Fair Access was recruited by the Secretary of State but in accordance with the guidance of the Civil Service Commission. The Civil Service Commission guidance applies to the recruitment of civil servants, so the amendment would imply that noble Lords wished the director to be a civil servant. Forgive me for spelling it out, but that would be the implication.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>We decided against the director being a civil servant, ultimately accountable to Ministers and with a duty of loyalty to the Crown, and opted instead for a director <br>&nbsp;<br>

who was visibly independent of government as the head of a non-departmental public body. I believe that that view will be widely shared by the higher education sector generally. The role of the director is closer to that of the Rail Regulator or the chair of the Commission for Racial Equality than to that of a Permanent Secretary of a government department. We are most concerned that that independence should be completely visible.
<a name="time_12"></a>
<a name="40517-14_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40517-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>Amendment No. 65 says that the director shall be paid out of money provided by Parliament. The director as currently envisaged would be an executive NDPB and as such would need to have a sponsor department. Members of the Committee may be prompted by a concern that direct funding from Parliament would give the director greater independence from the Secretary of State. That has been part of the argument that was put so well. The director will have a duty to carry out the functions within his or her remit in the way that he or she thinks fit. There is no question of the Secretary of State dictating to the director how to go about his or her business; the Secretary of State simply cannot do that. The director&#039;s decisions on access plans will be his or her own.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>The Government have never intended to interfere in how the director conducts his or her business. We accepted an amendment in another place to remove the Secretary of State&#039;s powers to regulate when the director should or should not approve access plans. There are no powers in the Bill to enable the Secretary of State to give a direction to the director. He may issue guidance to which the director will need to have regard and may provide for regulations that are subject to parliamentary approval. But he simply cannot dictate to the director how the functions should be fulfilled.
</p>

<a name="40517-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>I hope that that explains why we chose this direction. I accept the argument that it was among different directions in which we could have gone. We chose this direction because we believed that it enhanced the independence to the highest possible extent, and that the selection would be made on the basis of criteria that noble Lords believed essential in the context of other important public appointments. I hope that those reassurances will enable the noble Baroness to consider withdrawing her amendment.

The examples that he quoted of non-ministerial departmental bodies vary in size enormously. Just because the two or three that he mentioned happen to be quite large, there is absolutely no reason that there should not also be a small one of the same kind.

proved ourselves to be totally independent and at times deeply embarrassing to governments of all colours. I see various previous Secretaries of State nodding wisely as I say that. It was occasionally our duty to the Crown so to be. So I am afraid that, from personal experience, I do not find the noble Lord&#039;s arguments particularly persuasive. The Minister did well in trying to demonstrate that independence is somehow conferred by the kind of arrangements that the Government are proposing. However, when an official is head of an NDPB, but he or she must take direction, advice and guidance from the Secretary of State, is this like the guidance that HEFCE gets every year, in that it must be followed to the letter, or else? Must he or she have regard to that guidance in everything that he or she does? That does not sound like independence.
</p>

<a name="40517-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>I still rest on the importance of the kind of independence that an appointment through the Civil Service Commission gives. We have seen too much in recent times of cronies and creatures of Secretaries of State being appointed to senior positions. I find it very distasteful, whichever party does it.

&quot;(4)   The Director shall identify and promote best practice in fair access arrangements, and shall provide where he considers appropriate advice and training to institutions on best practice as identified in their reports to the relevant authority and the Funding Councils.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_119"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment creates another plank in the vision of what OFFA&#039;s role should be. It should in a sense be read together with the opposition, to come later, to Clauses 34, 35 and 36, which shows what many of us believe that OFFA should not be. OFFA should not be a regulatory power that has power to punish people if they do not follow a particular line. I am anxious to say that this vision of OFFA as an office that identifies and promotes best practice and offers appropriate advice and training to institutions on best practice is not in my view a wrecking amendment. We are not trying to wreck the Bill, but we are doing what is proper for this House to be doing; that is, asking the Government and those in the other place to think again about the role of the Director of Fair Access.
</p>

<a name="40517-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>I for one welcome the Government&#039;s emphasis on fair access. I yield to no-one in my commitment to it&#151;the whole of my career has been in one way or another concerned with providing access. I know how desperately difficult it is to reach out and get applications in from groups that are often alien to the higher education world. I am delighted to know that the Government are committed, through this Bill and through other activities, to improving this situation. I simply do not believe that the way in which universities can be made to redouble their efforts in improving fair <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_555"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 555</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

access is by punitive powers of regulation and then punishment if they do not meet what they say they will do.
</p>

<a name="40517-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>I wish to turn this into a different kind of model, one that genuinely enhances what universities are already doing, and which undoubtedly addresses the deficiencies that I am sure can be found in some recruitment processes. I am not pretending that everything is rosy and that it is a perfect world at the moment. Clearly, not enough is happening, and therefore probably not enough is being done, although I remain of the view that much of what is not being done is not the fault of the universities, but of schools.
</p>

<a name="40517-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>Nevertheless, I see a positive role for a small NDPB, a small OFFA, that would provide an analysis of the plans that universities send in as to what they will do; which would engage in dialogue with them as to whether their plans are seen as adequate in the light of other plans; which would identify from those plans good practice and best practice, and make that widely known. Also, crucially, it would provide the necessary training. Certainly, some of the deficiencies that have already been identified in the press and elsewhere could probably be helped by a central body that provided advice and training in the way that is suggested in this amendment.

<a name="40517-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>My noble friend on the Front Bench has referred several times to the Universities UK briefing. I was a little surprised to see that in the UUK briefing on this amendment, it says that it does not support the amendment, because UUK believes that the primary responsibility for widening participation rests with institutions themselves. In that case, it seems odd that the noble Baroness who is the director of UUK has not tabled any amendments, for example, to alter the duties of the director, to promote and safeguard access to higher education, which we support and believe is right.
</p>

<a name="40517-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>It goes on to say that UUK has already done much of this work itself&#151;so it has. It has brought out and widely disseminated some excellent publications that identify good practice. UUK could in no way measure up&#151;because it has so much else to do&#151;to the power to read through every access plan of every university and to do a real analysis of those plans, which would rest with OFFA and its director. Therefore, it would be appropriate to follow many of the recommendations of Professor Schwartz&#039;s report, to have a body not with regulatory and punitive powers, but with advisory, training and dissemination powers. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>I would be happy to accept this amendment in principle. Inevitably, there are technical issues to do with it, such as the position in Wales. This amendment does not allow for the different position in Wales. As I have indicated, we would see that because of the regulatory functions of the Director of Fair Access, he will gain expertise in this area, and therefore he will become a source of such expertise, in the way that the noble Baroness indicated. With the leave of the Committee and the noble Baroness, I suggest that we take this away, craft a suitable amendment, discuss it with the noble Baroness, so that she can see exactly what we have done, and bring it forward.

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The phrase &quot;Faustian pact&quot; has been used several times. I presume that, in this Faustian pact, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills is Mephistopheles and has done some sort of deal with the universities. That is not a pact. The pact that has been done is between the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and the Left wing of the Labour Party in the House of Commons. The deal is simple: the Secretary of State has said, &quot;You give me fees, and I will give you an access regulator to open up the ivory towers for our lads&quot;. The fact is that their lads have been going to the Ivy League universities in our country in huge numbers for the past 20 years&#151;not in hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands but in hundreds of thousands.
</p>

<a name="40517-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>I remember a conversation that I had a fortnight ago with the headmaster of the Landau Forte City Technology College in Derby. I was speaking to him because the chairman of that college, Lady Brigstocke, had been tragically killed in an accident. I asked how the college was getting on. The college was built in the most deprived part of Derby, where educational expectations were zero, 12 years ago. The college now has 90 per cent A to C grades at 16 and a staying-on rate of over 80 per cent at 16. At 18, many students go on to university.
</p>

<a name="40517-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>The thing that made the headmaster proudest was the fact that, last year, seven of his pupils had got into Oxbridge. That would have unthinkable. Why did it happen? It did not happen because of an access regulator, and it will not happen because of an access regulator. It happened because the college had an inspirational head teacher and inspirational teachers who lifted the expectations of their pupils and said, &quot;You can strike at the top of the tree. Be ambitious. You don&#039;t have to go to a college of further education or one of the newer universities&quot;. That is where the change must take place. It must take place in the motivation of pupils and students. We do not need an access regulator for that, and I fail to see why one is necessary.

<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>The figures show that pupils from private schools with a lower combination of A-level marks got a higher proportion of places than pupils from state schools. The headline was wrong. The article includes Sir Peter Lampl&#039;s comments. He said that the reason for the figures was that pupils from many schools did not apply to the Ivy League universities. I am glad to see the Minister nod; I shall suggest how she can spend a little money more sensibly than by setting up the OFFA regulator.

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>With his own money, Sir Peter provides summer schools for children from deprived areas.

</p>

<a name="40517-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   I suggest that the Minister goes to see <i>The History Boys</i> at the National Theatre, the new Alan Bennett play. In that play, it is only too clear that six or seven boys in the class are going to Oxford entirely because of the thrust and enthusiasm of a very unpleasant headmaster.
</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="40517-16_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Norton of Louth: </b>   I support my noble friend Lord Baker of Dorking and am much influenced by what he said. Like him, I cannot see the case for OFFA. There is, perhaps, a misperception on the part of the Government of how much the proposal to create that body is resented. OFFA is seen as an additional burden. It cannot be seen in isolation in addressing a particular problem.
</p>

<a name="40517-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>I have made the point before that academics are underpaid, under-resourced and undervalued. What they have in excess is regulation. Over the past 10 to 20 years, a massive regulatory burden has been imposed on the universities. There has been no off-setting increase in resources, and the regulation has been notably inefficient, consuming time and resources to marginal benefit. It may have helped raise standards in some of the less good institutions, but only at the expense of the rest. It has made no substantial impact on the quality of university education. One cannot see the additional burden as something that deals with a particular problem, detached from how academics view the burden that they already have. OFFA is an additional burden and is resented very much by those who work in the universities. It may be that the intention is to have a light touch, but that is the perception. We cannot divorce the two.
</p>

<a name="40517-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Secondly, OFFA will not deal with the problem that it purports to address. I agree with my noble friend Lord Baker of Dorking on that. The real problem is a cultural one, embedded well before pupils reach sixth form and start to think&#151;or not think&#151;of going to university. It is not even a case of persuading schoolchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds to apply to university; it is a case of creating a culture of attainment and of wanting to go to university in their family, well before they get to secondary school. The universities can help&#151;I did my bit this morning, talking to year 10 pupils in a Hull secondary school&#151;but they can only do so much. OFFA misses the point in that respect. If we really want fairness in the system, we must change the system so that applications for entry are made after A-level results are known.
</p>

<a name="40517-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>My noble friend referred to the survey by the Sutton Trust, reported in this morning&#039;s press, which suggests that pupils from state schools miss out to those from independent schools in admissions. I notice that the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education in another place said that that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_559"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 559</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

justified having the director of fair access, but that destroys the point that the noble Baroness was making about the distinction between applications and admissions. The chairman of the Sutton Trust pointed out that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;It is not that the universities are biased. They don&#039;t really have the data when they make the decisions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>It is a consequence of A-level results not being known at the time of application. Offers are made on the basis of predicted grades, and that can give rise to disparities in the system.
</p>

<a name="40517-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>OFFA is not the answer. It will not get at the nub of the problem. The director will largely have an impossible task. However hard universities try to encourage applications&#151;the somewhat ambiguous wording of Clause 31(4) appears to emphasise applications&#151;they cannot guarantee that pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds will apply. I appreciate what Clause 29 seeks to do, but this is not the way to do it. If anything, it will generate resentment and, I fear, little else.

</p>

<a name="40517-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I have no difficulty with what both noble Lords said about the role of schools in raising aspirations and about inspirational teachers and head teachers. I agree. However, we know that teachers will tell us how difficult it can be with children for whom it is not part of their culture to think of going to university and in whose family there is no experience of anybody doing it. Such children may not even consider it to be appropriate, as it is not what they and their mates do. There is a deep-seated issue about getting support to some of our brighter young people, and I know that the noble Lords, Lord Norton of Louth and Lord Baker of Dorking, would agree.
</p>

<a name="40517-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>We are trying to look at both ends of the situation and, for me, it is not a question of &quot;either/or&quot;, but of &quot;both/and&quot;. I recognise and accept that universities do a great deal in terms of outreach because they know very well that some of our school pupils do not think of going to university. They have no experience of university, they would not go near a campus, they would not understand either what it was for or was about, and therefore they need the experience. That is extremely important. It is true to say that many universities do great things in this regard, but I would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_560"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 560</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

say that some institutions could do more. That is inevitably a truism. I should like my own children to be invited to visit our local university, one that is five minutes down the road from their school but they have not set foot in it. So it is important to ensure that we do more.
</p>

<a name="40517-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>I turn to a point made earlier in the debate. It is important to take what will be a very different step in our relationship with universities. It is one which, in terms of the argument about ability, they have welcomed. I know that some noble Lords who represent universities will say that this is &quot;not enough&quot; and &quot;does not go far enough&quot;, but it is an important development.
</p>

<a name="40517-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>However, it is also the responsibility of the Government to look at the potential impact here. It is not just about the &quot;left wing&quot; of a party; that is too easy to say. Having read the media reports and listened to students and their representatives, it is clear that they are worried about the impact and implications. We have a responsibility to look at both of these issues and be clear about them. We are trying to create a system that gives universities their freedom, but in doing so ensure that they look carefully at the outreach work they do and at the bursaries they provide in order to make sure that the system is working well. Indeed, some fantastic and highly innovative work in this area has already been undertaken by universities like Cambridge.

There is no argument in the Committee that more could be done and, in some cases, more should be done, or that there is a real problem in attracting applications from people in under-represented groups. All sides agree on those points. However, what concerns some of us and certainly concerns the universities is that the way to make this happen is, according to the Government, by regulation, by punitive powers, by fines and by placing more burdens on universities instead of trying to encourage them.
</p>

<a name="40517-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>This is the old story of the carrot and the stick. All we are being offered here is the stick. We are not being offered anything that would enhance and improve what universities, with the best will in the world, are trying to do. No university seeks to exclude bright kids; they want them. We would welcome an organisation that helps and supports that aim, but not one that will be yet another set of regulations with punishments if universities do not do exactly what it says.

</p>

<a name="40517-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>I can say to the Committee that I would be astonished if the regulator does anything other than work with universities in a very positive way. I would expect that. However, it is the job of the Government <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_561"></a>

to lay out the consequences if it does not happen. It is as simple as that, otherwise universities will be unsure of the position and left feeling uncertain.

<a name="40517-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>It has been my experience during the passage of every piece of legislation on which I have had the good fortune to work that noble Lords look at the bold, bald elements which often seem to be the negative part of the experience. But this is meant to be about clarity and recognition. Nevertheless, the universities have to understand what the position would be should they not participate in the way we have set out.
</p>

<a name="40517-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>My ambition is exactly the same as that of all noble Lords, and I think that the package that we have put together in this Bill is a very good one. It will be much better for universities and will ensure, in a supportive way, that the young people we have all identified and feel passionately about have the chance to gain the qualifications that will enable them to be accepted at university. They should understand that they can go to university and that universities will support them&#151;not as individuals, but collectively. On that basis, I think that this clause should stand part of the Bill.

Can the Bill be changed from what it is at the moment&#151;a provision that will come into force immediately&#151;to something that would come into force later by regulation so that the stick was not put immediately in the hands of the access regulator, but which could appear later if things did not work out? I should have thought that would at least slightly shift the balance so that the dons are offered, if not more carrot than stick then perhaps more claret than stick.

<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="40517-17_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   As I have said, the Bill stands as a package and the package has to be clear. The role of the Director of Fair Access, as he takes up his functions, will be to work with the institutions and to consider the issues with them. We know that the universities are concerned to ensure that they have sufficient time to develop their plans with the director. I see that as a positive relationship. It is not about delaying provisions, it is about this Bill going through and providing the package that we have suggested. It is the right one to take forward for our universities.

</p>

<a name="40517-17_para4"></a>

<a name="40517-17_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   Perhaps we should remember that the basis for the introduction of the Office for Fair Access was the corollary of the change in this Bill to allow students to be charged a very considerable increase in fees. Although we have made clear our view that additional fees are most unlikely to put students off&#151;we can look to the experience in Australia and Canada for that&#151;and although we can say that the universities are doing excellent work to ensure that widening participation is a key mission statement, we must recall none the less that when this debate was held in another place, the Minister was put under great pressure not only by Members on the Labour Back Benches, but also by parts of the higher education sector, particularly the National Union of Students. The sector wanted to ensure that there would be some degree of guarantee that students would not be put off. That is the balance of the argument that the sector has had to face up to. We have not yet convinced many doubters of the willingness and determination of the sector to follow this through. It is on that basis that many vice-chancellors have felt able to support what the Government are doing.

<a name="40517-17_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   Before we do not vote on this matter, perhaps I may say a word, although why I know not. I agree with those who have argued that the answer to the problem of access is to be found in our secondary schools. It is the case that those with two A-levels go to university pretty well irrespective of class. The problem is the proportion of those in the less well-off social classes who get that far. One of the reasons why young people do not get that far is that they do not stay on in education after the age of 16.
</p>

<a name="40517-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>Some would say that the battle begins right back in primary school, or even earlier. We have to win that battle.

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Rightly or wrongly&#151;and many noble Lords may think wrongly&#151;there is a suspicion that entry to the more prestigious universities is associated with social class. It may be a false correlation, but it is seen. I think, painful though it is, that in the long run it will help universities to have an OFFA giving that public assurance. Maybe those universities which are looking forward to 2010 may find that if they are going to have their dreams come true, OFFA has been passed at the gateway to that.

I understand, and it has effectively been said, that there is a package there, but there is another way of doing it which will allow regulation in a much more straightforward way. If universities are told simply that a proportion of the moneys earned and raised from the additional fees had to be set aside for needs-blind admission and therefore scholarships for those who could least afford it, that could be audited through the accounts of the university very quickly and easily.
</p>

<a name="40517-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>There would be a corollary, however, which is why the proposal may not be politically acceptable: the fees would have to be higher to make that worthwhile and workable. But I do want to have on the record that there is an alternative: you do not have a &#163;3,000 cap on fees; you do not have a cap; but you insist that whatever the proportion&#151;and it might have to be about one-third&#151;it goes into a needs-blind admission system. Then I think we could achieve some of the goals we have been aiming for. I would not like the Bill to go through without alternatives at least having been put on the record.

part-time students, and also that my younger son, Jonathan, is a lecturer on inclusive education at the Open University, which has considerably more.
</p>

<a name="40517-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>I must also apologise for my absence last Thursday afternoon. As I explained to the Minister and others concerned, I had a long-standing invitation, together with my noble friend Lord Slim, to be at the splendid new gurdwara in Southall. While I was there, I was able to touch on the subject of higher education, albeit briefly&#151;a theme then being debated in this Chamber.
</p>

<a name="40517-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>Having read <i>Hansard</i>, I am aware that my absence also caused the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, to speak at greater length than she had planned, and I apologise for that, too. The noble Baroness informed us that no less than 42 per cent of higher education students in Britain today are part-time. Could anyone in all seriousness describe themselves as a director of fair access if he were to ignore those 800,000 students? Hence my amendment ensuring that the director includes them in his annual report. If the Government&#039;s view of their policy is correct, my amendment would allow the director of fair access to trumpet their wisdom. If the pessimistic among us are correct, my amendment will require the director of fair access to sound a warning. It seems perfectly reasonable to me.
</p>

<a name="40517-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Barnett&#151;who unfortunately is not in his place&#151;is also supposed to be speaking to an amendment on part-time higher education, to which my name is added; that is, Amendment No. 77. I will, if I may, say a few words on that.
</p>

<a name="40517-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>I believe that last Thursday the noble Lord was speeding towards Manchester as I was struggling through the rush-hour traffic to get to Southall. I imagine that the noble Lord reached his destination rather earlier than I did, but he certainly seems to have missed the boat this afternoon. Amendment No. 77 puts the onus on the Secretary of State to take into account the participation of part-time and full-time students, whereas my Amendment No. 66 puts the onus on the director of fair access.
</p>

<a name="40517-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>I do not need to dwell on the virtues of part-time education and the especial place held in the country&#039;s affections for the Open University. They were well rehearsed at Second Reading by, among others, the noble Baronesses, Lady Blackstone, Lady Dean and Lady Boothroyd, a formidable triumvirate indeed, well up to the fire power of the originals: Pompey, Caesar and Crassus. Further reinforcements arrived last Thursday with no fewer than six noble Baronesses&#151;and one lone noble Lord&#151;attempting to prize out of the Government even more improvements than they are proposing for part-time and/or mature students.
</p>

<a name="40517-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>It seems to me, having read the Minister&#039;s friendly but carefully worded reply, that even after making pro rata adjustments, part-time students will receive significantly less help than their full-time colleagues, and that universities&#151;wholly or mainly supporting part-time students&#151;will also be disadvantaged by the Government failing to make appropriate financial provision to safeguard their multifarious and extremely valuable activities.

<a name="40517-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>I pray in aid for this assertion two quotes given to me by my noble friend Lord Quirk, both from pre-1992 universities: Leeds and Leicester. First, Leeds:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;Damage would be inflicted to current programmes both by individual numerical losses (pushing up teaching costs) and possible clustering of lower recruitment in some programmes, making them unviable. It is difficult to see a simple or immediate way out of these problems&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Now Leicester:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;An immediate manifestation of not adapting form to purpose is still treating full-and part-time students as distinct species. It matters to institutions that cater wholly or mainly for part-time study, and to others for whom it is a major part of their business&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>The position of the Open University was brought to your Lordships&#039; attention by several speakers last Thursday, particularly by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, who is in her place. To illustrate my claim that part-time students are one of the keys to widening participation, I stress that more than 9,000 disabled students are studying through the Open University&#151;more than 9,000&#151;including quite a number with a learning disability. The first course concerned with that subject was launched over 20 years ago. It was a co-operative effort between the Open University and Mencap, at a time when I was that organisation&#039;s chief executive. The work continues to this day, and is an initiative&#151;together with many others&#151;of which any university would be proud. I am at a loss to understand the Government&#039;s apparent reluctance to make appropriate financial provision.
</p>

<a name="40517-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>A consequence of not being in my place last Thursday is that I have had an insight into the Minister&#039;s reply. In referring to those amendments which seek to support the position of part-time and mature students, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, described them as either being unclear or adding to the burden of regulation. I agree. My amendment does add to the burden of regulation, but not the regulation of universities, rather the regulation of servants of the Crown&#151;in this case the director of fair access. If we are not here to regulate the actions of servants of the Crown, what are we here for? I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="40517-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Two sets of people will lose out under the current proposals. One group consists of the part-time students themselves. As I pointed out, there are, roughly speaking, 800,000 part-time students in this country, four-fifths of whom pay their own fees. There are some improved bursaries available but only to those on very low incomes. Many of the students who pay their own costs are faced with an increase in fees from &#163;570 to &#163;1,500, almost treble the amount they now have to pay. Many will be put off from studying part-time as a result of the increase in costs.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 566</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40517-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>The second group of losers consists of the universities themselves. They will not benefit in any way from government procedures to compensate for students. The Open University, in particular, will lose students. Ordinary universities with full-time students will receive their fees up-front from the Treasury; universities with part-timers will not receive equivalent amounts and will lose out.
</p>

<a name="40517-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rix, quoted from an article written by Chris Duke, a professor at the University of Leicester, about the impact of the Bill. He said that it mattered to learners and the wider community that part-timers should have a variegated range of access. Chris Duke said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;Many more might upskill to the knowledge society away from the low-skills, low-wage equilibrium economy if support, opportunity and goodwill made part-time study a normal part of a healthy, learning society&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>In the 21st century we must recognise that the way forward for our universities is to make part-time study as easy as full-time study. We will not do so with this Bill. It is an opportunity missed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="40517-18_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Seccombe: </b>   The amendments enable us, once again, to highlight the important work of institutions such as the Open University and Birkbeck College. I thank the Minister for the full reply that she gave to the Committee last week. I hope that this opportunity to discuss the issue again will enable her to provide more of the detail that she was reluctant to go into on the previous occasion. I also hope that it will enable Members of the Committee, having had time to mull over her answer, to probe the Minister further. The noble Baroness said that her door was open on these issues. What further meetings has she had, or has planned, in relation to part-time and mature students?

<a name="40517-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The Government have proposed a review of funding to address the imbalance between these two groups but this is unlikely to take effect before 2007 at the earliest. Can she assure the Committee that a review will indeed take place and that it will be implemented as soon as possible? What progress have the Government made on an alternative, first-aid solution, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, as an interim measure while awaiting the 2007 review?

<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="40517-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I thoroughly support the sentiment behind the amendment and the importance of ensuring that part-time undergraduates are taken as seriously, if I may put it that way, as full-time undergraduates.
</p>

<a name="40517-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Rix, can answer a query for me. Amendment No. 66 refers to part-time undergraduate European Union students but, as I apprehend it, the general duties of the Director of Fair Access apply only to home students under Clause 30 of the Bill. I wonder how, as a matter of practicality, the director can have regard to and survey the impact of part-time student provision across the Union.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_567"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 567</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="40517-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   I shall try to answer the noble Lord. The information I have received is that anti-discrimination legislation enables universities actively to discriminate against overseas students if they are so minded. In this sense, &quot;overseas&quot; does not have its natural meaning of &quot;Fog in the Channel, Continent cut off&quot;, but relates to outside the borders of the newly enlarged European Union.
</p>

<a name="40517-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>I gather that the Government&#039;s policy on fee regulations applies to all full-time European Union students. If fees for full-time students rise, fees for part-time students will follow. If the Bill should be passed, it will affect each and every European Union student but not overseas students. I therefore felt that the gauge of the Director of Fair Access should extend beyond the cliffs of Dover but stop at the boundaries of the newly enlarged European Union. I may well be corrected on this by the Minister.
</p>




<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="40517-19_spnew2"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </b>   There were a number of references to part-time students in the Second Reading debate and I am glad that the amendment has been brought forward. I hope, too, that the last point made by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, as a matter of clarification&#151;which I think was greeted with a little scepticism around the Committee, but not by me because I do not know the details&#151;will be brought further into the light of day by the Minister when she replies. It is a fine amendment and should find support, even among those virulent &quot;savers of the pound&quot; who are Eurosceptic.
</p>




<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="40517-19_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Lockwood: </b>   I spoke in the debate on Thursday and I therefore do not intend to speak at any length today. I support the principles embodied in the noble Lord&#039;s amendment. The intention of my Amendment No. 105, which is in this group, is to bring within the ambit of the Bill all part-time courses of at least one year&#039;s academic length and which do not exceed twice the amount of time needed to complete a full-time course. That would, of course, bring most part-time courses under its scope.
</p>

<a name="40517-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>In her response, the Minister put a good deal of pressure on the promise that there would be a review of the position of part-time students. If the review takes 12 months, clearly there will be no inclusion of part-timers in this Bill. I know that she was sympathetic to helping part-time students but, if the Government cannot accept amendments which seek to include part-time students within the Bill, will they consider making a statement which would guarantee some additional assistance to the Open University and Birkbeck College, both of which will be at a disadvantage when the top-up fee becomes operative for full-time students in 2006? It would help a great deal. If the Minister cannot do so today, perhaps she will have another look at the issue and come back with a positive statement of some help for these two institutions in particular.
</p>




<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="40517-19_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   Following up on that question, can the Minister confirm that the Bill would allow fee deferral for part-time students if that were decided at <br>&nbsp;<br>

a later stage? If so, one group of candidates that I hope will receive early consideration consists of those on 50 per cent part-time courses.

<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="40517-19_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   Have the Government considered the position of Open University students living in the European Union who study in the European Union and get degrees from the Open University? A student from France or Germany, who may have a brother or sister at a university in England, pays the same fees as English students, because that is the European arrangement. However, top-up fees will affect that situation. What will be the position of the brother or sister who lives in Germany or France, who is studying with the Open University there, and collects a degree at the Open University degree-giving in Paris?
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="40517-19_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I hope to be as positive as I can. I was not reluctant to enter into this debate on Thursday but conscious of the time and the number of noble Lords in the Chamber. Noble Lords will be relieved to hear that I do not intend to repeat everything that I said on Thursday. However, I can show noble Lords a booklet that has just been produced called <i>Financial Support for Part-time Students in Higher Education</i>. I have arranged for 50 copies to be placed in the Library of the House. Noble Lords may wish to look at it because it is a very good document about what is now available to part-time students. I remind noble Lords that, before 1997, there was no support for part-time students. We have moved to a system that has ended up with grants being available for part-time students, which is the right thing to do.
</p>

<a name="40517-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>I put all my remarks in the appropriate context for this discussion. As the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, indicated, if we decide that fee deferral should be available for part-time students, we could do that without the need for primary legislation. That is important in reassuring noble Lords that that facility exists. I also remind noble Lords about something that the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, said on Thursday. Part-time students are many and varied, which is a great joy. Noble Lords will recognise that many of those students are very different from each other. Some are sponsored by their employers and some are not. Some will not know whether they are sponsored by their employers. For example, my own department encourages individuals to take up part-time education. It does not pay their fees up front, so it would not be listed as doing so, but it reimburses them in other ways. That is exactly the dilemma that I said that we would be trying to resolve through the students&#039; income and expenditure survey, which, for the first time, will include all students, including Open University students.
</p>

<a name="40517-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>As I said to the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, when she came to talk to Alan Johnson and me, we are very keen to look at what we can do in that context when we have better information. We are not reluctant to consider supporting part-time students or we would not have introduced the support that we already have. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_569"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 569</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

We are keen to ensure that if we go further&#151;if we can&#151;it is in the right way. As with any government, that relies on good, positive information. Should fee deferrals be part of that, the Bill has the capacity to include them. I wanted to put that in an over-arching context. I do not accept the amendments because, in that context, I would not.
</p>

<a name="40517-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>To answer the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, I have not had the chance to have any further meetings since Thursday. However, we are in ongoing dialogue, especially with the Open University, which we recognise is important. I am keen to continue that dialogue with the Open University and with Birkbeck, and with all the other institutions that have an interest. We recognise that this is an important part of their work. I can confirm that a review will take place and will be implemented as the noble Baroness indicated. I know that the Open University has expressed its intent to make a case for special interim funding. I cannot make any commitment on that: it is a matter for HEFCE. However, I encourage HEFCE to listen carefully to what the Open University has to say.
<a name="time_16"></a>
<a name="40517-19_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40517-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rix, is right about European students. The fees paid by full-time European Union students will be capped at &#163;3,000, as is the case for British students. However, just as part-time British students are not within current or future regulation regimes, nor are part-time European Union students, so OFFA would not cover them, as the noble Lord indicated.
</p>

<a name="40517-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>I shall deal with the specific amendments, which I hope will enable us to make progress. Amendment No. 66 moved by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, specifically requires the analysis that is undertaken to include provision for part-time undergraduate European Union students. We think that it is important that the director&#039;s report covers surveys of access plans, the way in which institutions are improving outreach, the kind of bursaries available, how institutions&#039; ambitions are affecting the picture in higher education generally and so forth. Of course, the director will contribute to the commission&#039;s review, after three years, of the work undertaken. However, I hesitate to go further in being overly prescriptive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="40517-19_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   If I change the amendment on Report and drop the words &quot;European Union&quot;, would that be acceptable to the Government?
</p>




<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="40517-19_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The noble Lord is asking a Minister to work without a brief. Perhaps he will say that that is easy. Because the matter is important, I undertake to work with the noble Lord and look at the issues that he raised. It is my job to look specifically at the amendment tabled. Noble Lords will know that amendments often have technical defects. We are having a general debate.

</p>

<a name="40517-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>I understand what the noble Lord is saying, and I will talk to him further on this matter. I am concerned that we recognise that there is a big difference. Institutions such as the Open University are rightly concerned about the impact of our new policies. That is why the commission is so important and why part-time study should be included. It is also why we need to get much better information about part-time students and work with those institutions that support part-time students right across the education sector to ensure that we get it right.
</p>

<a name="40517-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>I genuinely believe that our positions are not very different. Quite rightly, those representing institutions with a large number of part-time students are concerned and want to push us to ensure that we have their interests at heart. I am keen that we have a meeting of minds on the matter, because we are not far apart. However, part-time students are not regulated and I am conscious of the director having a clear remit in full-time education and not confusing the issue. Rather, it is a job for the Government to look beyond that.

</p>

<a name="40517-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>As the noble Lord indicated, Amendment No. 77 would ensure that the guidance to the director does not discriminate between full and part-time courses. He will not be surprised to hear me say as an aside that the amendment as drafted does not have a clear legal effect. It is, as we often describe such amendments technically defective because it does not tie in with the sentence that it would amend. Having said that, I recognise the purpose of the amendment is to initiate discussion.
</p>

<a name="40517-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>As I have said several times, the director&#039;s role concerns the regulation of full-time undergraduate higher education courses and initial teacher training courses. As we have indicated several times in your Lordships&#039; House, we recognise the importance of making sure that potential students are not put off. Therefore, all of these measures as a package seek to support our universities and encourage the aspirations of students to come forward to our universities. Our access plans relate to full-time students because that is where we have introduced the new measure of variability. That is what the director is to regulate. That is important and understood. However, we recognise the valuable role of part-time study in higher education, and the promotion of lifelong learning is critical. There are many recipients of valuable part-time courses and Open University courses in particular, whom we all know. However, where we differ is that, because of the way in which the director is being set up, part-time students should not be a mandatory element of the director&#039;s remit. That is the <br>&nbsp;<br>

difference. Institutions can show the director their plans. They can look at the whole question of part-time provision if they wish. That is for the institutions to decide, not for us to dictate. That is the difference in what we wish to set up.

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>With the proviso that I am very happy to talk further&#151;and the understanding that within the Bill as it stands we could move to fee deferment if that were appropriate, as I have already indicated&#151;we recognise that the individual and collective institutions have issues with respect to part-time education. We are in discussion and will continue to be so. We absolutely accept that we need to get more information upon which to make decisions. But we are also very proud of the work that we have already done to support part-time students, and I refer again to my little booklet.
</p>

<a name="40517-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>On that basis we do not want to be too prescriptive with regard to the director. It is important that the director focuses on the work to be done on full-time undergraduate courses, as we have indicated. Mature students are included in that. I suspect that we look at the issue of part-time students differently, but I am very happy to continue the discussion on that.

<a name="40517-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>I am also very grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate and to those who took part in Thursday&#039;s debate. There has been a very good airing on part-time students and less airing on mature students, although we just had recognition of mature students from the Minister. I am grateful to all noble Lords&#151;I am sure we are grateful to each other&#151;for raising this matter. Part-time students number nearly a million people in this country. That is an awful lot of students and undergraduates.

</p>

<a name="40517-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>The first amendment relates to monitoring the effect of variable fees on all groups that are under-represented in higher education. One of those groups is disabled students, who are perhaps the most under-represented group in higher education. Many <br>&nbsp;<br>

institutions do not include specific outreach activities for disabled students in their widening participation strategies. It may be that, without further direction from HEFCE and OFFA, they will not do this in their plans for OFFA approval. Those representing the disability groups think that it is essential that the universities be required to include in their plans details of how they intend to increase the number of disabled students.
</p>

<a name="40517-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>Many of these disabled students have to study part- time because of their impairment. Paragraph 7 to Schedule 5 requires the Director of Fair Access to Higher Education to produce an annual report which the Secretary of State must lay before both Houses of Parliament. This amendment to the Bill would require the director to monitor the effect of variable fees on all under-represented groups and to include details of the monitoring in his annual report. This is a wholly reasonable amendment, given the under-representation of disabled students among the student body and the lack of detailed statistics both of needs and resources within the sector on this issue.
</p>

<a name="40517-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>Amendment No. 69 picks up the issue of the lack of information and seeks to make OFFA the authoritative source of data on&#151;and trends in&#151;potential student applications to higher education, and to do this by reference to specific under-represented groups. The process will help inform its own work and priorities and will also embed its value as a body in the eyes of the outside world.
</p>

<a name="40517-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>At present there is no single authoritative source of data on student access. We have talked about the lack of data on part-time students. The Higher Education Statistical Agency supplies some data, and the funding council provides other information. It makes absolute sense for OFFA to become the authoritative source of such information if it is to be seen as the access champion. This would allow OFFA to generate informed debate on the issue of access to higher education and help it to be seen as the champion of those who are aspiring to higher education. I beg to move.

<a name="40517-20_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Neill of Bengarve: </b>   I would like to see greater availability of statistical information and I share the view of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, about the unsatisfactory nature of HESA statistics in many respects.
</p>

<a name="40517-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>I am not sure that we can expect OFFA to do better. Some of the material that is mentioned in these amendments is information to which I think OFFA will not have access, and in particular&#151;looking back on earlier provisions in the Bill and the requirement that universities not be required to do more than they already do&#151;I do not see how the universities can provide information that they do not have. Universities do not have information about their applicants that would satisfy even the least exacting of statisticians.

their desire to keep certain things a private matter. Students may self declare under the bizarre categories that do duty for ethnic monitoring in this country, but they have a right not to. My experience is that, increasingly, they choose not to, very often because they are of mixed background.
</p>

<a name="40517-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>Admirable as it might be to know all these things, in the end we are likely to have reasonably clear information about age&#151;they give their dates of birth&#151;and they can usually manage gender, but we are not likely to obtain information about family income background, ethnicity and disability that would be worthy of statistical elaboration in the course of the admissions process.
</p>

<a name="40517-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>Some information on family income background has to be sought when it comes to supplying a bursary. However, in my experience universities that are at present doing this are riding piggyback upon local authority family income assessment. Of course, the basis of that assessment is to be changed in certain ways. It is notoriously unreliable information. It does not wholly fit with national income statistics. Many more are exempted from paying a tuition contribution than the national income statistics would suggest should be exempted. If we are to have more statistics let us have them, but only if they can be made good statistics. I do not believe that these categories of information are available to universities, or to UCAS, or to OFFA, or to HEFCE.

Perhaps it should be part of the remit of the department to try to collate this information as part of an ongoing monitoring of the situation. Even if the actual figures are not available, the trends are surely available, which would be helpful, if not detailed, information. The trends would show what progress was being made.

The problem is not that the information is a bit ropey or that the trends are not available. The problem is that the information is essentially personal and subject to data protection, and is not sought by universities or UCCA and is not available in any systematic way. We would have to do far more to discover trends.

</p>




<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="40517-21_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   This will be the first time that I have spoken in this Bill, so I beg the indulgence of all those who have taken such a core part. My noble friend&#039;s amendments, especially Amendment No. 69, relate to disability. It relates to the disclosure of, and encouragement to disclose, hidden disabilities such as impaired hearing and dyslexia. Those are the two biggest ones, which people may not even be aware of as a problem but may discover later on.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>Universities and everybody involved cannot give assistance unless they find out what is going on. I have had mainly informal contact with a number of people who have had hearing problems or mild dyslexia and have managed to get through the system. They often try to give information to universities too late, once they are in the process of having their degrees assessed or are coming up to exams. If we can encourage a process by which people examine those problems, there may be an initial increase of work for the universities but in the long term it will save them both time and money. There will be fewer appeals and many fewer pupils failing. According to the trend, things are getting better overall, but examining the problem at a central point has got to help.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>It cannot just be me who is discovering that such problems are occurring. For instance, the son of someone from whom I am renting a house is dyslexic and is struggling through a degree. His university did not know that it was perfectly normal practice to dictate exams. That is the sort of absurdity that emerges time and again. It may be that his university knew but that his tutors did not. If there is that degree of ignorance in that one field, I would suggest that gathering such information is essential. If we can get such a requirement for gathering information into the Bill&#151;and I believe that more legislation will do so in the future&#151;it would save time, effort and money in the long run.
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="40517-21_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   It is in the interests of the universities and the national system that we get better at producing this information. It is clearly not adequate at the moment, for all the reasons that we have heard, but this seems a sensible way in which to tackle the problem&#151;although early reports would have to have a very large health warning on them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="40517-21_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Seccombe: </b>   We recognise the principles behind the amendments, particularly from the RNIB and SKILL lobbies, and understand that information is required. We all want there to be an increase in the number of disabled students who reach the criteria in higher education, but I do not feel that it should be a duty placed in the Bill. The Secretary of State could require that information without a change of primary legislation.

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>We on these Benches are just as committed to equality for disabled students. In fact, we have argued throughout these discussions for equality for all students, so that they can be assessed and accepted on their skills, ability, aptitude and excellence. However, fairness, as highlighted by the Scwartz report, does not mean that the Government, directly or indirectly via OFFA, should be able to choose students. The autonomy of admissions should remain with the higher education institutions. I fear that such information may be used if, for example, there is not enough of one ethnic group at a particular university.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>We do not want the system of admissions to become such that students who meet the required criteria are not awarded a place because it has to be allocated to an individual in a group considered to be under-represented, regardless of whether they meet the skills and ability criteria. If such under-represented groups have the necessary qualities, access through the current &quot;widening access&quot; programme employed by universities should be used to attract them.

<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="40517-21_spnew6"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </b>   When this debate began, I wondered whether this amendment was yet another add-on under which the Bill might sag. However, I have reached the stage, particularly after hearing from the noble Lord, Lord Addington, of believing not only that the amendment is appropriate, apposite and right but that if it is not passed, we may be judged by a future generation that is yet more sensitive than us to the kind of people who would benefit from it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="40517-21_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   These amendments would create new requirements for the Director of Fair Access to monitor issues relating to particular groups and to report them to the Secretary of State. On all sides of the Chamber there has been a great deal of sympathy with the motivation behind the amendment, which is to protect the interests of groups which, for one reason or another, may be under-represented in higher education. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, for giving us the opportunity to discuss these matters, as they are sensitive and important.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>Amendment No. 68 would require the director to include in each annual report the results of monitoring the effects of variable fees on all groups under-represented in higher education during that year. It is of course important that we should consider closely the effects of the policy on under-represented groups. That case has been made powerfully on behalf of disabled students by SKILL and the Royal National Institute for the Blind, which are keen to ensure that we monitor our proposed measures for higher education to ensure that they have no detrimental effects on under-represented students.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>I agree completely with the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, about the difficulty in collecting a great deal of the information, whatever our good will or motivations. Personal information is often declared only by individuals and only when data protection applies. The consequence for HEFCE&#151;and it is likely to be true of OFFA as well&#151;has been gaps in data.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_576"></a>

</p>

<a name="40517-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>Interestingly, as I have observed over the years, the more individual organisations collect data, the greater the mismatch may be between the data that they collect. It is not as though an easy composite can be constructed out of data, like the bits of a jigsaw puzzle simply fitting together. However, over time, it is also true that data have improved. Even with part-timers, where there was not a complete gap but there was nothing very good, there have been serious improvements in the amount of information as sources have produced it.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>The one area in which it is extremely difficult to make great sense of all the data is in the construction of trends, which often depends on the data being particularly accurate at the beginning. I should tell my noble friends who raised the point that I suspect that the reason why some of our predictions about the numbers and kinds of students who might want to go into all sorts of post-school education have been way off the mark is because we have tried to construct trend-lines from data that were deficient at the start of the process. I draw the conclusion that we must try to do a lot better. It is not wholly impossible, but it is extremely difficult.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>Amendment No. 69 is very similar and would require the director to include within the annual report an analysis of applications to full and part-time higher education courses, with particular reference to family income, ethnicity, age, gender and disability. All sides of the Committee would agree that they are important issues. Of course it is right that we should monitor the effects on those groups. I wholly take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, about the kind of disabilities which are often not apparent until someone makes them so. That may be well into the course&#151;not at the point of applying or of admission&#151;and therefore particularly difficult in the context of this legislation. I think that that was the great burden of what the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, said.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>Let me assure the Committee that we will take, of course, a very close interest in the effects of reform. That is why we have said that we will commission an independent review to look at exactly those kinds of issues three years after the introduction of variable fees.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>The remit of the commission, published in a statement by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State on 27 January, includes looking at participation for particular groups. I have no doubt that disabled and ethnic minority students and students from low income backgrounds will be included in that.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>The commission will also look at students&#039; choices of institution, courses and modes of study and include the take-up of provision by full and part-time students. Given the responsibility for overview of access plans, the director will naturally have a significant contribution to make to this review.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>Other interested parties&#151;charities, lobby groups, academics and organisations such as HEFCE and Action on Access&#151;will be looking carefully at the effects of this policy, not to mention the whole of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

sector itself. It will be interested, to say the very least, and my guess about its reaction is that it will be very alert.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>As regards the director&#039;s annual report, we are reluctant to be over-prescriptive in legislation about what he should include. We fear that over a period of time we could construct a very long list and fall into a list mentality, which would not be particularly helpful for all the reasons I have given.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Other than the usual accounting requirements set out by the Treasury, I think that we should leave the detail of the report&#039;s content to the director. I think that that was the force of what the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, was saying in her contribution a few moments ago.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>Much information is already available from HESA (Higher Education Statistical Agency) on ethnic origin and disability, for example. I hope that we would not want to try and duplicate it because the effort is already being made. It is at least questionable whether the director needs to add to that with further data collection and analysis. Certainly, the director should receive that information. It is critical that the information is received, but not necessarily that further data and analysis are generated, other than the increase in the quality and volume of data that HESA seeks to achieve.
</p>

<a name="40517-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>Perhaps I may say that I encourage noble Lords to seek information from HESA for themselves. It is an important source of information, which is intended for the public domain. The better informed we are as we review these matters, the more likely we are to reach good judgment. I anticipate that HESA will wish to help in that. I do not think that I should elaborate further; the arguments have been well-rehearsed. There is no lack of concern anywhere in the Committee for the position of those students described in the debate. I think we should try and ensure that over time the institutions we have do their job better, rather than trying to replicate the job in other ways and probably sowing the seeds of some confusion. It is in that light that I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

I should like to ensure that Parliament knows what is going on in terms of the universities&#039; efforts to widen participation and to take note of reports, simply because there are so many myths around. There are myths at both extremes of the university system. Perhaps I may say that I have suffered from both in my own career. First, there are criticisms of Cambridge, Oxford and other elite universities being too posh to care about poor students and so on, and generally being distorted in their admissions. Secondly, there are myths about the post-1992 universities letting in any old Tom, Dick or Harry&#151;people who are too thick to go to university, who really should not be there in the first place and so on&#151;with no understanding of the enormous care in recruitment and selection which goes on at both ends of the system.

The director&#039;s annual report, as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said, will be laid before Parliament and probably through the Select Committee system. We will see scrutiny of those reports. The same applies to any special reports that the Secretary of State might invite the director to undertake. It is possible that Motions will be tabled and resolutions passed, and each and every Member of Parliament in either House will be able to express their views in debate.
</p>

<a name="40517-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>Therein lies the rub&#151;Parliament does not necessarily speak with one voice, and a Motion passed in your Lordships&#039; House may not pass in exactly the same form in another place. The report from a Select Committee may not be accepted by the whole House. Views, however well expressed, will not necessarily be the views of every Member of Parliament. I am advised there are serious difficulties in placing on the director a duty to take account of the views expressed by Parliament, given that there is no commonly accepted definition of those views. The considered will of Parliament is embodied in legislation, and a director will of course take account of that. We run the risk of placing the director in an impossible situation. I do understand the concern of the noble Baroness and other noble Lords, and I will reflect on whether there is any way that we can respond constructively.
</p>

<a name="40517-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>I apologise for the fact that I have not been able to clarify the situation earlier, but as I say, the formal, proper advice came today. It is an important principle, and I hope I have clarified that there are real difficulties but that I will look further. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="40517-22_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean </b>   moved Amendment No. 73:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>Page 14, line 9, after &quot;education&quot; insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_5"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   not require any governing body or higher education institution to discriminate against or to prefer any student or prospective student on the basis of the school or type of school at which they were educated; and&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_175"></a>The noble Lord said: I do not wish to detain the Committee very long over this amendment, although it is important. Indeed, in the interests of making progress, I might have been tempted not to move it, were it not for the fact that I read in a newspaper today a statement made by the Minister in another place in respect of a survey indicating that children from state schools were not achieving places at the so-called &quot;Ivy League&quot; universities. The survey, which I believe was commissioned by HEFCE according to the newspaper report, identified that a number of youngsters were not going to particular universities, not because they were being refused admission but because they were not making applications. The Minister in another place, as has already been referred to, said that the fact that these youngsters were not getting places at these institutions was why we needed OFFA.
</p>

<a name="40517-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>The amendment would state specifically in the Bill the fact that OFFA may not require universities to exercise any form of discrimination against or in favour of an applicant on the basis of choices made by their parents about their school. I believe it is necessary to have that in order to deal with the kind of mistaken impressions that are being created. I have a daughter who is at present making applications through UCAS to universities. As a result, I have quite a lot of contact with youngsters. She went to an independent school&#151;I went to a state school, so I can just about remember what that was like. Amongst her generation, many believe that they are being discriminated against by particular institutions in making their applications. I have no doubt that people will jump up and say it is not true, it is not happening, but in politics, perception is everything. I think it is particularly damaging if youngsters believe that no matter how hard they work, however much effort they make, at the end of the day, people are going to cross them off the list because they went to a particular school. That, to my mind, is as bad as discriminating against people because they went to an independent or a state school&#151;both are equally unacceptable. Children are innocent of the wealth of their parents, or of the schools they attend. It is essential that they should be looked at by universities on the basis of their aptitudes, skills, abilities and potential to make the best of a particular course. Everything I have seen about the way in which universities tackle this difficult matter seems to point to the area of concern lying not with the universities but with the schools.
</p>

<a name="40517-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, made the very succinct point that perhaps some of the stick should be placed in the direction of the schools. There is almost nothing in this Bill which points to the failure of the schools to prepare candidates. How can universities admit pupils who are applying for courses in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_581"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 581</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mathematics or physics if they have not actually reached the required skill levels to embark on the course in the first place? That is a problem of the schools. I noticed the Minister, who has been very helpful this afternoon, was nodding in agreement when I said that children should be treated solely on their merits. Therefore I am very hopeful that she will not have a problem with accepting some form of wording&#151;if not this amendment&#151;which will at least reassure the many people who believe they are to be discriminated against because their children went to independent schools.
</p>

<a name="40517-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>There is a certain injustice in what this Bill proposes. Parents who have means or who decide to give up particular items of expenditure in order to send their children to independent schools find that when their children apply to universities, they are to be discriminated against in terms of receiving places. In return for doing so, the universities are entitled to charge them fees for which they and their children get no support through maintenance grants. It does seem to be very unjust. I expect the Minister to say this is not what is going to happen and that this is not the position&#151;in which case I very much hope she can accept Amendment No. 73. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="40517-23_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Buscombe: </b>   I rise to support absolutely everything that my noble friend said. Noble Lords may remember that this is the point that I focused on at Second Reading. I was in the state sector but my three children are currently in the private sector. I too feel genuinely and deeply concerned that they will be penalised because they are in the private system. Indeed one of them is on a scholarship in the private system, so she wonders what the point is. We have got to do all we can to allay those fears, if indeed those fears are unfounded.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>I want briefly to refer to one of the reasons why I am really worried about this&#151;the Schwartz review. The consultation document states that apparently research has been carried out which shows that, all things being equal, children from the state system do better at university than those in the private system. I want to say loud and clear that I understand that that piece of research has been misused, and I am glad to report that representatives of the independent sector among others are now carrying out research to check whether that has any grounding whatever. I personally doubt that it has. Many pupils from the independent sector are better able and prepared to cope with the private system&#151;particularly some of the more &quot;difficult&quot; universities, if I dare call them that, such as Oxbridge&#151;than are those who are not used to living away from home and fending for themselves in lots of ways from a young age, as is the case with children, in the private sector, particularly those at boarding school.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>I agree with what my noble friend said about application to universities focusing on aptitude, skills and potential only. Does the Minister believe that universities need to know at all what schools pupils have attended? Universities UK is very keen to ensure <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_582"></a>

that OFFA should not have any involvement in admissions, but we need real reassurance from the Minister that any reference to a child or pupil&#039;s secondary education would be treated as an irrelevance.
<a name="time_19"></a>
<a name="40517-23_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40517-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>There is a problem. I know that it was a long time ago but, when I was in the state system, I did not have the confidence to apply for Oxbridge. I wish that I had, which is why I feel it so important that we widen participation. I applaud what the Government are doing in terms of seeking to widen participation and encourage universities to make people&#151;people such as me, as I was&#151;feel that they are up to applying; it is a sadness in my life that I felt so shy about applying to universities at all. However, admissions should be based on skills, aptitude, potential, interviews and, if needs must, what one might call secondary exams for application to university, like the old S-level. If any of my children apply to Cambridge, for example, and want to read medicine or law, they will have yet a further exam above their A-levels in order to apply. In the circumstances, given that so many pupils achieve a number of straight A grades, that may be a fair approach.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>I want to speak out on behalf of the many parents who make a number of compromises in other directions to put their children through the private system. I know many parents whose cars barely get them to the school, and who compromise holidays and all sorts of other enjoyments in life. There are also those lucky pupils from poorer backgrounds whose parents simply cannot afford private education, but who are bright enough and have the aptitude to get scholarships and bursaries. Will they be penalised too because they have been in the private system? I hope not.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>It disturbed me at Second Reading that even noble Lords referred to &quot;the rich students&quot;. I take huge exception to that. I feel that I speak for thousands of parents who feel strongly that their children are lucky to be in private education because they get, in the main, a really excellent education. However, parents will be quietly making compromises to ensure that their children get the best. In life, we can give our children only two things: a lot of love, and a good education. It is up to the schools to improve standards of secondary education, to ensure that all pupils get a good education.
</p>




<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="40517-23_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Neill of Bengarve: </b>   I have some sympathy with the aims of the amendment, although I perhaps take it on a rather broader front. Those of us who do admissions in very selective universities are accused from both directions of discriminating against cohorts of young people on the basis of the type of school to which they have been. We look at not merely their potential and achievement, but their enthusiasm for their subject and the opportunities that they have had. Nevertheless the job is an art, not a science, although it is very conscientiously done.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_583"></a>

</p>

<a name="40517-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>We have to reckon that there are, every year, many disappointments. Far too many young people get three, four or even five A grades&#151;we look at only the first three&#151;for all of them to get their first-choice university. There are disappointments, and it is very easy for a pupil, parent or school to feel that there has been discrimination. The point is not simple, because the effects on reputation are hard to avoid with even the most scrupulous procedure.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>I take the serious point about the amendment to be that we should not repeat the history of the United States in respect of college admissions by trying to institutionalise a representational form of access as opposed to fair process for everyone. I think back to the Bakke case at the University of California on admission to medical school. I hope that the Minister can assure us, as we would all support it, that the Bill&#039;s provisions have been read with an eye to whether anyone&#151;be they a disgruntled school, parent, a local authority or, in view of the points raised by the Opposition, the Headmasters&#039; Conference&#151;can claim that discrimination has taken place because availability of university places is hinged to factors other than those that legitimately have a role in admissions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_178"></a>
<a name="40517-23_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   Whatever the Government may say, there is no question but that a lot of young people who are or have been at schools in the private sector have the impression that they and their friends are discriminated against in their choice of university. I know a large number of such people&#151;some young relations, many of their friends, and many other people of my acquaintance.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>It is very important that the Government dispel that. It is absolutely wrong that those people should grow up with the impression that they have been discriminated against by the Government, which is what they think. It may often not be true&#151;we do not know&#151;but the impression is there. There seems no reason whatever why there should not be something in the Bill to make it plain that that cannot be. The provision should perhaps not be worded like the amendment, but there should be something in the Bill to reassure such people. It is very unfortunate for people who may well in future take a lead in society to grow up with that grudge.
</p>




<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="40517-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   We should be a little careful on the matter. I would like to think that there is no particular discrimination against those children from independent schools who choose to go to university. Once or twice today, we have mentioned the subject of the courses that are available in sixth forms and whether they reach the heights at which universities want to attract certain students. I think that the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, mentioned it in an earlier debate.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>We have to bear in mind the balance of resources between the independent schools and the state schools. I would be particularly concerned if the resources of the independent schools enabled far greater academic prowess than were really required to go to university, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_584"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 584</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and if that were to then discriminate in some way against the perfectly good students who come out of the state system. One would not want to discriminate against those from independent schools, but we do not want to build hurdles that the resources of state schools cannot get anywhere near getting their students over.
</p>




<p><a name="st_180"></a>
<a name="40517-23_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   It has been an interesting debate. I recognise the concern of Members of the Committee to ensure that the Director of Fair Access does not interfere in the admissions processes of institutions. We will be debating amendments on that shortly. It is absolutely clear that it is not the director&#039;s job to interfere. It is for institutions to select their students on the basis of academic merit, irrespective of their background or the type of school that they attended. It is very important that we recognise that.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>We have no designs on academic freedom, nor do we seek in any way to disadvantage students from independent schools. It is for institutions themselves to decide which students best fit the courses that they offer and who should be part of their community of scholars. I agree that it would be quite wrong for the director to dictate to institutions which students they should admit, no matter what the basis. It will not be the director&#039;s job to do that.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>It is worth saying that the quote with which the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, began, was a misquote in the <i>Times. </i>I want to repeat what was said at the beginning of the quote, and I shall make sure that I give the noble Lord a correct copy. Alan Johnson said in his opening statement:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;All the evidence suggests that admissions are generally fair and that is why it will be outside the remit of OFFA&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>I hope that that offers some clarification. There is a longer quote, which I shall ensure the noble Lord receives, but I want to place that matter on the record because it is important.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, may have gained an impression, which is widespread, which I understand, particularly from the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, who has personal experience of the matter. It is not the place of the legislation to deal with false impressions. It is about clarifying that admissions are entirely the responsibility of institutions.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, said that there was a difficulty because some universities are oversubscribed with good candidates. They make choices based on a range of factors that might include how far they think the students have travelled in terms of their ability, knowledge and so on and their confidence level&#151;which was an important factor as the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said, in her own background and certainly in mine&#151;and how much students have developed themselves in that process. On the one hand, as the noble Baroness said, that might be because they have experience of living away from home and are more mature; and on the other <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_585"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 585</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

hand, they did not have a school that provided them with that, but my goodness look how far they have come.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Universities weigh up all such factors when they consider their cohort of students. That is right and proper. We do not believe that they should discriminate and we do not believe that they do so in considering applications. We have always said that the issue is that the Director of Fair Access makes sure that we get students to apply who do not have that confidence factor and do not necessarily attend a school that promotes it and has never heard of the university.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>I have said several times today that it is not an either/or situation; it is not the schools or the universities, it is both/and. It is building on the enormous amount of work that universities do in outreach in waking up students to the idea that university could be for them. For a student who has never heard of a university or never thought of it, a day spent going round a science lab in a university could be one of the most exhilarating experiences of their lives. There are many instances, as noble Lords know, of individuals describing the moment that they made the decision that university could be for them. We want the Director of Fair Access to address all those factors in encouraging applications from students, but we do not want any form of discrimination.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, will not be surprised to hear me say that the impact of Amendment No. 73 goes wider. The only proviso in respect of what I have just said is that the director might want to suggest to a university that it might want to consider outreach to its local schools. There are a number of instances&#151;I talked about my own children earlier&#151;where it is important that universities in a locality have a relationship with local schools, particularly those where there is not a tradition of going to university.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>I do not think that any noble Lord would find that strange, but the amendment would effectively prevent that from happening. This is about the director and the institutions letting good common sense guide them. We have indicated in our guidance to the director on the bursary requirements that eligibility will be defined by financial need and not at all by the school.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>I hope I have reassured the Committee that this issue is about institutions being responsible for admissions. I hope that the words I have placed on the record&#151;if noble Lords, especially the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, will reflect on them&#151;make the Government&#039;s position crystal clear. I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, to that effect.
</p>

<a name="40517-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>I also recognise what the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, said; that while sometimes the pendulum swings between those attending state schools being unable to get in and those attending independent schools being unable to get in, on balance when students apply universities behave properly and applications reflect the issues for us in making sure we <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40517-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   In the far-off days in the mid-1950s when I was a college representative on the National Union of Students, NUS policy was to seek to abolish the then minimum maintenance grant. I took part in a plenary debate on the issue to move a contrary amendment, citing a cousin who was capable of going to university but would feel that she could not impose on her parents for the total expense if the minimum grant was abolished.
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>As the debate developed, representative after representative said that they had been mandated to vote for the motion, but citing the considerations I had raised they were going to change their vote, and I carried the amendment. Irony being the stuff of life, 40 years later I recommended to the late great Sir Keith Joseph that he should abolish half the minimum maintenance grant and then in the second year he should abolish the rest of it.

<a name="40517-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>My concern in support of my noble friend&#039;s amendment is for a young person like my cousin who might be put off striving to get to university for fear that they are being weighed out of the race. I am partially reassured by what the Minister has said in reply, but they are words that need uttering again and again. &quot;Trust the universities&quot; is as useful a slogan as &quot;trust the people&quot;.

The Minister is a member of a Government that have spent a lot of rhetoric creating the impression that universities are discriminating against pupils from state schools and from particular areas. I could almost sense the weariness in the helpful contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill, for the universities are between a rock and a hard place.

<a name="40517-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>Ministers are saying things and creating an impression that is perhaps exaggerated by the media, as the Minister indicated may have happened today in the case of the Minister for higher education in another place, but nonetheless it has an effect on the people who read it and the culture that operates.

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>If one is responsible for admissions at a university and there are far more candidates with three or four &quot;A&quot; grades than there are places, there will be great difficulty where the well has been poisoned with the view that it is not the enthusiasm, ability, expertise or potential that governs whether people are awarded places, and indeed that universities will be subject to financial penalties from a Government that believe that they are not doing enough in this area.
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I understand and welcome what the Minister had to say, but I feel that her colleagues have created an atmosphere in which people believe that there is discrimination. I am grateful for the contributions to the debate. My noble friend Lady Carnegy reinforced what I said about my experience: youngsters believe that they are being discriminated against. Many ask me why they have to put on their UCAS form the school they went to and why it should be a relevant consideration from the point of view of the university.

But that is not a problem for the universities; the resources and standards in our schools, which is where the focus of attention should be, are a problem for the Minister&#039;s colleagues in her department. However much one wants to give a place to a youngster with ability, it must be impossible to do so if he has not learnt the basics required to set forth on the first-year course, and it will be extremely difficult for him to move forward. Therefore, in so far as those problems exist, I believe that the emphasis should be on schools.
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>I did not understand the point that the Minister was making&#151;perhaps she could help me&#151;when she said that the amendment would prevent universities having outreach programmes at their local schools. My amendment states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;not require any governing body or higher education institution to discriminate against or to prefer any student or prospective student on the basis of the school or type of school at which they were educated&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>To my mind, that does not prevent a university having an outreach programme at schools in its area.
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>However, if that is all that troubles the Minister in respect of the wording, I should be very happy for her to amend it slightly in order to deal with that point. Given the words of support that she expressed&#151;very <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_588"></a>

welcome they were, too&#151;I still do not understand why she could not undertake to consider this wording and perhaps come back with a revised form.
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>I am most grateful to my noble friend Lady Buscombe, who rightly pointed out the huge sacrifices that people make to send their children to independent schools. Indeed, other people send their children to state schools and make huge sacrifices by buying houses in the appropriate catchment area. Therefore, it is not an entirely even-handed debate as between the state and independent sectors.

<a name="40517-24_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Perry of Southwark </b>   moved Amendment No. 74:

&quot;(   )   The Director shall not in the performance of his functions frame his advice by reference to particular courses of study or programmes of research (including the contents of such courses or programmes and the manner in which they are taught, supervised or assessed) or criteria for the selection and appointment of academic staff and for the admission of students.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_187"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 74 addresses the issue of academic freedom, and I am sorry that we are reaching it just at the point when noble Lords are disappearing for their supper, very understandably.
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>The issue of academic freedom was a key concern of almost all noble Lords who spoke at Second Reading, and rightly so because the principle of academic freedom is, for all of us, an absolute. In a free and open society, there is no way that universities should not have freedom of academic expression or freedom to criticise and be critics of government or of any aspect of society, and no one&#151;especially in the political sphere&#151;should have any control over them whatever. That, for me, and I believe for most noble Lords, is indeed an absolute.
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>The amendment uses the words of the 1992 Act in respect of the Secretary of State giving grants to the funding councils. Looking around the Chamber, I believe that perhaps only five or six of us were here in 1992 when the debate on that Act took place. I can assure Members of the Committee who were not here that it was a fierce and long-lasting debate. As I recall, it ran for more than seven hours. In response to a concerted attack from all sides of the House, the then government brought forward an amendment with wording identical to that in my amendment.
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>It is interesting to note that, at that time, the comments from all sides of the House addressed in particular the absurd possibility that one day some <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_589"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 589</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

future Secretary of State might wish to interfere with the criteria under which students are admitted or might wish to interfere with the processes of recruitment. In 1992&#151;only 12 years ago&#151;it seemed impossible that any encroachment on that freedom could ever be envisaged or be likely to happen. What a long way we have come since then.
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>It is important to say that there is every possibility that, if OFFA did its job properly, it could go a great deal further than simply consider applications. That point was made earlier by my noble friend Lord Lucas, who pointed out that the kind of courses that universities offer and the kind of decisions that they make about the overall pattern of their courses very much predetermine the kind of applications that they will receive. It can either encourage certain kinds of applications or discourage others.
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>Therefore, it seems to me that there is absolutely no way in which OFFA could not be tempted&#151;in some ways, properly tempted, given its remit&#151;to go far more comprehensively into, for example, setting targets for individual courses. Could we not show concern that, whereas certain courses are very appropriate for attracting applications from under-represented minorities, others are not, and therefore we must consider the other courses which are not doing so well?
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Could OFFA not also go into the manner in which courses are taught? Certainly, I know from personal experience how very hard some of the universities which have a very strong access commitment and which take a large number of students from under-represented groups alter the way in which they teach, particularly in the first two terms of a course, because they expect students to enter university with inadequate preparation from their schools. Therefore, of course the teaching must be different from that at universities which attract people from schools which have taught their students and prepared them well for university. Should not OFFA also concern itself with the way in which courses are taught?
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>Similarly, those of us who have worked very hard to      attract applications from under-represented minorities know very well that the profile of the staff in the university is very important. If all the staff are white, middle-class males, the university is conveying a certain kind of message about itself. Therefore, we worked very hard to ensure that our members of staff were representative of the wide diversity of students whom we wished to attract.
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>In other words, unless we can prevent it happening, it seems to me that those are all concerns which OFFA may find itself becoming involved in&#151;not only in relation to applications but in relation to the criteria for admissions, the way in which courses are taught, the content of the courses and the structure of the staff and so on. I believe that we would all agree that that is wrong. We do not wish any outside body, particularly not a non-departmental public body, to involve itself in matters of that nature. That is why my amendment is comprehensive and covers, as the 1992 Act did, the whole range; that is, courses of study, programmes of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_590"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 590</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

research, the contents of such courses, the manner in which they are taught, supervised or assessed, the criteria for the selection and appointment of academic staff and the admission of students.
</p>

<a name="40517-24_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>I conclude with two brief quotations from a speech made by the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone&#151;I am sorry that she is not in her place&#151;in the 1992 debate when she was the Opposition spokesman on higher education. She said, in a tone of surprise:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;It is not possible to anticipate or determine what some future Secretary of State . . . might do about, for example, the kind of students who should or should not be admitted, the kind of academic staff who should or should not be appointed, or about departments which the Secretary of State has taken against and wishes to close. Lists of exceptions cannot encompass every possibility. An interfering Secretary of State could always find ways of exploiting loopholes&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 20/1/92; col. 651.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-24_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>Again, she said at Third Reading that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;the selection of students and their admission are entirely, and must be, matters for individual academic institutions. No government . . . should be involved in such detail. We must trust responsible people to get on with the running of institutions, deciding whom they can teach and who can best benefit from the courses they run&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 3/2/92; col. 102.]</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="40517-24_para23"></a>

<a name="40517-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I support the amendment moved by my noble friend. Given my failure to persuade the Minister to accept Amendment No. 73 and given that I have consistently been robust about the briefing from Universities UK, on this occasion the briefing in respect of these amendments is helpful. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s reply.
</p>




<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="40517-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   I too support the amendment. I was here in 1992, but up in the gallery. However, when I was younger I did not have the stamina to listen to seven-hour debates. Perhaps that comes with maturity as one accepts a place in the House. I prefer this amendment to later versions because it picks out the content of academic freedom in this context: course content, programmes of research, appointment of staff and selection of students. I believe it is necessary to include all those.
</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="40517-25_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   Noble Lords will know that I have tabled my own amendments on this subject. They are the culmination of long months of discussion, including discussion with the Government. I certainly support the spirit of this amendment, but I look forward to moving my own shortly. I shall explain my amendments in more detail when we come to them, but I want to touch briefly on why I prefer them to that tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry.
</p>

<a name="40517-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>The word &quot;admissions&quot; is potentially ambiguous. We have had an enormous amount of discussion about this matter. I am clear that admissions standards, requirements, procedures, policies and decisions all need to be excluded from OFFA&#039;s remit. A wide interpretation of the word &quot;admissions&quot; would do that, but it could also exclude other matters that are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_591"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 591</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

properly the remit of OFFA, such as open days or outreach activities which the Minister has said are entirely appropriate to OFFA.
</p>

<a name="40517-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>However, a narrow definition of &quot;admissions&quot; might simply be admissions decisions. In that case this amendment would prevent OFFA from involving itself in admissions decisions, but not practices. So, for example, OFFA might be able to require institutions to end the practice of conducting interviews and fine it if it does not. I am not convinced that these amendments do what is necessary. I hope that when I put forward my amendments the Committee will consider that they take a clearer approach.
</p>

<a name="40517-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The amendment would also prevent the director of OFFA interfering and widening participation at the level of individual courses. Institutions may wish to refer to particular courses in their agreements, but OFFA should not be able to require them to do so. I believe that it is right that OFFA should consider widening participation generally but should not examine matters on a course-by-course basis. That would lead to an unacceptable level of micro-management by OFFA and could open the way to political pressure in certain areas.
</p>

<a name="40517-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>Many factors affect application to particular courses which are outside the control of institutions. I have tabled an amendment on this subject too. Although I support the thrust of the amendment and although its wording reflects the wording, as the noble Baroness has said, of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992&#151;it certainly appears to be sensible&#151;because of the problems of the word &quot;admissions&quot;, I believe that my amendments would more successfully fulfil the aims of the noble Baroness.
</p>




<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="40517-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   I have put my name to an amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick. Like her, I find myself in accord with the proposals made by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, but the point about the word &quot;admissions&quot; made by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, is valid. It has the advantage of being interpreted more widely than in Amendment No. 74. While I support the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, on what goes in, I am less confident about excluding the fact that the Secretary of State may give advice to the director.
</p>

<a name="40517-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>When I dealt with the curriculum for schools it was said that one may give sex education, but that one should hold back on the practice. On the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, which we discussed earlier, there was considerable support for widening the remit of the director to include advice, guidance and training. If I were the Secretary of State and the director was getting a little too enthusiastic, I would want to say, &quot;Cool it, mate&quot;. Providing that the direction was published, I would not want to say, &quot;It&#039;s wrong to provide something like that&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="40517-25_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   We support the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry. I listened with interest to what the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, had to say about the differences between the two and in particular about the issue of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_592"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 592</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&quot;admissions&quot;. On the face of it, I cannot see that there is that much difference. As it stands, I support what the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, said so eloquently in introducing the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_193"></a>
<a name="40517-25_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   I hesitate to speak because I have not been able to do so before. Therefore, I may say something that has been said many times. I hope I shall be forgiven. I speak as someone who was state educated and went to Oxford on scholarships, so I know what that is like&#151;it was wonderful. But later when I was head of an Oxford college, I became conscious of three points that this appointment should consider. First, not enough people from state schools went to Oxford because at that time many teachers regularly said to their children, &quot;Oxford is not for you; it is elitist; it is <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>&quot;, and so on. We tried to counter that. Our undergraduates used to go to comprehensive schools, as I did, to reassure the students, but it was an uphill struggle.
</p>

<a name="40517-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>I remember one extremely promising girl who, although she performed extremely badly, was taken by the chemistry tutors because she had had six teachers of chemistry in one year. They recognised that it was a time of great upset in the school, but they took her just the same. Another girl who had won a place very nearly did not come at all because her teachers told her that she was a class traitor. They said so to her friends and family.
</p>

<a name="40517-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>To some extent we must look at the need for this appointment to educate schools and to make the point that if Oxford takes only 100 medical students that is because of the size of its medical school and because it cannot expand. Equally, there are limitations in law. I do not believe that any of those points are made sufficiently clear to schools. We read about such matters in the newspapers, but schools need to be told. It must be explained that if a pupil is the 101st pupil, that is desperately bad luck but it is not prejudice. We need to consider the matter much more from the point of view, not of what the universities are doing, but of the situation that confronts people.
</p>

<a name="40517-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>Lastly, I can remember very well the effects of social engineering when we indulged in it from time to time. The weak undergraduates had to be propped up by the strong ones. One will never cure undergraduates of helping each other and trying to work to enable the weak ones to manage. That is social engineering which has a very bad effect.
</p>

<a name="40517-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>I wholeheartedly support the amendment, but I believe that the concept of the appointment should be considered. We need someone who knows the problems of all universities, who is close to them and who understands them. We need someone who will go to schools and say, &quot;These are the problems; every effort is being made to help you but that is how it is&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="40517-25_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Winston: </b>   The noble Baroness, Lady Park, makes an excellent point. Rather than considering the director as encroaching on academic freedom, perhaps <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_593"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 593</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

one should consider him as someone who may assist at the front end of admissions to universities. I hope that that is taken to heart.
</p>

<a name="40517-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>I wish to make a point wearing not so much my Imperial College hat as that of chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, which has striven hard to increase access. Thirty per cent of students at that university come from social classes C2, D or E. At Sheffield Hallam we believe that one of the things that should be written into the Bill is that OFFA is barred from having any influence over admissions. If OFFA is allowed to intervene in admissions decisions&#151;for example, by setting admissions targets for students from specified groups or social classes&#151;that would lead to the taking of many wrong decisions that could be damaging to students and universities.
</p>

<a name="40517-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>The current proposals suggest that financial sanctions imposed through OFFA would be against failure to deliver a widening participation strategy. It is unclear how performance against delivery of such a strategy would be measured. Logically, the only feasible means of measuring delivery in this area&#151;setting admissions targets and imposing sanctions against the delivery of specified admissions targets by class or social grouping&#151;would undermine the fundamental principle applied by higher education institutions that admissions must be based on ability to benefit and probability of success in the course. By encouraging institutions to focus on volume, that would increase the risk of failure.

<a name="40517-26_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Buscombe: </b>   I support all that the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, has said on her amendment. I hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, says on her later amendment&#151;I am sorry that the two are not grouped. I prefer the one tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, because it appears more all-encompassing and therefore more reassuring. At the same time, however, it will be worth while to listen to what the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, says on her amendment.

<a name="40517-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Wilson of Dinton: </b>   I, too, support the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry. I accept entirely the Minister&#039;s argument about the need to widen applications. Taking one university as an example, I have found extraordinary figures in the <i>Cambridge University Reporter</i> to show that of the last round of applications some 36 per cent came from London and the south east, 20 per cent from overseas and 1 per cent from the north-east. There is a clear geographical imbalance.
</p>

<a name="40517-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>There are many ways in which we face a challenge, as the noble Baroness quite rightly pointed out. The Bill as drafted is unbalanced. On the one hand, it proposes a great apparatus of law on universities&#039; access plans. On the other hand, on the very important issue of academic freedom, the law would say nothing if the Bill were passed as drafted. That shows an imbalance that needs to be corrected.
</p>

<a name="40517-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>We have heard arguments about this group of amendments and about ones that we shall consider later. I wish that we could agree both, but I can see that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_594"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 594</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that is not practicable. One way or another, it is important that the issue of academic freedom is addressed in the Bill to rebalance the picture. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s comments.

<a name="40517-26_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I very much support my noble friend&#039;s amendment. Clearly, if we are to have an access regulator with teeth, he must keep his teeth out of such an area.
</p>

<a name="40517-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>Presumably, one of the first things that the access regulator will do is talk to students who have not gone to university or to people in the north-east who, despite having good qualifications, have not applied to Cambridge, and find out what their problem is. If the reason given is, &quot;All the Cambridge courses are too fusty. Of course I do not want to go there; I want to go where there are modern courses&quot;, or if it is found that schools are not up to it, that the kids are not getting far enough and that Cambridge has no arrangements for accepting people who have done a one-year access course to bring them up to standard, will the access regulator simply close his book and say &quot;I cannot touch it&quot;? If he did, he would be entirely ineffective, because he would not be addressing the problems that exist. Alternatively, will he open such discussions and questions with the university and be given a raspberry?
</p>

<a name="40517-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>My difficulty with the model of the access regulator is that he is too powerful. He cannot discuss the real problems because they are the problems of the university. If the amendment were agreed he could not mess with the universities in this area; therefore, he could not deal with the real problems.

<a name="40517-26_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   I was present at that great debate all those years ago. I remember great blasts from my late friend Lord Beloff towards the government that he supported about their monstrous behaviour. I said afterwards to our Front Bench, &quot;For goodness&#039; sake, put in a phrase about academic freedom and that will shut everybody up&quot;. I cannot remember whether they did, but that seems to be happening with the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick. She has made one or two proposals that would of course be very desirable.
</p>

<a name="40517-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>However, my noble friend Lady Perry has carefully used words, lifted from other legislation, that specifically say what the regulator cannot do. That seems a much more effective approach than the golden syrup of providing that there must be academic freedom and the subject of student admissions must be avoided.
</p>

<a name="40517-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>My noble friend included the question of staff and explained why. Listening with a fairly fresh ear and without a mental picture of what goes on during the admissions process, I think it is very important that the universities decide who will be their staff, where they come from and whether they should be from an ethnic minority. That is their job. I wish to goodness that the Government would leave it to universities. I get more and more angry about OFFA.

</p>

<a name="40517-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>I have given assurances in your Lordships&#039; House&#151;I no longer know how many times&#151;that the director will not be responsible for admissions, so I shall turn the page to avoid repeating much of what I have already said. One of the things that I wish to say to Members of the Committee from universities is that current evidence suggests that admissions are generally fair. It is important that we restate that point. Attracting applications from under-represented groups is a problem.
</p>

<a name="40517-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wilson, referred to admissions to Cambridge from the north-east. In looking at those statistics, Cambridge University may decide that some of its outreach should be in the north-east. That would be a reasonable conclusion to draw, but it is for the university to consider such issues. There are always interesting dilemmas for some of our top universities, in particular, in looking at where their applications come from. It is hard to get representation from the north-east if students there simply do not apply.
</p>

<a name="40517-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>However much noble Lords have tried to shift OFFA on to schools, there is also an issue about the extent to which universities can be involved in that. As Members of the Committee know, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State&#039;s draft guidance says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;Institutions&#039; admissions policies and procedures will be outside your remit&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>Amendment No. 74 uses the wording of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. I understand her desire to reflect that in the Bill, but we must consider other issues, some of which have been raised by my noble friend. I repeat that I have not had the Universities UK briefing, therefore I am the one person in the Chamber who does not know what will be said.

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>It is part of the group of amendments proposed by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, which are about changing the function of the director to an advisory one. Therefore, the term that the noble Baroness uses is &quot;frame his advice&quot;. On its own, this amendment does not work. It does not adequately cover the director&#039;s functions. It would not prevent the director taking admissions into account in doing things other than providing advice&#151;for example, in agreeing plans&#151;which is not what the noble Baroness would wish to happen.
</p>

<a name="40517-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>Furthermore, the reference to particular courses of study creates some difficulty. Clause 31(1) requires universities to include in their plans the fees of each qualifying course, which means any course for which variable fees might be applied&#151;that is, full-time, undergraduate courses. Access plans are necessarily tied to the freedom to charge higher variable fees for full-time undergraduate courses. It would be wrong to sever that tie, which this amendment would do. As noble Lords have indicated&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, in particular&#151;it would remove the duty on the director to have regard to the Secretary of State&#039;s guidance, which, not surprisingly, the Government think is important. It is valuable to have that.
</p>

<a name="40517-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>I have reservations about the technicalities of the transference of the 1992 legislation to this legislation. It does not work. Had they been grouped, I would have gone on to say that we are mindful to accept Amendment No. 75, and as we return from dinner, I hope that we will have a useful debate in which I will be able to state how important it is that noble Lords have convinced me and my colleagues to put this right in the Bill.

<p><a name="st_204"></a>
<a name="40517-27_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Rendell of Babergh </b>   rose to ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government what is their view of the therapies available to help people to stop smoking.
</p>




<p><a name="st_205"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, everyone in the United Kingdom is aware by now that smokers should give up their habit. Smoking, restricting smoking, banning smoking and the effects that it has, both active and passive, on the health of the nation are in the news almost every day. Certainly, a week never goes by without the announcement of some new restriction on smoking&#151;or the disastrous result of it on our hearts, lungs and circulatory systems&#151;appearing in the media. Today, for instance, sees the presentation of the findings on passive smoking at a conference organised by the Royal College of Physicians. Great stress is placed on the need for smokers to give up and many therapies have been developed advising on how to do so. Smoking is said by some to be more controlling and enslaving than a heroin dependency.
</p>

<a name="40517-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>It is 27 years since I stopped smoking, but I still remember the horror and the very real anguish and longing I suffered after I gave up those 30 or so cigarettes a day that I had been smoking. I do not mean to go into case histories this evening, least of all my own. Apart from trying cigarettes stuffed with dried lettuce leaves, which would in any case have solved only part of the problem, I found no aid available. Now I see herbal cigarettes are back again as a suggested remedy to help people to conquer their craving. Do Her Majesty&#039;s Government realise how difficult it is to stop? When they advise people to stop smoking, there are entering a quality of life area, where by giving up his or her addiction the smoker may see the whole purpose, routine and programme of life change, a support one always relied on in times of stress or crisis banished, and a supreme pleasure snatched away.
</p>

<a name="40517-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>What is being done to ease the passage of addicts&#151;I see nothing wrong in using this word, I know that I was an addict&#151;from the dependency that has them in its grip to a final freedom from cigarettes? According to Cancer Research UK, simple interventions such as the advice of a doctor, nurse, pharmacist, dentist, or <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_598"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 598</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

other health professional, are powerful motivators to stop smoking, and encouragement is given to all health professionals to ask patients at least once a year about their smoking and offer advice about giving up.
</p>

<a name="40517-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>Apart from the herbal cigarettes that I have mentioned, there are systems called Smoke Rx and 7-Day Smokeaway, each of which provides a week&#039;s supply of natural supplements and aromatherapy. The promoters of the systems recommend focusing the mind on kicking the habit and the repetition of the mantra, &quot;Let&#039;s get healthy&quot;. Probably the oldest aids are those which come into the category of nicotine replacement therapy; nicotine gum and nicotine patches. The gum is chewed until the taste becomes peppery, and while it rests in the mouth the nicotine is absorbed through the cheek into the bloodstream. This process is to be repeated once the taste of the gum fades for 30 minutes. Ten or 12 pieces of gum a day for one to three months is recommended.
</p>

<a name="40517-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>Nicotine from a patch placed directly onto the skin is absorbed into the bloodstream throughout the day. The 16-hour patch is used during the day and thrown away at night, while the 24-hour patch is worn all the time and replaced during the day. It is said that United Kingdom smokers reach for that first-thing-in-the-morning cigarette earlier than everywhere else in Europe, and the manufacturers of the patch claim that this type is particularly suited to heavy smokers who crave a cigarette on first waking up in the morning. Experts believe that the need for an early cigarette could be one reason why two out of three attempts to quit the habit by smokers in this country fail within a week. Patches have been available on the NHS, I believe, for the past three years.

</p>

<a name="40517-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>The first kind of nicotine replacement therapy claimed to deal with both elements of smoking addiction&#151;the physical and the psychological&#151;is the inhaler, called the &quot;inhalator&quot;. A cartridge is inserted into a tube about the size of a small cigarette holder. Sucking on the end of the inhalator pulls nicotine vapour through the cartridge, which is then absorbed through the mouth and throat into the bloodstream. Each cartridge lasts about 20 minutes and between six and twelve a day may be used, each providing a low dose of nicotine over a long period. This system seems to satisfy the craving for a nicotine rush. The drug Bupropion, trade name Zyban, apparently helps take away cravings and helps with withdrawal. The inhalator cartridges cost about two-thirds of what cigarettes cost and can be bought over-the-counter from pharmacists and supermarkets, but both Zyban and nicotine replacement therapy are available on National Health Service prescription. According to Cancer Research UK, these medications approximately double a smoker&#039;s chances of stopping. Can my noble friend tell the House what side effects, if any, Zyban has?
</p>

<a name="40517-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>Breath carbon monoxide monitors have apparently been in use for 20 years. The help that they give seems to consist in giving the smoker visible proof of his damaging CO levels and are designed to be used during smoking cessation programmes. The NHS has a smoking helpline, as does Quitline. Many people anxious to give up, I might say most, hope to achieve their aim by a slower and therefore less painful process <br>&nbsp;<br>

than any cold turkey method, and prefer to attempt it by cutting down the number of cigarettes smoked. ASH&#151;Action on Smoking and Health&#151;warns that that is a pointless strategy for people concerned about their health. Apparently, the belief is that cutting down lulls would-be quitters into a false sense of security, with the result that they draw more deeply on the fewer cigarettes that they have allowed themselves. Dismissing that method, ASH says that it is just a different way of consuming the same drug. Similarly, smoking low-tar cigarettes simply leads to smokers inhaling eight times the amount of nicotine and tar than is stated on the packet.
</p>

<a name="40517-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>So we come to hypno- and psychotherapy. What results are achieved by self-hypnosis, for instance, I cannot say. I have no experience of that method, but I hope that other noble Lords speaking in the debate will be able to give more information on it, particularly on the effects and the success rate. The same goes for experience of the inhalator, patch and gum therapies.
</p>

<a name="40517-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>An organisation called Goldmoor offers a self-hypnosis programme called &quot;Mind power&quot; that claims to handle various kinds of stress. The Allen Carr is more convincing&#151;to me, at any rate&#151;with its boast of having 40 clinics in 18 countries and having treated 20,000 smokers in the past year. One is told that a trained therapist conducts a group of up to 20 people, and the session lasts for four to five hours. Smokers are encouraged to smoke as much as they like during sessions. At the end, they smoke a final cigarette and then, rather dramatically, I suppose, throw their lighters and remaining cigarettes into a pile at the front of the room. The therapist focuses on the reasons why we smoke, rather than why we should not. A combination of psychotherapy and hypnotherapy is used, with the aim of removing the smokers&#039; belief that the habit provides them with any sort of genuine pleasure or crutch. Feelings of sacrifice and deprivation that may ensue from giving up are, in theory, removed, and the ex-smokers suffer neither fear nor pain from their loss.
</p>

<a name="40517-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>On what seems to me a far lighter note, the British Heart Foundation, which runs an enthusiastic and dedicated anti-smoking campaign, has converted the popular Internet tetris game into an anti-smoking therapy. Apparently, when playing the game for the three minutes that it would usually take to smoke a cigarette, the player sees how many fatty deposits he or she can stop clogging up a section of artery. The idea is that the game distracts the player from his or her desire to smoke. I am afraid that my experience teaches me that the slight stress and challenge of the game would be more likely to lead one to reach for a cigarette.
</p>

<a name="40517-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>Finally, there is the option of just giving up cold. It is hard. &quot;Will-power&quot; is an expression almost totally gone from our usage. It needs to be revived. We have become accustomed to expecting help with everything and doing little on our own. I can say only that I have never talked to anyone who, having given up, regrets it, or to anyone who feels no improvement in his or her <br>&nbsp;<br>

health from having done so. Meanwhile, the world awaits a harmless potion that in a single dose and at one magic swoop will take away the craving to smoke.
</p>

<a name="40517-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>Which therapy does my noble friend favour? Do Her Majesty&#039;s Government prefer a particular method as the safest, least likely to carry serious, troublesome side effects and the most efficacious?

<a name="40517-28_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Gale: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Rendell of Babergh for bringing this important subject before us tonight.
</p>

<a name="40517-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>Every day, 450 children in Britain start smoking cigarettes. One in three girls aged 15 smokes, and most smokers start in their school years. Nineteen per cent of 11 year-olds in England have tried smoking. Children and young teenagers get addicted to nicotine, and the addiction can be as great as that of adults. If they decide to give up, where do they turn?
</p>

<a name="40517-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>There are many good school-based programmes. Most are based on educating children about the danger to health and ensuring that children do not smoke at school. All that is very good in making children aware of the problem, but for children who smoke regularly there does not seem to be as much help and support given as there is for adults. One good organisation, called Quit offers advice to adults and to children and young people. It is one of the best that I have seen. It gives help and support to young people, such as a telephone helpline, counselling by working in groups during lunch hours at school and speaking in the same language as young people.
</p>

<a name="40517-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>Recently, I read an article in the press that revealed that research showed that children as young as eight were smoking six cigarettes a day. Dr Nick Lupini, a GP in Llanelli, says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;I have seen children of eight who smoke half a dozen cigarettes a day. When you have children as young as eight smoking cigarettes something needs to be done&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>He goes on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;The prescription of nicotine patches would only happen as a last resort in these cases, and we would try other methods first. The real problem is children getting hold of cigarettes, not nicotine patches&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>I had the opportunity of speaking to Dr Lupini last week. He told me that, although children may smoke at a young age, they were,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;rarely heavily addicted and they only occasionally smoked. A bigger problem was teenage girls who smoke&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>Nicotine replacement products can be prescribed to children by GPs to tackle the problem of cigarette addiction, although some doctors have questioned the practice, as they believe that it might pull children further into the grips of addiction. From what I gather, there appears to have been no research into the effects on children and young people of the use of nicotine replacement therapies. There is a need for more research into the most effective way of helping and supporting young people and to see how effective therapies are for this age group. One report that I read recently said that research in the field was in its infancy.

<a name="column_601"></a>

</p>

<a name="40517-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>A piece of research on young people, which was commissioned by ASH and carried out in July 2000, illustrated how difficult the problem was. The research, carried out by KSA Associates, showed that cigarette smoking retained a strong appeal among young people and that social pressures to smoke were strong. For many young smokers, the thrill of flouting the rules by buying cigarettes under age and smoking them at school seems to be part of the appeal of cigarettes. The research also showed that young people who wished to smoke had little difficulty in obtaining cigarettes. They know which shops will sell cigarettes to under-16s. Many young smokers rely on older friends to buy cigarettes for them, or they buy cigarettes at school, obviously from their school friends.


</p>

<a name="40517-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>Underage smoking is a huge problem and there are difficulties in giving effective help and support to children and young people who would like to give up. I welcome the initiative by the Welsh Assembly on smoking cessation programmes for young people. Between 2001 and 2003 eight pilot adolescent smoking cessation projects were held in Wales. Because of the success of those projects, the National Assembly for Wales has won funding worth &#163;221,000 from Europe to co-ordinate a Europe-wide adolescent smoking cessation programme. As a result, an initial conference is being held in Cardiff today and tomorrow. Representatives from 14 European countries will be attending and the aim is to support projects in eight countries, including Wales. This is a great initiative and should provide much-needed information.
</p>

<a name="40517-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>I am sure that the Government are doing all they can, but unless we can persuade children and young people that smoking is not a good idea, how will we be able to reduce the number of adults who smoke?

<a name="40517-28_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   My Lords, I too am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell of Babergh, for raising this topic. We are not here to debate whether people should give up smoking, or indeed whether they should ever start, but whether there are measures that are effective.
</p>

<a name="40517-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>I would suggest that it does not really matter what method someone uses to quit, providing of course that it is safe. There seems to be one single factor that determines the outcome, and that is the motivation to quit. People have to want to quit. They need to realise that they have a problem and to want to change their behaviour. It is at that point that pressures from society come in so strongly. In the clinical scenario, the unique opportunity of a clinical consultation may provide the teachable moment in which a person confronts the reality of their situation, but that depends on having some evidence of damage or potential damage to show them.
</p>

<a name="40517-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>Much work has been done on behaviour change based on the &quot;trans-theoretical model&quot;. It recognises the brick wall of trying to persuade someone who does not see the need to change to make the change, and the importance of maintaining change when it occurs.

</p>

<a name="40517-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>Smokers can be thought of in groups covering certain stages. The first is the pre-contemplation stage, covering the kids who think it is cool to smoke. Those young people are not going to stop. They may then move into contemplation, thinking that perhaps it is not so cool when they cannot run as well as they could, or that they are coughing because of the cigarettes. The next step is key, that of preparation and beginning to think about stopping. That is followed by the action to stop, where the different therapies and support come in. Lastly comes the difficult stage of maintenance.
</p>

<a name="40517-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>Motivation to stop smoking can be assessed accurately with three simple questions: do people want to stop smoking for good; are they interested in making a serious attempt to stop in the near future; and are they interested in receiving help with the quit attempt? Once the decision to quit is made, it seems that nicotine replacement therapy helps, in particular for those who had a high nicotine intake through their cigarettes. It also helps to identify heavily dependent smokers.
</p>

<a name="40517-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>Student teaching in both medical schools and nursing undergraduate curricula is woefully inadequate, but the curricula are full and I suggest that it is probably at the postgraduate stage that the skills to help people stop smoking should be learnt. Pack cover messages probably do not have any effect; they just raise general awareness so that with hindsight people are aware of the risks they have been taking for a long time.
</p>

<a name="40517-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>In the USA, studies have suggested that youngsters who smoke have higher levels of feelings of stress and depression, so smoking in young people in itself may be a pointer to mental illness in teenagers. So how do we discourage youngsters from ever starting on the road to nicotine addiction? A group of 14 year-olds from Caen in northern France and their teacher have come together to put on a forum of theatre vignettes in schools to get groups of parents and children to think about not smoking. They play a scene of kids smoking outside school in the morning, followed by a scene of two of them at home that night. The audience is invited to volunteer to take over the role of any character and act out what they think should be done, and the scene evolves. Interestingly, it is the youngsters, not their parents, who call for firm discipline and a zero tolerance culture. While the parents feel unable to confront their children, the children themselves seem to be pleading for strict rules so that they know where the boundaries are.
</p>

<a name="40517-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>But the youngster in love seems to be able readily to quit if their loved one insists on it. That is a pretty powerful tool in getting people to stop smoking. Being in love is a therapeutic measure.
</p>

<a name="40517-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>Passive smoking is known to damage health. I shall not go through all the background, but the figures from New York show that if there is a culture of not smoking, it makes quitting easier. Around 100,000 New Yorkers have now stopped smoking, and it is estimated that 300,000 smokers in the UK would stop completely if smoking was banned in public places.

<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>We have to ask why so many nurses smoke. I would suggest that there is a sub-culture at work. But things can change. At my medical school, of the six porters, five were smokers two years ago. Since then I have given each quitter a box of House of Lords chocolates when they have given up for three months. The non-smokers also get House of Lords chocolates to encourage them to stay off. I suggest that our gift shop is just as good as nicotine patches, but it is becoming a bit expensive for me as I am rolling the programme out to the canteen and the staff at Cardiff Central station.
</p>

<a name="40517-28_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>Unfortunately the record of the tobacco industry is not good. The &quot;Latin Project&quot; is a sad tale of undue and undisclosed influence on the part of the tobacco industry. Therefore please can we have a ban on smoking in public places? It should be viewed as a therapeutic measure. Wales wants to do it. This is not about politics or power struggles. Banning smoking in public places is a preventive therapeutic measure.

<a name="40517-29_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hayman: </b>   My Lords, I join the general approval for and gratitude to my noble friend Lady Rendell for introducing this debate. She has rightly focused on looking at what works in terms of smoking cessation, rather than the damage that smoking does. However, as chairman of Cancer Research UK&#151;an interest of which I remind the House&#151;I believe that it is important that we focus on the truly horrific fact that smoking is responsible for a third of all cancer deaths in the United Kingdom each year, equating to 46,000 deaths in 2002, and that lung cancer kills one person every 15 minutes in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>Lung cancer is an extremely difficult cancer to treat in the majority of cases. It is also an extremely easy cancer to prevent in the majority of&#151;if not all&#151;cases, by preventing people ever taking up smoking in the first place, and cessation of smoking for those that do.

<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="40517-29_spnew1"></a><b> Earl Russell: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness, but I do not think she needs to persuade smokers that smoking is dangerous. Most of us who have been or are smokers know it. What she needs to do is to persuade smokers that life without smoking can be safe. That is a lot harder.
</p>




<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="40517-29_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hayman: </b>   My Lords, the noble Earl is absolutely right. My dear father used to say that it was easy to give up smoking: that he had done it hundreds of times. He died, not of lung cancer, but of bladder cancer&#151;a cancer that is related, as are many other cancers, to smoking. I believe as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said, that knowledge about smoking, as well as knowledge of the dangers of smoking, are tremendously important.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>I know that the noble Earl is sometimes gloomy about the ability to persuade people to give up smoking successfully, but there are now 12 million people in this country who are ex-smokers and who have been convinced that life without smoking is worth while. That is a very important and encouraging <br>&nbsp;<br>

fact. But I take the point that we need to know what is effective in this area. We need to have proper research that gives us the evidence on which to base strategies.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>That is why I support not only the work that is founded on looking at the biologies of cancer or at developing new therapeutic targets in order to treat cancer, but also the very important behavioural research that seeks to understand the motivation for taking up smoking in the first place and looks at effective strategies for changing that.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>There is very interesting research going on in Oxford, where Dr Robert Walton is investigating the molecular basis of nicotine addiction and how a person&#039;s genetic make-up influences whether they become a smoker and how easy they find it to give it up. That is the sort of research that will help to inform the counter-preventive strategies of the future and lead to more tailored and therefore more effective smoking-cessation aids. I am afraid falling in love is not a cure for everybody, nor an option that is open to everybody.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>It is tremendously important not only that we conduct long-term trials on smoking cessation, but also that we are willing to share that evidence with the developing world. If there is one thing that is enormously sad when looking at countries in the developing world as they get richer, it is that more and more people smoke. They are then building up epidemics for the future and will have to go through the same learning curve that we have gone through in public health. That would be an absolute tragedy. We know the dangers, we are beginning to know some of the strategies that are effective in countering smoking, and we ought to be sharing that knowledge internationally.

<a name="40517-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Acton: </b>   My Lords, unlike my noble friend Lady Rendell of Babergh, who I congratulate on this Question, I will give my case history. I have given up drinking, smoking, gambling, swearing, pudding and coffee. Smoking was infinitely the hardest.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>I started smoking at my colonial Rhodesian school when I was 12. The big boys smoked and the tough boys smoked. I was puny, and smoked hoping that I would be thought big and tough. Nearly all of us 10 Acton children smoked. The advertisements told us that smoking was grown-up. The economy depended on tobacco. We smoked box after box of 50 Matinee cigarettes. In a joking voice, cigarettes were sometimes called &quot;coffin nails&quot;. We ignored that voice and our farmhouse was a blue haze.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>Thus prepared for life, I departed for university in England. Down the years, cigarettes were my constant companions.

<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>In 1988, following the advice of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, I fell in love and, aged 46, I married an Iowan. The social climate of that American mid-west state was fiercely anti-smoking. My wife banished me to the basement to smoke. At a dinner, I soon learnt that you could not smoke in other people&#039;s houses. I asked to smoke in the living room and then the <br>&nbsp;<br>

television room and received a firm &quot;No&quot;. Taken to see the car, I asked to smoke in the garage, and again got a &quot;No&quot;. &quot;I suppose the car will get cancer&quot;, I muttered furiously, and went out into the snow to smoke.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>Gradually things changed. Everyone I met seemed to have given up smoking, even the most hard-boiled of mystery writers who seemed a natural smoker if ever there was one. Cigarette packets had a warning from the Surgeon-General that &quot;Smoking can damage your health&quot;. I began to wonder if possibly he did not have a point, and then would hastily smoke two cigarettes to rub out the thought.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>A doctor, originally from Glasgow, told me that he had given up smoking in the 1960s because of the proven link with lung cancer. There was a smoking room at that Iowa city party. &quot;Look at that ashtray&quot;, he invited. I looked&#151;really looked&#151;at that ashtray overflowing with cigarette stubs. &quot;What filth are you putting into your lungs?&quot;, he asked. I could not get that ashtray&#039;s image out of my mind. Finally, I went to an editor friend and poured out my thoughts. She summarised them. &quot;You love your wife; you&#039;re very happy. Do you really want to kill yourself with cigarettes so as to be naughty?&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>On 2 January 1991 I had lunch with my doctor friend. I told him that I doubted if I could stop smoking. He uttered the immortal words, &quot;If you really want to give up smoking, you can do it&quot;. He recommended nicotine chewing gum, Nicorettes. After lunch I threw away my box of cigarettes and never smoked again.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>But it was tough, very tough. The craving was constant. The Nicorettes were a blessed relief, but how I pined for the real thing. I ate far too much; my concentration waned; my temper deteriorated. On the other hand, my wife glowed with happiness and friends congratulated me. Somehow I got through that first year. Whenever I nearly gave in I would cling on to those words, &quot;If you really want to give up smoking you can do it&quot;, and I would resist temptation.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>After a year, with difficulty, I gave up my Nicorettes and switched to chewing gum. I believe that I have compulsively chewed more gum in your Lordships&#039; Library than anyone else in history. Then my dentist forbade chewing gum as a peril to my teeth.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>Fourteen years have gone by and I never think or dream of smoking. My experience shows, first, that a social climate hostile to smoking helps; secondly, that the support and encouragement of family and friends helps; thirdly, that the image of an overflowing ashtray with the slogan &quot;What filth are you putting into your lungs?&quot; helps; fourthly, that health warnings help; and, fifthly, that analysing the underlying reason you smoke helps. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, I believe that doubting that one can succeed is the greatest barrier to giving up smoking. So, sixthly, the words &quot;If you really want to give up smoking you can do it&quot; should be engraved in gold and stressed to every smoker who comes to the National Health Service for help.

<p><a name="st_212"></a>
<a name="40517-29_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Massey of Darwen: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Rendell for instigating the debate and for her masterly summary. Smoking is the subject of endless speculation. As someone once said, it is now proved beyond doubt that smoking is one of the leading causes of statistics.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>If smoking is so harmful, why do people do it? Like the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, my question to the Minister is: what evidence is there for what helps people to stop smoking? I am not convinced that therapies are the whole answer. In my family we have an expert on giving up smoking; he has probably tried everything. I have several friends who have attempted to give up; many with success, some not. One used to use patches; take the patch off to have a cigarette and then replace it. Giving up is highly individual and nearly always difficult despite incentives. People seem to think that they could give up if they wanted. A cabaret song went something like this:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;My teeth are all yellow and so is my tongue, I breathe through a kipper, they call it a lung, but I&#039;ll give up the habit, I will even yet, when I&#039;ve had just one more cigarette&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>I know that a significant incident in life can precipitate stopping smoking. Long before I knew that I was pregnant with our first child, I gave up smoking, alcohol, tea and coffee. Clearly, my body was telling me something. Many women and men give up when they have young children. People give up after health scares, but some resume. Smoking is partly a public health issue and partly a personal issue, linked sometimes to therapies. Smoking is about addiction and risk taking. Many young people experiment and take risks such as smoking, drinking or drug taking, and stop the behaviour as they mature. Some do not. Some become addicts and addiction is difficult to break, as we have heard this evening.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>I will briefly discuss hard-drug taking and drug treatment. I declare an interest as chair of the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse. We know that drug treatment works and that treating people for drug misuse saves a lot of money to all systems, including health and criminal justice. Treatment has to be readily available and suited to individuals, taking into account their lifestyles and mental states. Treatment can be a long process. I have heard users say that stopping is not the problem. Staying off drugs is the difficult bit. Therapies do work to help people stop using drugs, and so does the support of family, friends and communities, which was reflected in the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Acton.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>There are parallels between drug use and smoking, but there are also differences. Smoking is a common social drug. I am sure that anti-smoking therapies can work, but they work better if they are supported by family and friends, once a person recognises that they need help. I said earlier that smoking is partly a public health issue. Public health is influenced by economics, social climate, campaigns, the media, education, advocacy and the law, as well as public services. In other words, health is not simply an individual issue.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_607"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 607</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40517-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>In considering smoking cessation, I would like to say a word or two about social climate, campaigns, education advocacy and the law. I suspect that they may influence giving up smoking as much as therapy. Education and preventive measures designed to put people off starting unhealthy habits have had uncertain success rates and are difficult to evaluate. Making smoking unacceptable is beginning to happen. I can remember when cigarette advertisements implied wellbeing, toughness and sex, depending on whether or not you were on a horse. More and more people are insisting on not having to be near smokers. Health campaigns have become tougher. Helplines are frequently given alongside the deterrent to stop.
</p>

<a name="40517-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>Last week a report from New York stated that a huge increase in cigarette tax and a ban on smoking in bars had cut the number of adults smokers by 100,000. New York City experienced the biggest decline anywhere in one year. Those who did not stop cut down by 13 per cent. A professor of health care put this down to a threefold attack&#151;raising taxes, making it harder to smoke indoors and promoting cessation. Therefore, public health messages, legal imperatives and social climate seem to be powerful means of influencing health behaviour. If we can add suitable therapies, this holistic and multi-faceted strategy is the one most likely to succeed.

<a name="40517-30_spmin0"></a><b>The Countess of Mar:</b>  My Lords, if noble Lords do not mind, I should like to speak in the gap. I was notorious in this House for smoking 40 cigarettes a day, presumably reeking like a kipper and all the things that go with cigarette smoking. I wanted to give up. I had terrible problems with pleurisy, pneumonia and various other complaints. However, what I needed was something to spur me into giving up. Someone asked me to look into chemicals in perfumes&#151;noble Lords will know that I am concerned about chemicals. I saw an article about aromatics in tobacco. I looked at the website and found five pages about extremely toxic chemicals.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>Indelibly printed on my mind is the time of 10.15 on 15 March&#151; the ides of March&#151;2000. I have not had a cigarette since. What I did was to use nicotine patches&#151;and nicotine lozenges for the periods when the patches did not meet the bill. I went through a programme with nicotine patches and kept on with the lozenges for about 10 months or longer. Then, like the noble Lord, Lord Acton, I reverted to nicotine chewing gum and he and I have probably kept Wrigley going ever since.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>The spur was the support of a noble Lord who wrote the date down in his diary. He was&#151;and still is&#151;an inveterate smoker and he did not believe that I would give up.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>Another spur was a very nice Labour Whip who promised me a glass of champagne after the first year and a glass of champagne after the second year. Then she realised that it was getting a little expensive so we have had no more champagne.

<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>The third spur is the amount of money that I have saved. My bank balance is fit and flourishing and I am now able to give money to charity that I would not have been able to do before. I no longer smell like a kipper, I am fit and healthy and I am delighted to promote anything that would stop smoking.

<a name="40517-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>The noble Countess may have been one of the greatest smokers in your Lordships&#039; House, but my noble friend could challenge her on that score.

<a name="40517-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>I stand here as the good boy in class, the one who did not smoke because he thought it was tough&#151;probably because he was more scared of what his mother would do to him if she found out.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>The serious point that comes across is the fact that there are two legalised and traditionally approved-of drugs in our society&#151;alcohol and tobacco. But any use of tobacco damages people. Nicotine-dependent dried leaf damages people in all circumstances. It is probably the most addictive&#151;and most easily addictive&#151;of all the drugs that we consume, one that we have ingrained in our society and which we will have to push out by inches.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>The story of the noble Lord, Lord Acton, shows that if a person is in the right social environment it can be very easy to try to quit. I say &quot;try&quot;, I do not go through the process. If people are in a society where regular smoking is not encouraged, they do not do it so often and they are less likely to start.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>I would like to go back a few years, when many more people smoked. The cigarette was a wonderful marketing tradition. It was one of the great marketing coups when people stopped smoking pipes and starting smoking cigarettes, because they are so much more social. How many chat up lines started with the offer of a cigarette? A couple of friends and I discussed how quick people had to be with a lighter to break in to a conversation with a girl. All these things were there and have been removed, largely by making sure cigarettes are, first, more expensive and, secondly, not consumed in public. That is one of the greatest things we have done. The Government must do everything that they reasonably can do&#151;and, of course, enforce&#151;and we have to apply social pressure.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>The second and most important part of this debate is tackling those groups where smoking is deeply ingrained. They tend to be the lower-income groups that can least afford it, where both parents smoke, the children smoke and the house has a thick blue fog around it.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>In a short debate like this I am fortunately not going to have to go through information with which I am not as familiar as I should be. But a Government who have introduced a Minister for Public Health have got to take very seriously that commission. They must support those who are going to guide and give <br>&nbsp;<br>

counselling to those who are smokers. They have to inject money into communities whose members have traditionally gone to doctors only as a last resort.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>These are people who do not read the diet fad books or take herbal remedies. These are the people who are going to be the most difficult ones to touch. This is probably a set of sociological clich&#233;s by today&#039;s standards. They are people who did not have long-term objectives, who thought of &quot;now&quot; as what they have. They do not have the tradition of going long term and worrying about their health. These are the people that we have to get hold of. It is so much easier for what used to be called the middle class to do this. In the environment in which they find themselves, the disapproval and the knowledge is there.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>If we decide that we are going to ban smoking in bars and restaurants in this country, we will have taken the first step towards improving that the social environment. However, it will not help those who are already smoking if they simply stand outside and consume cigarettes at a frantic gulping-it-down rate outside those buildings. It does not really help those consume cigarettes outside offices.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>We must get the support services in place and active. They must be activated through health workers, since if health workers point people in the right direction, they will take the advice&#151;or at least they stand a better chance of taking it. We must do that sort of work and become involved with those parts of the community where smoking is most deeply engrained.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>Can the Minister give us some direction about the programme and what guaranteed funding it has in the medium term? That is one of the problems, because preventive health therapy is not engrained in National Health Service culture. What is happening here? This is a programme with which the Government must be asked to take action. I hope that if they do so, we shall not have to address this subject again in at least the medium-term future.

<a name="40517-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McColl of Dulwich: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, for introducing this debate. Only a cynic would believe the story of a patient who asked his doctor, &quot;Will I live longer if I stop smoking and drinking?&quot; and was told, &quot;No, you won&#039;t live longer but it will seem longer&quot;. Of course, he was wrong. Sir Richard Peto has estimated that smoking will cause 450 million deaths world-wide in the next 50 years. Of that number, 180 million of these could be saved if there was a 50 per cent reduction in smoking.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>There is a ray of hope, in that 70 per cent of smokers would like to give up. How can they best be helped to escape from this lethal and anti-social habit? The reason why it is so difficult to give up smoking is because the nicotine in the smoke is so strongly addictive. When the victim does stop completely, he can experience craving and withdrawal symptoms, which are so real. It is important to emphasise that it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_610"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 610</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is not the nicotine that is the major cause of smoking-related disease, although nicotine can have a direct effect on arteries. It is the 50-odd cancer-producing chemicals that are so lethal. Therefore it is rational to give nicotine to satisfy people&#039;s craving when they are making a serious effort to stop.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>The National Institute for Clinical Excellence&#151;NICE&#151;recommends nicotine replacement therapy or the drug called Zyban. These will double the smoker&#039;s chances of giving up, but they are for smokers who seriously wish to stop smoking as part of an abstinent-contingent treatment&#151;ACT. The smoker undertakes to stop smoking on a particular date, known as the target stop date. It is important that there is advice on how to succeed and an initial prescription that will last until two weeks after the target stop date. Second prescriptions should be given only to those who have demonstrated that they are making a serious attempt. If the attempt is unsuccessful, no further attempts are funded within six months, as a rule.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>It does not seem to matter by which route the nicotine is given, whether it is by patches, lozenges, inhalers or chewing gum, so it seems reasonable that the choice is left to the individual. Zyban works by suppressing the region of the brain that gives the smoker a nicotine buzz when smoking a cigarette. It is therefore taken before the person starts to quit smoking, and is intended to put people off smoking by stopping them getting the hit from the nicotine. It also reduces the usual withdrawal symptoms of anxiety, sweating, and irritability.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, asked about the side effects. Some users reported nausea, headaches, dry mouth and blurred vision, which are not too serious. The drug is not recommended for pregnant women, those who are breast feeding, epileptics, or those with liver diseases or eating disorders. Early trials have found it to be highly effective, especially when combined with an overall giving up strategy.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>The fact that many nicotine replacement therapy products are available over the counter from pharmacies is clearly an improvement on the situation a few years ago when they could only be obtained by prescription. Has the Minister considered making them even more readily available from newsagents and other such outlets where cigarettes are so readily accessible? Diet and exercise should be recognised as having an important role.
</p>

<a name="40517-30_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>The NHS smoking cessation service is now available across the country giving behavioural support to those who really want to stop smoking, providing one-to-one counselling or group sessions, depending on personal preferences. I understand that 500 new staff have been recruited for this work. Can the Minister tell us how many centres are actually working throughout England? Will she give us an assurance that the &#163;138 million allocated for this service for the period 2003-06 will be spent on those services? As the money has not been ring fenced, how will the Minister ensure that PCTs do in fact spend it on smoking cessation?

<a name="40517-31_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, like all noble Lords who have spoken in the debate, I am extremely grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, for enabling us to have such a thoughtful debate. She took us on a fascinating journey around the various therapies, via dry lettuce leaves. Clearly, love is more effective than dried lettuce leaves. We have heard about the therapeutic qualities of chocolate and even the role of the Whip, which is something I suppose we should all think about.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>In recent months we have had many debates in the House on smoking but this was an opportunity to address and to take a look at new issues. I am very grateful to noble Lords who have shared with us their often heroic struggles to give up smoking. In such instances, one personal experience is worth a million words, when we understand just how hard and difficult it was to meet that challenge.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>There is no doubt that just as public concern about smoking is increasing, we have reached a crucial point in our strategy to tackle smoking. I should like to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Addington, in that respect. In 1998 we published the White Paper, <i>Smoking Kills</i>. That was a landmark in public policy. The action that followed has established the UK as a world leader in the field with our smoking cessation services.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>We have reached another turning point as we embark on an exercise in public policy involving people in a unique way in the questions in the consultation document and, indeed, in giving such prominence to smoking in this context. The noble Lord asked whether we are serious about the issue. We are. We called our document <i>Choosing Health. </i>That is exactly what we mean. It indicates that every one of us bears a responsibility for our own health. The document asks specific questions about smoking:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;What else can the Government do to ensure that people don&#039;t start smoking and if they do to support them to stop?&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>and:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;Who else in society should be involved in helping people not to start smoking and supporting those who start, to stop?&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>They are pertinent questions.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>I hope very much that this debate will be read by those compiling the responses to the public debate, because such a lot of very important information has been given tonight. I want to refer particularly to the excellent contribution of my noble friend Lady Gale in that respect. She raised the important issue of children who are sometimes outside the formal therapeutic structure but who in fact are so vulnerable. The figures in relation to children and young people are not as good as we would want them to be in terms of the response. So, our smoking cessation policies have long emphasised personal responsibilities.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>My noble friend Lady Rendell asked me what therapies work; how we know what works; what we provide; and why we provide it. Indeed, these are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_612"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 612</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

important and timely questions. As the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, said, when we are talking about smoking, we are liable to think about and to deal with a lot of statistics&#151;of which the most important is that there are 120,000 deaths per year from smoking. Of those deaths, the highest proportion occur in manual socio-economic groups. I think that the most important and encouraging statistic is that 70 per cent of smokers say that they want to quit. As the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said, they have to want to quit. That is what we have to work on when we devise our motivational strategies. Our job as a Government is to make sure that they have the right help at the right time in the right way.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>The challenge lies, as many noble Lords have said, in the nature of addiction to nicotine. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, gave a very cogent account of the nature of that addiction. The Royal College of Physicians has described it as comparable to addiction in relation to hard drugs. Indeed the withdrawal symptoms are extreme, I understand, with the impact they have on people&#039;s inability to give up.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>We understand about the degrees of dependency. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, talked about the Oxford research which is looking at why some people are more dependent&#151;whether they are more susceptible or whether it is genetic. I hope we will see more research like that because the knowledge that this might provide will give us somewhere to go in terms of our future therapies. The noble Baroness made an extremely important point about the developing countries and what we can see in terms of the global figures, which the noble Lord, Lord McColl, used himself.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>If our smoking policies are to be effective, we have to recognise the strength of the image of smoking, the strength of the addiction, and the power of ritual in helping people to break the cycle of dependency. That is exactly what we are trying to do as a Government&#151;to come at it in both ways, to address the psychological and the physical dependency. We are the first Government to set up smoking cessation services as part of the NHS and by 2006 we will have spent &#163;200 million. I can say to the noble Lord, Lord McColl, that the money is not ring-fenced because so much of the work to do with smoking cessation is to do with the other services that we offer throughout the NHS. I have no doubt that PCTs, knowing as they do of the cost-effectiveness of those services, will ensure that that money gets through.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>We know that our smoking cessation services are successful because they are based on the knowledge of what works. That is the answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell. They are based on motivational support and effective therapies. The motivational support comes through the trained motivators who are in the centres&#151;I am afraid I cannot give an answer to the number of centres. We recognise the quality of training that personal supporters have, a point referred to by many noble Lords. That help combined with the pharmaceutical therapies themselves on a systematic and regular basis&#151;the four to six-week strategies, and then the therapies that kick in and last nine to 12 <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_613"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 613</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

weeks&#151;is what is accounting for the success. Certainly, our two preferred therapies are based on the evidence of what works. That is a nicotine-replacement therapy&#151;noble Lords have paid tribute to the effectiveness of that, whether it is in patches or whatever&#151;and in Bupropion (Zyban). There is compelling evidence to show that those who use the smoking aids roughly double their chances of quitting. The fact that we have made it available over the counter is making the NRT more accessible, giving more choice, and making it easier to access without going through prescription. I do not know about newsagents&#151;I think it is something I could take back to the department with some enthusiasm.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>Importantly, we are finding that NRT is a popular choice. About three-quarters of smokers choose that, and about half of those succeed in quitting. With regard to Zyban, the noble Baroness asked me about side effects. That question has been partially answered by the noble Lord, Lord McColl. It is a very effective therapy, but it is available only on NHS prescription. It is a relatively new product and it acts on the part of the brain which governs cravings. There are known and documented side effects. Some are not serious, such as insomnia and dizziness, but there is a very small chance&#151;one in 1,000&#151;of seizures and other side effects that are well known. Doctors would certainly screen their patients for those side effects.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>Since Zyban was first marketed, it has been closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and our own committee on safety. A number of steps have been taken to highlight Zyban&#039;s profile and maximise its safe use. We have put out strengthened warnings as a result of that monitoring. We have issued new dosage guidance, advising a slower increase. All that has been done by the Committee on Safety of Medicines. There has been a noticeable fall in the reporting rate of suspected ADRs since the titration was changed.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>Zyban has also been the subject of a referral to the European equivalent of the CSM, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products. It importantly advised that the balance of risks and benefits as an aid to smoking cessation remains favourable. That is consistent with the most recent advice provided by the CSM, and we obviously continue to keep Zyban very closely monitored by the medicines regulatory agency. The recommendations of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in 2002 were that both NRT and Zyban should be used as first-line treatments. It reminded us that they are among the most cost-effective of all treatments.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>We have that combination of therapies because we know that it works. When that is combined with counselling, we can increase the likelihood of quitting almost fourfold. In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Gale, some of those quitters are young people. Because we have based our responses on what we know works, we do not provide hypnotherapy or acupuncture on the NHS although we are not hostile or indifferent to them. There is good evidence to show that they can work effectively as complementary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_614"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 614</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

methods, and can contribute to the package of care. We say that anything that the doctor thinks would work should be tried, provided that the patient is willing to try it.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>Several noble Lords, including the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, drew attention to the fact that the therapeutic strategies take place in a context where education assumes a much more important role. There are much bolder and bigger messages on cigarette packets, and much more intelligence going into schools and the places where young people gather. When we come to our public policy statement on public health, we will ask questions of the very wide public audience about whether the Government should pass a law to make all enclosed workplaces and public places smoke-free. What about restaurants? What about pubs and bars? We look forward to some of those answers, because that will take the public debate a very long way forward.
</p>

<a name="40517-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>Of all that we have heard this evening, I highlight the noble Lord, Lord Acton, simply saying that the most effective advice was, &quot;If you really want to give up smoking, you can do so&quot;. I would like to leave the debate with that, as it was a particularly inspiring message. I am very grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in such a wide-ranging and thoughtful debate.

<p><a name="st_217"></a>
<a name="40517-32_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe </b>   moved Amendment No. 75:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>Page 14, line 10, after &quot;regard&quot; insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_7"></a><br>
&quot;(i)   to the need to protect academic freedom, including, in particular, the freedom of institutions to determine the criteria for the admission of students and to apply those criteria in particular cases, and


(ii)&quot;    </p>



<p><a name="st_218"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment, I shall be brief. I supported the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, because we have the same aim. The matter is clearly important to the whole Committee, and I do not really need to explain my reasons for moving the amendment. I am grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and that the Minister has indicated that she is minded to accept the amendments.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>If the Government are clear that OFFA is not to interfere in admissions, they need to make it explicit in the Bill. This is necessary because of the inevitable scope for confusion that arises when OFFA is, in the words of the draft guidance,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;to expect the most, in terms of outreach and financial support, from institutions whose record suggests that they have farthest to go in securing a broadly based intake of students&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>Several noble Lords have made that point.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_615"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 615</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40517-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>Briefly, it might be helpful to explain what I have sought to do with the amendments. First, I have been asked why I have sought to exclude only the criteria for the admission of students and their application rather than frame my amendment with reference to admissions generally.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>As I mentioned earlier, the problem I see with the word &quot;admissions&quot; is that it is capable of both a wide and a narrow definition. A wide definition might say that everything that leads a particular student to enrol on a particular course comes under the heading &quot;admissions&quot;. That would then include everything from the factors at play when a student first forms the idea that they might like to go to university to the point at which they sign their name for a specific course at a specific university.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>Such a wide definition might include such things I have already mentioned as summer schools and outreach work. I do not think that would be right. A more narrow definition might include only the actual admissions decisions and exclude the requirements for admission and the procedures employed. That might leave the way open for OFFA to claim that although the admissions decisions are none of its business the fact that the university conducts interviews, for example, is indeed its business. That would not be right either.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>I want to ensure that we exclude admissions standards, requirements, procedures, policies and decisions from the remit of OFFA, so I have sought wording that is clear and unequivocal. That is why, having sought prolonged legal advice, I chose to seek to protect an institution&#039;s right,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;to determine the criteria for the admission of students and to apply those criteria in particular cases&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>I sought to do that by making it part of the director of OFFA&#039;s remit that he must have regard to the need to protect the rights of institutions and their academic freedom.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>Amendment No. 90 goes further and makes it clear that OFFA may not require a plan to include provisions relating to the admission of students. I accept that this is a belt-and-braces approach, but I hope that precisely because of that it will find favour with your Lordships and with the Government. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_219"></a>
<a name="40517-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   I am glad to sponsor the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_220"></a>
<a name="40517-32_spnew2"></a><b> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </b>   I did not expect the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, to be quite so fast after dinner. I have one or two comments that I nearly made on the previous amendment but decided in the cause of getting to dinner that it would be better to do so now.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>I welcome the amendment because the issue of division between access and admissions concerned us all at Second Reading. There are two issues. First, I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate and give us a reassurance as to how watertight on admissions the amendment is. It refers to having regard to the need. One can define that in any way; it is the need and not the requirement on admissions. How <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_616"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 616</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

strong is that provision, and how likely is it to be disputed? The reference to &quot;particular cases&quot; may be a normal legal phrase, but does it mean that they will be only certain cases or can it apply to every case of admission? I would like reassurances on the legal firmness of the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>Secondly, paragraph (b)(i) would read to &quot;have regard to&quot; and so on, which is the same phraseology that would be used in paragraph (b)(ii) which would read,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;have regard to . . . any guidance given to him by the Secretary of State&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>I seem to recall&#151;perhaps I was wrong&#151;that the director does not have to follow every guidance that the Secretary of State gives. The Secretary of State gives guidance that the director has to take into account, but he does not necessarily have to follow it. Does that mean that the director does not necessarily have to follow the need to protect universities in relation to admissions either? I am a little confused and unclear on this matter, and I am concerned that it does not wholly protect universities on admissions. I should be grateful for the Minister&#039;s response.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>My second point is rather more important. The amendment refers to academic freedom and uses the words &quot;in particular&quot; in relation to admissions. But that is academic freedom in general. Academic freedom is certainly being undermined by the role and responsibilities that the Director of Fair Access has&#151;in particular, given that he can use sanctions and penalties. Therefore, he will be able to use sanctions and penalties against universities if, in his view, their access plans do not come up to scratch. That, to me, seems considerably to undermine academic freedom and yet the amendment refers to the importance of paying regard to academic freedom. Therefore, why select this particular area as not giving freedom to the universities?
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>More importantly, I find it very difficult to understand how exactly the distinction will be drawn between access and admissions, and I should be grateful for the Minister&#039;s further guidance. It seems to me to be a very thin dividing line. If, for example, the director comes to the conclusion that some of the admission criteria which a university has and is free to apply in terms of the amendment undermine the access plans, will he then be able to challenge those access plans?
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>The key issue is one of admissions. In a sense, the access plans are important but they are not the crux of the matter; the crux of the matter is admissions. I hope that I am making myself clear. What I mean is: is it not possible that a director who is under a great deal of pressure and who wants to establish a big reputation will be able to look at the admissions and conclude that the access plans are not being properly carried out? If that is the case, he will be able to apply the sanctions and penalties of the access plans. Therefore, I find it quite difficult to see how, in practice, that very thin dividing line can be maintained.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>That leads me to two conclusions. One is the extreme importance of an amendment which we shall debate later&#151;that relating to the right of appeal. But <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_617"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 617</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

if there are issues here that will affect universities, it is important that those matters do not rest entirely on the discretion of the director, who can then apply the penalties and the sanctions. Therefore, I think that that amendment will be crucial in clarifying some of the very difficult issues to be resolved.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>Secondly, I am led to the conclusion that it is then difficult to justify OFFA and the director in the first place because academic freedom is undermined. That is why I continue to be very concerned about this whole aspect of the Bill.
<a name="time_33"></a>
<a name="40517-32_time1"></a><h5></h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_221"></a>
<a name="40517-32_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I had hoped that this would be a rather happy debate. However, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, for raising his concerns on this issue. The noble Lord, my noble friend Lady Warwick and the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, have put their arguments very succinctly this evening. As noble Lords will be aware, there has been a huge amount of debate and discussion around this issue. I hope that, in accepting the amendments, we have made clear that we have understood the critical importance that this matter has in your Lordships&#039; House and beyond in terms of the universities.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>I can say to the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, that, as I understand it, it is a watertight case. The effect of the amendment&#151;that is, removing admissions from the director&#039;s remit and preventing the Secretary of State making any regulations under Clause 31(2)&#151;would require a plan to include provisions on the criteria for admissions for students.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>In talking to the universities, in particular, we have been very clear that this is about inputs and not outputs. We shall be looking at the work that universities do in drawing up their access plans and the kind of work that they will do in respect of bursaries and outreach programmes. We recognise that some of the work that they do may have no impact on what happens in an individual institution, but it might have a broader impact on a group of universities as the university sector works with students. Therefore, for example, it is possible that if a university such as Cambridge&#151;if I may quote the noble Lord, Lord Wilson&#151;were to carry out outreach work in the north-east, that might have an impact on the number of applications to the University of Newcastle. That is why we are very clear that the director should recognise that this is about inputs and not outputs. That is a critical part of the freedom. We are very clear that it is for universities to determine their own admissions. That is a fundamental part of the agreement between us.
</p>

<a name="40517-32_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>These amendments put on the face of the Bill the reassurances that noble Lords have sought. I pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, and to the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, who have pushed very hard on this matter; I would not want them to feel that they <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_618"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 618</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have not played an important role in this matter. These two amendments work in terms of the Bill, and on that basis I accept the amendment.

<a name="40517-33_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I thank the Minister for listening to the representations. I know that she will have further discussions to consider the wording, but at the risk of appearing slightly churlish, I am concerned about two aspects in addition to the points made by my noble friend Lord MacGregor. First, the Minister&#039;s preferred amendment from the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, does not contain the definition of &quot;academic freedom&quot; which is contained in the previous amendment in the name of my noble friend Lady Perry.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>Secondly, the ability of the Secretary of State to provide guidance to the director was removed by the previous set of amendments. That has been mentioned at various times throughout the afternoon. It has been suggested that if the Secretary of State is to retain the right to give guidance to the director of OFFA, it should at least be made public so that the direction given to OFFA is transparent. I believe that point was made earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. While not detracting from the positive response that we have had from the Minister, I want to ask her, while reflecting on the matter, to bear those matters in mind before she returns to this at a later stage of the Bill.

<p><a name="st_225"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of the amendment is to add to the duties of the director of OFFA in Clause 30 a duty to consult relevant stakeholders on the overall higher education access policies as monitored by OFFA. That would better inform its ability to ensure best practice in universities&#039; access plans. OFFA is set to become the lead body in terms of spreading best practice in widening access and monitoring universities&#039; attempts to achieve that.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>The genesis of the amendment was discussions that the AUT had with the other unions on the Higher Education Bill. The original idea was to set up an OFFA board which would oversee its work. Board membership would have included representatives, for example, from the TUC, the CRE and the Equal <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_619"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 619</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Opportunities Commission. However, partly because of the cost of such a board, and partly because of the inevitable bureaucracy involved, that idea was dropped in favour of a duty to consult. That would allow those organisations with an interest in seeing broader access to have an input into OFFA. The duty to consult need not necessarily be a burden on OFFA and that is certainly not the intention behind the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>Such a duty would help to strengthen OFFA and over time ensure that it is seen as credible and effective. Without a duty to consult it would be entirely possible for OFFA to talk to nobody apart from the higher education institutions. That could only be damaging over the long term to the cause of widening access, which, we all agree, is important. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_226"></a>
<a name="40517-33_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   In speaking to Amendment No. 78A, I wish to place on record my gratitude to the Minister for making available in draft the guidance that the Secretary of State intends to issue to the director of OFFA when the Bill receives Royal Assent.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>I, together with representatives of Universities UK, have had the opportunity to discuss the draft guidance with the Minister and her officials, for which I am very grateful. As the Minister will be aware, there are a number of points in the guidance with which I am not entirely content. For example, the phrase:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;I would expect that OFFA would expect the most . . . from institutions whose record suggests they have furthest to go&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>is unhelpful, given the sensitivities about admissions.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>However, I appreciate that in that wording the Secretary of State is trying to do something that I requested: to ensure that OFFA recognises the excellent track record of many institutions. Indeed, I would like him to go further on that point. I want to see the guidance changed to make it more explicit that OFFA is intended to act in a light-touch, non-bureaucratic way. I know that the Minister does not intend OFFA to micro-manage institutions&#039; widening participation strategies, and that could be a little clearer in the guidance.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>That illustrates the reasons for the amendment. It is said that many heads are better than one. I think, quite simply, that consultation produces better legislation. Incidentally, the guidance ought to make clear that the director of OFFA should consult regularly with key stakeholders in developing his or her <i>modus operandi</i>. I hope that the Minister will agree.
</p>




<p><a name="st_227"></a>
<a name="40517-33_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   We strongly agree that consultation is absolutely vital. I am very surprised not to find it in the Bill already. However, I question the scope of the duties that the two amendments would impose.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>Amendment No. 78 argues that OFFA must consult those,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;who have an interest in ensuring fair access to higher education&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40517-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>Does that include every student&#039;s parent, for example, who will want to guarantee that his or her child has a fair and just system of entry into higher education? Who is to decide what is fair: the Secretary of State, the director or someone else? I do not know.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>Amendment No. 78A states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;the Secretary of State or the Assembly must consult bodies appearing to him or it&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="40517-33_para12"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;to be representative of institutions likely to be affected by guidance&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>If the guidance under this clause is, as I think is intended, to dictate to the director how he should carry out his duties in relation to widening access, should businesses be consulted? I made that point recently in connection with a health matter. Should businesses be consulted, given that this year&#039;s students are next year&#039;s workforce? That may be particularly significant if the director ends up, for example, with a role in vocational training, which I have talked about before in these debates.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>There are no set periods within which the consultation must happen. More importantly, neither amendment provides that the results of such consultation must be taken into account or adhered to by the Secretary of State or the Assembly before the guidelines are implemented or before the director takes steps to ensure fair access. It is normal for a consultation requirement to appear in such Bills. I hope that the Minister will give us some comfort in that regard.
</p>




<p><a name="st_228"></a>
<a name="40517-33_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   Consultation is a vitally important factor in all policy-making. Ministers and officials have been actively engaged in consulting stakeholders in developing the policy framework surrounding the director. We have consulted widely on the Secretary of State&#039;s guidance to the director, and I am confident that such a consultative approach will be carried on by the director himself once appointed.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>I ought to say immediately in response to my noble friend Lady Warwick that the intention is precisely that OFFA would have a light touch. That has always been intended to be a feature of OFFA. We have always believed that OFFA should be happy to discuss details in its operation, just as there will be further discussions on the details of the notes of guidance themselves in the way that has been sought. There is no intention of getting into micromanagement.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>Amendment No. 78 requires the director, in the performance of his functions, to consult with those stakeholders who have an interest in ensuring fair access to higher education. I have already mentioned the draft letter of guidance from the Secretary of State to the director of fair access. We have said that the director will need to talk to the Commission for Racial Equality, the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Disability Rights Commission and work with them to help institutions understand best practice in the area of outreach. We have also said that HEFCE and the director will need to work closely together and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_621"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 621</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

exchange data freely. The director will also engage in a consultative process with individual institutions when making decisions on approval of access plans. In discussions, it has already been suggested to us that we should include specific references to other bodies in the guidance letter to the director, and we are reflecting carefully on that. We are committed to adequate, full and appropriate consultation.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, mentioned a moment ago, the first amendment is drawn very broadly, and the list of people with an interest in protecting fair access would be a very long one. Businesses, certainly; parents and young people self-evidently have an interest; as well as universities and colleges, schools and training providers and many others. We would expect OFFA to consult organisations representing those groups under-represented in higher education, but all of the groups that I have mentioned, and business was a good example, have a genuine interest in fair access if it is to deliver the most able graduates for industry and commerce. The point was well made.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>As individual citizens, we all have an interest, because this is a question of fairness. If for some reason a single stakeholder were missed out, it is unclear what the legal effect of the amendment would be. We entirely recognise their concern, and suggest that a possible solution would be to revise the Secretary of State&#039;s letter of guidance to the director of fair access, as my noble friend Lady Warwick has already suggested, and to attach greater prominence to the issue of consultation. That seems to be a sensible way through the absence of other references to the point. I give an undertaking that we will pursue that course of action and discuss, with anyone who wishes to discuss it further, the details of how that might be achieved.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, moved Amendment No. 78A, which deals with consultation on the Secretary of State&#039;s guidance to the director. It is precisely because we value such consultation that we have published a draft letter of guidance from the Secretary of State to the director in advance, which should allow ample time for scrutiny by universities and many others who might have an interest. The draft guidance has been discussed in detail with Universities UK&#151;we have been grateful for its thinking&#151;and also with a number of other bodies. Of course, it has been shared with noble Lords and with Members in another place.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>Consultation is at the heart of the way in which the director will carry out his functions. For example, there must be discussion between relevant institutions and the director if the director were minded not to approve an access plan or was considering applying a sanction. We have agreed to make regulations under Clauses 31 and 35 subject to affirmative resolution, ensuring detailed scrutiny by Parliament. I assure noble Lords that we would not expect ordinarily to issue guidance to the director without first discussing it with those most likely to be affected. We support the principle.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_622"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 622</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40517-33_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>There are three reasons why the amendment would not work. First, there would be circumstances in which we would need to issue revised or supplementary guidance very quickly. A statutory requirement to consult would, under current Cabinet Office guidelines, imply a standard 12-week consultation period, with a further time to consider the responses. That would delay the publication of urgent guidance where that guidance could be helpful to the director and the institution.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>Secondly, a statutory requirement to consult would make the guidance letter from the Secretary of State over-elaborate and would imply a detailed level of emphasis that would be unnecessary and burdensome. I remind the Committee that the guidance is not a legal direction: it is simply meant to convey the spirit in which, we hope, the director will operate.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>Thirdly, if we were to engage in more formal consultation, it would seem appropriate to consult a wider range of bodies than the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment would require. The amendment would require the Secretary or State or the Welsh Assembly to consult only bodies representing institutions before issuing guidance. I understand that that would be a major concern to the noble Baroness, as she has important responsibilities for institutions. I am concerned that it would exclude other sectoral organisations with a legitimate interest. The problem is that such formal consultation would create a major delay in the process. I know that many institutions&#151;probably all&#151;are keen to finalise their access plans, including their fees, as soon as possible. Regrettably, the amendment would frustrate that process.
</p>

<a name="40517-33_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment. I hope that we have given some serious indication of the way in which we would like to pursue the consultation question. We take it very seriously.

<a name="40517-34_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I am delighted that business is one of the sectors with which consultation is already going on and will go on in the future. However, I would like to press the Minister a fraction. He accepted that plans would need to be changed from time to time, but can he give an instance&#151;a hypothetical instance, I accept&#151;in which it would need to be changed so quickly that guidance would not be appropriate?
</p>




<p><a name="st_230"></a>
<a name="40517-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I am loath to speculate about specific instances, but I observe that institutions want a high level of flexibility to respond to the demand for courses that, they perceive, will come from students. Often, they work rapidly in such circumstances. I suspect that, for some of the courses that will come up rapidly, the notion of the importance of access will be a feature.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para0"></a>

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_9"></a><br>
&quot;(2)   A plan under this section relating to any institution must include provisions relating to&#151;


(a)   the promotion of higher education, and


(b)   the promotion of equality of opportunity in connection with access to higher education.


(3)   The provisions referred to in subsection (2) shall include measures which the governing body will take to&#151;


(a)   attract applications from prospective students,


(b)   provide, or secure the provision of, financial assistance to students, 


(c)   make available to students and prospective students information about financial assistance available to students from any source.


(4)   The plan shall include the governing body&#039;s objectives in relation to the matters covered by subsections (2) and (3), and its arrangements for monitoring the achievement of those objectives.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_235"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 80 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 91, 92 and 93. Amendment No. 80 addresses the nature of the plans which the institutions will be required to submit to OFFA. Amendment No. 80A, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, seeks to leave out subsection (2)(a). I am inclined to support it and wish that I had not included the proposal in my own amendment. I agree entirely that giving OFFA the right to approve a plan on the &quot;promotion of higher education&quot; gives it rather wide-ranging powers. My amendment would substitute the word &quot;and&quot; for &quot;or&quot;, but that has been picked up by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp and, I suspect, was a government drafting error in the first place.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a>My proposed subsections (3) and (4) would change the nature of the kind of information institutions would be required to give to OFFA. Rather than having regulations which we have discovered are to come from the Secretary of State rather than OFFA <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_624"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 624</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

covering how the plans should be drawn up, we think it would be much more sensible to ask governing bodies to submit plans setting out how they intend to attract applications from all prospective students. It is limiting to provide that governing bodies should submit plans for one kind of student. Surely their overall strategy for recruitment, how they intend to attract students from all walks of life, would be of the most interest to OFFA.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>I have a personal objection to the phrase,


</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>It is too vague. Someone said that stockbrokers are under-represented in higher education. Should governing bodies submit a plan for how they will recruit more stockbrokers? It is an infelicitous phrase. Perhaps the Government could think of a form of words that focuses more closely on what they wish to say.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>Amendment No. 91 again seeks to take out the provision allowing the Secretary of State to make regulations and provides for OFFA to give guidance to institutions on what kind of content the director would like their plans to include.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>Amendments Nos. 92 and 93 comprise the last plank in our vision of a different kind of structure and framework for OFFA&#039;s functions. The amendments propose that institutions should submit their plans for widening access as part of the overall triennial strategic plans submitted to their funding councils. I have managed a fairly large university in my time and it seems quite absurd to pick out what is a very key part of a university strategy&#151;that is, the strategy for recruitment&#151;from the rest of the plans covering the mission of the university, its financing, student numbers over the coming three years, new buildings, the adaptation of classrooms and so forth. Universities are required to include all this information in their triennial strategic plans. Surely plans for widening access, as now, should remain part of the overall strategy rather than be picked out as a separate element.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>I do not know whether representatives from NATFHE have had discussions with the Minister, but their briefing states as a fact that the section on widening access is to be taken out of the triennial plan to HEFCE and submitted separately to OFFA. I think that is wrong. It seems to be bad management practice to pick out one central part of the university strategy&#151;how the customers are recruited&#151;from the rest of the plans for finance, buildings and so forth.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>The amendments would ensure that the plans for OFFA are originally part of the overall plan submitted to the funding councils. The councils would then pass on the relevant elements of the plan to OFFA for its consideration. I beg to move.

<a name="column_625"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 625</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

No. 80A. I certainly agree with that. I simply stress the importance of looking at the universities&#039; overall strategic plan. We have been drilled, dragooned, cajoled, steered and pushed towards having overall strategic plans, and that is the right direction to go. Therefore it would be sensible to leave consideration of this part of the strategic plan as part of the larger whole.

<p><a name="st_237"></a>
<a name="40517-34_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   Amendment No. 81 stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Shutt. It is a little amendment and relates to subsection (2) of Clause 31. It is really a probing amendment, as to why it is &quot;or&quot; and whether the &quot;promotion of higher education&quot; is part of the access plan or whether that is not part of the plan as a whole.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>Having said that, I have a great deal of sympathy both for Amendment No. 80A&#151;which eliminates paragraph (a) altogether&#151;and for the whole run of amendments that have just been proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry. It seems to me that what the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, has just said in relation to the development of strategic plans&#151;and of the access plan being an element that is integral within those strategic plans&#151;is the right way to look at it. To separate them out and create separate plans is somewhat absurd. It goes back to my general wish not to see OFFA there at all.

<p><a name="st_238"></a>
<a name="40517-34_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   It is always extremely helpful to debate one group of amendments while thinking about the next group. I will confine myself to these amendments, but I will bear in mind what noble Lords have said about the next group of amendments&#151;Amendment No. 80A in particular, which picks up the theme that noble Lords have identified. I will try to work through them reasonably speedily and address the concerns raised.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, said, Amendments Nos. 80, 91, 92 and 93 all seek to remove the regulation-making power relating to the content of access plans, the approval of plans and the maximum length of time a plan may be in force.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>We considered very carefully what was most appropriately enshrined in primary legislation and what we felt best left to secondary legislation. We need a degree of flexibility, within the bounds of the remit of the director, as to the content of access plans. That said, I accept the need for clear boundaries within which the director can operate, and within which regulations can be made. There also needs to be appropriate levels of parliamentary scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>As noble Lords will see from the Marshalled List, I have brought forward Amendments Nos. 110 and 111, which make the regulation-making power in Clauses 31(2) and 35(2)&#151;covering the content of access plans and the enforcement of plans&#151;subject to the affirmative procedure. That is the recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, as noble Lords will be aware. But I do not agree that we should have no regulations at all. They <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_626"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 626</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are a well-travelled and recognised route for enacting provisions which may need some changes and adjustments to be made without primary legislation.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>For example, a provision about the financial information that institutions could be required to provide to students: in time it is quite possible that we may be able to remove that requirement in regulations if information were available through another route. Under this amendment we would be unable to do so.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>Amendment No. 80 would prevent institutions being required to include in their plans commitments to running outreach activities to raise aspirations and attract applications from under-represented groups. There is no mention of under-represented groups in this amendment. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, and the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, have said that the term is insufficiently clear, but it remains the best way of expressing in legal terms what widening participation is about. I am happy to discuss whether there is a better term, but we have checked and that is the best term. We do not, as I have made absolutely clear, wish to interfere with admissions, but improving the number of applications from under-represented groups is to be encouraged, as we have deliberated this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>The amendment would also, of course, remove from the face of the Bill any reference to the provision of information to the director. We believe that it is important that the director can ask for and receive relevant information where necessary. This would not be onerous. The director would simply ask institutions to confirm on an annual basis that they have met the commitments in their plan. It would be important that the director could ask for any information needed to check that this was the case were it ever called into question. Clause 37 provides that the director may exchange information with HEFCE and with the Teacher Training Agency. This means that he would not need to seek information from institutions which had already supplied it to these bodies.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>Amendment No. 91 is a consequential amendment to Amendment No. 80 and seeks to remove reference to our regulation-making power, which I have already discussed.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>Amendment No. 81 does not relate to a drafting issue, as some noble Lords may have felt. As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, it would require that the provisions in the plans should relate to both the promotion of higher education &quot;and&quot; the promotion of equality of opportunity in connection with access to higher education. The Bill currently states &quot;or&quot;, recognising that in England we intend the focus of plans to be clearly about the latter.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_514"></a>Let me explain briefly but slightly further. The clause covers both England and Wales. While in England we want our plans to be focused solely on the promotion of equality of opportunity in connection with access to higher education, the National Assembly for Wales has yet to make a decision on whether to introduce variable fees and, if so, what arrangements it will make for plans. It may want to focus more generally on the promotion of higher education.

</p>

<a name="40517-34_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a>I asked for clarification from Jane Davidson, the Assembly Minister for Education and Lifelong Learning. Let me read a brief extract of the letter that I received from her. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;I do not envisage defining the contents of fee plans, whether in relation to access or to the promotion of HE, in such tight terms to allow institutions no flexibility or in such tight terms as to interfere with their autonomy. I am firmly of the opinion that institutions must be given the space to respond to their local circumstances. Rather, I envisage a process whereby essentially institutions propose what additional contribution they will make to higher education in Wales as a result of their fee income&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-34_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>I hope that gives some assurances on how the Assembly envisages its plans operating in Wales.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a>I know that concerns have been expressed by organisations such as SKILL and the Royal National Institute for the Blind, but I can assure the Committee that we have absolutely no intention of causing difficulties for them in England with these clauses. I hope I have reassured the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that that is not what we intend. We shall return to this issue with the next group of amendments. I am of course willing to reflect on the matter if that will help.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a>I was going to say that I have some sympathy with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, but he is not in his place and his amendment will not be moved by anyone on his behalf. I shall swiftly move on to my conclusion.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a>I should say to the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, in regard to Amendment No. 92 that, under our proposals, access plans will subsume the widening participation strategies which institutions currently submit to the funding council. No institution will have to produce both. We therefore believe that the plans will generate negligible additional burden. This is particularly true given the closeness of the working relationship between the director and HEFCE in that context. I know the noble Baroness was very worried at Second Reading about that issue.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a>We believe that it is very important to reject these amendments. Amendment No. 92 would delete all the regulation powers in Clause 32 and instead would produce a strategic plan in perpetuity. We do not believe that is the right way to go. There would also be technical difficulties with the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a>Amendment No. 93 seeks that the institutions&#039; first action plan should last no longer than three years. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent an institution from proposing an action plan that lasts only three years. The flexibility we have built in enables institutions to align their action plans in a range of different ways, tying in with their financial cycle, their financial strategy, their business planning cycle and so on. The Bill provides a power to specify the maximum period that a plan may be in force, and the Committee will see from the draft regulations that we have indicated that that period should be five years.
</p>

<a name="40517-34_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>I hope that I have answered some of the queries that the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, had in putting forward her amendments. We believe that we would need the flexibility of secondary legislation and <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40517-35_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Perry of Southwark: </b>   I thank the Minister for her careful reply and noble Lords who have spoken in support in this debate. I am a little surprised that the Minister felt that Amendment No. 80 would prevent institutions from submitting plans about how they would attract applications from the type of students about whom we are all concerned. Subsection (2)(b) in my amendment requires institutions to include,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;the promotion of equality of opportunity in connection with access&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>Also, my argument for subsection (3)(a) was that it would of course include not only students who are currently under-represented&#151;if that is the phrase that we are using&#151;but all students. The provision has to fit in with an overall plan. It cannot be right to single out certain groups and say, &quot;This is what we are going to do for them&quot;, without including that as part of the institution&#039;s overall recruitment strategy. Higher education is just not like that. There is a total recruitment strategy, not bits and pieces of what one is going to do.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>I am happy that the Minister agrees with some of the thinking behind my Amendment No. 92. In her answer to Amendment No. 93, she said that it would be important to have institutions thinking of their access plans alongside all their other plans for finance, buildings and so forth, which is exactly the point that I was making. However, we shall doubtless return to the matter at a later stage. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_241"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment, I will also speak to Amendment No. 84A. I will not detain the Committee for long. Amendment No. 80A makes a very simple point, although it appears to be in almost direct contradiction with Amendment No. 82 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a>Clause 31(2) states that a plan must include provisions,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;relating to . . . the promotion of equality of opportunity in connection with access to higher education&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a>That is fine. That is what I understand OFFA to be about. That is what I thought the plans would contain. However, what is the need for paragraph (a), which states that plans must include,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;provisions relating to the promotion of higher education&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_528"></a>I do not understand what that means in this context. When I first looked at the provision, I thought that there was no problem. If the plan fulfils condition (b), by definition, it fulfils condition (a). However, does it? Some more cynical than I have pointed out&#151;and the Minister referred to this&#151;that the provision appears to give the Secretary of State and the Director of Fair <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40517-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>Although the Minister sought to reassure the House on that point, I was not at all reassured by the quote from the letter from the Assembly Minister, which raised a lot more questions than I had imagined. I confess that I am genuinely puzzled. I do not intend to press this amendment to a vote, but I give fair warning that, if the Minister is not able to provide a convincing argument, I shall return to the issue on Report. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_242"></a>
<a name="40517-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   Our Amendment No. 82 is grouped with these amendments. It is a probing amendment and it has almost probed successfully. Both the Minister and the noble Lord on the Government Front Bench referred to the Government accepting the recommendations of your Lordships&#039; Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform. In fact, as I understand it, Amendment No. 111, which is the acceptance amendment mentioned by the noble Lord and the Minister, does that only in part. My problem is that Clause 31 is a bit of a mish-mash. It refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>&quot;the promotion of higher education&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a>and the finance conditions attached. I will come on to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, in a minute.
<a name="time_35"></a>
<a name="40517-35_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40517-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a>The Select Committee on Delegated Powers&#151;as it then was&#151;published its first report on 5 March 1993. This said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a>&quot;The Committee is not likely to think it appropriate to delegate powers to impose or to increase taxation or other charges, except to take account of inflation or increased costs; to create criminal offences unless the general scope of the offences and the maximum penalties are contained in the primary legislation; or to remove or reduce benefits conferred in primary legislation unless that legislation lays down clear criteria for determining how the power is to be exercised&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_532"></a>The report went on to say that it was concerned with financial powers which would always be affirmative&#151;and, indeed, the current report of your Lordships&#039; Select Committee has backed this up. As I said, Clause 31 is a bit of a mixture. I would even describe it as a mish-mash.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a>I am therefore surprised that Amendment No. 111 refers only to Clause 31(2) and not to the whole clause, which the later amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, does. She will know what number that is. That refers to the whole clause, plus a whole string of four other clauses. I am not going to debate the four other clauses, but I am certainly debating that one. That was the purpose of our tabling Amendment No. 82.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a>As far as the other two amendments are concerned, surely there is a valid argument that the promotion of higher education as aspects of the equality of opportunity in connection with access should be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_630"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 630</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

looked at as part of the whole picture surrounding higher education. The links between finance, fees and access plans shows in the clause that it already could have a wide-ranging implication under the Bill, touching areas such as research funding and more general funding for the universities.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a>Amendment No.84A removes the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a>&quot;relating to either of those matters&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a>In doing this, the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, allows regulations relating to the equality of opportunity in connection with access and the promotion of higher education to include what I suggest are some rather vague &quot;further provisions&quot;. That is a quotation from the amendment. The use of these words could leave it open to wide interpretation. If we are to have regulations at all, surely they should be limited to relating to the matter in hand.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a>Those are general comments on the other two amendments in this group. I would like to know why the Government&#039;s acceptance of the ideas of the Select Committee on Deregulated Powers and Regulatory Reform has been limited to Clause 31(2).
</p>




<p><a name="st_243"></a>
<a name="40517-35_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I say to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, that when we come to debate the next group of amendments that I put forward on delegated powers I hope to answer his question completely.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a>My understanding from the 14th report of the Delegated Powers Committee on 23 April was that we have acceded to the specific recommendations that it put forward and those are covered in my Amendment No. 111. Before we get to debate that group, I will ensure that if what I have said is unclear, I will refer to it.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a>The noble Lord said that these seem to be diametrically opposed amendments but I believe that they are searching for the same issue, which is to look at why we have drafted the clauses in the way that they appear on the face of the Bill. I hope to be able to offer some clarity.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a>Amendment No. 80A and the consequential amendment, Amendment No. 84A would, as my noble friend Lady Warwick said, remove paragraph (a), relating to the promotion of higher education, from the Bill. I covered this matter in part in my remarks on the previous group. We are quite clear in England that it is our intention that access plans should be related to the equality of opportunity in connection with fair access. I understand the concern expressed by my noble friend Lady Warwick that access plans may suffer from &quot;mission creep&quot;, which is new terminology to me. The amendment would remove from the Bill the reference to the promotion of higher education.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_541"></a>In the first instance, I assure Members of the Committee straightaway that in England we have no intention that access plans should cover anything other than the equality of opportunity in connection with fair access. We have always been clear that that would be the case&#151;that has been the entire foundation <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_631"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 631</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of our policy. Teaching, research or business links have not been a part of our thinking as far as access plans are concerned.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_542"></a>We have given clear signals of that in the Bill. The title of the director is the Director of Fair Access, and Clause 30(1) says that he must perform his functions in such a way as to promote and safeguard fair access to higher education. As Members of the Committee will have seen from our draft regulations, we intend that the contents of access plans should follow very closely indeed the specific provisions set out in Clause 31(4).
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_543"></a>The position in Wales is rather different. I shall say only that there are only 13 higher education institutions in Wales and, from August, there will be 12. Wales outperforms the UK average on widening participation. The position is different, and the Assembly might wish for plans that cover a different scope. The term &quot;promotion of higher education&quot; is a wide one, as my noble friend has recognised. It is there specifically to give the National Assembly sufficient flexibility and freedom.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_544"></a>I am clear that higher education institutions are autonomous bodies, and the provisions in Clause 31 are in no way intended to undermine that long-established principle. I am reluctant to take away from the National Assembly the freedom to make those decisions by removing the term &quot;promotion of higher education&quot; from the Bill, but I recognise the concerns that my noble friend has expressed. We shall reflect on the matter and have further discussions with Universities UK on the basis of this evening&#039;s debate.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_545"></a>Amendment No. 82 seeks to remove the reference to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>&quot;promotion of equality of opportunity&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-35_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_546"></a>from the Bill. We recognise that the main key to widening access to higher education is improved attainment at all levels of a child&#039;s education. We have also debated the role of both/and, not either/or, which I have tried to suggest is relevant to the role played by universities. We need to ensure that we have established that opportunity fully within Clause 31.
</p>

<a name="40517-35_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_547"></a>On the basis that I shall return to the issues referred to by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee under the next group of amendments and on the understanding that I shall reflect further on the issues raised by my noble friend about the breadth of concerns in relation to the meaning of the clause, while recognising the importance of giving the National Assembly the right to have that flexibility, I hope she will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_246"></a>The noble Lord said: I have just been criticised by the Minister for jumping ahead and asking my question on this group of amendments under the last group. In response, I might quote from the report of Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.

<a name="40517-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_550"></a>Clause 31 concerns plans, which are essentially financial. The Bill does not specifically exclude from the scope of regulations under the clause, measures which are not wholly financial, such as those relating to admissions policy. That is why I described the clause during the debate on the previous amendment as a &quot;mishmash&quot;.

<a name="40517-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_555"></a>If the clauses are to remain as they are, we welcome the application of the affirmative parliamentary procedure. However, we feel that our Amendment No. 109 would also achieve that. I beg to move.

<a name="40517-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_557"></a>Clause 32 allows the Secretary of State to make regulations specifying,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a>&quot;matters to which the relevant authority is, or is not, to have regard in making any determination relating to approval&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_558"></a>I am no lawyer, but I have taken advice. I know that among your Lordships there are those who can imagine just how wide that power might be. It is important to remember that the Secretary of State is also responsible for appointing the director of OFFA and may issue guidance to which the director must have regard. I think these powers are very wide. It is not much to ask the Minister to accept that they should be constrained at least by a little parliamentary scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="40517-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_559"></a>Amendment No. 93A subjects regulations under Clause 33 to an affirmative procedure. I understand that the current duration of plan is intended to be five years. I am content with that. What if the Secretary of State changes his mind once the Bill receives Royal Assent and makes regulations which require plans to be renewed every year? That would impose a significant additional burden on institutions and would be inconsistent with the Minister&#039;s avowed intention that OFFA should be light-touch and non-bureaucratic. Again, Parliament should have some say and institutions should have some opportunity to influence the legislation.
</p>

<a name="40517-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_560"></a>The same applies to regulations under Clause 34, which deals with the variation of plans. I know from my experience of trying to secure changes to the secondary legislation under the Export Control Act that negative instruments are nigh-on impossible to change once they have been made. I want to ensure that in future universities have some say in the way the regime develops. The Secretary of State should consult on changes to the regulatory framework&#151;hence my Amendment No. 109A. If the Government see fit to accept my other amendments, I assume that consultation will be part of the affirmative procedure, but I would welcome clarification on this point. I beg to move.

As he was particularly interested in clarifying the scope of Clause 31, it is my understanding that Amendment No. 90, which we have accepted, does clarify this point. If that does not satisfy the noble Lord on that particular point, perhaps he and I can have a word outside the Committee.
</p>

<a name="40517-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_561"></a>As I have made clear through Amendments Nos. 110 and 111, we have accepted the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and will be very pleased to publish our regulations and consider the comments of noble Lords before they are formally laid. These amendments also have the advantage of allowing for other regulations, still subject to negative procedure, to be laid together <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_634"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 634</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with those now subject to the affirmative procedure. In other words, for the first set of regulations we can lay a single set of regulations of both negative and affirmative, and use the affirmative procedure. I hope that that will go some way to addressing the concerns of noble Lords as we go through these amendments.
</p>

<a name="40517-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_562"></a>Amendment No. 85 is in line with the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee but actually creates a difficulty in the wording because of the position of Wales. As I think I have explained in your Lordships&#039; House before, the National Assembly has a different regulation-making procedure, much more akin to the affirmative procedure in this Parliament. Therefore I hope the noble Lord will accept that my own amendment seeks to achieve the same outcome, but taking on board the issue in Wales.
</p>

<a name="40517-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_563"></a>Amendment No. 92A, on which my noble friend has focused, concerns the approval of access plans. We have listened very carefully to some of the concerns expressed about the clause by Universities UK. An amendment was made in another place to Clause 32, restricting our regulation-making powers in respect to the approval of plans. This followed from representations from Universities UK. However, I do not believe the nature of these regulations justifies the high level of scrutiny provided for by the affirmative resolution procedure. As I mentioned earlier, in the first instance they would be made as part of a single set of regulations which in any event would be subject to the affirmative procedure. In the first set it will be very clear what the position is.
</p>

<a name="40517-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_564"></a>Amendment Nos. 93A and 93B would make regulations under Clauses 33 and 34 subject to affirmative resolution. Again, while we intend in the first set of regulations for the director to be approved by the affirmative procedure, we do not believe that subsequent changes would, in themselves, justify an affirmative approach.
</p>

<a name="40517-36_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_565"></a>Amendment No. 102 goes beyond the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which were that regulations under Clause 35(2)(c) be by affirmative resolution. Amendment No. 102 would extend this to the whole of Clause 35(2). Again, I reassure noble Lords that the first set of regulations will all be through the affirmative process, but again we believe that it is appropriate to leave the provisions for the future to be by the negative procedure.
</p>

<a name="40517-36_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_566"></a>Amendment No. 109 seeks to make every single regulation made under this Bill subject to the affirmative procedure, which I suggest is a rather unusual departure from parliamentary procedure. I understand the desire to make Parliament play a very active role in scrutiny and I support that desire. However, I believe it is appropriate to have different forms of scrutiny, and that there are occasions when the negative resolution procedure is more appropriate. I know the noble Lord&#039;s concern mostly involves regulations related to variable fees and the director of fair access, but there are other issues in the Bill&#151;supply of information, a number of technical matters <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_635"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column 635</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

relating to student fees and so on. As we said, the first group of regulations will all be by the affirmative procedure, and I hope that being able to see the process in action will put noble Lords&#039; minds at rest.
</p>

<a name="40517-36_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_567"></a>In Amendment No. 109A, I too agree on the importance of consultation, and I assure the Committee that we will consult on any regulations made under Clauses 31 to 35. I am happy to place that on record, but I do not believe that this needs to be included as a statutory requirement in primary legislation. It follows existing practice under Section 22 of the 1988 Act. When we do consult, we will not only wish to consult the institutions. There are a number of bodies who have a legitimate interest in this area, and I believe it is important to have the flexibility to do that.
</p>

<a name="40517-36_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_568"></a>Amendment No. 111A would make regulations under Clauses 31 to 35 subject to affirmative resolution. As I have already indicated, I do not believe that the high level of scrutiny is appropriate for the affirmative resolution procedure when considering the kind of change that we would expect to those regulations.
</p>

<a name="40517-36_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_569"></a>I have welcomed the report of the Delegated Powers Committee, and we have tabled amendments to implement it. In the light of the technical flaws of Amendments Nos. 85 and 102, the assurances that I have given on the other amendments, and the more important difficulties of principle with Amendment No. 109, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment and support those in my name.

that the Government should have acceded to various suggestions that we drew to the attention of the House. I am conscious that the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, is unhappy that we did not go further. I may be speaking out of turn in the absence of any of my colleagues, but we rather pride ourselves on living to a regularity of precedent, in terms of our recommendations. We concentrate entirely on procedure and not on policy. It is always gratifying when, almost invariably, the Government accept our recommendations. That may be in part because of the manner in which we conduct ourselves. Were we constantly to go further, we might find more of our recommendations rejected.

In addition, the Government have prepared an informal document showing the Bill including all the government amendments, copies of which are available from the Attendant at the door.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Before Clause 149, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
   &quot;DISPUTES BETWEEN CIVIL PARTNERS ABOUT PROPERTY


(1)   In any question between the civil partners in a civil partnership as to title to or possession of property, either civil partner may apply by summons or otherwise in a summary way to&#151;


(a)   the High Court, or


(b)   a county court.


(2)   On such an application, the court may make such order with respect to the property as it thinks fit (including an order for the sale of the property).


(3)   Rules of court made for the purposes of this section may confer jurisdiction on county courts whatever the situation or value of the property in dispute.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_4"></a>The noble Baroness said: Before I speak to this group of nine amendments I should say to the Committee that at Thursday&#039;s sitting it was generally agreed that it would be helpful if we could find a way to put the amendments relating to Northern Ireland in a new format to facilitate the Committee&#039;s consideration of them. It was also suggested that the Government provide further explanatory material on the amendments. We have attempted to do this. I should like to put on record my thanks to the officials who worked very hard to produce the material that was requested by the Committee.
</p>

<a name="40517-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>A separate version of Part 4 with the amendments incorporated, making it easier to see how the proposed amendments fit into existing provisions for Northern Ireland, has been produced. However, I make clear to the Committee that this is not an official version but a draft intended to aid Members of the Committee in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC240"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column GC240</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

discussion. We have also produced a revised set of draft Explanatory Notes to accompany those amendments and a supplementary document noting the purpose and effect of each amendment. I hope that noble Lords will find these documents helpful in assisting our deliberations this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="40517-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>Turning to the amendments, this group of nine amendments make provision in Northern Ireland in connection with civil partnership which is comparable to the provision made for England and Wales by Chapter 3 of Part 2 as well as Schedules 4, 5, 6 and 7. They cover a wide range of legislative provision that sets out the rights and responsibilities of civil partners during the civil partnership, on its dissolution and after the death of one of the civil partners.
</p>

<a name="40517-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>I will speak in some detail on this group and the following groups of amendments, as I did on Thursday. I hope that the Committee will find it useful in following the debate. I have taken heed of the request of the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, and will indicate page numbers in the Marshalled List as I proceed.
</p>

<a name="40517-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>Amendments Nos. 61AW and 61AX on page 38 enable civil partners to refer disputes over property to court using a summary procedure. The first of these amendments allows these disputes to be resolved in the High Court or a county court. The second of these amendments extends the availability of this jurisdiction of the court to situations where the civil partner no longer has the money or property in possession. In these cases the court has the same powers to make orders as if the property or money in question was still in the hands of the civil partner, including the power to order one civil partner to pay to the other a sum of money as appropriate. We discussed similar provisions in relation to Clauses 64 and 65 on 13 May.
</p>

<a name="40517-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Amendment No. 61AY on page 39 extends to civil partners and their children the protections under Northern Ireland law currently available to spouses and children in respect of the proceeds of life assurance policies. As in Clause 67 for England and Wales and Clause 127 in Scotland, this is a necessary provision to ensure that surviving civil partners and their children are treated in the same way as spouses and the children of a married couple for the purposes of life assurance policies which have been expressly taken out for their benefit.
</p>

<a name="40517-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>Amendments Nos. 61AZ, on page 39, and 63A, on page 70, are concerned with the disposition of the estate of civil partners who have died. Amendment No. 63AZ contains a clause introducing Amendment No. 63A which amends existing legislation in Northern Ireland in relation to the effect of the formation or dissolution of a civil partnership on the will of a civil partner. Where a person has made a will, that will is revoked by the formation of a civil partnership, it being expected that the testator would have wished to make fresh provision. Similarly, the dissolution of a civil partnership will have the effect of revoking the will insofar as it concerns any disposition made in favour of the former civil partner. I hope that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC241"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column GC241</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

given the supplementary material that we have provided, any further questions that the Committee may have on that are past us.
</p>

<a name="40517-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Amendment No. 63A also deals comprehensively with the rights of surviving civil partners to a share of the deceased&#039;s estate under the intestacy rules and inheritance legislation.
</p>

<a name="40517-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Amendments Nos. 61BA, on page 39, 63B, on page 80, 63C, on page 117 and 63D, on page 141 establish a system of financial relief in Northern Ireland for civil partners and children of their family following the breakdown of the civil partnership. Amendment No. 61BA inserts a new clause introducing the schedules contained in the three subsequent amendments.
</p>

<a name="40517-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>Amendment No. 63B inserts a new schedule which deals with the adjustment of the finances and property rights of civil partners when a civil partnership is brought to an end. Amendment No. 63C sets out a system of financial relief that will be available in the magistrates&#039; courts tier. This will enable civil partners to apply for maintenance themselves and for children of the family in the same way as parties to a marriage.
</p>

<a name="40517-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>Amendment No. 63D inserts a new schedule containing provisions for financial relief in Northern Ireland after a civil partnership has been dissolved or annulled or the civil partners have been legally separated in a country outside the British Isles.
</p>

<a name="40517-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The provision made by these four amendments replicates existing arrangements for the financial arrangements between married couples whose marriage has ended, either within or outside Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40517-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>The nine amendments in this group amend or replicate existing provision in Northern Ireland law applying to married couples and their property and finances. They raise no new issues of principle for the Bill. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40517-38_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   I tell the Leader of the House that I will not be long, but wish, first, to thank her very much and, indeed, through her, her officials, because it must have been some task to make some sense out of this matter. Although we have not had much time to look at the amendments&#151;I have only just received most of them&#151;the results have been useful.
</p>

<a name="40517-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Secondly, the noble Baroness started by saying that the new amendments are comparable to the amendments for England and Wales, which is fine. But are they identical? If they are only comparable there may be some areas which the Minister could highlight. Could someone write to let us know if there are any differences? We have largely been examining the England and Wales provisions and if these new amendments are identical there will not be much more work to do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40517-38_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   With respect to &quot;identical&quot; or &quot;comparable&quot;, they will be different&#151;or differently worded&#151;only where Northern Ireland legislation is different. The reason that I use the word &quot;comparable&quot; concerning Northern Ireland legislation is that I have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC242"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column GC242</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sought, as I go through, to highlight those places where it is different, because I know that the Committee would want to know. But in the majority of instances, where there is a slight difference, it will be because the orders or legislation in Northern Ireland are slightly different.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40517-38_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   May I also thank the noble Baroness the Leader of the House, her team and Ministers more generally for what is a departure from anything that I have ever known before in the decade for which I have belonged to the House? I very much hope that what is being done on this occasion may be considered as a possible example for what could be done again. It has always seemed to me strange that the way in which we deal with amendments makes it extremely difficult, even for lawyers, who have the sad task of reading such things, to be able to mate the proposed amendments to the text of a Bill. The beauty of what has been done here is that, in an informal document, we have the entire relevant parts of the Bill dealing with Northern Ireland in a way that does not require us to go back and forth to the Marshalled List.
</p>

<a name="40517-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The other thing that is important is to have the notes on the amendments, which Ministers themselves have, which means that we have an update on the Explanatory Notes. One problem about the way in which we normally deal with law-making is that although we normally have good Explanatory Notes on the Bill, we do not always get Explanatory Notes on amendments, especially government amendments. Funnily enough, that does not apply where the Joint Committee on Human Rights is involved, which is able, to some extent, to get some of the material in its area updated.
</p>

<a name="40517-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>That is admirable, and enables us to see what is being proposed as a whole. As far as I can see, we are not establishing any different principles in the Northern Ireland part of the Bill&#151;as the noble Baroness said, all we are doing, on my reading, is to change the nomenclature to suit Northern Ireland legislation. On that basis, the amendments, and others like them, are not controversial; they mirror what we have already scrutinised. I repeat my great gratitude for the labour that has been done and my hope that it may be considered to be a precedent set for the future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40517-38_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Alli: </b>   I, too, thank my noble friend the Leader of the House and her officials for the extremely helpful and thorough notes. They certainly helped me this morning to run through the amendments in some detail and to consider them more carefully. I wonder whether my noble friend could also pass on my thanks to my noble friend Lord Filkin for his helpful letter about the work being done concerning unmarried same-sex couples.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40517-38_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   Not same-sex couples.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40517-38_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Alli: </b>   Sorry&#151;co-habiting couples, both same-sex and of opposite sex. We asked for that and his response is most encouraging.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40517-38_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   First, I thank members of the Committee for recognising the hard work that officials <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC243"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column GC243</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have done. I tell the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that one way in which I managed to persuade parliamentary counsel that this work could be done informally by officials was by promising that I was not setting a precedent. So the noble Lord&#039;s words are not especially helpful in that respect. I repeat that this was an informal exercise; it does not set a precedent&#151;although I absolutely recognise the helpfulness of it to the Committee. I should like to retain a degree of flexibility in how we handle Committee stages of Bills, especially when there is a large volume of government amendments, as in this case. It will, of course, depend on work load. I should like to endorse the fact that the principles are not different, they are the same. I also thank my noble friend Lord Alli, with respect to his comments about my noble friend Lord Filkin.

   &quot;APPLICATIONS UNDER SECTION (DISPUTES BETWEEN CIVIL PARTNERS ABOUT PROPERTY) WHERE PROPERTY NOT IN POSSESSION ETC.


(1)   The right of a civil partner (&quot;A&quot;) to make an application under section (Disputes between civil partners about property) includes the right to make such an application where A claims that the other civil partner (&quot;B&quot;) has had in his possession or under his control&#151;


(a)   money to which, or to a share of which, A was beneficially entitled, or


(b)   property (other than money) to which, or to an interest in which, A was beneficially entitled,


and that either the money or other property has ceased to be in B&#039;s possession or under B&#039;s control or that A does not know whether it is still in B&#039;s possession or under B&#039;s control.


(2)   For the purposes of subsection (1)(a) it does not matter whether A is beneficially entitled to the money or share&#151;


(a)   because it represents the proceeds of property to which, or to an interest in which, A was beneficially entitled, or


(b)   for any other reason.


(3)   Subsections (4) and (5) apply if, on such an application being made, the court is satisfied that B&#151;


(a)   has had in his possession or under his control money or other property as mentioned in subsection (1)(a) or (b), and


(b)   has not made to A, in respect of that money or other property, such payment or disposition as would have been just and equitable in the circumstances.


(4)   The power of the court to make orders under section (Disputes between civil partners about property) includes power to order B to pay to A&#151;


(a)   in a case falling within subsection (1)(a), such sum in respect of the money to which the application relates, or A&#039;s share of it, as the court considers appropriate, or


(b)   in a case falling within subsection (1)(b), such sum in respect of the value of the property to which the application relates, or A&#039;s interest in it, as the court considers appropriate.


(5)   If it appears to the court that there is any property which&#151;


(a)   represents the whole or part of the money or property, and


(b)   is property in respect of which an order could (apart from this section) have been made under section (Disputes between civil partners about property),
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC244"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column GC244</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
the court may (either instead of or as well as making an order in accordance with subsection (4)) make any order which it could (apart from this section) have made under section (Disputes between civil partners about property).


(6)   Any power of the court which is exercisable on an application under section (Disputes between civil partners about property) is exercisable in relation to an application made under that section as extended by this section.&quot;


Before Clause 149, insert the following new clause&#151;


   &quot;ASSURANCE POLICY BY CIVIL PARTNER FOR BENEFIT OF OTHER CIVIL PARTNER ETC.


Section 4 of the Law Reform (Husband and Wife) Act (Northern Ireland) 1964 (c.23 (N.I.)) (money payable under policy of life assurance or endowment not to form part of the estate of the insured) applies in relation to a policy of life assurance or endowment&#151;


(a)   effected by a civil partner on his own life, and


(b)   expressed to be for the benefit of his civil partner, or of his children, or of his civil partner and children, or any of them,


as it applies in relation to a policy of life assurance or endowment effected by a husband and expressed to be for the benefit of his wife, or of his children, or of his wife and children, or of any of them.&quot;


Before Clause 149, insert the following new clause&#151;


   &quot;WILLS, ADMINISTRATION OF ESTATES AND FAMILY PROVISION


Schedule (Wills, administration of estates and family provision: Northern Ireland) amends enactments relating to wills, administration of estates and family provision so that they apply in relation to civil partnerships as they apply in relation to marriage.&quot;


Before Clause 149, insert the following new clause&#151;


   &quot;FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR CIVIL PARTNERS AND CHILDREN OF FAMILY

(2)   Any rule of law under which any provision of Part 3 of the 1978 Order is interpreted as applying to dissolution of a marriage on the ground of presumed death is to be treated as applying (with any necessary modifications) in relation to the corresponding provision of Schedule (Financial relief in the High Court or a county court etc.: Northern Ireland).


(3)   Schedule (Financial relief in court of summary jurisdiction etc.: Northern Ireland) makes provision for financial relief in connection with civil partnerships that corresponds to provision made for financial relief in connection with marriages by the Domestic Proceedings (Northern Ireland) Order 1980 (S.I. 1980/563 (N.I. 5)).


(4)   Schedule (Financial relief in Northern Ireland after overseas dissolution etc. of a civil partnership) makes provision for financial relief in Northern Ireland after a civil partnership has been dissolved or annulled, or civil partners have been legally separated, in a country outside the British Islands.&quot;</p>

   &quot;CIVIL PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS UNENFORCEABLE


(1)   A civil partnership agreement does not under the law of Northern Ireland have effect as a contract giving rise to legal rights.


(2)   No action lies in Northern Ireland for breach of a civil partnership agreement, whatever the law applicable to the agreement.

(3)   In this section and section (Property where civil partnership agreement is terminated) &quot;civil partnership agreement&quot; means an agreement between two people&#151;


(a)   to register as civil partners of each other&#151;


(i)   in Northern Ireland (under Part 4),


(ii)   in England and Wales (under Part 2),

(iv)   outside the United Kingdom under an Order in Council made under Chapter 1 of Part 5 (registration at British consulates etc. or by armed forces personnel), or


(b)   to enter into an overseas relationship.


(4)   This section applies in relation to civil partnership agreements whether entered into before or after this section comes into force, but does not affect any action commenced before it comes into force.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_15"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 61BB, which is on page 40, and Amendment No. 61BC, on page 41, make provision for Northern Ireland comparable to Clauses 70 and 71 of Part 2 of the Bill, dealing with England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="40517-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Amendment No. 61BB provides that agreements to register as civil partners will not be enforceable and no right of action will arise if such an agreement is broken. This provision corresponds to the current Northern Ireland law on engaged couples.

</p>

<a name="40517-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Clause 149 is a common clause appearing in Westminster legislation, which needs to be replicated in whole or in part for Northern Ireland. The clause permits an Order in Council under the schedule to the Northern Ireland Act 2000 to make further provision for civil partnership in Northern Ireland. It was necessary to include that clause in the Bill on introduction for drafting reasons in order to ensure that it was technically correct. However, now that we have the necessary additional clauses and schedules for Northern Ireland being added to the Bill, Clause 149 is no longer necessary. That is why I oppose Clause 149 stand part of the Bill.

   &quot;PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY, CHILDREN OF THE FAMILY AND RELATIVES

<p><a name="st_21"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments Nos. 61BD and 61BE on page 42 and Amendments Nos 61BF, 61BG and 61BH on page 43 add five new clauses to Part 4 of the Bill. They deal with matters relating to children. The five new clauses would amend certain <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC247"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column GC247</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

family law legislation in Northern Ireland in much the same way as is done in Chapter 5 of Part 2 of the Bill, which has already been debated.
</p>

<a name="40517-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>The amendments take account of the important role that civil partners will play in children&#039;s lives. &quot;Child of the family&quot; will be redefined to include children who are treated as children of the family by civil partners. Civil partners will be able to obtain parental responsibility for children of their civil partner by court order or by agreement of all those who have parental responsibility for that child.
</p>

<a name="40517-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Those amendments also allow civil partners to apply for residence and contact orders in respect of a child of the family, in the same way as parties to a marriage. That will ensure that a child who has formed a close attachment to a civil partner who is not his or her parent can continue to benefit from that bond even if the relationship between the civil partners has ended. When hearing an application of this nature, the court will obviously take into account whether a residence or contact order is in the best interests of the child in question.
</p>

<a name="40517-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Those amendments also allow a civil partner to be liable for financially maintaining a child whom he or she has treated as a child of the family. That will enable the court to make orders for periodical payments to be made from one civil partner to the other or to a child of the family or to a particular person for the benefit of the child. That will not affect the responsibility of the biological parent to maintain his or her child.
</p>

<a name="40517-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>Those amendments also contain a safeguard for a civil partner who appoints his or her civil partner to act as a guardian for his or her children. That appointment will be revoked if the civil partnership is subsequently dissolved or annulled, unless a contrary intention is shown in the appointment.
</p>

<a name="40517-39_para13"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40517-40_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I think that that is in relation to civil partners being guardians to the child, for example, as well as whether the biological parent of the child is one of the civil partners.

<a name="40517-40_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   Perhaps I can follow up the question of the noble Lord, Lord Monson, about the impact of the devolution scheme. It arises on all these amendments and is a question that goes as much to the Scottish as to the Northern Irish provisions. I understand the answer that has been given by the Leader of the House, which is that it all depends upon whether a matter falls within those matters that are devolved. Obviously, that has to be tackled to some extent on a provision by provision basis, according to the subject matter.
</p>

<a name="40517-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>However, if it would not be too much trouble, it would be helpful if the Government would at some point spell out the brief principles that would apply in deciding whether a matter falls within those that are devolved and are capable of being legislated upon by the Northern Ireland Assembly, when it is restored, or by the Scottish Parliament, or whether they are matters that are controlled entirely by the Westminster Parliament and are therefore not capable of amendment.
</p>

<a name="40517-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>I can see that at the moment one imponderable would be that under the devolution scheme both the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Scottish Parliament are constrained in their law-making powers by the Human Rights Act and by the European Convention on Human Rights. Therefore, if it would be unjustifiably discriminatory to treat homosexual people in Northern Ireland less favourably than homosexual people in the rest of the United Kingdom, that would be a constraint upon the ability of the Assembly to amend, even if, on the face of it, the amending power seemed to fall within the devolution scheme. I do not wish to detain the Committee in any detail on it, but it seems to me that, in view of the understandable sensitivities in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and to a lesser extent in Wales&#151;a lesser extent because they do not have the same law-making powers&#151;it would be helpful if we could have a short explanation at some convenient moment. If not now, then can we please have it on some future occasion, just for the record?

<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40517-40_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   I have listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and we can set out those areas of responsibility that fall to the devolved administrations and those that fall to Westminster. It would be more difficult to set out those areas where, for example, the Assembly or the Scottish Parliament may feel that they want to challenge responsibility and which may end up in a court of law. On the basis of the devolution settlements for Northern Ireland and Scotland, we would be able to set out those areas that fall to Westminster or to Belfast or Edinburgh. The Committee will know, for example, that immigration falls to Westminster, as does responsibility for <br>&nbsp;<br>

The Committee will see that Schedule 8, dealing with these matters in England and Wales, is significantly bigger than its corresponding schedule in Amendment No. 63E. I should like to assure the Committee that this does not imply that civil partners would have any fewer rights to succeed to tenancies in Northern Ireland than their counterparts in England and Wales&#151;here I point out a significant difference to the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain&#151;merely that the <br>&nbsp;<br>

different organisation of the provision of social housing in Northern Ireland entails the need for fewer pieces of legislation. There are also specific pieces of legislation amended in Schedule 8 for England and Wales which have no direct counterparts in Northern Ireland, due largely to the different history of property ownership and its legislative regulation. That is one of the areas where there is a big difference.
</p>

<a name="40517-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Finally, Amendments Nos. 61BL on page 45 and 63F on page 159 deal with the protection to be afforded to civil partners under relevant Northern Ireland legislation dealing with occupation of the family home and protection from domestic violence. Amendment No. 61BL is the new clause introducing the schedule in Amendment No. 63F.
</p>

<a name="40517-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I point out one significant difference between the legislation in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. As yet, legislation on family homes and domestic violence in Northern Ireland does not cater for same-sex cohabitees, as does the legislation here. The Government hope that that will be remedied within this Session. I beg to move.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>The noble Baroness said: This group of amendments serves two purposes. First, Amendments Nos. 65A and 65B on page 51, Amendments Nos. 65L and 65M on pages 56 and 57, Amendments Nos. 65N, 65P and 65Q on page 58 and Amendments Nos. 65S and 65T on page 65 continue the package of Northern Ireland provisions which we are adding to the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40517-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>While the main provisions for Northern Ireland appear in Part 4, additional provisions are needed in Chapter 3 of Part 5 to set out the jurisdiction of the courts in Northern Ireland. At present, the chapter only covers courts in England, Wales and Scotland. We are therefore making minor changes to Clause 159 to ensure that the regulations under that clause can apply in Northern Ireland, subject to the appropriate procedures.
</p>

<a name="40517-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>In addition, new clauses are inserted after Clause 157 to provide for the jurisdiction of courts in Northern Ireland, mirroring Clauses 160 to 164 in England and Wales. There is also a small technical change to Clause 178, consequential on the fees provision inserted by an earlier government amendment to Part 4. Clause 178, as amended, will ensure that this fees provision works correctly in relation to things done by, or on behalf of, the Registrar General for Northern Ireland, under an Order in Council made under Part 5.
</p>

<a name="40517-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Secondly, Amendments Nos. 65C to 65K, which are all on pages 53 to 55, and Amendment No. 96A ensure that the courts in all parts of the UK have the jurisdiction they need to hear applications concerning civil partnerships registered in that part of the UK for dissolution, nullity or separation orders, presumption of death orders and declarations as to validity, even where neither party is domiciled in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="40517-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>The Bill as introduced provided this jurisdiction only in the case of applications for a dissolution or separation order, and in England and Wales in nullity cases. But it is important that civil partners who registered in the UK can gain access to the courts in that part of the UK for all these applications, provided the court considers it in the interests of justice to assume jurisdiction. The new provisions being inserted for Northern Ireland ensure a similar result there.
</p>

<a name="40517-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The provision of a residual jurisdiction for UK courts to hear cases concerning civil partnerships registered in the UK is important because civil partners who register in the UK may subsequently move to a country or territory where civil partnerships <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC254"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column GC254</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are not recognised. As a result, the local courts would have no power to make decisions affecting the civil partnership. If the couple were no longer domiciled in the UK, the UK courts would have no jurisdiction. The couple would be left with nowhere they could go to obtain a valid dissolution or decision on the validity of their civil partnership.
</p>

<a name="40517-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The approach we have taken ensures that cases are not brought back to the UK courts without good reason. The inclusion of an &quot;interests of justice&quot; test allows the UK courts to consider whether they provide the most convenient forum or whether, on the contrary, the matter can appropriately be decided in another legal jurisdiction.
</p>

<a name="40517-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>If the couple are domiciled in a country where the local courts have full power to decide the matter, it is unlikely that the UK courts would be prepared to assume jurisdiction and hear the case. These provisions give the courts a residual jurisdiction to hear the matter where they consider it to be in the interests of justice to do so.
</p>

<a name="40517-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>The consequential amendments to Clauses 150 and 151 ensure that, for the purposes of this residual jurisdiction, a civil partnership formed outside the UK under an Order in Council will be treated as if the parties had registered as civil partners in the part of the UK determined in accordance with the Order in Council. I beg to move.

Those who live in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and elsewhere around the world will be particularly interested in this clause and other related clauses. This provision is plainly a very important element as those people need to know where they will stand if they come and settle, for example, in this country. So this provision is most welcome.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>Page 75, line 12, leave out subsections (2) to (6).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a brief probing amendment to Clause 153, proposing to leave out subsections (2) to (6). We tabled it simply to ask why the Government are treating amendments to specified relationships in different ways.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Clause 153 defines &quot;specified relationships&quot; for overseas relations that are to be treated as civil partners. The clause as currently drafted would allow the Secretary of State to change Schedule 14, the schedule setting out the meaning of overseas relationships, for the purposes of this part of the Bill. I believe that it is a quite large power to allow the Secretary of State to change that by diktat. It is what I think has always been defined as a Henry VIII power in that he is being given power to amend legislation. While,

<a name="40517-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>as provided in subsection (5)(a) and (b)&#151;is quite rightly subject, with this Henry VIII power, to the affirmative procedure, adding a relationship, as in subsection (2)(a), is not. I should be very interested to know whether the Government can explain why that is not to be done by the affirmative procedure whereas the others are.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>I think that we are all well aware of the vast numbers of negative statutory instruments that pass weekly and monthly through the House.

</p>

<a name="40517-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>It is very important that when we come to a matter as important as a relationship under Schedule 14, it should not be done by a negative instrument. It would be more appropriate for it to be done by an affirmative procedure. I should be very interested to know the Government&#039;s reasoning why some of these bits of Clause 153 are dealt with by an affirmative order and some by a negative one. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40517-42_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   For the reasons I had begun to outline, it is obviously very important that people living overseas in established relationships should know how those relationships are to be recognised or not recognised within the United Kingdom. I think that I have already raised the point&#151;in correspondence, and perhaps even in a Question for Written Answer&#151;that Schedule 14 as it stands, on page 207 of the Bill, is much more restrictive in the countries and the territories that it specifies than was the provision outlined originally in the White Paper. As I understand the position, that is because the Government wished to have necessary flexibility as they could look at the changing laws and practices in those countries and decide which of them would come within Schedule 14 and which would not.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>We can take the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as an example to serve for all since today happens to be the day when the new process begins; men and women are marrying under the present law in Massachusetts. It is possible that an attempt will be made to change it&#151;if the constitution of Massachusetts is amended in two years&#039; time&#151;to turn them into civil partners, as I understand it, rather than into married persons. That seems to be one possible outcome of a political controversy that is happening in Massachusetts.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>If John and James, or Mary and Elizabeth, &quot;marry&quot; under the prevailing law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, they will need to know what the consequence of that will be if they come to settle in, for example, this country. While they are living in the United States, at the moment, because of something called the Defence of Marriage Act&#151;a federal Act&#151;they will have virtually no rights in most other states or under federal law. They will be gravely disadvantaged, and even if they are civil partners they will be left with shrunken rights. So for those European and Commonwealth countries that are taking the step that we are taking, the recognition under this provision of the Bill and Schedule 14 is of enormous consequence. Obviously, it requires clarity&#151;reasonable legal certainty&#151;because they may decide to change their positions as a result of their advice about what our law now provides.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>As it is now drafted, Clause 153 is not objectionable. I note that the consent of the Scottish Ministers and the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland must be obtained before any order is made that shows proper deference to the devolved administrations. I do not think that that needs affirmative resolution. Indeed, that would be detrimental because it is important that civil partners across the world should be protected sooner rather than later once the Bill comes into force.

<a name="40517-42_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Frankly, I am not sure of the competence of even us as parliamentarians to be able to judge questions of foreign law that have to be looked into in exercising that power. I hope that I do not offend anyone in suggesting that that may be the case. However, I should be grateful for greater clarity about how the powers are to be exercised and by what criteria that would be decided. To take my Massachusetts example, when that kind of evolving situation is occurring, at what point, in what manner and by what procedure will Ministers take a decision to include or exclude those within that jurisdiction under Section 153 as a specified relationship? It may be that a full answer again cannot be given today, but the fullest possible answer should be given at some point while the Bill is in this House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="40517-42_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   I hope that the following explanation will help to answer the questions posed by the noble Lord, Lord Henley. I shall turn to the questions posed by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, in a moment.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The clause introduces Schedule 14, which lists the specified relationships that can be treated as civil partnerships if the other requirements of this chapter are met. Schedule 14 ensures transparency for the users of the legislation by providing certainty for individual couples, government departments and private-sector bodies, such as pension groups and employers, about whether a particular kind of overseas relationship may in principle be treated as a civil partnership. The clause also gives the Secretary of State power to amend Schedule 14&#151;referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Henley&#151;by secondary legislation, which this amendment seeks to remove.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>In order to ensure that the list of specified relationships keeps pace with the likely introduction of new kinds of same-sex partnerships or marriage in other countries in future, it is necessary to include such a power. The law in this area is developing quickly. It would not be practicable to use primary legislation for each amendment that may be needed to the schedule. The removal of a power to add to or to delete from the list risks the creation of legislation that is relevant for only a short period of time. We clearly need the flexibility in the Bill to take account of future changes around the world. As I said earlier, those changes are happening very rapidly.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>We recognise that an order made using this power, which would have the effect of removing or amending one of the specified relationships contained in the schedule, should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, and the clause provides accordingly. That is because such an order might involve a reduction in the scope of recognition of overseas relationships and might involve amending a provision approved by Parliament during the passage of the Bill. It is anticipated that the power would rarely be exercised in this way, but it is necessary in case a partnership scheme in another country were repealed or amended or a court judgment fundamentally <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC258"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column GC258</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

changed the nature of an overseas relationship in a way which made its treatment as a civil partnership in the UK inappropriate.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>However, it is not considered appropriate to require affirmative resolution for any exercise of the power that merely adds new foreign relationships to the list. Such additions would not raise any new issue of principle for Parliament to consider, but would simply be applying the approach taken by the Bill to new forms of relationship. The content of Schedule 14 already gives a good indication of the kinds of relationships that might be added in future. These are all relationships which are considered to meet the general conditions laid out in Clause 154, in that they all involve exclusive same-sex relationships that are registered, are of indeterminate duration and result in the parties being treated as a couple or as married. Requiring a debate on every such addition or amendment would be unduly onerous. Accordingly, an order of this kind would be subject to the negative resolution procedure.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Since recognition of foreign relationships is a devolved matter, I must add that the clause requires that any orders made must have the consent of the Scottish Ministers and the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland. I hope that, with that explanation, the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I will take a moment to answer one or two of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Lester. He asked why Schedule 14 does not include all the relationships outlined in the consultation document. Tables 1 and 2 of the consultation document <i>Civil Partnership</i> provided information about a wide range of partnership schemes in other countries for comparative purposes. We do not feel that it is appropriate for all these relationships to be listed in Schedule 14 of the Bill. In some cases this is because the overseas relationship in question does not meet one or more of the general conditions in Clause 154 that I spoke about; for example, because it does not involve registration of the partnership.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>In other cases it was decided not to include a relationship in Schedule 14 until further research had been completed. Officials continue to gather information on relationships in other countries and territories in order to determine whether they should be added to the list contained in Schedule 14. There will be a continual need to update this list as new kinds of relationships come into effect in other countries. Clause 153 of the Bill allows for the Schedule to be amended by subordinate legislation. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, referred to the Massachusetts case. As noble Lords will know, Massachusetts was not originally included in Schedule 14 because the relevant ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme Court in the Goodridge case allowed the legislature 180 days to implement the ruling opening marriage to same-sex couples.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Although it is the case that from today same-sex couples should be able to marry in Massachusetts, we know that legislators in the state are continuing, as the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC259"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column GC259</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

noble Lord, Lord Lester, has said, to attempt to overturn the court&#039;s decision by seeking to amend the state constitution to outlaw gay marriage. But we will obviously continue to await further developments on that particular state.
</p>

<a name="40517-42_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Lester, asked what criteria the Government would apply in deciding what to add to the list. The contents of Schedule 14 already provide a good indication of the kinds of relationships that might be added in future. These are all relationships that meet those general conditions. They are the key to the criteria&#151;the general conditions set out in Clause 154&#151;in that they all involve exclusive same-sex relationships that are registered, are of indeterminate duration and result in the parties being treated as a couple or as married. I hope that has answered the questions.

I wish to make clear that I was not demanding primary legislation to make amendments to Schedule 14. That would be ridiculous. What I was intrigued by was why subsection (2)(a) would be dealt with by negative order and paragraphs (b) and (c) by affirmative orders.
</p>

<a name="40517-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>Having said that I am not demanding primary legislation, I am also not pushing for affirmative regulations where they are inappropriate. Particularly those of us who have been Ministers know that Ministers often concede an affirmative order where originally a negative order has been proposed, because it often makes a nice little concession during the course of the passage of a Bill. As a result we often have slightly too many affirmative orders coming before the House. For example, a few years ago I remember a whole string of &quot;paralytic shellfish&quot; orders. I am sure that they were all the result of some hapless Minister&#151;it cannot have been me, because I was never in that department&#151;conceding some affirmative orders, just to make a problem go away. I am not seeking affirmative regulations just for the sake of it, but that procedure has been offered for subsections (2)(b) and (c) and not for paragraph (a).
</p>

<a name="40517-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>Obviously, it cannot be purely a question of the time needed to deal with these matters and the speed with which they can be processed, because, as the Minister made clear in Clause 153(3), consultations will take place with the Scotland Office and the Department of Finance and Personnel, which I take to relate to Northern Ireland. Therefore, matters cannot move ahead that quickly. Those consultations would take place, whether the matter relates to paragraphs (a), (b) or (c).
</p>

<a name="40517-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>Is it correct that the reason why it is proposed to leave paragraph (a) subject to negative resolution and paragraphs (b) and (c) affirmative, is that paragraph (a) simply relates to adding another country? So, if one looks at Schedule 14, at the bottom of that list, one could at some point add &quot;United States of America: Massachusetts&quot;&#151;although I am not clear exactly when that state would need to be added as we know <br>&nbsp;<br>

that something has happened today, but, given the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, further matters have to be dealt with by the Massachusetts legislature. One could go on adding countries to the list, as and when appropriate, simply by means of negative orders that would have to lie before the House for a number of days. However, paragraphs (b) and (c), which amend a description or omit a relationship, would still need affirmative regulations. I hope that the Minister can deal with that&#151;I might then be in a position to withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="40517-43_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   Before the noble Lord seeks to withdraw his amendment I should like to raise one or two points. First, I am satisfied by the Minister&#039;s explanation of the reasons for differentiating between the affirmative procedure and the negative procedure. That seems to be a coherent distinction.
</p>

<a name="40517-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I wonder whether I could ask the Minister to take the Massachusetts example to serve for all, because I am troubled by a kind of analogy. Some years ago, I introduced a Bill into the House because, under the Jewish religion, there was a curiosity about Orthodox marriages and Orthodox divorces that led to the so-called &quot;chained wives&quot; problem. According to one interpretation of the Book of Deuteronomy, unless there was writing by both, the unfortunate Jewish wife could not obtain a divorce. Luckily, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, and then the present Government came to the rescue, and we managed to free them. That was an example of a limping marriage. Here I am worried about an example of a limping non-recognition situation arising. Let me explain exactly what I mean.
</p>

<a name="40517-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Anyone of the same sex who &quot;marries&quot; today in Massachusetts has a valid marriage under Massachusetts law unless and until that is altered by the Massachusetts legislature by amendment to the constitution. As I understand it, that amendment cannot take place anyway, even if there were enough support for it, for two years. Let us assume that this Bill is enacted and brought into force in less than two years from now, which I would anticipate is the position. Let us assume that a couple have been &quot;married&quot; validly under the law of Massachusetts at the time this Bill comes into force but that the Massachusetts legislature is taking steps which may turn it into a civil partnership, or lawyers are brought in and horrible constitutional challenges are made on one side or the other which could go on for years and years. Meanwhile, the couple who have &quot;married&quot; want to come to this country and want to know whether they will be recognised if and when they come.
</p>

<a name="40517-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I take it that the fact that &quot;marrying&quot; would not be a disqualification under this provision or the schedule. In other words, I take it that there will not be a problem about labelling and the fact that it is called marriage, not a civil partnership or civil union. That seems to follow from what the Minister has said. It cannot make any difference to the substance of the matter. That is quite important.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC261"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column GC261</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40517-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>Secondly, I hope that there could be reassurance that when ministerial discretion is exercised by subordinate legislation to add, let us say, the Massachusetts relationship, Ministers will not be deterred by the prospect of some future change in Massachusetts law that attempts to be retrospective, or some future litigation which could, hypothetically, last for 10 years. Meanwhile, this ageing couple&#151;gay or lesbian partners&#151;are left in limbo while Ministers are deferring a decision. That is what I meant when I said that the general approach to the matter is important.
</p>

<a name="40517-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>I quite agree that one has to have this power, and it is a beneficent power. However, I suggest that it needs to be used and not deferred indefinitely in such a situation, as a matter of simple humanity for the couple. It may be that that long question cannot be answered today, but I think that it is very important and will need to be answered during the passage of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40517-43_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Alli: </b>   The Minister seemed to suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, that with regard to the Massachusetts case, whether or not they were added to the schedule was dependent on an assessment by Ministers about whether those marriages would remain legal after the action taken by the legislative body. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that that would be an unfortunate consequence; if such marriages are currently legal, I assume that we would recognise them as such. If they were deemed illegal or if the status were changed, we would then re-examine them at the point at which the status was changed as opposed to making an assessment of the outcome of the deliberations of a court or another sovereign body.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="40517-43_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   I shall first deal with the questions put by the noble Lord, Lord Lester. If Massachusetts is not listed right now, for whatever reason&#151;it could well be because of the complexity of the way in which the law is being studied by the legislature in that state and because of the outcome of any federal moves&#151;that does not necessarily prevent a couple being recognised because one then looks at the general conditions and compares them with the Massachusetts situation. Not being in Schedule 14 does not prevent a couple in a recognised partnership seeking to have their partnership recognised under the general conditions of Clause 154.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="40517-43_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Alli: </b>   I am confused because the noble Baroness qualified the first part of her answer by saying &quot;for whatever reason&quot; and giving as examples where there may be legal difficulties or where legal actions are taking place. Where my confusion lies is that I assume that if something is legal, as gay marriage is in Massachusetts from today, until it becomes illegal it should be treated as something that meets the criteria and should go in the list. I would assume that if it is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC262"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column GC262</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

challenged one would have to wait until the outcome of the challenge before Ministers could reassess, rather than forecasting the result of a challenge.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="40517-43_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Henley: </b>   Before the noble Baroness answers that question, I will add to the question that the noble Lord, Lord Alli, has been asking as I have got rather confused. I will use Massachusetts as an example, as it is in the news. If Ministers chose to add Massachusetts to the list, they will do that quite simply by the negative procedure. But if, in due course, Massachusetts is taken out of the list by the state itself, do Ministers then have to come back to Parliament and use the affirmative procedure to omit under subsection 2(c)?
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="40517-43_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   Yes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="40517-43_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill:  </b>  I think that the Minister was telling us that it is not crucial to fall within the specified relationship because of the general conditions. But I could be completely wrong. Clause 152 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;an overseas relationship is a relationship which . . . (a) is either a specified relationship or a relationship which meets the general conditions&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>so I agree that it can be one or the other. But then it says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;(b) is registered (whether before or after the passing of this Act) in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom, by two people . . . who under the relevant law are of the same sex at the time when they do so, and . . . neither of whom is already a civil partner or lawfully married&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>As I read that, one is eligible either if one falls with a country or territory that has been specified, or if one falls within the general conditions where the country has not been specified but one has to have been registered in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom at the relevant time. So the real question, to take the Massachusetts example, is whether the Government understand the reference in Clause 152(1)(b) to:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;is registered . . . in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>as applying to a gay or lesbian couple who register their marriage today in Massachusetts. If the answer to that is yes and that provided that they satisfy the general conditions they will be recognised, it matters a little less whether a country is in the list as it simply concerns a matter of simplicity. I would be very grateful for clarity on that.

<a name="40517-44_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   As we are talking about events that have happened today, obviously we are moving along cautiously. If the partnership is legal in Massachusetts, it is recognised as a civil partnership here if it meets the general conditions in Clause 154. I hope that that makes it clearer.

<p><a name="st_57"></a>

<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="40517-44_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Cameron of Lochbroom: </b>   Perhaps that could be clarified. I am slightly disturbed by the terms of Clause 154; it states that the general conditions are that, &quot;under the relevant law&quot;, all the particulars that follow have to be part of the law. It may be that in a particular jurisdiction, the general conditions are contained within the law but extend further. Can one make an exception by simply saying that the particular relationship would meet the general conditions? Or is the Minister saying that the relevant law has to contain all the conditions under Clause 154?
</p>

<a name="40517-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Clause 152 seems to be the sense of how this is dealt with. It is either a specified relationship as Parliament has said, which we recognise, or it is a relevant law in which the relationship that is to be accorded the right to be registered in that jurisdiction meets the general conditions as set out in Clause 154.
</p>

<a name="40517-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>I appreciate what the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said. He is referring to individual partners who may, within their own particular conditions, meet what is set out in Clause 154. But that does not appear to be enough as regards Clause 152. It requires that the registering jurisdiction has to be law, which simply complies with Clause 154. That is how I read it, but I may be wrong. I should be grateful if the Minister could express a view on that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40517-44_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   In that case, I do not know what that really means in practice. It seems that it is more complicated. When the Bill becomes law, if &quot;the relevant law&quot;, which is Massachusetts law, recognises that the couple have the capacity to enter into the relationship and at that date meet all the necessary requirements to ensure the formal validity of the relationship, on referring back to Clause 152(1)(b)(i)&#151;which states that two people,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;under the relevant law are of the same sex at the time when they do so, and      (ii) neither of whom is already a civil partner or lawfully married&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>the reference to &quot;relevant law&quot; does not seem to add any significant problem. The answers already given by the Minister will continue to apply. Any future change in the relevant law of a retrospective kind, whether by legislation or judicial interpretation, will not defeat the effect of the registration of the &quot;marriage&quot;. I hope that that also meets with the agreement of officials.

<p><a name="st_61"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked why we should not use the affirmative procedure in all cases. As a former member of the usual channels, the noble Lord will know that the business of the House would become extremely jammed and clogged up if, as we expect, we would need to use this provision on many occasions as the law develops rapidly around the world. We consider that it would be unduly onerous on the House to have to use that procedure in each case. For the noble Lord&#039;s information I add that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not raise any concerns about the level of parliamentary approval proposed.

I suggest that if I return to the matter at a later stage the noble Baroness will come up with a slightly better argument than merely clogging up the business.

(a)   the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each civil partner&#151;


(i)   has, or

including, in the case of earning capacity, any increase in that capacity which it would in the opinion of the court be reasonable to expect the civil partner to take steps to acquire;


(b)   the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each civil partner has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;


(c)   the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the civil partnership;

(3)   If the court decides to make&#151;


(a)   a periodical payments order, or


(b)   a secured periodical payments order,


in favour of one of the civil partners (&quot;A&quot;), it must in particular consider whether it would be appropriate to require the payments to be made or secured only for such term as would in its opinion be sufficient to enable A to adjust without undue hardship to the termination of A&#039;s financial dependence on the other civil partner.


(4)   If&#151;


(a)   on or after the making of a dissolution or nullity order, an application is made by one of the civil partners for a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order in that civil partner&#039;s favour, but

(2)   To the extent to which the Part 1 order is made having regard to any benefits under a pension arrangement, it may require the person responsible for the pension arrangement, if at any time any payment in respect of any benefits under the arrangement becomes due to the civil partner with pension rights, to make a payment for the benefit of the other civil partner.


(3)   The Part 1 order must express the amount of any payment required to be made by virtue of sub-paragraph (2) as a percentage of the payment which becomes due to the civil partner with pension rights.


(4)   Any such payment by the person responsible for the arrangement&#151;


(a)   discharges so much of his liability to the civil partner with pension rights as corresponds to the amount of the payment, and

(3)   If the person responsible for the pension arrangement has power to determine the person to whom the sum, or any part of it, is to be paid, the court may require him to pay the whole or part of that sum, when it becomes due, to the other civil partner.


(4)   If the civil partner with pension rights has power to nominate the person to whom the sum, or any part of it, is to be paid, the court may require the civil partner with pension rights to nominate the other civil partner in respect of the whole or part of that sum.

(5)   In any other case, the court may require the person responsible for the pension arrangement in question to pay the whole or part of that sum, when it becomes due, for the benefit of the other civil partner instead of to the person to whom, apart from the order, it would be paid.


(6)   Any payment by the person responsible for the arrangement under an order made under Part 1 made by virtue of this paragraph discharges so much of his liability in respect of the civil partner with pension rights as corresponds to the amount of the payment.


(7)   The powers conferred by this paragraph may not be exercised in relation to a pension arrangement which&#151;


(a)   is the subject of a pension sharing order in relation to the civil partnership, or

(6)   A periodical payments order in favour of a child, regardless of anything in the order, ceases to have effect on the death of the person liable to make payments under the order, except in relation to any arrears due under the order on the date of the death.


(7)   If&#151;


(a)   a maintenance calculation (&quot;the current calculation&quot;) is in force with respect to a child, and


(b)   an application is made under this Schedule for a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order in favour of that child before the end of 6 months beginning with the making of the current calculation,


the term to be specified in any such order made on that application may be expressed to begin on, or at any time after, the earliest permitted date.


(8)   &quot;The earliest permitted date&quot; is whichever is the later of&#151;


(a)   the date 6 months before the application is made, or


(b)   the date on which the current calculation took effect or, where successive maintenance calculations have been continuously in force with respect to a child, on which the first of those calculations took effect.

(2)   No variation of a pension sharing order is to be made so as to take effect before the order is made final.


(3)   The variation of a pension sharing order prevents the order taking effect before the end of such period after the making of the variation as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Lord Chancellor.


(4)   The power to make regulations under sub-paragraph (3) is exercisable by statutory rule for the purposes of the Statutory Rules (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 (S.I. 1979/1573 (N.I. 12)).

43   (1)   No property adjustment order or pension sharing order may be made on an application for the variation of a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order made (whether in favour of a civil partner or in favour of a child of the family) under Part 1.


(2)   No order for the payment of a lump sum may be made on an application for the variation of a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order in favour of a civil partner (whether made under Part 1 or 7).

44   (1)   In exercising the powers conferred by this Part the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case, giving first consideration to the welfare, while under 18, of any child of the family who has not reached 18.


(2)   The circumstances of the case include, in particular, any change in any of the matters to which the court was required to have regard when making the order to which the application relates.


(3)   Sub-paragraph (4) applies in the case of&#151;


(a)   a periodical payments order, or


(b)   a secured periodical payments order,


made on or after the making of a dissolution or nullity order.


(4)   The court must consider whether in all the circumstances, and after having regard to any such change, it would be appropriate to vary the order so that payments under the order are required&#151;


(a)   to be made, or


(b)   to be secured,


only for such further period as will in the opinion of the court be sufficient to enable the civil partner in whose favour the order was made to adjust without undue hardship to the termination of those payments.


(5)   If the civil partner against whom the order was made has died, the circumstances of the case also include the changed circumstances resulting from that civil partner&#039;s death.

(b)   the personal representatives of the deceased person.


(3)   No such application may be made without the leave of the court after the end of 6 months from the date on which representation in regard to the estate of that person is first taken out.


(4)   The personal representatives of the person who has died are not liable for having distributed any part of the estate of the deceased after the end of the 6 month period on the ground that they ought to have taken into account the possibility that the court might allow an application under this paragraph to be made after that period by the person entitled to payments under the order.


(5)   Sub-paragraph (4) does not affect any power to recover any part of the estate so distributed arising by virtue of the making of an order in pursuance of this paragraph.


(6)   In considering for the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) the question when representation was first taken out a grant limited to part of the estate is to be disregarded unless a grant limited to the remainder of the estate has previously been made or is made at the same time.

(a)   the death of either of the parties to the agreement, or


(b)   the formation of a subsequent civil partnership or marriage by the party to whom the payments are to be made.


(3)   The limits if the payments are to be secured are&#151;


(a)   the death of the party to whom the payments are to be made, or


(b)   the formation of a subsequent civil partnership or marriage by that party.

(b)   increasing the rate of the periodical payments which the agreement provides shall be made or secured by one of the parties for the maintenance of such a child.


(5)   The court, in deciding the term for which under the agreement as altered by the order the payments, or the additional payments attributable to the increase, are to be made or secured for the benefit of the child, must apply paragraph 36(2) to (5) (age limits) as if the order in question were a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order in favour of the child.

it may make such order as it thinks fit for restraining B from doing so or otherwise for protecting the claim.


(3)   If the court is satisfied, on an application by A, that&#151;


(a)   B has, with the intention of defeating A&#039;s claim for financial relief, made a reviewable disposition, and

it may make an order setting aside the disposition.


(4)   If the court is satisfied, on an application by A in a case where an order has been obtained by A against B under any of the provisions mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), that B has, with the intention of defeating A&#039;s claim for financial relief, made a reviewable disposition, it may make an order setting aside the disposition.


(5)   An application for the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) must be made in the proceedings for the financial relief in question.


(6)   If the court makes an order under sub-paragraph (3) or (4) setting aside a disposition it must give such consequential directions as it thinks fit for giving effect to the order (including directions requiring the making of any payments or the disposal of any property).

(3)   Any disposition made by B (whether before or after the commencement of the proceedings for financial relief) is a reviewable disposition for the purposes of paragraph 59(3) and (4) unless it was made&#151;


(a)   for valuable consideration (other than formation of a civil partnership), and


(b)   to a person who, at the time of the disposition, acted in relation to it in good faith and without notice of any intention on B&#039;s part to defeat A&#039;s claim for financial relief.


(4)   If an application is made under paragraph 59 with respect to a disposition which took place less than 3 years before the date of the application or with respect to a disposition or other dealing with property which is about to take place and the court is satisfied&#151;


(a)   in a case falling within paragraph 59(2) or (3), that the disposition or other dealing would (apart from paragraph 59) have the consequence of defeating A&#039;s claim for financial relief, or


(b)   in a case falling within paragraph 59(4), that the disposition has had the consequence of defeating A&#039;s claim for financial relief,


it is presumed, unless the contrary is shown, that the person who disposed of or is about to dispose of or deal with the property did so or, as the case may be, is about to do so, with the intention of defeating A&#039;s claim for financial relief.


61   (1)   An order under paragraph 59(2), to the extent that it restrains B from making a disposition of any land in Northern Ireland which is specified in the order&#151;

(b)   subject to section 88 of the 1970 Act (statutory charge to be void against purchaser in certain circumstances), renders liable to be set aside by the court at the instance of A any disposition of the land in contravention of the order.


(2)   In this paragraph and paragraph 62&#151;


&quot;disposition&quot; has the same meaning as in paragraphs 59 and 60;


&quot;1970 Act&quot; means the Land Registration Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 (c. 18 (N.I.));


&quot;statutory charge&quot; has the same meaning as in the 1970 Act.


(3)   Nothing in sub-paragraph (1)(b) or section 88(1) of the 1970 Act affects any power of the court to set aside a disposition under paragraph 59(3) or (4).


62   (1)   The registration of a statutory charge created under paragraph 61(1)(a) shall be effective until&#151;


(a)   the expiration of 1 year from the date of its registration or of the last renewal of its registration, unless the registration is renewed or further renewed before the expiration of that period, or


(b)   the court orders that it is to cease to have effect.

64      The fact that&#151;

(b)   a transfer of property,


had to be made in order to comply with a property adjustment order does not prevent the settlement or transfer from being a transaction in respect of which an order may be made under Article 312 or 313 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (S.I. 1989/2405 (N.I. 19)) (transfers at an undervalue and preferences).

to a civil partner, and


(b)   the court is satisfied that the person in whose favour the order is made is incapable, because of mental disorder, of managing and administering his or her property and affairs.


(2)   &quot;Mental disorder&quot; has the same meaning as in the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 (S.I. 1986/595 (N.I. 4)).


(3)   Subject to any order, direction or authority made or given in relation to that person under Part 8 of the 1986 Order, the court may order the payments to be made, or as the case may be, the property to be transferred, to such persons having charge of that person as the court may direct.

(2)   If the pension sharing order relates to a person&#039;s rights under a pension arrangement, the appeal court may not set aside or vary the order if the person responsible for the pension arrangement has acted to his detriment in reliance on the order taking effect.


(3)   If the pension sharing order relates to a person&#039;s shareable state scheme rights, the appeal court may not set aside or vary the order if the Department for Social Development has acted to its detriment in reliance on the taking effect of the order.


(4)   In determining for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) or (3) whether a person or the Department has acted to his or its detriment in reliance on the taking effect of the order, the appeal court may disregard any detriment which in its opinion is insignificant.


(5)   Where sub-paragraph (2) or (3) applies, the appeal court may make such further orders (including one or more pension sharing orders) as it thinks fit for the purpose of putting the parties in the position it considers appropriate.


(6)   Paragraph 14 only applies to a pension sharing order under this paragraph if the decision of the appeal court can itself be the subject of an appeal.

<a name="40517-45_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Henley: </b>   I understand that this is to be the last Question that we shall deal with today before we move to social security matters next week. As it is the last Question, I apologise to the Committee for speaking at this late hour and assure the noble Baroness that I will be brief.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The clause concerns the public policy exception and provides that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;Two people are not to be treated as having formed a civil partnership as a result of having entered into an overseas relationship if it would be manifestly contrary to public policy to recognise the capacity, under the relevant law, of one or both of them to enter into the relationship&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40517-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>I am simply curious what situations the clause would cover and what the Government envisage would happen if such an event took place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="40517-45_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My understanding is that this is equivalent to the public policy exception for a marriage, especially foreign marriage, and does not add more than that. It is obviously necessary in very exceptional cases for there to be such an exception.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="40517-45_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   Perhaps I may assist the noble Lord, Lord Henley, by setting out where we see the clause appertaining. The clause provides that an overseas relationship cannot be treated as a civil partnership if it is manifestly contrary to public policy to recognise the capacity of either or both parties to enter into the relationship. The exception applies only to the capacity of the parties to enter into the relationship&#151;known in legal terms as essential validity. It does not affect the procedures for registering the overseas relationship&#151;known in legal terms as formal validity&#151;which will be governed solely by the law of the overseas country or territory.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Wherever possible, we have aimed to ensure that the Bill provides certainty about which overseas relationships are treated as civil partnerships in the UK. For example, there are provisions in this chapter which ensure that no overseas relationship can be treated as a civil partnership if the parties are not of the same sex, or if either of them is already a civil partner or lawfully married.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>However, there are also other areas where we cannot guarantee that other countries&#039; rules will always exactly match those applying in the UK. For example, other countries may have slightly different approaches to prohibited degrees than is the case in the UK, or may have different rules as to mental capacity. These are aspects of detail where different jurisdictions may legitimately have different views. Where neither of the parties was domiciled in the UK, a degree of flexibility is appropriate when considering whether compliance with UK rules is required before the overseas relationship can be treated as a civil partnership here.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>The appropriate means of ensuring such flexibility is a public policy exception, similar to that which the courts have developed for equivalent issues in relation <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC333"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column GC333</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to overseas marriages. Such an exception enables the courts to decide that it is contrary to public policy to give effect to a capacity which exists under the relevant foreign law.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>The definition of when it would be manifestly contrary to public policy to recognise a capacity that exists under the relevant law is clearly something that the courts are best placed to determine. In doing so, they would no doubt apply a similar approach to that which has been taken to similar issues in marriage cases. We are satisfied that the clause gives the courts sufficient power to ensure that, for example, we do not find ourselves treating as civil partnerships overseas relationships between close relatives or people significantly under the age of 16.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="40517-45_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Henley: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, for answering, and also for the support that he got from the Minister.

<a name="wms_subhd_0"></a>
<a name="40517-45_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Palestinian Authority: Support</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="40517-45_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following statement.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>I am today announcing a &#163;7 million initial UK contribution to the World Bank&#039;s Public Financial Management Reform Trust Fund to support the Palestinian Authority.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The Palestinian Authority has been in fiscal crisis since late 2000. Lack of revenues due to economic collapse prevents it delivering services effectively to the Palestinian people. In 2004 its total budget is 1.45 billion dollars. Revenues are expected to be 800 million dollars, leaving a financing gap of about 650 million dollars. Donor budget support in 2003 was 270 million dollars, a sharp fall from 2001 and 2002. The PA has large and growing debts to the private sector and commercial banks. This is an unsustainable situation, and a continued fiscal crisis could lead to the termination of social and administrative services to the population, and poverty (already at over 60 per cent) increasing further.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>At a meeting of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee in December 2003, attended by the Palestinian Authority (PA), Israel, major donors to the PA and other Arab countries, the PA asked the World Bank to create a new mechanism through which donors could provide pooled contributions to support the PA&#039;s budget. The Public Financial Management Reform Trust Fund was approved by the World Bank&#039;s board on 22 April and launched on 27 April. The objectives of the Reform Fund are to mobilise additional donor resources in support of the PA budget, to harmonise donor assistance in exchange for a commonly agreed reform programme, and to simplify procedures for the PA. Use of direct budget support also reflects World Bank analysis that this is the most efficient of all the emergency assistance instruments currently employed by donors, with substantial macroeconomic and welfare benefits.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>An important precondition for creation of the Reform Fund was a satisfactory assessment of the current financial management procedures of the PA. The World Bank has carried out a detailed Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), which found that major and highly creditable improvements in budgeting and fiscal transparency have been introduced during the tenure of the present Palestinian Finance Minister. Weaknesses in financial accountability remain, related in particular to the lack of adequate public financial statements, inadequate auditing and the undeveloped oversight role of the Palestinian Legislative Council. But the CFAA confirms that the current systems are adequate to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS18"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column WS18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

justify World Bank budget support. It also identifies key actions needed to further improve the systems, and these have now been agreed with the PA as performance benchmarks for the Reform Fund. Disbursement of funding will be conditional on achievement of reform benchmarks. This is an approach successfully used by the EC in its recent bilateral provision of budget support to the PA.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>The use of donor funds provided to the PA through the Reform Fund will be carefully monitored. Prior conditions for the first disbursement, such as passage of a 2004 Budget Law, and the payment of all security personnel salaries by direct bank transfer, have already been met. Funding will be disbursed in six-month tranches depending on progress with further reforms, such as revised external audit arrangements, containment of the wage bill, maintaining a minimum level of social sector expenditure, and full control of the Ministry of Finance over all PA procurement. World Bank staff will monitor the implementation of the benchmarked actions on a regular basis. Every quarter, the PA will prepare a progress report. Using these reports, the bank will lead quarterly technical and fiduciary supervision missions to review compliance with agreed prior actions and benchmarks, budget implementation and general economic and social developments. DfID will participate in these missions.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>In the event of the PA not meeting all benchmarks, the World Bank would assess the specific situation and consult contributing donors on whether a waiver were appropriate. Should no waiver be granted, the release of the next tranche of funding would be held back pending fulfilment of the benchmarks. The World Bank could also, in consultation with contributing donors, suspend disbursements if the PA reversed already implemented policy actions, until remedial action were taken. Donors have the option of bilaterally withdrawing their money from the Reform Fund at any time.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>In addition to the PA&#039;s own external auditing arrangements, an external auditor contracted by the World Bank will perform annual audits of the Reform Fund&#039;s deposit account at the PA Ministry of Finance. These audits will verify the extent to which the World Bank&#039;s requirements under the grant agreement are being met, and whether the PA&#039;s procedures are adequate to achieve this result.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>We expect several donors to contribute to the Reform Fund. Norway and Canada have already decided to do so. Other countries are considering contributions. The World Bank plans to contribute 20 million dollars of its own alongside the fund. The EC has been providing budget support to the PA since 2000, and is likely to continue doing so. The IMF is involved in a technical capacity. The USA has been actively involved in the design of the fund, and will participate in its management. The G8 has urged the international community to increase and accelerate their assistance provided to the PA. We and other contributors will be urging other donors to give money to the Reform Fund. Arab states continue to be the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS19"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column WS19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

biggest supporters of the PA&#039;s budget, although some may prefer to contribute outside the Reform Fund.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>DfID has thoroughly appraised a UK contribution to the Reform Fund, in line with our published policy on the provision of direct budget support. This policy reflects our commitments under government acounting that aid should be properly accounted for, used for the intended purposes and represent value for money. When appraising budget support, we ensure the following: first, that a thorough evaluation of public financial management and accountability systems, and associated risks, has been carried out; secondly, that the recipient government have a credible programme to improve standards of these systems; thirdly, that the potential developmental benefits justify the risk, taking account of any safeguards that can be put in place to buttress and develop these systems; and fourthly, that these assessments are explicitly recorded as part of the decisionmaking process to provide assistance. In the case of the Palestinian Authority, we share the World Bank&#039;s assessment that there is a significant fiduciary risk, but that a satisfactory programme of reforms is in place to reduce this risk. This level of risk is not unusual in countries where DfID provides budget support. I have judged that the developmental benefits of providing budget support, and the risks of not providing it, justify this fiduciary risk.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>In making this judgment I have also looked at the impact on poverty of PA spending. The PA does not have an internationally recognised poverty reduction strategy. But it has started to develop short-term planning frameworks to guide its own prioritisation. I share the judgment made by the International Development Committee in its report in February that, although unusual, given the current state of the Palestinian economy, &quot;wage payment maintained by budget support is an effective method of emergency poverty alleviation&quot;. The PA Ministry of Planning is beginning to develop a more comprehensive approach to poverty reduction. DfID will work with other donors to help them do this, alongside the provision of budget support.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>I have of course considered the many allegations made against the PA about diversion of funds. In particular, there have been accusations that budget support previously provided by the European Commission was used to finance terrorist activities. An EU independent anti-fraud investigation into these allegations has been going on for over a year and has not yet concluded. An inquiry by a European Parliament Working Group on Budgetary Assistance to the Palestinian Authority reported in March 2004, after a one-year investigation. The majority report concluded that, &quot;there is no conclusive evidence, to date, that the EU non-targeted Direct Budgetary support was used to finance illegal activities, including the financing of terrorism&quot;, and that, &quot;there is no evidence that EU budget support has not been fully transferred into the PA budget or that it was used outside the budget&quot;. It further concluded that budget <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS20"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column WS20</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

support had, &quot;contributed to bring about concrete changes in the PA financial system and impacted on the PA reform process towards more transparency, accountability and good governance&quot;. Recommendations from the report have largely been addressed in the design of the World Bank Reform Fund, notably that, &quot;future budget support should be accompanied by clear, specific conditionalities subject to strict monitoring&quot; and that &quot;such conditionalities should be established in full co-operation and in close co-ordination with the other international donors&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>It has been suggested that aid to the PA should be conditional on progress with security sector reform, and other measures to reduce terrorism against Israeli citizens, such as action against incitement. We agree with the World Bank and other donors that at this stage it will be more effective to link disbursement of budget support to conditions related to financial management, budget allocation and accountability. The Government have made action on Palestinian security their highest diplomatic priority in our relations with the PA. We are also providing practical assistance to help them to take this action. Particularly under current circumstances, we do not think an underfunded PA which risks not being able to pay salaries is in the interests of Israeli security. We have informed the Government of Israel of our decision to contribute. The Israeli Government have told us that they welcome international humanitarian and economic assistance to the Palestinians and support the World Bank Reform Fund, provided the money is properly spent and monitored.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>Contributing to the PA&#039;s budget is in line with the Government&#039;s strategy for supporting Palestinians. Our new Palestinian Country Assistance Plan says we will work with partners to help to end conflict and create a viable Palestinian state that will reduce poverty. The strategy has three aims: prospects for peace enhanced; more effective, accountable and inclusive Palestinian institutions and governance systems; and humanitarian and development assistance delivered more effectively. Contributing to the Reform Fund will address all three outcomes. It will also address the Government&#039;s wider political objectives on the Middle East peace process, by helping the PA to meet its roadmap commitments. Our initial contribution to the Reform Fund is for 2004. We will consider later this year, in light of monitoring of the PA&#039;s use of donor funds and its likely financing gap and spending plans for 2005, whether we should continue contributing.
</p>

<a name="40517-45_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>I am placing in the Library of the House the World Bank&#039;s board paper describing the rationale for, and operational arrangements of, the Reform Fund, which includes as an annex the Palestinian Authority&#039;s Statement of Development Policy and a matrix of further reform actions the PA is undertaking. I am also placing in the Library of the House copies of the finalised Palestinian Country Assistance Plan.

<a name="40517-46_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Draft Criminal Defence Service Bill</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="40517-46_spmin0"></a><b>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </b>  I am pleased to announce the publication today of a draft Criminal Defence Service Bill together with a consultation paper seeking views on a number of possible models for the delivery of a restructured criminal legal aid scheme. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

</p>

<a name="40517-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>It has been the shared belief of this Government and previous administrations that those found guilty of offences who can afford to pay their defence costs should be required to do so. This is right in principle and will ensure and that a greater amount of finite legal aid funds can be targeted at the poor, the vulnerable and the victimised in line with the commitments set out in the DCA manifesto by the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs.
</p>

<a name="40517-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>The Draft Bill contains two key proposals: the reintroduction of a financial eligibility (means) test; and the transfer of the authority to grant the right to publicly funded representation away from the courts and into the scope of the Legal Services Commission.
</p>

<a name="40517-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>My department believes that, taken together, these two measures will bring a greater level of consistency and better control over grant as well as ensuring that those found guilty of offences pay where they are able to do so.
</p>

<a name="40517-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>The accompanying consultation paper discusses in more detail, and invites comments on, the implications of these changes as well as outlining a number of ways in which they might work in practice. The paper will be sent to the key opinion formers within the legal community including the professions and the judiciary and will be published on the DCA&#039;s website at www.dca.gov.uk/. Responses are requested by 6 August.
</p>

<a name="40517-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The Bill itself will also be simultaneously examined by the Constitutional Affairs Committee as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny procedure and interested parties will have an opportunity to comment as part of that process.

also recommends a pay increase of 3.225 per cent for medical and dental cadets and an out-of-hours supplementary payment of &#163;4,500 to junior doctors. In addition, the review body recommends that there should be an increase of 3.225 per cent in the values of trainer pay and distinction awards.
</p>

<a name="40517-46_para7"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>The Chief Secretary and I have today presented to Parliament this year&#039;s spring departmental report for HM Customs and Excise (Cm 6224).
</p>

<a name="40517-46_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>The spring report provides an interim update on Customs&#039; activities and sets out the department&#039;s priorities and expenditure plans for the coming year. This year it confirms strong growth in VAT receipts, which are more than &#163;2.5 billion ahead of the Budget 2003 forecast&#151;including an estimated &#163;1 billion from our crackdown on &quot;Missing Trader&quot; VAT fraud. It reports continued success in tackling tobacco smuggling, and over &#163;30 million of criminal assets seized. The spring report also outlines the major changes facing the department following the announcement of plans to create a Serious Organised Crime Agency and a single revenue department&#151;Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs.
</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>Alongside this update, the spring report marks a change in policy in relation to the publication of statistics of Customs&#039; seizures. I have decided that Customs will include in its annual and spring reports summary seizure data in relation to those prohibitions and restrictions that it enforces at the frontier but which are not already included in the reports as part of updates on PSA priorities. Customs has not published this information in its annual reports since reporting was streamlined after 1999, but will do so in each spring and annual report from now on.

<a name="40517-46_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>There has been continuing interest in the number of seizures Customs makes in the areas where it protects society, including particular interest in Customs&#039; new anti-smuggling role on imported meat and other products of animal origin. Customs will therefore publish seizure information on:

</p>

<a name="40517-46_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>Customs will continue to consider requests for further information in accordance with the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. It will only withhold information under exemption 4 (Law enforcement and legal proceedings) or exemption 7 (Effective management and operations of public service) of that code where information would be of value to those who seek to circumvent Customs controls or in the clearest cases of risk to the effective management of its operations.

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="40517-46_spmin3"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  The voluntary code of practice for retention of communications data under Part II of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 came into force on 5 December 2003, pursuant to the Retention of Communications Data (Code of Practice) Order 2003 (SI 2003/No. 3175). Paragraph 33 of the code requires that its effectiveness would be assessed, against criteria identified in the code, three months from the date it received parliamentary approval.

</p>

<a name="40517-46_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>The voluntary scheme is working in the sense that there are a number of communications service providers that have volunteered, or are volunteering, to retain communications data in line with the code. However most of these volunteers need to prepare themselves, in technical terms, to be able to do so. Consequently it is still premature to evaluate whether investigative work has been facilitated by the voluntary retention of communications data in line with the code or to determine what data has been acquired by investigators that was available only because of its voluntary retention in line with the code.

<a name="40517-46_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>Although communications service providers are volunteering to retain data in order to support the important task of safeguarding of national security, service providers are sensitive to any commercial impact from being identified as volunteers. The Government shall not be identifying providers that have volunteered or are indicating a likelihood of volunteering. Equally there are no indications that sectors of the industry, which have not adopted the code of practice, are enjoying an unfair commercial advantage.
</p>

<a name="40517-46_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>We do not believe, at this time, that identifying the volunteers&#039; precise share of the communications service market is helpful, since it could enable deductions to be made, accurately or inaccurately, about which providers have volunteered. However the Government are confident that a significant proportion of communications data is being retained in line with the code.
</p>

<a name="40517-46_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>Once the volunteers are able to indicate that they are retaining data in line with the code, it will be possible to conduct a more thorough evaluation of the effectiveness of the code.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>The Government are keeping the issue of retention of communications data under review in the context of the recommendations of Lord Newton&#039;s committee, which reviewed the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, and the declaration of European Council on 25 March 2004 that proposals for establishing rules on the retention of communications traffic data be examined by the Council with a view to their adoption by June 2005.
</p>

<a name="40517-46_para31"></a>

<a name="40517-47_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Fraud Law Reform</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="40517-47_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   It is estimated that fraud currently costs the UK economy &#163;14 billion a year. To equip law enforcement agencies to tackle the threat we face from fraud, the existing law needs to be modernised. The main problem is that the existing statutes focus on very specific types of fraudulent behaviour, so they do not effectively cover all the potential varieties of fraud and cannot keep pace with rapidly developing technology.
</p>

<a name="40517-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>The Government are today publishing a consultation paper on fraud law reform. Its proposals are based on those made by the Law Commission in 2002, following a reference made to them in 1998 by the then Home Secretary. In particular he asked the Law Commission to consider whether a general offence of fraud would improve the criminal law. The commission concluded that it would help to make the law simpler and more easily understandable for juries, defendants and the general public and make the prosecution process more efficient and effective.
</p>

<a name="40517-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a>The central proposal is that there should be a general offence of fraud which can be committed in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS25"></a>

<b>17 May 2004 : Column WS25</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

three different ways: by false representation, by wrongfully failing to disclose information or by abuse of position. In each case the behaviour must be dishonest, and must intend to make a gain for the defendant or cause a loss to another. However the gain does not actually have to be obtained, as it does under the existing statutory offences.
</p>

<a name="40517-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a>We also propose a new offence of &quot;obtaining services dishonestly&quot;, to close a current loophole regarding fraudulent use of machines. The current offence of obtaining services by deception does not cover, for example, giving false details to access data from the internet for which a charge is made. This is because a machine has no mind and so cannot be &quot;deceived&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40517-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a>The consultation paper also seeks views on whether all behaviour which is currently prosecuted as conspiracy to defraud can be prosecuted under the proposed new law of fraud (or under other existing law) so that the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud can be repealed. It also seeks views on the possible extension of the existing offence of fraudulent trading, and on the creation of a new offence of possessing equipment to commit fraud. The proposals will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="40517-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a>This legislative reform is only part of a wider set of current initiatives which will help tackle fraud. For their part the Government have:
</p>

<a name="40517-47_para5"></a>
<p>set up the Assets Recovery Agency and implemented the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. These will take the profit out of crime by increasing powers to find and recover money from those who benefit from and launder the proceeds of frauds and other crimes;
</p>

<a name="40517-47_para6"></a>
<p>agreed extra resources for the Serious Fraud Office and City of London Police to tackle fraud;
</p>

<a name="40517-47_para7"></a>
<p>included new procedures to deal with multiple offending in the current Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill;
</p>

<a name="40517-47_para8"></a>
<p>included proposals to ensure effective incentives for criminals who give evidence against their associates, which will help in fraud cases, in the White Paper <i>One Step Ahead</i>, published on 29 March 2004;
</p>

<a name="40517-47_para9"></a>
<p>proposed new methods of tackling identity fraud in the White Paper on <i>Legislation on Identity Cards</i>, published on 26 April 2004. The introduction of identity cards incorporating biometrics (such as finger or iris scans) will help people to identify themselves uniquely and protect their identity against fraud.
</p>

<a name="40517-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a>Combating fraud requires vigilance from all and we very much welcome the measures that financial institutions and the retail industry have taken to protect credit cards by a chip-and-PIN system. That step has been found to cut card fraud dramatically in other countries.

The arms embargo against Iraq remains in place under United Nations Security Council resolution 1483 (2003), with the exception of &quot;arms and other related material required by the (Coalition Provisional) Authority to serve the purposes of this and other related resolutions&quot;. As this includes promoting the development of free and fair media, Her Majesty&#039;s Government consider it appropriate to grant exemptions for the export of armoured vehicles for use by media organisations working in Iraq. Her Majesty&#039;s Government have included conditions for these licences, including a limit to the quantities. The export is consistent with the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. Future applications will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis against the UN Embargo and Consolidated Criteria, taking into account the circumstances prevailing at the time.
