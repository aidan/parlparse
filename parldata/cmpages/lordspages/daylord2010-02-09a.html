That view is shared by the United Nations. The camp leadership have been given that information. As for the inquiry into the violence that occurred in July, we asked for a review of the events that took place. The ambassador met the Minister responsible on 27 January and reminded him of the need to send a copy of the report. We are still waiting to receive it.

These include limitations on fishing effort, improving gear selectivity and closures that protect spawning and undersized fish. The UK has also committed, with Denmark and Germany, to trial a catch quota management system. Through the review of the common fisheries policy, we are working towards a European discard policy that applies to all member states, regardless of where they fish.</p>

The Secretary of State for the Environment called last month for a ban on waste food, yet he is responsible for discards whereby we throw away a quarter of our most precious species. Is that not obscene, and should not the UK Government insist, in relation to the common fisheries policy, that like Canada, Norway, Iceland and New Zealand, we should have a ban on discards?

The issue is exacerbated by the developments in gear which have led to the catching of a greater amount of fish of the wrong kind as far as the fishing boat is concerned. However, we are making progress and have almost halved the tonnage of discards in the past 10 years.

Funding through the economic, social sciences, arts and humanities research councils combined is due to rise to £286 million in 2010-11. The Higher Education Funding Council for England's research allocations for social sciences and humanities for 2009-10 total £517 million, and we are maintaining research funding to HEFCE in 2010-11.</p>

More than 50 per cent of overseas students are drawn to study here by the excellence of teaching and research. From the figures that he has already produced, perhaps the Minister could clarify the latest figures given by Mr David Lammy on 20 January.

We do not think that we are putting those subjects at risk. Clearly, there is a balance to be struck. The share of funding for non-STEM subjects did not decline. In fact, funding for non-STEM subjects increased, although not as much as it would have done. Again, I stress the need for a balance. We need also to protect STEM from a decline in funding to get us out of the downturn and to equip our next generation with the skills to compete in global, high-skilled knowledge-based economies, and I make no apologies for that. Anyway, the two groups are complementary.</p>

Given the Government's rather dubious criteria of functionality to render educational research worthwhile, is he aware that recent evidence suggests that for every £1 invested in humanities research, a return of some £10 is made to the economy? Thus, even on the Government's own criteria of the value of educational research, ring-fencing it for the future would be justified.</p>

The <I>Guardian</I> report clearly illustrates the culture of impunity among some staff in the UK Border Agency. Will the Minister revisit the decisions taken by the agency in relation to asylum seekers who have been deported to ensure that racism played no part whatsoever, and will he ensure that the inquiry looks at the wider aspects of race relations in the agency?</p>

We do not know that. We know that an allegation has been made that will be seriously investigated independent of the department and separate from the Cardiff office. People have been accused of things for which they have not yet been found guilty. If there is guilt to apportion, it will mean that lessons have to be learnt. The noble Lord's latter point of ensuring that there have been no deportations as a result of racism is important. The removal stage is reached only after consideration by the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. I am confident that the inquiry will find a solution to the problem and verify whether the allegations are correct. However, at this point I think we should work on the old premise that people are innocent until proven guilty.</p>

<a name="10020975000078"></a><b><a name="100209-0002.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="10020975000419"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b>My Lords, the Terrorist Asset-Freezing (Temporary Provisions) Bill makes provision for the temporary validity of Orders in Council that impose financial restrictions on, and in relation to, persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activity, and for connected purposes.</p>

<a name="100209-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="10020975000079"></a>The whole House will, I know, understand that terrorism continues to pose a threat to the UK. The Home Secretary recently raised the UK terrorist threat level to "severe", meaning that an attack on the UK is highly likely at any time. As noble Lords know, terrorist organisations including al-Qaeda have executed or planned a succession of attacks with the aim of causing mass casualties. Measures to prevent terrorist finance are at the heart of the international effort against terrorism. Without resources, terror networks are unable to plan, to organise or to execute attacks. For this reason, the United Nations requires that all states freeze, without delay, the assets and resources of people who commit, attempt to commit, participate in or facilitate the commission of terrorist acts. Our tools to combat terrorist finance therefore, have become an important part of the UK's counterterrorist strategy. Our measures must be proportionate but they must also be robust and effective. Terrorist attacks are not expensive, and even small amounts of money in the wrong hands can cause devastation. The attacks in London on 7 July 2005 cost the perpetrators just £8,000.</p>

<a name="100209-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="10020975000080"></a>While financial sanctions have a long history, their use against terrorists is only around a decade old. The UN Security Council established an asset-freezing regime against the Taliban in 1999. It was quickly extended to include Osama bin Laden and persons associated with al-Qaeda. In the weeks after 9 September 2001, the UN created a separate requirement on member states to freeze the assets of those involved in terrorism more generally, where those individuals were identified by member states. The UK acted quickly; using secondary legislation under the United Nations Act, we were able to ensure that our freezing regime was in place by 10 October 2001, only 12 days after the UN Security Council passed the resolution.</p>

<a name="100209-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="10020975000081"></a>Some people have asked why we used secondary legislation under the UN Act in the first place rather than putting our regime into primary legislation. The answer is that in good faith we believed that the  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_613"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 613</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>United Nations Act was the right legal base. Section 1 of the United Nations Act has been used since 1946 as an established basis for successive Governments to implement our UN obligations on matters concerning threats to international peace and security. Section 1 of the UN Act says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="10020975000287"></a>"If, under Article forty-one of the Charter of the United Nations, the Security Council of the United Nations call upon His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to apply any measures to give effect to any decision of that Council, His Majesty may by Order in Council make such provision as appears to Him necessary or expedient for enabling those measures to be effectively applied".</p>

<a name="100209-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="10020975000082"></a>Given that there are clear UN Security Council obligations to freeze the assets of terrorists, the Government believed that the UN Act gave them legitimate authority to make secondary legislation to freeze terrorist assets. The Court of Appeal upheld the Government's position. The Supreme Court decided on 27 January 2010 that the United Nations Act does not go so far as to give us that authority and that the Orders in Council we have used were therefore not validly made.</p>

<a name="100209-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="10020975000083"></a>However, I hope noble Lords will appreciate that until the Supreme Court made its judgment, the correct interpretation of the United Nations Act was unclear. The Government acted in good faith when using it as the basis for implementing UN asset-freezing obligations.</p>

<a name="100209-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="10020975000084"></a>The Supreme Court ruled that the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 were beyond the scope of the power provided by Section 1 of the United Nations Act 1946, and quashed both orders. On 4 February, it ruled not to grant the Government any stay or pause before its judgment took effect.</p>

<a name="100209-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="10020975000085"></a>Assets frozen under the UN regime on al-Qaeda and the Taliban remain frozen under the effectively parallel EC regulation. However, the Supreme Court's judgment has the effect of removing the sanctions for breach of its provisions, so we will attach sanctions to the EC regulation through secondary legislation. This will be debated in the House in due course through an affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="100209-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="10020975000086"></a>The court then also struck down the terrorism order 2006, and in so doing rendered vulnerable the terrorism orders of 2001 and 2009. There is no back-up EC regulation for the UK's designations under the terrorism orders. Primary legislation is therefore needed to ensure that we can continue to freeze terrorist assets.</p>

<a name="100209-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="10020975000087"></a>Currently, more than £150,000 is frozen in the UK under the terrorism orders. We need to act quickly to ensure that this money remains frozen and that suspected terrorists are not allowed to use the financial system to raise and move funds. That is why this Bill is being fast-tracked, with all stages being considered in this House in one day. I appreciate that one day is inadequate to consider legislation of this significance, but I hope noble Lords will understand why we need to act quickly.</p>

<a name="100209-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="10020975000088"></a>The Bill seeks to provide a temporary legal base for the Orders in Council, aimed at freezing assets of those we reasonably suspect are involved in terrorism where it is necessary to protect the people of this  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_614"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 614</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>country. This Bill will, if passed, restore the UK's terrorist asset-freezing regime in primary legislation as a stop-gap, before a full Bill can be considered and, I hope, passed into law. This course of action allows the House to scrutinise our proposals, while eliminating any risk of a gap in our asset-freezing regime. Through this action we are able to provide legal protection for the banks, to ensure that terrorist assets remain frozen, even though the Supreme Court judgment was not stayed. We have already published the full Bill to which today's legislation is merely a bridge. I hope the House will agree that the fuller Bill deserves a great deal of scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="10020975000089"></a><b><a name="100209-0002.htm_spnew24"></a><a name="10020975000420"></a>Lord King of Bridgwater:</b> When that fuller Bill is considered in the House, will it take account of the fact that, while this freezes some terrorist assets at present, many terrorists are closely involved in serious organised crime? The figures the Minister has given for what is actually going to be frozen under this are minute compared to the resources available to some of these organisations. One of the tragedies of recent years and successive Administrations around the world is the total failure to deal effectively with money-laundering by terrorists and serious organised crime.</p>

<a name="10020975000090"></a><b><a name="100209-0002.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="10020975000421"></a>Lord Myners:</b> I note the observation from the noble Lord, Lord King. Matters relating to serious organised crime are already dealt with by other agencies and legislation. This legislation focuses on the use of finances that are specifically related to the risk of terrorism activity which threatens the United Kingdom. No doubt the authorities will at all times be vigilant in recognising the area where organised crime may well abut terrorist activity, and will be alert to ensure that we are vigilant in addressing that risk.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100209-0003.htm"/>


<a name="100209-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="10020975000091"></a>I should make it clear at the outset that today's Bill, and the fuller Bill, seek only to restore the asset-freezing regime that is implemented through the terrorism orders- that is, the regime mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 1373, where listings are made at the national level. The Bill does not seek to restore the UN al-Qaeda and Taliban asset-freezing regime. That is the regime mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 1267, where listings are made at the UN. As I mentioned earlier, the al-Qaeda regime remains in effect through a directly applicable EC regulation. Noble Lords will be aware that the Supreme Court had specific concerns about the UN al-Qaeda regime-in particular, the lack of direct access to a court for people who are listed at the UN. Those specific concerns do not arise on this Bill, because it seeks only to restore the terrorism order regime, where decisions are made nationally and individuals have access to UK courts.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="10020975000092"></a>With the House's permission, I shall briefly outline the Bill's effects. It seeks to maintain the Treasury's power under the Orders in Council to designate persons if they meet both the required conditions of a legal test: reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in terrorist activity, and that the designation is necessary for public protection. The effect of a designation is to forbid dealing with a designated person's funds and economic resources; to forbid making funds or economic resources available to such persons, and to forbid  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_615"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 615</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>funds or economic resources being made available to a person when the designated person will obtain significant financial benefit. The orders will continue to provide for licences to permit access to funds and to ameliorate the effect of the sanctions. The Treasury will remain open to legal challenge to its asset-freezing decisions, including the procedures approved by Parliament in the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="10020975000093"></a>Perhaps I might turn briefly to retrospection. The Bill makes retrospective provision in one respect only. It gives retrospective legal authority for banks and any other institutions to maintain existing freezes between the dates of the Supreme Court judgment-4 February-and Royal Assent. I know that retrospective legislation is a very serious business and should be contemplated only where absolutely necessary. I assure your Lordships that this provision is necessary; without legal cover, banks would not have been able to maintain existing asset freezes for the past five days, and asset flight might already have happened at a cost and risk to our national security.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="10020975000094"></a>The Bill is time-limited to expire on 31 December 2010. We believe that the end of the year is the right timetable, as it will allow time for more permanent asset-freezing legislation to be given full consideration both in Parliament and in pre-legislative scrutiny. I could not be confident that, given elections and recesses, this job of scrutiny could be safely dispatched and a full Bill could then be taken through both Houses before 31 July 2010. Today's Bill is unavoidably urgent, but we do not believe that we should be fast-tracking two asset-freezing Bills through Parliament in close succession.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="10020975000095"></a>I want to respond to a number of points concerning human rights safeguards that were raised yesterday in debating the Bill in the other place, and which I expect noble Lords will also want to discuss today, both at Second Reading and in Committee. There are fundamental issues that are important to all Members of this House. Our intention is that all those issues be fully considered and debated when this House considers permanent asset-freezing legislation in the coming months. However, I understand that noble Lords will want some discussion of these issues today to be satisfied that the regime they are voting to extend in this Bill today until the end of the year is proportionate and fair.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="10020975000096"></a>Before coming to some specific issues, I want to explain that our asset-freezing regime is tried, tested and fit for purpose. It was subject to rigorous analysis by the Financial Action Task Force in 2007 and was judged to be, in its words, "fully compliant" with international best practice-we are the first country, incidentally, to get this top mark-and we have improved it through experience. For example, as the Supreme Court itself pointed out, the Terrorism Order 2009 is an improvement on the 2006 order, with more safeguards and greater proportionality.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="10020975000097"></a>One question that was raised yesterday in the other place, and which I see is also raised in an amendment we will discuss later, is whether "reasonable suspicion" is the right legal test. We believe strongly that it is. If we want the regime to be preventive rather than punitive, which we all do, freezing people's assets only when  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_616"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 616</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they are convicted is not the right approach. Such an approach is not very preventive as it may mean that freezes cannot be imposed for more than a year after someone has been detained, while they are still awaiting trial. Indeed, waiting to freeze assets until someone is convicted may simply appear punitive; an additional form of punishment on top of a prison sentence. The Financial Action Task Force is clear that reasonable suspicion is a proper legal basis for meeting UN asset-freezing obligations. As I mentioned earlier, we do not simply rely on the reasonable suspicion test. Designations must also be necessary for public protection, which acts as a safeguard against any arbitrary use of the power to make designations.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="10020975000098"></a>A number of Members in the other place expressed concern that using reasonable suspicion as a test may leave people in a sort of limbo situation where they have their assets frozen without knowing the case against them, without being charged with a criminal offence and without any means of getting an asset freeze removed. I will explain why this perception is not accurate. First, it is not true that people do not know the case against them. When people are designated, we provide them with as much information as we can share about the reasons for their listing. Only relatively few cases involve closed source material that cannot be shared directly with the designated person. Of the 33 UK people currently designated under the terrorism orders, six were designated on the basis of closed information and 27 were designated on the basis of open material.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="10020975000099"></a>Secondly, it is not true to say that people on an asset freeze list are never charged with a criminal offence. In fact, a clear majority also face action through the criminal justice system. Of the 33 people designated under the terrorism orders, 27 have been charged with a terrorist offence. Of these, 22 have been convicted; four are awaiting trial or retrial; one has recently had their charges dropped and we are urgently reviewing their listing.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="10020975000100"></a>Finally, it is not true to say that people can never get off an asset freeze list. The Treasury has a track record of actively reviewing designations and revoking them when they no longer meet the legal test. Of the 51 UK designations made under the orders to date, 18 have been revoked following a Treasury review; for example, where criminal charges have been dropped or where an individual is no longer assessed to pose a significant threat. Under the Bill, the Treasury will continue to carry out such reviews on a yearly basis, or more frequently when there has been a change in a person's circumstances.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="10020975000101"></a>A further question raised on several occasions yesterday in the other place was whether the right of individuals to challenge their designations in court under a judicial review procedure provided sufficient redress. The Government are of the view that court scrutiny should happen after freezing decisions have been taken and individuals have decided to challenge them. We do not believe that courts should be taking the decision to impose the freeze in the first place. These are decisions that the Executive can rightly take, with the safeguard, as I outlined earlier, that all decisions must be necessary for public protection and supported by proper evidence.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_617"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 617</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100209-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="10020975000102"></a>We believe that judicial review is the right procedure for the courts to examine cases that are brought before them. Judicial review is not, as some might argue, a light touch that lets the Executive off the hook. On the contrary, as we have seen in control order cases that have come before the courts, a judicial review procedure closely scrutinises the Government's decision-making processes and the evidence used to support them.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="10020975000103"></a>It might help if I explain in detail how the judicial review procedure works for control orders. There is an automatic review process by the High Court to determine whether the Secretary of State's decision to make a control order was flawed. In other words, the judge must agree: first, that there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity; and, secondly, that a control order is necessary to protect members of the public from a risk of terrorism. The judge must also satisfy himself that each obligation imposed by the order is necessary and compliant with the ECHR, including Article 5, which deals with the right to liberty, and Article 8, which deals with the right to respect for private and family life. The judge will further ensure that the individual's right to a fair hearing in accordance with Article 6 is protected.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="10020975000104"></a>If any of these tests is not met, the judge can quash the order, quash one or more obligations imposed by the order or give directions for the revocation of the order or for the modification of the obligations that it imposes. The court may consider the case in open or closed session, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information under consideration. Individuals are represented in open court by a lawyer of their choice. Special advocates are used to represent the interests of the individuals in closed sessions.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="10020975000105"></a>Finally, I know that a number of noble Lords will be concerned about the human rights impacts of the asset-freezing regime and will have noted the comments of some of the Supreme Court judges referring to the regime as "draconian" and designated persons as "prisoners of the state". Again, these points were raised in the other place yesterday. I should stress that the Supreme Court did not make findings that the asset-freezing regime breached human rights. It quashed the orders because of the legal base. Given that the court did not make human rights findings, we should be careful not to take some individual comments in the judgment as representing definitive views of the court about the nature of the regime.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="10020975000106"></a>Some of the Supreme Court Justices expressed clear views that the orders were not disproportionate. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, for instance, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="10020975000288"></a>"I am unimpressed by the alternative grounds on which the Order is challenged, those of certainty and proportionality. Primary legislation introducing this same asset-freezing regime could not have been declared incompatible on those grounds. It is only because the Order was plainly insufficiently mandated by the SCR 1373 that I would hold it invalid".</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="10020975000107"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, with whom the noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips, agreed, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="10020975000289"></a>"I agree with the Court of Appeal's reasoning and conclusion that the relevant provisions of articles 7 and 8 were and are sufficiently certain to be valid ... I am at present also unpersuaded  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_618"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 618</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the content of the Orders could be challenged on grounds of lack of proportionality, although I need express no final view about this. Combating terrorism, and the freezing of funds or resources which can be used for terrorist purposes, are undoubtedly matters of first importance".</p>

<p><a name="10020975000278"></a>We take great care to ensure that the regime is proportionate.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="10020975000108"></a>As set out in the Written Statement that I laid before this House on Friday, central to this is our licensing regime. We make sure when we designate people that we immediately issue a legal aid licence so that people can receive legal aid, if eligible. We also immediately issue a licence to allow them to receive and use their state benefits without delay. We do not limit people only to basic expense. We impose licence conditions, but only conditions that are proportionate to ensuring that funds are not diverted to terrorism. As I announced on Friday, we no longer require spouses of designated persons to report to the Treasury on how they spend benefits money. That will help to minimise the impact that the regime has on spouses and families.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="10020975000109"></a>In closing, in these times of severe threat to our national security, we cannot afford to fail to take the necessary steps to prevent terrorists raising and using funds for purposes of terrorism. Without primary legislation of the kind before the House today, we will leave gaps in our defences which could be exploited by people who intend serious harm to the British public.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="10020975000110"></a>The Bill ensures that the proper safeguards we set out in the Terrorism Order 2009 will continue to apply. At the same time, the Bill will provide Parliament with the proper time needed to consider and debate the permanent legislation in full. I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</p>

He referred to £135,000 as having been frozen under the orders of 2001 and 2009, but am I not right in thinking that those orders have in fact been quashed? So at the moment, at any rate, they are quite safe. It is only the 2006 order that has been quashed, and that relates to £16,000 only, which has presumably now gone. Is that the right analysis?</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_619"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 619</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the totality of anti-terrorism legislation. This patchwork of legislation, not just for asset freezing, lacks clarity, and it is time that the Government moved beyond a piecemeal and reactive approach. We are committed to reviewing and consolidating national security-related legislation and to ensuring its compatibility with fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="10020975000114"></a>Our support for anti-terrorism legislation is never unconditional. That legislation has to be proportionate, and inevitably there is a balance to be struck between the rights of individuals and the public interest, but Parliament is the right place for that balance to be determined. The Supreme Court decision handed down on 27 January made plain the impact on individuals affected by the various freezing orders covered by the Bill, and the Minister has quoted some of the words used in the Supreme Court: "draconian", "drastic", "burdensome", "oppressive" and "prisoners of the state". However, as the Supreme Court made clear, Parliament should have been involved in determining whether and how the rights of the individuals were to be protected under the orders. The Supreme Court was clear that it was for Parliament to determine.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="10020975000115"></a>When the United Nations Act 1946 was passed, it was in the context of a very different world from today. All of the orders made under that Act prior to 2001-and indeed a good number of those made subsequently-deal with sanctions against countries rather than individuals. I rather doubt that the 1946 Act, with its Order in Council process, would get through your Lordships' House unamended today, possibly even if it were restricted only to sanctions against nation states.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="10020975000116"></a>In 2001 however, the Government decided to use the 1946 Act for the anti-terrorist measures mandated by the UN Security Council. The Treasury has some form in using legislation in a way for which it was not initially intended. We all recall that the Treasury surprised many people, including the Icelandic nation, when it used the asset-freezing powers of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 to freeze the assets of certain Icelandic banks.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="10020975000117"></a>The Treasury has never fully explained why it chose to use the 1946 Act rather than primary legislation which could have been processed through a fast-track procedure in 2001. The Written Ministerial Statement of 27 January, and the Minister today, referred to the Government acting,</p>
<ul><a name="10020975000308"></a>"in good faith based on their belief that section 1 of the United Nations Act was an appropriate legal vehicle".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 27/1/10; col. 54WS.]</ul>
<p><a name="10020975000279"></a>Did it never occur to the Government that they had taken too much power to the Executive, to the detriment of those who were targeted by the orders? Did they never stop to think that Parliament ought to have been involved in the decisions? Did they not recognise the rights and liberties of the individuals who might be affected? If they had done so, the only logical conclusion to have drawn would have been that the balance between the interests of national security and those of individuals were best decided by Parliament and not by the Executive alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="10020975000118"></a>If it did not occur to the Government that they were acting inappropriately in 2001, did they not pause for thought when the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, chaired by my noble friend Lord Newton of Braintree, highlighted in 2003 the human rights issues involved in asset freezing? Or perhaps when the Joint Committee on Human Rights issued its sixth report of the 2003-04 Session? Or even when New Zealand and Australia replaced their regulations with primary legislation? The Government have known since the High Court ruled against them in April 2008, after a legal challenge, that their use of the 1946 Act was vulnerable.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="10020975000119"></a>It is unattractive when the Executive try to take maximum power for themselves and then are prepared to go right through the courts to defend it. I cannot help but think that it would have been more responsible for the Government to recognise the force of the arguments in the High Court judgment that have now been endorsed by the Supreme Court, and to have brought forward primary legislation in 2008.</p>

The point that she made about the decision of the High Court in April 2008 is perfectly valid. However, I am sure that she will accept that the Court of Appeal reversed the decision-I think unanimously-a few months later.</p>

However, I accept that the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the Government. My point is that the Government were on notice that they were vulnerable, but they chose to battle on through the courts rather than put the legislation on a more secure basis by involving Parliament. It should have been clear to the Government that Parliament had not been properly involved in the early decisions, and that the proper way forward was to bring legislation that would involve Parliament in the construction of the way in which individuals' assets would be frozen. However, they stuck it out until the very end and lost in the Supreme Court. That made it inevitable that we would have emergency legislation. We are in this position because the Government failed to act.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="10020975000122"></a>The Government first informed us nearly two weeks ago that they intended to take through the legislation, which was published in draft form last week, on an expedited basis. The Bill would replace the orders under the 1946 Act with a dedicated Bill. Dates had been provisionally agreed that would have allowed both Houses to consider the Bill on a rapid but acceptable timescale. The plan was for the Bill to start in the other place today and for it to have been completed in your Lordships' House, with Second Reading, Committee, Report and Third Reading taken over the first two weeks of March. However, once the Government heard that their application for a stay had been rejected by the Supreme Court, they abandoned that Bill and opted for the minimalist Bill before us today. They have dressed this up as the virtue of pre-legislative scrutiny; but they showed no interest whatever in extensive or pre-legislative scrutiny right up to the time that their stay application failed.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_621"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 621</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100209-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="10020975000123"></a>There is also a puzzle. The Government have asset-freezing powers in the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, the Deputy President of the Supreme Court, said could have been used for the cases covered by the appeals. I believe that that legislation has been used only once, in the case of the Icelandic banks to which I referred earlier. The Government have not properly explained why they do not use that legislation for terrorist asset freezing; in what ways their view differs from that of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope; or, indeed, why a simple amendment to that Act could not give them the legislative cover that they need.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="10020975000124"></a>The Bill has a sunset date of 31 December 2010. It could have been managed perfectly well with a 31 March sunset. It would have been possible and, in our view, desirable if the longer Bill putting terrorist asset freezing onto a proper footing had stuck with the timetable that we had already agreed. We told the Government last week that we were ready and willing to do that in addition to dealing with this emergency Bill this week. The chairman of the Human Rights Committee said yesterday in another place that 31 March would have allowed his committee enough time to scrutinise the longer Bill. The Government are still running away from proper parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="10020975000125"></a>We believe that it is about time there was a debate in Parliament about the balance between the rights of those who are the subject of asset freezing and the needs of national security. We need to debate whether there should be some involvement by the courts in the designation orders themselves, by way of review or confirmation. We should examine why terrorist asset-freezing orders are more draconian than asset freezing for money laundering or criminal purposes, for example under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, where the courts have a greater involvement.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="10020975000126"></a>We need to debate whether the appeal processes first set out in the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 are appropriate. They are based solely on judicial review processes and remedies and so are heavily weighted in favour of the Executive. I disagree with the Minister's analysis of judicial review. It does not allow an examination of the merits of the case and it also does not allow, for example, for orders to be varied, which is important when dealing with licences for the use of financial resources. We need to debate the way in which the various offences are constructed and why some of them are restricted to situations where significant benefit is involved while others are not. We need to subject the information provisions to scrutiny and ensure that the privilege regarding self-incrimination is not damaged.</p>

<a name="100209-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="10020975000127"></a>We have a long list of more detailed points which can be taken forward only in the context of a longer Bill. We are denied the opportunity to deal with those points because the Government have chosen the minimalist emergency legislation. All the points that I have mentioned are relevant to the minimalist Bill but they cannot be debated given the structure of the Bill and the timetable to which we are working. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has tabled amendments for our Committee stage this evening, but I do not think that this short Bill is the right place for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10020975000128"></a>Let me reiterate that we believe in a strong and effective regime which can minimise the threat posed by terrorism in whatever guise it appears. However, we are mindful of the need to accord those suspected of involvement in terrorism the sort of rights that a civilised and libertarian society accords its citizens. The Bill does not allow a proper consideration of those issues. We shall return to some of them when we reconvene later today for the Committee stage but we shall not debate them properly until there is a full Bill to scrutinise. I regret that the Government are denying Parliament that opportunity.</p>

First, the Supreme Court decided that the international obligations of this country under the UN resolution extend only to those persons who are involved in terrorism. Secondly, the Supreme Court explained that because the relevant orders purport to go much further and apply to those in respect of whom there are only reasonable grounds for suspecting their involvement in terrorism, the orders were not validly made under the United Nations Act 1946. Thirdly, the court emphasised the destructive effect of these orders on the lives of those affected and the consequent need for considerable care and attention in ensuring the legality of any order so made. Some of the language of the justices has already been quoted in this debate.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10020975000130"></a>The undoubted urgency of this matter has meant that there has not been an adequate opportunity for your Lordships to reflect on the important issues raised by this Bill. There has also been no time for your Lordships' Select Committee on the Constitution, of which I am a member, or for the Joint Committee on Human Rights to consider and to report on the major constitutional and human rights implications of this Bill.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10020975000131"></a>No doubt we have no choice but to accept this Bill. However, we should record and we should regret that we are in this difficult position because of the Government's failure to heed earlier warnings that they were acting unlawfully in relation to these measures to combat terrorism. This Government have a very poor record of ignoring advice that their measures relating to terrorism are unlawful-detention in Belmarsh, control orders, stop-and-search powers and now the freezing of assets. I declare an interest as counsel in some of the litigation in relation to these matters. If the Government were to listen more carefully and with, if I may say so, a little more humility to bodies such as the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the organisations, JUSTICE and Liberty, for example, the Government would not need to come before this House today and ask for help in clearing up the mess that they have created.</p>

I hope I am not the only noble Lord who is most reluctant to wave a magic wand over these measures to validate, even temporarily, what is otherwise constitutionally objectionable. It is ironic indeed that when the Supreme Court has found these orders to be

Like the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, I am concerned that the Government prefer orders rather than primary legislation precisely because they do not value debate on these important matters. We will need reluctantly to approve a temporary measure, but all its provisions must be scrutinised most carefully in Committee to ensure that they are necessary and proportionate.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="10020975000133"></a>Noble Lords will not dispute the need to validate freezing orders against people who have been found to be involved in terrorism. Noble Lords will also accept the need to validate such orders against people who the Secretary of State believes, on reasonable grounds, to be involved in terrorism. As the Minister rightly said, of course freezing orders must be available against people who have not yet been convicted for terrorism. But the orders go much further: they impose restraints on people merely because there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they are involved in terrorism. That is unacceptable, especially as the United Nations resolution imposes no such obligation.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="10020975000134"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, in his judgment in the Supreme Court, said at paragraph 199:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="10020975000290"></a>"To suspect something to be so is by no means to believe it to be so. It is to believe only that it may be so".</p>

<p><a name="10020975000280"></a>The House should not be asked to fast-track legislation that will have a destructive effect on the lives of people without the Minister being able even to say that he believes on reasonable grounds that the persons concerned are involved in terrorism.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="10020975000135"></a>Perhaps I may also ask the Minister about the retrospective effect of the Bill. He mentioned that Clause 2 has a retrospective effect, back to 4 February, to protect the interests of the banks. However, as I understand it, the Bill has no retrospective effect for the period before 4 February. That means, I assume, that someone whose funds were frozen last year and who asked the bank to release the funds on 27 January-the date when the Supreme Court handed down its substantive judgment-would have a good claim against the bank for damages. Will the Minister please clarify whether my understanding is correct, because I do not understand what is the point in distinguishing in this temporary Bill between what occurred on 3 February and what occurred on 4 February?</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="10020975000136"></a>I also suggest that 31 July 2010 would be a much more appropriate date for the termination of this legislation, even allowing for the intervention of a general election. The date of 31 December in Clause 1 gives a strong impression to your Lordships that the Government are content to rush through this Bill and then relax, with the pressure off, rather than, as should be the case, ensuring that the substantive measures receive full debate as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="10020975000137"></a>Later today, the House will of course approve the Bill. But I ask noble Lords to remember the wise words of Mr Justice Frankfurter in the United States Supreme Court in 1950, that,</p>
<ul><a name="10020975000309"></a>"the safeguards of liberty have frequently been forged in controversies involving not very nice people"-</ul>

Therefore, the United Nations Act was not a lawful instrument for the making of the orders.</p>

I would like to express my appreciation of the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Myners, introduced the Bill, and I appreciate the difficult situation in which the Government find themselves. There is no doubt that statutory instruments are extremely useful if you wish to do something quickly. The speed with which the legislation was introduced after the Security Council resolutions were passed is commendable. The problem with legislation that proceeds in that way is that it is by no means as secure as primary legislation. Indeed, primary legislation in our country is so secure that no court can overturn it, except possibly the court in Luxembourg in cases where it is supposed to contravene European law.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="10020975000141"></a>The important difference is between primary legislation and secondary legislation. As the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, said-I shall not repeat what he said on this point-the Supreme Court decided unanimously that the two orders that it quashed went beyond the empowerment that the United Nations Act 1946 gave for the purpose of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions because the reasonable suspicion basis was not included in that resolution.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="10020975000142"></a>That has another effect. So far as I know, the United Nations has not found it necessary to pass resolutions requiring member states to introduce legislation dealing with people against whom there is only reasonable suspicion, so these orders were without the authority of a United Nations Security Council resolution. That does not mean that, after a broad and careful assessment of the situation, the Government might not think that, because of our special circumstances, it was necessary to have legislation that went beyond the United Nations resolutions. I think I am right in saying that New Zealand and Australia took the view that that was necessary and passed primary legislation. We did not do that and have stayed with secondary legislation that enables one to take action very quickly but in which, in this case, Parliament was not involved because there was no need for a negative or affirmation resolution procedure.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_625"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 625</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100209-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="10020975000143"></a>The difficulty with that is that the legislation is nothing like as secure as primary legislation, and in due course the Supreme Court, having examined this with considerable care, came to the conclusion that these orders were beyond the powers conferred by the Act of 1946 and therefore should be quashed. That has the effect of making them null and void from the time they were originally passed. They have no authority whatsoever.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10020975000144"></a>This was a situation of very grave difficulty for the Government if, as I assume, they believed that there was a serious risk to this country arising from people against whom they had no more than a reasonable suspicion. On that basis, it was necessary to take immediate action. My original thought, when I read of this occurrence, was that we have a range of anti-terrorism legislation which has been passed by Parliament over a number of years. It is quite a patchwork. Therefore, I wondered why it would not be possible to resort to one or other of these pieces of legislation to deal with this sudden difficulty. The answer to that is contained in the speech that the Exchequer Secretary made to the other place yesterday. She said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="10020975000291"></a>"Let me deal with a point raised by the hon. Member for Twickenham"-</p>

<p><a name="10020975000145"></a>that is Dr Cable of the Liberal Democrats-</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="10020975000292"></a>"Why do we not use other existing counter-terrorism legislation? It has been suggested that counter-terrorism legislation is already in place, and that we should use those powers rather than introducing asset freezing. We have a comprehensive framework to counter financing of terrorism, but none of the other legislation replicates the effects of the asset-freezing regime under the terrorism orders in its preventive nature and in its ability to restrict suspected terrorists' access to the financial system. Furthermore, no other legislation contains such a comprehensive range of prohibitions on third parties' making funds available to terrorist suspects, such prohibitions being essential to preventing terrorists from circumventing the restrictions and accessing funds."-[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons, 8/2/10; cols. 697-98.]</p>

<p><a name="10020975000146"></a>That immediately shows that there was a huge hole in the primary legislation system for dealing with terrorism on the basis of the nature of the threats which the Government believe to exist.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="10020975000147"></a>We are going to deal with this today on the basis of this Bill, but I would venture to humbly suggest to the Government, and to any other Government that may have responsibility in the future, that it is vital that the counterterrorism legislation, which is important, should be primary legislation, even if one has to take secondary legislation in order to get quick action. It should be followed up by primary legislation.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10020975000148"></a>Secondly, it is amazing, looking at the patchwork of counterterrorism legislation that we have had, that it was not appreciated that this risk existed. I can understand that we are all fallible-at least, that is the general view-and that this kind of loophole or difficulty may be overlooked. However, it is extremely important, in the light of what has happened, that the whole pattern of counterterrorism legislation should be examined to see that, in all its aspects, it is reasonably secure and fit for purpose in what is a fundamental protection for our citizens.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="10020975000149"></a>The Bill is temporary-there is argument about how temporary it should be-and the Government have indicated that they will replace it with primary legislation. I venture to think that that would be a

As my noble friend Lord King has noted, there is a rather difficult grey area between terrorism and serious crime, and the provisions for seizing assets from serious crime are extremely complicated, as I think anyone who has tried to operate them will agree. I know that the Government have other work to do, but this may be a good opportunity to consider whether these two systems could profitably be linked together.</p>

I should say to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that some of them are relevant for now. </p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="10020975000151"></a>Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, I very much appreciated the Minister's introduction, although I would have appreciated it even more if I had been able to take it away and read it before responding to it. However, here end the compliments.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="10020975000152"></a>I put on record our thanks to JUSTICE and Liberty for their briefings. Second-hand compliments are often the most credible. One of my colleagues who questioned me about the Bill yesterday had read the briefing material as soon as it arrived, and the organisations should take that as a compliment.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="10020975000153"></a>Nothing that is said from these Benches should be taken as our opposing proper measures to stop funding getting to terrorist groups or as our resisting our international obligations. However, we detect the Government's air of panic to which other noble Lords have referred. We, too, asked: why such a rush? The judgment was made at the end of last month, and a supplementary judgment was made when the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay on 4 February, but the case did not start this year. I accept that the High Court order to quash the relevant orders was superseded by the Court of Appeal, but it was made in April 2008, so the Government were clearly on notice, as the noble Baroness put it, of the issue, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, said, they have failed to heed warnings for a considerable period.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="10020975000154"></a>In the Supreme Court judgment, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, expressed,</p>

<p><a name="10020975000282"></a>a word used by noble Lords this afternoon-</p>
<ul><a name="10020975000311"></a>"of over-lapping anti-terrorism measures, some receiving Parliamentary scrutiny, others simply the result of executive action".</ul>
<p><a name="10020975000283"></a>As noble Lords have said, we have had a great deal of terrorism legislation and criminal, serious organised crime legislation. Speaking as a lay person in this, I find it difficult to believe that terrorism is not serious organised crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="10020975000155"></a>If the Acts of 2000 and 2001, which were used against the Icelandic banks, and 2008 did not cover the issue-the Government take that view but there is a dispute about this-why did they not make them? Even if the Government thought that Orders in Council were adequate, such important provisions, with such an impact, should have been brought into primary legislation. I follow the noble and learned Lord, although not as eloquently or no doubt as technically correct, in saying that the answer is not that an Order in Council is the usual way to go. Later today, there will be amendments from these Benches to seek to apply some existing primary legislation for the interim period.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="10020975000156"></a>As has been said, only small sums are currently frozen. Although I accept that it is not necessarily expensive to carry out an act of terrorism, the issue of proportionality obviously arises. It is right to protect the banks which are caught in the middle. But if an individual who is subject to freezing took proceedings to get his money back, it would not be dealt with overnight. That would, in effect, allow a little more time for the Government to take this in a rather more measured way. In any event-I think that I read this in the same way as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick-the rights of individuals against the Treasury are preserved. Taking legislation a little more slowly would simply extend by a small amount the period in respect of which an individual might claim. Having made that point, I welcome the fact that those rights are preserved.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="10020975000157"></a>We are unpersuaded of the need for emergency-or, as it is now perhaps a little euphemistically known, fast-track-legislation. But the House of Commons passed this Bill and it is clear that by tomorrow morning we will have a new Act of Parliament; so I do not want to spend much more time on this aspect.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="10020975000158"></a>The Government have been hauled over the coals by the Supreme Court for bypassing Parliament and now the use of emergency legislation is sought to overturn that judgment. Much as we might object to this, our task is to make the legislation more palatable. I hope that our amendments will help to achieve that end.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="10020975000159"></a>I said that it was right to protect the banks which have been caught in the middle. But that is not as important as protecting the citizens in the face of disproportionate interference with their human rights in ways not required by the UN resolutions. The terms "remorseless", "devastating", "draconian" and "paralysing" are used to describe the conditions imposed on those who are merely suspected-these are the Supreme Court's adjectives and have been used by other noble Lords today. No evidence is required and there is no possibility of judicial challenge.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="10020975000160"></a>It is important that permanent legislation is scrutinised thoroughly. We would support pre-legislative scrutiny perhaps by a Joint Committee of the two Houses or some other bespoke procedure. There is no reason why one should not design a procedure for this unusual circumstance. But it is far from clear that, even with a general election intervening, it is necessary to wait for as long as the end of this year. It certainly is clear that the asset-freezing regime to which an individual is made subject should itself be subject to supervision by  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_628"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 628</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the courts. Such orders should not just be made by the Executive. To quote the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, again, he said that the wording of UN resolution 1373,</p>
<ul><a name="10020975000312"></a>"does not suggest that the Security Council had in mind 'reasonable suspicion' as a sufficient basis for an indefinite freeze".</ul>
<a name="100209-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="10020975000161"></a>The 2001 Act has the test of "reasonable belief". However, the Government come nowhere near evidence in the Bill, although I heard what the Minister had to say. Furthermore, promoting a Bill with no judicial oversight when a person is designated and no appeal-in other words, no judicial oversight at the beginning and no appeal at the end-and no appeal in respect of the licence terms that might apply is something that we find offensive; that would not be the wrong word. The Minister referred to judicial review and said, I think, that it was not a light touch. I believe that it is the wrong touch for this situation. It is about process and as described it accepts the premise on which the original order was made. That of course is one of the matters about which we complain.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="10020975000162"></a>It is of great importance that the orders are themselves proportionate, but their impact has been described as "very burdensome" on all members of the designated person's family. The impact on normal family life is remorseless and can be devastating. Noble Lords have heard of some of the restrictions. The wife of one respondent could not even receive welfare benefits until the regime was relaxed. It was what amounted to an invasion of privacy of a wife who was not a listed person. Solicitors have reported to the Supreme Court the break-up of the marriages of some of the individuals concerned. Although the Minister covered some of this in his opening speech, I want to ask particularly about what is routinely licensed. What is the approach and how are the needs of the whole family assessed? Indeed, how are their representations heard? Incorporating some sort of minimal level would be right, and I would say too that it goes against every principle that the actions of providing money to fund a challenge to an order or legally to represent a designated person should be an offence is itself offensive. The noble Lord mentioned legal aid. I am a little perplexed because it is difficult to imagine that someone subject to one of these orders would have the funds not to require legal aid. As we have seen in the draft longer Bill, the Government consider that periodic reports from the Treasury and an independent review of the process would be proper, so why not import those here?</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="10020975000163"></a>This is an emergency largely of the Government's own making. The Minister referred to human rights legislation and has made a statement under the Human Rights Act that the Bill complies with the Act. Can he confirm that it complies only because the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights do not apply? The UN charter trumps them both. As I understand it, the Supreme Court thought that as the Al-Jedda case is still continuing, that precluded it from considering the human rights position. The Minister quoted the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, who said that he was not taking a final view.</p>

<a name="100209-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10020975000164"></a>It is with the greatest reluctance that we see before us legislation that amounts to control orders by another name. Liberal Democrats in the Commons made it clear what they thought by voting against Clause 1-

We will do our best later today to ensure that the legislation that emerges is appropriate and not excessive. I can certainly assure the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, that no magic wand will be waved from these Benches.</p>

As has just been mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, the noble Lord, Lord Myners, states on the front of the Bill that nothing in the Bill is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. How do the Government know that? The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, suggested that the JCHR could have looked it, but we have not looked at it. For the Government to say that the legislation is compatible with the ECHR without even subjecting it to parliamentary scrutiny is, I regret to say, fairly disgraceful. Obviously the Bill has got to go through, but with my human rights hat on, I must raise the strongest objection to how it is being done. This rush and panic reflect the Government's track record of totally disregarding the liberties of the subject, about which some of us feel very strongly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="10020975000167"></a>As the whole House recognises, the threat to the UK today from international terrorism is very real and significant. Terrorists need financing to be able to carry out attacks, the costs of which, as we have seen, do not have to be great. Terrorists also need financing to maintain their infrastructure; for training, equipment and recruitment, and to promote their ideology. The capabilities of terrorist groups are severely constrained without access to funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10020975000168"></a>The asset-freezing regime, implemented in good faith under Orders in Council, has proved over the years to be a valuable tool for disrupting and preventing terrorist financing. The Supreme Court ruled that the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006, implemented in good faith, were beyond the scope of the power provided by Section 1 of the United Nations Act 1946 and quashed both orders. This had effect from 4 February.</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="10020975000169"></a>National security and public protection continue to be an absolute priority for the Government. Our aim is to prevent a gap in the asset-freezing regime and ensure that suspected terrorist funds cannot be diverted and used for terrorist purposes, and that suspected terrorists do not get free access to the UK's financial system.</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="10020975000170"></a>That is why this legislation is being moved today. We considered it necessary to the UK's national security to act swiftly to restore the asset freezing on a temporary

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="10020975000171"></a>I welcome the many points made by Members of the House. I will deal first with the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. The noble Baroness kindly offered support for the intention of the legislation, and we welcome and greatly appreciate that. At the same time, the noble Baroness quite correctly lost no opportunity to point out what she regarded as the Government's failings, which led us to have to introduce this legislation on a fast-track basis. No doubt there were warnings which could have led many to believe that primary legislation should have been introduced from 2001. The noble Baroness referred to the work produced by the noble Lord, Lord Newton, in 2003 in that respect; and also, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, referred to, the actions taken in primary legislation in New Zealand and Australia.</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="10020975000172"></a>However, I remind your Lordships' House that the Government were acting in good faith and under advice that it was correct and proper to rely on Section 1 of the United Nations Act 1946. We cannot rush to Parliament every time a piece of legislation goes through some form of court challenge, certainly not in a situation where the Court of Appeal found in favour of the line that the Government had taken. However, the judgment from the Supreme Court required us to take the necessary action to protect the country and our people from the risk of terrorism facilitated by the use of financial assets and access to the financial system, while at the same time putting in place detailed legislation that can be subject to intensive scrutiny as it makes it way through the House.</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10020975000173"></a>The noble Baroness is correct in observing that the decision of the Supreme Court to reject a stay in respect of its decision led us to require urgent action. The Supreme Court in its judgment directs us towards the need for fairer scrutiny, which is precisely what we are going to achieve by the process of putting forward two pieces of primary legislation-one to be adopted through the fast-track mechanism and the other through the very detailed scrutiny that this House and others will apply to the legislation, as we wrestle with reconciling the need to preserve security against the risk of terrorism while not encroaching unreasonably or disproportionately on individual freedom and rights, which we regard as of the highest possible importance. The noble Baroness in her various questions demonstrated why we need a very serious debate and scrutiny of the permanent legislation, which is precisely what we plan to ensure.</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10020975000174"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, referred to the undoubted urgency to validate orders and asked why the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Constitution Committee had been circumvented. The House will be aware that the answer is simply the lack of time. The Bill was introduced only on Friday, and the Joint Committee on Human Rights does not meet until tomorrow, and the same applies to the Constitution Committee. Both committees will have a very full role to play in scrutinising our permanent Bill, and we very much welcome that.</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10020975000175"></a>The noble Baroness asked why we were not using the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. The answer was provided largely from her own Benches by the intervention from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, in referring to the answer given in the other place yesterday by the Exchequer Secretary to Dr Cable. I might respond also to another point that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, made, relating to what he described as the patchwork of legislation. There is much to commend his observation that we should at an appropriate moment review the myriad pieces of legislation which deal with terrorism-to go back to the earlier intervention in my opening speech from the noble Lord, Lord King-to satisfy ourselves that the interface with other forms of legislation, particularly those relating to serious organised crime, is looked at in its totality to ensure that they are comprehensive and complete and that there are no inconsistencies or gaps. I have had the opportunity already to discuss this matter with my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General. It is a matter on which we will no doubt reflect-but we can rest assured without any doubt that the permanent legislation that we propose to follow this temporary Bill will receive very close scrutiny.</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10020975000176"></a>The noble Baroness asked why we did not simply amend the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. The Act covers a wide range of threats but is primarily aimed at countering threats from overseas and is framed appropriately. Amending it to allow for a meaningful terrorist asset-freezing regime that could be used to tackle threats within the UK would substantially change the nature of the Act, and we judge that this would not be an efficient way of addressing our particular concerns.</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="10020975000177"></a>I will go back to answer some more points made by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick. He expressed concern about the speed with which the Bill is being rushed through. I fully sympathise with his comments, and I think everybody on the government Benches and elsewhere in the House would rather we never had to use fast-track processes. However, the House also recognises that this is not necessarily a case, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, suggested, of a hint of panic; rather we are acting expeditiously and with appropriate urgency in the light of developments. We are not, of course, asking noble Lords to accept permanent asset-freezing legislation on such a fast-track basis. This Bill simply restores the existing regime for a temporary period to provide time for Parliament to consider permanent legislation more fully.</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10020975000178"></a>Concern was also raised about our use of reasonable suspicion tests, and whether this exceeds our international obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373. I accept that UNSCR 1373 does not spell out precisely that action should be taken on the basis of reasonable suspicion. However, it is clearly intended to be preventive, and the international Financial Action Task Force has made it clear that, in its reasonable view, suspicion is a proper standard for implementing UNSCR 1373. I suggest to your Lordships' House that this is also an area where one operates within the framework of UN thinking but according to the particular circumstances as they are perceived to apply in one's own territory. I am afraid we know from very painful  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_632"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 632</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and tragic experience that the United Kingdom is a country in which the threat of terrorism is particularly pronounced, as indicated by my right honourable friend's decision recently to raise the security level. That ability to form a judgment as to the particular circumstances that will apply to our situation in this country, within the framework of 1373, is a reasonable way of proceeding.</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10020975000179"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, also said that he was a little puzzled as to why Clause 2 gives retrospection to the banks only back to 4 February, and raised the question of what would happen if banks were to be sued for having maintained frozen accounts on 27 January, after the first Supreme Court judgment. We believe that retrospection should be used only where absolutely necessary, especially in a fast-track Bill. The reason we do not provide banks with retrospective cover predating 4 February in this Bill is that the Supreme Court judgment did not take effect until 4 February. Prior to that date, the banks were therefore in a position where they could reasonably argue that they properly thought they had a valid legal base to freeze terrorist assets. The noble Lord also expressed concerns about why we-</p>

Am I right in thinking, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, indicated, that as a result of the Supreme Court decision, these orders have been null ab initio-from the very beginning? Therefore, previously, if a person failed to comply with a prohibition or obligation-prior to 27 January, for example-they might have been guilty of a crime. However, is the Minister saying that no crime will have been committed if a person failed to comply with a prohibition or obligation under these orders prior to 4 February, or even 27 January?</p>

I will no doubt reflect on that question while I complete my answers to the noble Lord, Lord Pannick. With assistance, I might provide him with the accurate and precise answer that his question justifies, and which I know that he would expect. As I think I said, we abhor retrospection-particularly in a fast-track Bill-and would only seek to use it where we believed that the arguments for so doing were compelling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10020975000182"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, also raised the issue of the length of the sunset clause. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, also mentioned that, and preferences were expressed for an earlier date. That will no doubt receive our attention during the Committee stage, if noble Lords so wish. We believe that 31 December is the right deadline to allow sufficient time for pre-legislative and parliamentary scrutiny. We also believe that our existing regime is tried, tested and fit for purpose, that it has appropriate human rights safeguards already in place, and that it can reasonably continue in operation until the end of the year and until we are able to introduce permanent legislation.</p>

As the details of the Bill are already available, that scrutiny process has already commenced within an informal structure. Having reflected carefully on the question from the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, I can now advise him and the House that the orders are void. There are therefore no offences to prosecute; and, in any event, no prosecutions have been brought. I trust that that answers his question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10020975000188"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, made a very thoughtful contribution. I am sure that we will see much more of the logic behind her arguments displayed in Committee. In my opening comments I endeavoured to address some of the issues that will be raised by the amendments, but no doubt she will reflect on whether I have provided an adequate response or whether she still wishes those amendments to be placed before the Committee. I heard what she said about judicial review but I emphasise that it is not a light touch. It is a serious challenge and we should not disregard its powerful protection against abuse of privilege by the Executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="10020975000189"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked about the basis of individual need.

As regards frozen funds, all £150,000 remains frozen; £135,000 under the 2001 and 2009 orders, because they remain in force, and £16,500 under the 2006 order because we are giving the banks retrospective legal cover in this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10020975000191"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, also asked about a Section 19 statement based on the ECHR not applying. I advise her that we do not rely on the al-Jedda judgment. As regards Section 19 certification, we believe that the Bill is fully compliant with human rights requirements. I re-emphasise that I absolutely agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, about the importance of primary legislation. With hindsight, we wish that we had not relied on the powers in the United Nations Act 1946, but we are now somewhat belatedly seeking to rectify that with primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="10020975000192"></a>I think that I have covered most of the points raised. I must emphasise again that these are times of severe threat to our national security. We cannot afford to fail to take the necessary steps to prevent terrorists raising and using funds for terrorist purposes. Without the primary legislation before this House, we would leave gaps in our defences which people who intend serious harm to the British public would be able to exploit. At the same time, the Bill will provide Parliament with the time needed to consider and debate the permanent legislation in full. I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</p>

Our amendment would provide an exception to the public sector equality duty, which would mean that any public authority, or a non-public authority that had been subcontracted to carry out functions of behalf of a public authority, should not be subject to the public sector equality duty if it employed fewer than 250 people.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_635"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 635</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100209-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="10020975000194"></a>Research carried out by the Government to analyse the functions of the public sector equality duty and its impact was carried out predominantly on large organisations. Research to support extending the duty to other protected characteristics was based on research by Schneider-Ross Ltd. Most of the respondents in that case were large organisations. Some 30 per cent of the 174 organisations that replied to the survey employed between 1,000 and 4,999 people. Only 2 per cent employed fewer than 150 people. Has any further or alternative research been undertaken that concentrates more fully on small businesses?</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10020975000195"></a>Concerns have been expressed to us that the public sector equality duty may be too onerous on businesses with fewer than 250 employees and that no information has been provided to suggest otherwise. Without any such reassuring information, it is perhaps premature to saddle smaller businesses with this burden until further research has been undertaken. This is a particularly pertinent question because, if the organisations subject to gender pay gap reporting are only those with more than 250 employees, might that not make sense in this case as well?</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="10020975000196"></a>A second concern is the potential lack of clarity in this area. We have been informed that Section 6(3) of the Human Rights Act 1998 states that a person may be defined as a public authority for exercising public functions. Would that mean, therefore, that a single person could be classed as having to abide by the public sector equality duty? Certain groups are worried because, as the Bill stands, it is unclear exactly to whom the public sector equality duty would apply.</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10020975000197"></a>I have another question about smaller organisations that have had public functions outsourced to them. We covered most of this in a debate on a previous day and I will not go over those arguments. However, will the Minister confirm that if public functions are outsourced to a small charity-for example, one based on religious principles-the employment exceptions in paragraph 3 of Schedule 9 would still apply? In other words, will the charity continue to function under the terms of its foundation charter even though it would be performing a service on behalf of a secular public authority? Will the Minister clarify where the terms of a charity's foundation charter would apply and where they would not? If a public sector authority has outsourced some of its functions, in terms of those functions, will the public sector authority duty or the charity's foundation charter have pre-eminence?</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10020975000198"></a>Finally, there is a question to be asked about organisations where jobs cannot be neatly segregated into those that would be tied into the public sector equality duty and those that would come under the private functions of a small organisation. For example, if a small care home operates under a Christian ethos, would that care home have a right to demand that staff were of the same religion? Moreover, if the care home also had some of the public care provision outsourced to it, under the terms of the public sector equality duty would it be able to ask for all staff to be of the same religion? I ask this because in such organisations it would not be possible to separate the roles into those which clearly came under the new equality duty, and those which remained under the small, private

I see the Minister looking confused, and we are confused, but these are genuine concerns which have been raised with us, so I look forward to her response and hope she can shed some light in this area. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10020975000200"></a>The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, made in the wake of the recommendations of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, introduced general statutory duties on scheduled public authorities which apply irrespective of the number of employees within its workforce. That is in respect of race. So did the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, supported by the Conservative Party.</p>

<a name="100209-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10020975000201"></a>The Equality Act 2006 introduced similar public sector duties as regards sex discrimination which apply irrespective of the size of the public authority. The fair employment amendment Act of 1989, introduced by the Thatcher Administration to combat religious discrimination in the workplace, contained no such exception for public authorities with fewer than 250 employees. That is why the amendment is regressive. It is going back on the whole of that-race, religion, with regard to Northern Ireland here, with regard to gender, with regard to disability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10020975000202"></a>We know of no evidence to support the amendment, nor do we understand why Her Majesty's Official Opposition should seek to weaken the scope of the public sector duty and the protection it gives to vulnerable minorities, including women, ethnic minorities, disabled people, religious minorities, gays and lesbians and the elderly, and we are opposed to it.</p>

For example, whether a care home is under a religious foundation's auspices or not, it would be totally unrealistic to restrict those staff who actually do the caring to people of a particular faith, race or anything else, because they just would not work any more. It would be totally contrary to the aims of the Equality Bill.</p>

What matters is that people are not discriminated against either overtly or covertly and it does not matter whether the employees are five, 20, 100 or 1,000. Discrimination is discrimination, so I am surprised by the number. It may sound interesting, but mathematical calculations in a Bill such as this are never helpful. I do not understand why the figure has been asserted, and if, as the provision says, a public authority has a public duty, I do not understand why mathematics is beginning to come into it. Maybe I need to go back to primary school and then I will know that 250 is the level at which it is impossible to discriminate.</p>

Already small and medium-sized businesses have a huge problem in getting business and contracts from government bodies. There are a lot of barriers in their way, and a lot of contractual obstacles are put in their path. SMEs employ about half the non-public sector workforce in this country. They are very large employers. Most are tiny companies employing five people or fewer, but some are larger companies. Innovation and growth in the economy come from the SME sector: they do not come from large companies, which tend to rationalise and downsize. Therefore, future pensions will be paid by these companies. In some areas, the local authority is almost the only employer. Therefore, there is a huge problem if people cannot do business with the local authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10020975000206"></a>I have seen one of these forms. It was sent to my wife, who employs only three or four people, in order that a small sum could be procured from her. It is impossible. There are questions like, "Can we see your special diversity policy?" and "Can you prove that X number of your workforce are this, that and the other?". Small companies cannot handle it. Therefore it is very sensible that there should be an exemption at some level-although I do not know what the figure should be-to allow government authorities to procure from small businesses. Because this applies down the supply chain, it may not apply to the first contractor, which may be a large organisation. However, when that organisation wants to contract further down the supply chain, the same thing will apply. The Government should show mercy to small companies, because the burden of bureaucracy is already enormous on them. This could be the straw that breaks the camel's back.</p>

If I am picking up the vibes correctly, the Minister may be able to answer the query. It may be thought that small charitable bodies that might be asked to undertake work via a public authority would run into a problem because of this. From reading the Bill, I cannot see that. However, I will leave it to those who have more detailed knowledge. I am not in favour of this amendment.</p>

Many people in this country are employed in small companies, as has already been indicated. The Bill is about individual rights as much as anything. If an amendment of this kind, with this sort of arrangement, were to be on the statute book, a large number of people would not have the benefit of employment rights of any kind. That would be totally unacceptable. I understand that in some instances it may be felt that very small companies may have problems, but one cannot have a situation in which 250 people-quite a high number-do not have access to the employment rights that other people have.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="10020975000211"></a>Despite the progress that we have made, inequality persists in our society. The equality duty is an innovative approach to tackling discrimination. It requires public authorities to show leadership in proactively rooting out entrenched systems of discrimination and in promoting equality of opportunity. The roles of the public sector and of the bodies that provide public services are central to our equality goals, as public services are used by all, with many of the most vulnerable citizens dependent on them.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10020975000212"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, probably wished to speak to Amendment 115B, which concerns procurement. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, asked about the impact on SMEs and what further research had been done. I do not know, but I will come back to her in writing.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10020975000213"></a>The equality duty requires public bodies and other organisations which provide public services to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to foster good relations. It is difficult to understand why the size of an organisation should matter in considering the need to eliminate discrimination and promote equality. I think I am at one with the most reverend Primate on this. A number of small organisations provide services that could impact the lives of many in the community. For instance, at times, some of the health service bodies will have fewer than 50 employees but the service that they provide could have an impact on hundreds of people in the area. The same could be said for many schools.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10020975000214"></a>I understand that in the current fiscal climate some people think that compliance with the new integrated equality duty could lead to extra administrative burdens and bureaucracy. I do not think that is the case because, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, informed us, at the moment we have three different duties, each with different requirements and reporting timescales. Bringing them together into one duty should decrease bureaucracy, and our emphasis on specific duties on proportionality-outcomes rather than processes-should lead to less form-filling and increased results.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10020975000215"></a>The exclusion of public authorities, listed in Schedule 19, which have fewer than 250 staff, or of private organisations that are discharging public functions but have fewer than 250 staff, would seriously limit the coverage of the equality duty. For instance, the amendment would exclude around 70 per cent of all central and local government bodies from the equality duty and that is plainly wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10020975000216"></a>I accept that the amendment is probing but, should it be passed, it would seriously damage the good progress made by the current duties, as it would exempt from the new duty hundreds of public bodies which are subject to the current duties, and would result in serious regression.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="10020975000217"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, asked whether the charity foundation document or the equality duty would take precedence where a public body contracts out some of its functions to a charity. The charity would have to comply with its foundation document but, in performing public functions, it would also need to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination and promote equality in accordance with the duty, so it would have to look at both things.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10020975000218"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether the equality duty would apply to a single person performing a public function. Yes, it is important to remember that public functions are vital services which impact on the well-being of the public and, therefore, it is irrelevant whether it is delivered by a large organisation or a single person-a GP or a Secretary of State. She asked whether, if a public function were outsourced to a religious organisation, the exemption in paragraph 3 of Schedule 9 would still apply. Yes, it would. The equality duty operates alongside provisions prohibiting discrimination in the rest of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10020975000219"></a>I can answer the question which the noble Baroness asked about whether small authorities were consulted on the extension of the new duty to new strands. Yes, in June 2007, we launched a three-month public consultation on the proposal to extend the equality duty. Around 4,000 organisations and individuals responded, including small organisations and representatives of small organisations, such as schools and health service providers. I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_640"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 640</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>line with recommendations from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. I welcome the fact that the Minister tabled amendments on Friday which would meet with some of these recommendations and address most of the concerns raised by our amendments.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10020975000222"></a>Amendment 114ZB is tied into Schedule 18, which is about the public sector equality duty exceptions. Our amendment, following a recommendation by the DPRRC, would ensure that only primary legislation could amend the list of exemptions in this schedule with reference to judicial and parliamentary functions. We are very pleased that the Government have now accepted that there is no need to retain flexibility in this instance.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10020975000223"></a>Furthermore, perhaps there is a case for suggesting that it might be inappropriate for a Minister to be able to alter the exceptions relating to other organisations. Can the Minister clarify, for example, when there might be a case for removing the exemptions relating to the Security Service, the Secret Intelligence Service, the Government Communications Headquarters and part of the Armed Forces? Is there a specific need to retain the flexibility that regulations would allow, or does she agree that this sort of decision should be subject to primary legislation?</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10020975000224"></a>Our second set of amendments in this group, Amendments 115A and 135AA, add a similar power which is awarded to Clause 150(1). This subsection would allow the Minister to update Schedule 19 to include or exclude different bodies. In accordance with the recommendations from the DPRRC we tabled Amendment 115A. It would exclude judicial and parliamentary bodies from the regulation by which amendments can be made to the schedule and so make them subject to the public sector equality duty. Amendment 135AA would mean that the reduced power would also be subject to affirmative resolution for greater scrutiny. We welcome the Government's amendments which, like ours, are designed to meet this recommendation. I apologise; I have been editing my notes as a result of today's events and I think that I have probably edited them too much.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10020975000225"></a>However, the government amendments retain the negative power for the changes that occur when an entry is removed just because it has ceased to exist, or because it has changed its name. That seems sensible. Have the Government had any response from the DPRRC about whether this would meet its concerns? It seems a critical factor in knowing what their response is. Furthermore, what consultation has occurred with the devolved Ministries about the changes to their powers here? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10020975000227"></a>I am going to speak to government Amendments 114ZC, 115ZA, 135AB, 136ZZD, 136ZZE, 136ZAA, 136ZAB, 136ZAD, 136ZAE, 136ZAF, 136ZCA, 136ZCB and 136ZCD, which reflect the recommendations made

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10020975000228"></a>I shall speak first to government Amendment 114ZC. This seeks to achieve the same aim as the noble Baroness's Amendment 114ZB, in response to the committee's question whether it would be appropriate for the exceptions to the equality duty relating to judicial functions or those relating to parliamentary bodies to be removed or limited by statutory instrument. This amendment limits the power in paragraph 5 of Schedule 18 so that it cannot be used to remove these exceptions from Schedule 18. Primary legislation would therefore be required to remove or limit these exceptions. While there is no difference between the intentions of the noble Baroness's amendment and this one, we think that the wording of our amendment provides more precise clarification.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10020975000229"></a>Government Amendment 115ZA reflects the committee's recommendation that the power in Clause 150 to amend the list of public bodies subject to the duty, as referred to by the noble Baroness, should not be capable of listing the judicial and parliamentary bodies that are currently excluded from the scope of the duty by Schedule 18. The intention behind this amendment is the same as that behind Amendment 115A, which the noble Baroness spoke to. Again, however, we think that our wording provides greater clarity on this important matter.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10020975000230"></a>I turn now to Amendment 135AB,<b></b>which reflects the recommendation made in paragraph 11 that the power in Clause 150 should be subject to the affirmative procedure. The amendment is seeking the affirmative procedure to apply to the power to make changes to the list of bodies subject to the equality duty, except where we simply want to amend the entry for a body whose name may have changed or where a body is removed because it ceases to exist. We think that it will be more appropriate for the negative procedure to apply in these particular cases. To have to use the affirmative procedure for such minor issues is likely to be a waste of valuable parliamentary time. Of course, if Parliament wishes to debate any use of this power, it can still choose to do so by praying against a negative resolution order. The noble Baroness asked about removing exemptions on organisations such as security services, Armed Forces and so on. We are retaining a measure of flexibility because those organisations are susceptible to change and because they could change their names or merge.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10020975000231"></a>Amendment 135AA-this was missing from my notes-would delete what the Government have proposed and our Amendment 135AB would amend it. Amendments 136ZZD, 136ZZE, 136ZAA, 136ZAB, 136ZAD, 136ZAE, 136ZAF, 136ZCA, 136ZCB and 136ZCD ensure consistency with the Welsh and Scottish Ministers. I therefore invite the noble Baroness not to move Amendment 135AA.</p>

The debate about whether Ofqual should be included under the public sector equality duty was covered concisely and effectively in another place. I recall that in relation to this the Solicitor-General said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="10020975000300"></a>"I completely agree that Ofqual should be subject to the equality duty".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 30/6/09; col. 594.]</p>

<p><a name="10020975000284"></a>She said that that would be done after the Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Bill had passed through your Lordships' House and become an Act, thus giving Ofqual statutory status.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10020975000234"></a>Of course, we now have the Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Act, but I cannot see an amendment here to bring Ofqual into Schedule 19 and make it subject to the public sector equality duty. It may well be that there is a simple answer to this. Perhaps I have missed something that would explain this entirely. However, I have not seen an explanation, and it would be marvellous if the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster could enlighten me. I beg to move.</p>

I hope that that is just the result of the sort of unfortunate oversight that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, was so exercised about the other day. On the assumption that it is, I hope that the Government will commit to remedying the deficiencies in the schedule before it leaves this House.</p>

<a name="100209-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10020975000236"></a>The Government have given numerous commitments that all organisations covered by the current duties will be covered by the integrated duty. Exclusions that I have noticed include the Electoral Commission, which is surprising when one considers that only recently we were debating political diversity. The NHS is included, but none of its regulators are. The omission of regulators in general is concerning, as is the omission of a number of educational bodies. The General Teaching Council is just one example. As an avid supporter of the arts, I was particularly concerned not to see the Arts Council in the schedule. I could go on, but I shall not. It just remains for the Government to fulfil their commitments and put the schedule to rights. Of course they have the power to change the list by regulation, but they should not expect the Committee to buy a pig in a poke like that. They should populate the schedule comprehensively and reserve their order-making power for amending the list when bodies are created or wound-up. I therefore very much support the amendment.</p>

Ofqual, which will be formally established in April and will be the new independent regulator of qualifications and tests in England, must of course be subject to the equality duty. The Government would not contest that. I recognise what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said about the comments in the other place by my right honourable friend the Solicitor-General. However, we have since established that we do not need to add Ofqual to Schedule 19 to deliver the desired outcome. The Bill will achieve that without the noble Lord's amendment. The Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act, which received Royal Assent this autumn, establishes Ofqual as a non-ministerial government department, and government departments, including non-ministerial ones, are already covered in Part 1 of Schedule 19. This means that there is no need to include it as a separate entity within Schedule 19.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10020975000238"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low, suggested that Schedule 19 is practically empty and that the duty covers very few bodies. Schedule 19 as it stands is not the end of the story. At the moment it contains only core generic bodies, such as government departments, local authorities, NHS bodies, educational bodies and the police. We have been clear that we intend to update the schedule with more bodies. Now that we have publicly set out the requirements of the general duty, we want to talk further with other bodies that we think should be included in the schedule. Let me stress that, in broad terms, the duty will cover the same bodies as the current duties and there will be no reduction in coverage. I assure the noble Lord that we are not offering noble Lords a pig in a poke. The two-stage approach is the

It has allowed us to have informed discussions with those who we propose to list, and we will include them via regulations. There are no inconsistencies, and I hope that this brief explanation will persuade the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

In response to the questions from the noble Lord, Lord Low, our plan is to publish the list of organisations that we intend to be covered under Schedule 19 in the summer, at the same time as we consult on the draft regulations for specific duties. That is the timescale to which we are working. When we impose the specific duties, the regulations will be subject to the affirmative procedure, which means that government will have the opportunity to debate proposals fully.

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10020975000259"></a>Clause 154 gives the power to a Minister of the Crown, or to a Scottish or a Welsh Minister, to impose specific duties on public authorities listed in Schedule 19 that are also contracting authorities for public procurement purposes. The Minister may correct me if I am wrong, but I assumed that the Government's intentions are for public procurement to be another area in which the goal of equality can be pursued.</p>

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10020975000260"></a>We therefore tabled this probing amendment, which would make any order made under Clauses 152 or 153 subject to public sector directive 2004/18/EC and directive 2007/66/EC, merely to inquire as to the status of the European directives on public procurement that seem to undermine the Government's intentions in this area. I immediately apologise to the Committee for any confusion that may have been caused by the reference in the amendment to the "Public Sector Equality Directive". What was meant, of course, was "public sector directive".</p>

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10020975000261"></a>The intention is that public sector authorities should be able to use procurement as an extra tool to secure equality. The amendment seeks to clarify the extent to which the Government have taken the EU directives into account on this issue. I am sure that they have; I merely seek reassurance, which I believe the Minister will give. However, the Committee may find it useful if I explain why this is a complicated area.</p>

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10020975000262"></a>Public sector directive 2004/18/EC requires that public contracts are awarded on the basis of only two award criteria: "the most economically advantageous tender" or "the lowest price". In what way do the Government expect the public procurement provisions to work given these constraints?</p>

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10020975000263"></a>Public sector directive 2007/66/EC has provisions within it that state that there must be review procedures, which would include the award of damages to any person who is harmed by an infringement of the specifications of the directive. We therefore have one European directive which states that public procurement can be based only on two very narrow criteria, and

Have these directives been taken into account? What is the solution for ensuring that the Government's objective of equality-based public sector procurement can also occur? I look forward to hearing the response of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. I beg to move.</p>

I can offer that reassurance.</p>

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10020975000265"></a>Any regulations made under Clause 152 would have to be made with the EC directives in mind and any failure to comply with the directives, whether in the specific duties or any other legislation, could result in infraction proceedings. For this reason, it is superfluous to have an express provision in the Bill. Directive 2004/18/EC specifies the procedures that public bodies, known as contracting authorities, have to follow when awarding certain contracts for goods, services and works. Directive 2007/66/EC sets out the remedies that are available to economic operators who think that a contracting authority has breached the provisions of directive 2004/18/EC.</p>

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10020975000266"></a>Both directives have been transposed into UK law by the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 and the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006. I should like to make it clear that the Government do not propose to use the specific duties to alter either the procedures set out in directive 2004/18/EC or the remedies prescribed in directive 2007/66/EC and that any attempt to put this in the Bill is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10020975000267"></a>The public sector spent approximately £220 billion last year on goods and services. That is a huge amount of money and much of it went to private providers following the public procurement procedures. The public sector has an important opportunity to use its purchasing power to promote equality wherever possible and it has legal obligations under the equality duty to do so. Achieving value for money and delivering wider and improved social outcomes, such as equality objectives, often go hand in hand. The procurement proposal in the Bill makes this relationship clear.</p>

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10020975000268"></a>In June 2009, the Government consulted on policy proposals for the specific duties, including proposals relating to public procurement. Last month, the Government published a policy statement in response to the consultation. The policy statement includes proposals for specific duties requiring contracting authorities to consider the use of equality-related award criteria where they relate to the subject matter of the contract and are proportionate, and to consider incorporating equality-related contract conditions where they relate to the performance of the contract and are proportionate.</p>

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="10020975000269"></a>Both those proposals require any proposed action taken by a contracting authority to be proportionate and to relate to the subject matter of the contract in

For example, as part of a major estate renovation scheme and in an attempt to redress the local and national under-representation of women in building trades, a local council could include a contract condition that requires 10 per cent of the person weeks required to complete the works to be delivered by women who have either an apprenticeship, traineeship or employment contract with the contractor or sub-contractor and are engaged in a training programme which is accepted by the employer. The current procurement regulations allow for this contract condition because 10 per cent would be considered proportionate and the proposals in the Bill will not change this.</p>

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10020975000270"></a>The Government policy statement also included the proposal that public authorities should, when setting their equality objectives and how they intend to achieve them, set out how they will use their public procurements to help meet their equality objectives. For instance, the evidence collected by an NHS trust might show that a particular section of the community within a diverse area is inadvertently excluded from accessing a service. An equality objective might be to redress this exclusion to ensure the service is offered, as it should be, to all sections of the community. The trust would need to consider how its procurements might help it to achieve this objective. These procurement proposals were subject to extensive consultation and views expressed were mixed. However, there was a general acceptance for the inclusion of equality-related measures that were relevant to the contract and proportionate.</p>

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10020975000271"></a>The directives do not undermine the provisions in the Bill and we do not believe that there is a contradiction between award criteria that take into account the most economically advantageous tender and equality; for example, quality is a permitted criteria when deciding the most economically advantageous tender. Quality will be linked to many equality issues, such as whether a service meets the needs of users from all sections of the community.</p>

<a name="100209-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10020975000272"></a>I believe that the package of proposals that we intend to take forward in regulation is proportionate and appropriate. Again, I confirm that the new proposals comply with the European legislation that regulates public procurement.</p>

I should emphasise that we on these Benches strongly support both clauses and oppose any dilution of them, and that both clauses are permissive, not mandatory. My amendment to Clause 157 is probing in nature and not intended to hobble or curtail its scope or effect. The amendment to Clause 158 is intended to state in the Bill, in the interests of legal certainty, what is required by EU equality law; namely, compliance with the principle of proportionality. That would be in accordance with the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Human Rights at paragraph 289 of its report on the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="100209107000002"></a>Positive action is a necessary element in the concept of equality, as the European Court of Human Rights reaffirmed in the DH and others v Czech Republic case. Article 14 of the convention does not prohibit a member state from treating groups differently in order to correct what it calls "factual inequalities between them". In some circumstances, a failure to attempt to correct inequality through differential treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of Article 14. That is also true of EU equality law. Article 7 of the framework directive provides that with a view to ensuring,</p>
<ul><a name="100209107000193"></a>"full equality in practice, the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any member state from maintaining or adopting specific measures to prevent or compensate for disadvantages linked to any of the grounds listed in Article 1".</ul>



<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_651"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 651</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="100209107000158"></a>It recognises that a concept of literal equality is too narrow. In William Blake's words:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="100209107000173"></a>"One Law for the Lion and the Ox is Oppression".</p>

<p><a name="100209107000159"></a>The relevant Explanatory Notes are important. Both here and throughout, they are expressed with great clarity, for which we should be grateful to their authors. I want to mention that particularly because I have not read Explanatory Notes of this quality before, and although I must not name their authors, I think that if I could do so, I would say that Melanie Field and James Maskell between them have done the most extraordinary job I have ever seen. I hope that future Bill teams will work to that high quality. Paragraph 525 explains that Clause 157 provides that,</p>
<ul><a name="100209107000194"></a>"the Bill does not prohibit the use of positive action measures to alleviate disadvantage experienced by people who share a protected characteristic, reduce their under-representation in relation to particular activities, and meet their particular needs. It will, for example, allow measures to be targeted to particular groups, including training to enable them to gain employment, or health services to address their needs. Any such measures must be a proportionate way of achieving the relevant aim".</ul>
<p><a name="100209107000160"></a>Paragraph 526 explains that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="100209107000174"></a>"The extent to which it is proportionate to take positive action measures which may result in people not having the relevant characteristic being treated less favourably will depend, among other things, on the seriousness of the relevant disadvantage, the extremity of need or under-representation and the availability of other means of countering them. This provision will need to be interpreted in accordance with European law which limits the extent to which the kind of action it permits will be allowed".</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="100209107000003"></a>To comply with the principle of proportionality, the positive action measure in question must both pursue a legitimate aim and be necessary to achieve that aim. Clause 157(1) relates to the European legal principle that measures must be shown to be necessary and focused on a specific disadvantage, requiring that the person concerned reasonably thinks that paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) apply. Clause 157(2)(a), (b) and (c) define the legitimate aims that may be pursued. I note that the Official Opposition have not tabled any amendments to limit the scope of Clause 157 by substituting "can demonstrate" for "reasonably thinks", as they have done in the next group in relation to Clause 158, to which I now turn.</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="100209107000004"></a>It is important to record that paragraph 532 of the Explanatory Notes explains that Clause 158,</p>

This can be done only where the candidates are as qualified as each other. The question of whether one person is as qualified as another is not a matter only of academic qualification, but rather a judgment based on the criteria the employer uses to establish who is best for the job which could include matters such as suitability, competence and professional performance. The clause does not allow employers to have a policy or practice of automatically treating people who share a protected characteristic more favourably than those who do not have it in these circumstances; each case must be considered on its merits".</ul>

The Explanatory Notes explain in paragraph 535 that the clause is new:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="100209107000175"></a>"While current legislation allows employers to undertake a variety of positive action measures, for instance, offering training and encouragement for certain forms of work, it does not allow employers to take any form of positive action at the point of recruitment or promotion. This clause extends what is possible to the extent permitted by European law, and applies in relation to all protected characteristics".</p>

<p><a name="100209107000161"></a>This is an important advance on current law. When I helped prepare the sex discrimination and race relations Acts in the mid-1970s, we included narrowly restrictive provisions allowing positive action to be taken to encourage women and members of ethnic minorities to apply for jobs where they were underrepresented, and to provide them with special training. But we were unable to obtain agreement to allow any form of positive action at the point of recruitment or promotion. That was regrettable and is one reason why employers have made insufficient use of the positive action provisions. They may encourage women or ethnic-minority individuals to apply for work where they are underrepresented, such as in the police service, and they may give them special training to equip them for the work, but they may not use underrepresentation as a reason for appointing, say, a woman or a person from an ethnic minority who is as qualified as other candidates in preference to a candidate who does not share the relevant protected characteristic.</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="100209107000006"></a>As regards my own profession as a barrister, the Equality and Diversity Committee of the Bar Council, in a 2007 response to a government consultation on the Bill, explained why greater and clearer positive action measures are needed under the law. The committee pointed out that the current law limits positive action measures to a greater extent than is permitted by the relevant European directives. Currently, for example, apprenticeships and other on-the-job training schemes cannot be used as positive action measures. It argued for the need for a wider range of "voluntary balancing measures" to be available to organisations and employers. Thinking of the profession of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, the Law Society in response to the same consultation also indicated that further "balancing measures" are needed. We therefore welcome the changes made in Clause 158 to encourage much greater use of positive action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="100209107000007"></a>The Official Opposition seek, in Amendments 117 and 118, to restrict the scope and effect of Clause 158 and apparently intend to oppose the Question that Clause 158 should stand part of the Bill, even though in the other place they did not seek to remove the clause. It is questionable whether the amendments would make any practical difference other than to cause confusion and limit the effectiveness of Clause 158. It is ironical that they should do so, for it was the Thatcher Government who, in the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989, introduced a far more robust system of positive action to combat discrimination against Catholics and Protestants in the workplace, drawing on the Canadian employment equity approach which incorporated monitoring and affirmative action, but not quotas. The 1989 legislation of the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, provided for compulsory religious monitoring by both public sector and private  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_653"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 653</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sector employers. It required employers, at least every three years, to review their employment practices and to compare the religious composition of their workforce with available labour in the catchment area. The legislation also provides for affirmative action measures which exclude quotas but include the setting of goals, timetables and outreach measures.</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="100209107000008"></a>Monitoring covers about 70 per cent of all employees in Northern Ireland and all employments with 11 or more employees. The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland has kindly informed me that the data reveal that substantial progress has been made and that a sizeable body of independent research evidence shows that the legislative provisions and their implementation have been successful in improving employment equality. The Conservative Party may and should claim credit for introducing the 1989 scheme. It is therefore ironical that it now opposes the much narrower provisions of Clause 158, which are entirely permissive and voluntary and subject to the proportionality principle. My amendment seeks to put the proportionality principle explicitly on the face of Clause 158, and I hope that the Government will be able to accept it.</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="100209107000009"></a>I should add that this group also includes Amendment 119, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, which would give blanket permission to discriminate in favour of the over-50s and disabled people without reference to proportionality. That would clearly violate European law. There is of course nothing to prevent more favourable treatment of disabled people; Clause 13 so provides. The positive action provisions in the Bill apply to disability, unlike the Disability Discrimination Act, to permit positive action between different types of disability-for example, permitting an employer to target training at people with learning disabilities, or to target advertising at people with sight impairments. In relation to age, as well as the positive discrimination measures permitted by Clauses 157 and 158, Clause 13 provides that age discrimination is not prohibited where it is a more proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.</p>

It is not to get rid of Clause 158, because we are happy with "positive action"; it is to allow us to raise our concerns about the operation of the clause.

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="100209107000012"></a>Amendments 117 and 118 are designed to change the language of the clause from "as qualified as" to "equally qualified to". As I have already explained, we raised Clause 158 stand part to allow further discussion about what is a very important clause. We do not like the clause if it is to be used as positive discrimination, but we would be happy with it if it were to be used as "positive action", as the title suggests. We are concerned that without our amendments the clause will verge towards the former, which we could not agree to.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_654"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 654</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100209-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="100209107000013"></a>The first point that I want to raise is that I was under the impression that the Government intended this clause to be about "positive action". This is made clear not only by the title of the clause itself, but also by the statement made by the Minister for Women and Equality, Harriet Harman, at Second Reading in another place. She presented this clause on that occasion saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="100209107000196"></a>"the Bill includes the power to take positive action",</ul>
<p><a name="100209107000162"></a>to change the situation whereby, if an employer,</p>
<ul><a name="100209107000197"></a>"is faced with two equally qualified candidates, one a man and one a woman",</ul>
<p><a name="100209107000163"></a>in this example,</p>
<ul><a name="100209107000198"></a>"the employer cannot actually say, 'Right, we've got two equally qualified people for this job, but I'm going to take you, because you're a woman and I want to diversify my management team'".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/5/09; cols. 557-58.]</ul>
<a name="100209-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="100209107000014"></a>It seems clear that the Government agree with us that this clause should be used for a tie-breaker situation between two candidates who are equally qualified. We would very much support the use of positive action in this way. It is clear that there may sometimes be a desire to discriminate in favour of a candidate with one particular characteristic. The example which has been done to death is one where a job vacancy has opened up in a primary school, when all the interviews, checks and tests have been carried out and the two candidates left are equally qualified to do the job. In this presumably rare situation, the employer would then be allowed to choose the male candidate, with the protected characteristic of gender being the factor which gave him the lead over the other candidate, who was equally qualified.</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="100209107000015"></a>I hope very much that the noble Baroness the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster can confirm the Government's views on this clause. We have heard what Harriet Harman said about it in May in another place. By the time the Bill reached your Lordships' House, however, a different tune was being played. The Minister introduced the clause saying that it,</p>
<ul><a name="100209107000199"></a>"allows ... but does not compel",-[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/12/09; col. 1408.]</ul>
<p><a name="100209107000164"></a>employers to recruit a person from an underrepresented group in their workforce when choosing between otherwise equal candidates for recruitment or promotion. This seems to give a different emphasis on the clause. My understanding from this statement is that employers would be allowed to make a choice from a pool of candidates rather than select one person in a tie-break situation.</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="100209107000016"></a>The Explanatory Notes lend a little more credence to this. One of the examples states that, where the police service employs disproportionately low numbers of people from an ethnic-minority background, and where a number of candidates were,</p>
<ul><a name="100209107000200"></a>"as qualified as each other",</ul>
<p><a name="100209107000165"></a>preferential selection can be made,</p>
<ul><a name="100209107000201"></a>"to a candidate from an ethnic minority background".</ul>
<p><a name="100209107000166"></a>Our fear is that this clause is there to allow, in effect, positive discrimination. It appears that, instead of a clause which allows employers to make decisions based on protected characteristics in a tie-break, this clause is going to be much broader. We need to clarify this. In  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_655"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 655</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fact, would it allow employers to make a decision based on a protected characteristic when there is a pool of candidates who are considered all to be above a certain level of qualification and so can be considered as "qualified as each other"? We could not support that. It would be helpful, for the sake of clarity, if the Minister could confirm whether the Government's policy is indeed that this should only be used in a tie-break situation.</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="100209107000017"></a>Clarity is necessary because the Minister in another place said that we should not worry because Clause 158(4)(b) prevented any kind of "policy" decision. In other words, this would mean that a company could not have a policy of favouring groups who shared a protected characteristic. I wonder whether this fits with the Government's seeming change of heart about whether this provision should relate to a tie-break or pool situation. The example given in the Explanatory Notes about the police recruiting ethnic minorities seems to show instead what I would have assumed subsection (4)(b) was designed to prevent. Therefore I look to the noble Baroness the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to clarify that for us. Does subsection (4)(b) prevent a blanket policy-a policy in relation to all recruitment drives-but allow a general policy in relation to one appointment?</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="100209107000018"></a>To put it another way, is it the Government's intention that a company should be able to say, "We have not employed many of this particular section of people recently", then advertise a job, interview people from all backgrounds but, when it has found a pool of 20 candidates with the relevant qualifications and skills, to pick the candidate representing what it believes to be an unrepresented class or people over the others? We welcome the commitment to positive action, but this is not the clause we felt we were welcoming when it was first introduced in another place. We are now looking for some reassurance.</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="100209107000019"></a>We believe that a clause which allows a decision to be made on a protected characteristic for a legitimate reason is very sensible and gives employers a reasonable freedom. If, however, the policy is broadened so that it is likened to positive discrimination, then it will do more damage than good to the cause of equality in a society which believes also very firmly in a meritocracy.</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="100209107000020"></a>We have seen that many of the business organisations agree with the principle of this clause, but they need essential clarity to allow it to operate effectively. The CBI, for example, has told us that it welcomes the intention, but feels the clause is poorly drafted. It is uncertain how it will work in practice. It calls it a tie break. It would be helpful if the Minister could address that point directly in her remarks. The British Retail Consortium also supports the clause, saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="100209107000202"></a>"businesses should be supported to address under-representation in their workforces".</ul>
<p><a name="100209107000167"></a>However, it believes that,</p>
<ul><a name="100209107000203"></a>"it is imperative that legislation and accompanying guidance is clear on how this should be done to ensure employers do not end up falling foul of the law".</ul>
<a name="100209-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="100209107000021"></a>The British Chambers of Commerce agree with this point, saying that the language is too confusing. The Bill uses "as qualified", but the Solicitor-General uses  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_656"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 656</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>"equally acceptable". To be consistent with European law, we believe that we should use "equally qualified", as the amendment does. They also think that the situation the Government are trying to describe is one where there are two equally qualified candidates. We are looking to the Minister to make this entirely clear in her response. I hope also that she will agree that, for the sake of clarity and the correct use of the provision in the Bill, it is possible to accept our amendments. I also await with interest her response to the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lester. He has explained that they are to clarify the use of this procedure and ensure that it is used only in the correct specific circumstances, namely when it is a,</p>
<ul><a name="100209107000204"></a>"proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim",</ul>
<p><a name="100209107000168"></a>concerning positive action regarding those with a protected characteristic which might otherwise disadvantage them. However, the most important area to clarify is that which we have raised-namely, the need to make absolutely clear that positive action can apply only in a tie break.</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="100209107000022"></a>I shall mention the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lady Knight, who sadly is unable to be with us. It raises an interesting issue. We would hope that nothing in this Bill would prevent those over 50 or who are disabled from being integrated into the workforce to address discrimination against these groups, if they were the suitable candidates for the job. However, we cannot support positive discrimination, so this must happen only when a tie break has occurred and two people who are equally qualified have been identified. It is only at this point that a selection on the basis of a protected characteristic should be made.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, does not quarrel with those words in Clause 157, so why does he quarrel with them in Clause 158? The wording must be "reasonably thinks" because it is very difficult to demonstrate that the employer has all the facts and reasons, and I am not always convinced that things are as transparent and clear to the person being interviewed. If you have reason to believe that you have been discriminated against, that is all that you require. Then it is for the employer to demonstrate that they have not done that. I should rather put it that way round than require the person who "reasonably thinks" that they have been discriminated against to demonstrate it. For those reasons, I do not think that the words in Clause 158 should be changed, as they are not being asked to be changed in Clause 157.</p>

Many people who I have dealt with genuinely believe that they have been discriminated against and have gone through the tribunal and all kinds of different things and still think that they are being discriminated against. You then realise that what they want to do is not proportionate. If there had been a proviso right at the beginning, there is a chance that it would have concentrated the mind. I support the noble Lord's change to "provided it", because it subtly asks whether a person really has grounds and whether it is so proportionate that it will achieve their aims and objectives. The noble Lord and I know of many cases which we have pursued and have been taken all around but which have achieved nothing. I want the noble Lord's probing amendment to be more than probing and to be inserted, because it says it better that simply "which is".</p>

<a name="100209-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="100209107000027"></a>We have already meandered from Clause 157 to Clause 158. I prefer the phrase "as qualified as", because "equally qualified to" is mathematical. How would you measure it? How will someone know that I am equally as qualified? I sit in your Lordships' House, and I do not think that I am equally qualified as some of your Lordships. It is better simply to say "as qualified as". It is more humbling and more genuine, so I shall stick with that phrase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="100209107000028"></a>Finally, on "to be recruited or promoted", I do not understand why that should be narrowed. I would rather have both. Of course, some people always worry that positive action means positive discrimination, but the word discrimination can be used in two different ways. In the Latin as well as the Greek, discrimination is the same word as discernment. I understand in this sense that positive action and promotion or recruitment means that it is discerning, not simply leaving someone out. I should rather use the same phrase-which for me is not positive discrimination but positive discernment. Unfortunately, some people do not discern that. I would not quarrel with the drafting as it is, except to say that "provided it is proportionate" is a much stronger way in which to put it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="100209107000030"></a>Clause 157 builds on and simplifies the current legislative framework for positive action. For the first time, these provisions will be extended to cover all protected characteristics and will apply to them all in exactly the same way. As long as the relevant criteria are met, these provisions can be used to address disadvantage, encourage participation where people with a particular protected characteristic are underrepresented, or meet particular needs. For example, a construction firm wishing to diversify its male-dominated workforce could add a statement to its job advertisement inviting women to apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="100209107000031"></a>Clause 158 enables employers to take targeted action with regard to recruitment and promotion. This will assist employers to address underrepresentation and disadvantage, fill skills gaps, and create a more diverse

The decision to extend the existing, more limited, provisions has been welcomed by businesses as a beneficial move. Any use of these provisions remains entirely voluntary; it is not a mandatory requirement. However, to ensure that employers do not misuse these voluntary measures, Clause 158(4) ensures that employers cannot adopt a blanket policy of favouring candidates simply because they have a protected characteristic and are disadvantaged or underrepresented. Each case must be considered on its merits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="100209107000032"></a>Clause 158 does not permit positive discrimination, nor is it contrary to the "merit principle". It simply allows an employer, when faced with two candidates who are as qualified as each other to carry out a specific job, to use the desirability of widening the diversity of the workforce as the criterion for choosing between them. I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that my emphasis is no different to that expressed by my right honourable friend Harriet Harman in another place: there has been no change of heart. I am grateful to the most reverend Primate for his very reasonable support for these clauses.</p>

I completely agree with the noble Lord: we would not want the provision to permit action which is disproportionate, or to allow employers or service providers to misuse positive action measures in any way. However, to the great disappointment of the most reverend Primate, I can assure the noble Lord that Clause 157 as drafted will not allow positive action in any circumstances where it is not proportionate. Accordingly, replacing "which" with the alternative suggestion would have no impact on the intent or effect of this provision. Therefore, I urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="100209107000035"></a>Amendment 118A would make it explicit that any positive action measure taken in recruitment and promotion under Clause 158 has to be a proportionate means of achieving the aims set out in subsection (2) -helping people overcome a disadvantage or participate in an activity. While we consider that Clause 158 as drafted already implicitly embodies a requirement for proportionality, I accept that there are benefits to making proportionality an explicit requirement: it would it make clearer what this clause is about, allowing employers to take positive action where proportionate, and also better reflect the terminology used in Clause 157, where proportionality is already explicit. I am therefore content to accept Amendment 118A.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="100209107000036"></a>Amendment 117 would change the present wording of the provisions in Clause 158(4)(a) from "as qualified as" to "equally qualified to". Amendment 118 seeks to delete "to be recruited or promoted" from the qualification criteria. We believe these amendments are misconceived and we will therefore resist them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="100209107000037"></a>It has been claimed that Clause 158 would allow employers to set an artificially low qualification threshold for a job to enable them to gerrymander the selection of the successful candidate-the idea that the pass mark is set so low that almost everyone will make the grade, in the hope that at least one candidate has a targeted protected characteristic. Clause 158 does not permit an employer to recruit or promote a candidate who is less qualified than another just because the employer wants to address disadvantage or underrepresentation-in any event, this would make no business sense. Where the assessment process, in whatever form it takes, evaluates one candidate as having scored, say, 95 per cent and another 61 per cent, those candidates cannot be considered as being as qualified as each other to undertake the job. It is immaterial whether the pass mark was set at 60 per cent, 50 per cent or 40 per cent; the clearly superior candidate must always be offered the job. We are confident that the clause as drafted achieves that effect.</p>

<a name="100209-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="100209107000038"></a>We consider that the amendments could have the effect of leading employers to interpret the clause too narrowly by considering the provisions as being solely about the equality of qualifications per se. An employer might misinterpret such wording as a requirement that candidates should have identical qualifications, whereas the provision is designed to be available where both candidates have demonstrated that they have met the employer's particular requirements for the post to a comparable standard. Any assessment of candidates' suitability will depend on a number of factors relevant to the job in question, such as experience, aptitude, physical ability, or performance during an interview or assessment. Formal qualifications are only one way in which a candidate's overall suitability may be assessed.</p>

<a name="100209-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="100209107000039"></a>The impact of such a misinterpretation could be that employers will be reluctant to use the provision unless they have a situation in which candidates have absolutely identical qualifications, or identical scores if a scoring system is part of the assessment process, rather than looking at the respective ability and suitability of each candidate in the round. This would limit the scope for delivering real equality outcomes for women particularly, people from ethnic minority communities and disabled people, for example, who still experience disadvantage and underrepresentation in the labour market. For those reasons, I urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="100209-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="100209107000040"></a>I will briefly mention Amendment 119, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Knight of Collingtree, which would appear to permit any action intended to increase the participation of people aged over 50 and disabled people in the labour market. This amendment is unnecessary. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, helpfully explained how the disability and age discrimination provisions in the Bill permit a wider range of differential treatment than is available for the other protected characteristics. In addition, this Government have done much to increase the labour market participation of people aged over 50 and disabled people through targeted programmes such as the Flexible New Deal, which provides tailored help for jobless people of all ages, including those aged 50 and over. I therefore

When I listen to him on the subject of discrimination, I always feel that he speaks not only as a very distinguished archbishop, but as a human being who understands exactly what the problems of discrimination are, and looks at these issues not as a lawyer but in a common-sense way to make the law work in practice.</p>

We have a different kind of experience, because we are constantly seeking to choose pupils and tenants on the basis of individual merit. I have discussed these provisions of the Bill with the diversity team in my chambers, and they are happy to work within that framework. I have been persuaded by what the Minister has said that proportionality is already fully within Clause 157, and that my words add nothing-although I am very grateful that the most reverend Primate prefers them to those already there. It is not for me to second guess parliamentary counsel, once I am satisfied that the substance is there.</p>

The most reverend Primate was also talking about "reasonably thinks". I think that is in the next group of amendments, so although I agree with him, we will come back to that later. I share the view of the Minister and the Government about the other amendments. This is, therefore, an opportune moment for me to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Last night, the Commons voted to reject the proposal to bring the period's end forward to 31 March. We believe from these Benches that it would be wrong to allow what are acknowledged to be temporary provisions to continue any longer than necessary. Indeed, as the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, reminded the House, not many days ago the Government were considering introducing the long Bill now, rather than putting any temporary arrangements in place in the interim.</p>

<a name="100209-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="100209107000045"></a>My honourable friend the Member for Cambridge rumbled the Government's objections to the July date because, had they accepted it, it would have amounted to acknowledging that the general election will be on 6 May. The Minister said yesterday that it was "not certain"-I think that she used those words-that it would be possible to undertake the proper scrutiny of the Bill, given the upcoming general election and recesses, if it were earlier than 31 December. However, December really is a long period in which to allow an unsatisfactory situation to continue to apply. We are talking about provisions that relate to the liberty of the subject. In our view, a Bill relating to the liberty of the subject-the longer Bill-should have priority.</p>

<a name="100209-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="100209107000046"></a>As we are all human, the temptation must be that, if we have a period that runs until December-I say "we" because I suppose that noble Lords will know that we have until December, whereas those in the other place will not know precisely who is batting until then-it is unlikely that anything very energetic will happen until after the Summer Recess. In other words, that would be October, and minds need to be focused and steps taken before that.</p>

<a name="100209-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="100209107000047"></a>I see that Amendment 1A, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, proposes the long-stop date of 30 April. In real terms, I am not sure whether that is any different from 31 March; I wonder how firmly her tongue was in her cheek in proposing that. She indicates that it was not, but I shall wait to hear what she says. There will certainly be some elections in early May, whether or not the general election is then. We believe that ours is a reasonable mid-point, and I beg to move.</p>

The key issue for the Committee is when we can scrutinise primary legislation, because there is agreement on all sides of the Committee that the previous regime of orders under the 1946 Act has to be replaced by primary legislation. Not even the Government will claim that if the Bill completes its passage in your Lordships' House this evening there will have been full parliamentary approval for the three orders that were damned by the Supreme Court's judgment. Our support for the Bill is linked exclusively to the consequences of dealing with terrorism if the vacuum caused by the Supreme Court's judgment is not filled immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="100209107000049"></a>Both the structure of the Bill and the timing constraints of our deliberations mean that parliamentary approval is more formal than substantive. We cannot realistically debate the contents of the three orders, and it is pretty

We might have less difficulty with the 2009 order, in that it has taken on board some of the criticisms made in the courts, but it, too, has problems, or at least substantive issues that ought to be debated. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has tabled amendments to the Long Title of the Bill in order to accommodate some substantive amendments which we will consider later. As I said earlier, however, I do not believe that that is an ideal way to proceed.</p>

<a name="100209-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="100209107000050"></a>The Government have laid Command Paper 7806, which contains a full draft Terrorist Asset-Freezing Bill, complete with Explanatory Notes and an impact statement. As I explained on Second Reading this afternoon, we had agreed timing with the Government such that the Bill would have had two days in the other place-today and in the week after Recess-followed by three days in your Lordships' House, over a period ending roughly in mid-March. The chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights confirmed that his committee could have handled that March timing. The Government have now put that longer Bill on the back burner and proceeded only with this temporary provisions Bill, which is not entirely unsatisfactory. We, like the Liberal Democrats, believe that the Bill should not remain on the statute book any longer than necessary.</p>

<a name="100209-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="100209107000051"></a>Amendment 1A says that the Bill can stay on the statute book until the end of April. My honourable friend Mr Mark Hoban moved a similar amendment in another place yesterday, with the date of 31 March. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, accused me of having my tongue in my cheek when I moved that date to 30 April. Perhaps I might explain that I have used that slightly longer date because of the Government's decision not to proceed along the lines earlier agreed; that has set back the timetable of getting the Bill through. If a general election comes along before we have concluded our deliberations on a longer Bill, I would hope that we could have completed sufficient scrutiny to allow that arcane process known as wash-up to deal with the rest of the Bill. That might have to stretch into April, depending on when the election is called-assuming, of course, that an election is held on 6 May. I think that that is most people's working assumption, although it could be later.</p>

<a name="100209-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="100209107000052"></a>The date of 31 July, proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, causes real problems in the context of the general election, which is why if she chooses to test the opinion of the Committee, we will not support her on it. If the Government do nothing in respect of the draft Bill in Command Paper 7806, a new Government formed in early May would not have enough time to process the Bill in the ordinary way-that is to say, using the normal intervals and processes by 31 July. I would hope that if my party formed that Government, we would review and amend the draft before putting it before Parliament. A July sunset would be the most undesirable outcome in that context. If we cannot deal with the issue this side of an election on an expedited process, then, as I explained, we will need a longer period-quite possibly until the end of this year-to prepare legislation and then subject it to scrutiny in the normal way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="100209107000053"></a>I could have done as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has done and tabled detailed amendments to the Bill in order to debate the substantive concerns that remain with the formulation that appears in the 2009 terrorism order, but that is merely to tinker with an interim solution. Our strong preference is for Parliament to scrutinise the detailed legislative proposals in the context of draft legislation set out in Command Paper 7806 or something like it. I cannot force the Government to bring a draft Bill to Parliament, but if the sunset clause is set at a modest end-April date, that would require the Government to act now by introducing a draft Bill or something else, rather than sit on their hands and wait for another Government to clear up the mess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="100209107000054"></a>Of course I hope that my party will form the next Government and that Treasury Ministers will be led by my honourable friend Mr George Osborne. If we come to power, those Ministers will have quite enough to do to clear up the economy and the mess that it is in without having also to deal with the aftermath of a decade of incorrect use of statutory powers. That is why I hope the Government will think again and put proper primary legislation through the House as rapidly as possible.</p>

There may well be a case for having an even longer period, but it seems to me that if any of the amendments proposing other dates were carried, the House would impose on itself a wholly unnecessary straitjacket. Of course, when we are dealing with legislation that is accelerated in this way, there is a legal and moral incumbency on us to see that it is operated for as short a period as is humanly possible. However, we are dealing with extremely complicated situations that need a great deal of thought. Although the draft Bill has been proposed for this short term, it has to be considered from all possible angles. It seems to me that there should be the maximum consultation with all manner of bodies. Why, therefore, confine it to a matter of weeks or, indeed, a few months, if one is speaking of 31 July as a time limit? That is the first reason. It seems to me that there is no case for a wholly unnecessary spectacle of speed and, indeed, of thoughtlessness in this matter, when there is every possible reason for taking as much time as is reasonably necessary in the circumstances.</p>

<a name="100209-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="100209107000056"></a>The second reason is perhaps somewhat less clear, and that arises from the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Myners, at Second Reading, when he indicated-I hope that I do him no injustice-that the Government's mind was not closed not only in relation to the idea of a longer-term Bill on this matter but in relation to consolidating powers of confiscation, freezing and exercising authority over the property of persons who may be involved in serious crime or, indeed, in terrorism. I appreciate that the noble Lord, Lord Myners, most certainly did not give any undertaking in that regard. I also appreciate that consolidation is now rather different from what it was about 40 years ago when I was a Member of another place and served on one or two consolidation Bill committees, when it was a very mechanical exercise altogether. One did not have to

It was simply a question of arithmetic, of adding two and two and two and two and coming to a conclusion. Consolidation now is much more creative. One has to consider not only the sheer crude mathematics of various statutory provisions but how one must flesh out a little here or pare a little there. Few Governments in the past 20 or 30 years have ever applied their minds to that sort of consolidation, but certainly on a matter as complicated as this-I think of the ordinary simple lawyer who has to advise a client on where he or she stands in relation to such a matter-it would be a very great blessing indeed. However, you probably could not do it in a matter of months and probably not by 31 December 2010. In those circumstances, therefore, I urge the Committee to consider that all the alternatives to 31 December 2010 are utterly impractical.</p>

We are being asked today to approve a temporary measure on the basis that we will not have a proper opportunity fully to debate the substantive measures. I think that we all accept that those substantive measures will have a very serious effect on the individuals concerned. It is therefore incumbent on the Committee to ensure that the sunset clause is as near to today as is reasonably practicable. As I see it, the only issue is how long it will take as a matter of practicality before the substantive Bill can be properly scrutinised. That covers pre-legislative scrutiny, as well as the debate in this House and in the other place. I am surprised that the Government take the view that it will take as long as another 10 months for that to occur, even allowing for the general election and the Summer Recess. I suggest to the Committee that it is incumbent on the Minister to explain-with respect, he has not yet explained this, nor was it explained in the other House yesterday-why it is not practical for Parliament to address the substantive matters more speedily than a sunset clause of 31 December suggests.</p>

As we have discussed today, the issues raised by the asset-freezing legislation are clearly complex and very important. Essentially, we all want to strike the right balance between the needs of national security and the protection of human rights, but reasonable people can and do differ about where the appropriate balance lies. Should the legal test be reasonable suspicion or something higher? Is the judicial review procedure a sufficient legal check on Executive power in this area, or do we require more? These are very significant issues that require careful analysis and consideration and where we need to take account of the views of a wide range of interested parties. With a deadline of 31 July, or the end of April, as proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, I do not think that we leave ourselves sufficient time to address these and other important issues.</p>

We have to be mindful that with an election pending there will be significantly less parliamentary time available between now and the end of July than there would normally be, so I do not think that an earlier date than 31 December is the right approach. However, in putting this forward, I reassure the Committee on two points. First, we will ensure that serious pre-legislative scrutiny will occur. Secondly, we will progress legislation in a timely fashion, though I am mindful of the strictures of the noble Lord, Lord King of Bridgwater, that I must not seek to write a Queen's Speech in advance of the appropriate time.</p>

If we had put an earlier date on the sunset clause such as the end of April or the end of May, the predominant view expressed in the House is that we would be allowing inadequate time for scrutiny and that that ran the risk of legislation that had not been critically examined. Parliament would wish to see us strike a balance. We would like to be able to complete the process before 31 December and, with a fair wind, that is possible.

Pre-legislative scrutiny given by the

It is certainly pre-legislative scrutiny, but the idea is that a Joint Committee would be very comprehensive and include the kind of consultation to which the Minister referred. If one is to do this exercise properly-and it is quite a difficult exercise-and finish it before 31 December, the parliamentary system will have to work very well.</p>

Do they intend to seek to set up a Joint Committee of both Houses to commence the work of scrutinising the draft legislation and when do they intend to do that? Alternatively, do they intend to start a consultation process with a public call for people to comment on the command paper that they issued last week? The command paper is rather curious. It is a wrapper around a draft Bill with Explanatory Notes and an impact statement, but without a foreword or any kind of explanation of why it is there. The Minister has referred to pre-legislative scrutiny, but it would be helpful to know what the Government's intentions are.</p>

I would expect others to express views on that matter. I have already indicated my expectation that there should be a call for evidence and an expression of views and opinions and that that should be wide and comprehensive because of the delicate and sensitive matters involved. We are trying to strike the right balance between protecting national interests from the threat of terrorism while at the same time not encroaching on the civil liberties of individuals. Parliament needs to show itself to be open to a wide range of opinions and questions.</p>

Surely the Government have plans. They have come in with a proposal for a sunset date of the end of December. What plans do the Government have to consult? As I pointed out, the command paper containing the draft legislation was issued in a sort of void last week and did not constitute the start of the consultation process and did not call for evidence. What plans do the Government have and when will they start?</p>

It is unlikely that either House, having got fuller legislation in place, would see it as a priority to review it so quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="100209107000070"></a>The term "straitjacket" was used. This is a matter on which we should impose a straitjacket on ourselves. The position now is unsatisfactory and how we deal with that and the conditions we impose on ourselves should not be for our convenience, but with a view to getting the best outcome, which involves many factors.</p>

<a name="100209-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="100209107000071"></a>Of course, the Minister referred to balancing the needs of national security and we did not vote against the Second Reading of the Bill. I welcome his acknowledgement of the human rights matters. It is difficult to believe that it is necessary to give three months to pre-legislative scrutiny. Organisations with a particular interest in the bigger Bill are already well appraised of the issues. I asked a representative from one yesterday about the time needed-I will not say which one it was because I do not want to pin it down without prior warning-but the message that I got back was that this is something they could do very quickly indeed. The July date would have been a balance. However, I would not like to hear an excuse at a later date that insufficient time had been given to looking at what would be an extremely important Bill. On a more practical note, I can see that I am on a loser and so I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Amendment 2 refers to the decision of the Supreme Court on 27 January that struck down the 2006 order. It was confirmed by the later decision of the Supreme Court that it had no discretion to suspend the order. It had the effect of declaring that the 2006 order had never possessed legal force and that it had been void from the start. It was therefore never an order in any legal sense. Your Lordships will recall this was a matter that was discussed at Second Reading this afternoon. It is only a "purported" order and the amendment corrects the description of the orders in the context of this Bill. It has the effect of protecting the clause from the argument-as, for example, in the Anisminic case-that a legal nullity cannot be used to give rise to further obligations.</p>

<a name="100209-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="100209107000073"></a>The Bill currently gives the provisions of the orders retrospective effect and cloaks them in the authority of the United Nations Act 1946 if they derive their force from that Act. Amendment 3 removes the restrospectivity and the reference to the 1946 Act altogether so that the orders would now, instead, have their own freestanding legal force as primary legislation.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_668"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 668</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100209-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="100209107000074"></a>Amendment 5 is consequential. Its effect is to preserve a consequence of the current lines of the Bill which is that the provisions of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008-about special procedures to preserve security in proceedings about financial restrictions-will apply to asset-freezing proceedings under the Bill.</p>

<a name="100209-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="100209107000075"></a>Amendment 6 goes with Amendments 4 and 7. Its effect is to carry over the effect of any current purported directions of the Treasury, which the Supreme Court has said have no legal effect, into new interim orders as established by the new clause. It would mean that the Treasury would have one month from the passage of the Bill to apply to the High Court for full orders. The amendment also preserves the effect of current licences granted by the Treasury. Amendment 12 is consequential to that, so that the current orders would continue under this proposal.</p>

<a name="100209-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="100209107000076"></a>Amendment 7 is the important amendment which inserts a new clause into the Bill. The effect of that new clause is to alter the process by which a person becomes subject to the asset-freezing regime, to change the length of time that a person can be subject to the regime on the basis of reasonable suspicion alone, and, importantly, to introduce an appeal mechanism for the licensing process. Under the order as it currently stands, the Treasury, acting on the basis of reasonable suspicion alone and without any prior supervision by the courts, may subject a person to the full asset-freezing regime. There is no appeal and no limit to the number of times a direction, which lasts for a year, may be renewed. Your Lordships heard all these criticisms at Second Reading this afternoon.</p>

<a name="100209-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="100209107000077"></a>The amendment and the new clause replace the existing process with one under which the Treasury applies to the High Court for an order to impose the asset-freezing regime on an individual. The court may impose an order on the basis not of reasonable suspicion but on the basis of findings of fact that the person concerned-the individual against whom the order is directed-is connected with terrorism and that the order is necessary to protect the public from terrorism. Reasonable suspicion would not be enough for such a full order, which would last up to a year and which may be renewed on further application from the Treasury as long as the findings of fact remain valid.</p>

<a name="100209-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="100209107000078"></a>For emergency situations, this draft clause provides that the Treasury would be able to apply to the High Court for an interim order on the basis of reasonable suspicion alone, but that interim order would last for a month only. In that month the Treasury would be expected to bring proceedings for the full order in the High Court which would have control of the proceedings. The interim order could be extended beyond a month but only to cover the time taken for the subsequent proceedings for a full order, or for any relevant criminal trial or other proceedings. The purpose is to replace the reasonable suspicion test with a finding of fact that the individual is connected with terrorism.</p>

<a name="100209-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="100209107000079"></a>The 2009 order introduced a licensing system under which the rules that forbid giving support to the subject of the asset-freezing regime might be relaxed for certain purposes. The amendment to Article 17 of the 2009 order maintains that licensing system but does allow an appeal to the High Court both for the

Your Lordships will recall that the judgment of the Supreme Court criticised many things, but one of them was the lack of any provision for appeal. The purpose of these amendments is to recast the power of making orders, to make those orders ultimately based upon fact, to provide a temporary solution for up to a month, to make sure that it is the High Court and not the Treasury which controls the making of the orders, and to provide for the right of appeal. I beg to move.</p>

I will not go through the amendments in detail or comment on the particular drafting of the amendments because I sympathise with all the points that he has made. As I explained at Second Reading today, we do not regard this Bill as one to which substantive amendments should be made. Essentially the fast-track process does not lend itself to this kind of amendment. Our normal process is a deliberative one, with pause for thought after Second Reading and again after Committee. I do not know about the Liberal Democrat Benches, but I do not feel as if I have paused for thought at all today.</p>

If we were going to try to perfect the 2009 order, there would be other amendments that we would think worth considering. We will not be able to support these amendments today. However, is saying that, I agree that they raise valid points and I hope that we shall have a proper opportunity to consider them in the context of a full Bill at some point.</p>

However, I say with the utmost respect that Amendments 2 and 3 may well be unnecessary. It is not a case of saying that these provisions shall have the effect as if they were primary legislation-they are primary legislation. Although there is a history that leads us back to the realms of various elements of delegated legislation, that has no real relevance to these provisions at this time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="100209107000083"></a>I have immense respect, regard and admiration for the noble Lord, Lord Myners, in every context, particularly in this one. If he had been spending or mis-spending his life for the past 30 years in the courts, he could not have made a better fist of it than he did at Second Reading today. However, he said that we were interpreting UN Security Council Resolution 1373 as including a situation where a person not only was proven to have taken part in terrorism but was indeed suspected of that. That is an utterly logical and understandable attitude to take, but technically very probably a wrong one for this reason. Although that is the historical narrative of what has brought this crisis to your Lordships' House today, with regard to the actual legislation that we are considering, the United Nations resolution is totally irrelevant. If there never was such a thing as the United Nations, the legislation would stand or fall on its own feet. The fact that you may in legislation refer

Once you have incorporated the words in an Act of Parliament, it is the Act of Parliament under the sovereignty of Parliament that counts, not its origin.</p>

<a name="100209-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="100209107000084"></a>It is often said that Parliament can do whatever it likes except make a man a woman and a woman a man. I am not sure that that restriction applies any longer. Be that as it may, Parliament has total sovereignty. It is in the exercise of that sovereignty that we are entitled to do this. We are referring to the wording of what were once delegated powers and incorporating those powers in primary legislation. It is the primary legislation that will be judged from now on. On that basis, much as I sympathise with the views expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, on the other matters, I respectfully submit that Amendments 2 and 3 are not necessary.</p>

I am also concerned that the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, seeks to confine the substantive order to circumstances where there is a finding of fact that the individual is connected with terrorism. There is a strong case for maintaining such a power in circumstances where the individual is reasonably believed to be associated with terrorism. It is a much stricter test than the test merely of reasonable suspicion that the Government wish to maintain.</p>

Clause 1(2)(d) refers to the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2009. Under Amendment 2, it is to be called "purported". When it comes to later amendments, it has suddenly dropped its "purported" and has become-what should I say?-fully fledged.</p>

We are in grave difficulty when we attempt to alter the test that was used in the orders that have been quashed, because it is hard for us now to take the view that the Government's protection is more than is necessary in the circumstances, with which they are much more familiar than any of us can be. I would not wish to take the risk of reducing the ambit of the orders without a full discussion, for which we have neither the time nor the opportunity. This is meant effectively to put in place the orders that have been quashed or

The debate that we have just had is illuminating because it identifies how complex and different the views expressed on this issue are. It is clear that the amendments proposed by the noble Lord seek to bring about a fundamental change in the nature of the terrorist asset-freezing regime that we have. I make no comment for the moment on whether they are soundly based: I simply say that that is their purpose. We will not be able to deal with them adequately-I would almost say "at all"-this evening. Justice should be done to them, because we know from the Supreme Court decision that it wanted Parliament to have an opportunity for have a mature, reasoned and seasoned debate.

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="100209107000091"></a>We disagree with the noble Lord's premise. The amendments that he seeks to pursue concern two issues. The first advocates putting asset freezing in primary legislation rather than Orders in Council, in the belief that this is necessary to restore access to Convention rights. The second removes the asset-freezing decision from the Executive and gives it to the judiciary. That is a very significant change. Therefore, I agree with what was said by all other noble Lords: the point was made by the noble Baroness Lady Noakes, the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, and, in effect, by my noble and learned friend Lord Boyd, who pointed to the fact that we have not dealt with Scotland. When you stand at the Dispatch Box, that is always something that you fail to do at your peril. Salient points were also made by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick. All the points recognised that the matter is complex, difficult and will take time to discuss.

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="100209107000096"></a>The 2009 order is far from perfect; we had a small taste of that on the previous group of amendments. The advantage of the 2009 order is that it is an improved version of the earlier orders: the 2001 and 2006 orders allow the Treasury to designate someone who may reasonably be suspected to be or may be a terrorist. That was removed following the Court of Appeal judgment and does not appear in the 2009 order. The 2009 order made other beneficial changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="100209107000097"></a>I am aware that the 2006 order repealed part of the 2001 order and that the 2009 order repealed part of the 2006 order. It may well be that my amendment is unnecessary because no further directions can be given under the earlier orders. However, I am not absolutely sure of the position, and that is why I have tabled the amendments. If directions can be given only under the 2009 order, can the Minister explain why subsection (3)(a) is drafted as it is? It refers to all the orders. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="100209107000100"></a>Article 26 of the 2009 order revokes the 2006 order, with savings only for current directions, and similar provisions in the 2006 order revoke the 2001 order. Therefore the 2009 order power is the only live direction-making power which the Treasury can legitimately use. I think that is the clarity which the noble Baroness wanted. The drafting makes that clear once you know that that is the only power. We think that matter has been covered. I thank the noble Baroness, first, for being so quick on the uptake and noticing that there might be a lacuna and, secondly, for helping us to try to close it. I can reassure her that there is nothing there to worry about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="100209107000104"></a>It has been put to me by Justice, which has provided very helpful briefing, as other noble Lords have said, that the effect of the retrospective deeming contained in Clause 1(2), which subsection (3) expands on, is that the prohibitions referred to in paragraph (c) are similarly retrospective. I can also see that subsection (1) refers only to the period after the Act comes into force. If there is any scintilla of doubt or ambiguity about a matter as important as retrospectivity for criminal purposes, we must be quite clear in our resolve to remove that ambiguity. I hope that the Minister agrees with that. I beg to move.</p>

We tabled this amendment because the Government said that the power in Section 4 of the 2001 Act to make freezing orders does not apply because the object of the order must be a foreign resident or a foreign country. It seemed to us that rather than the slightly crab-wise approach of this legislation, one could simply make it apply by leaving out the conditions relating to foreign residents and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="100209107000108"></a>The 2001 Act has some important attributes. Some judicial oversight is already provided by the Act but it is perhaps limited in light of the discussions we have had already on the Bill. Under Section 63 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, application to the High Court or to the Court of Session can be made in connection with any decision of the Treasury and in connection with its functions under the 2001 Act. In parenthesis, I ask the Minister-I have given notice of this and it is important-whether she can tell the Committee whether Section 63 of the Counter-Terrorism Act will apply to the Bill we are considering now when it is enacted. Section 63(1) refers to the UN terrorism orders, to Part 2 of the 2001 Act and to a schedule to the 2008 Act.</p>

Individuals also have a right to seek compensation. There are also provisions regarding licences-that is, bluntly, arrangements for funds to be made available to allow individuals to live. There are even provisions in the schedule that would, I think, benefit the Treasury. It includes in primary legislation some things that might be a matter of practice. We might be told that those provisions already apply, but this will make it certain. What is most important, in the light of the judgment that has led to our proceedings today, the 2001 Act has had the benefit of parliamentary process. I beg to move.</p>

On Second Reading, I asked why the 2001 Act was not used for terrorism purposes, if that is what it was put there for, and why it could not be used for this purpose. That said, I have some problems with the noble Baroness's amendment. Although it might set up a new regime going forward, I do not see how it copes with all those who are currently covered by the designations that have already been made under the existing orders. It seems to create a very severe problem. It may well be that, as a permanent solution to the problem, the noble Baroness's amendment has the core of a way forward, but in the context of dealing with the temporary problem caused by the Supreme Court's judgment, it seems to create more problems than it solves.</p>

Parliamentary approval was given to Section 4 of the 2001 Act, as I understand it, in relation primarily to foreign activities. I am concerned about the possible implications-I emphasise possible implications-of generally extending the scope of Section 4 so that it would apply to all domestic activities. That may have unfortunate implications and I would need some assurance that that was not the case before I could support this amendment.</p>

I certainly reassure the noble Baroness that all the comments made will be taken into consideration when we come to look at the final, full Bill. It gives us an indication of the sort of issues that are troubling Members of the House, and we will want to address those in due course. I hope the noble Baroness will feel that, having properly raised these issues, she is able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We seem not to have had a proper answer from the Government. I take seriously the points that other noble Lords have made, but this amendment was tabled so that the Government could tell us something rather more substantive than, "It is because I say it is". I am not happy with such a response. We should be given more than that slightly Humpty Dumpty reply.</p>

However, I think that both the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, have already identified some of the difficulties that the noble Baroness's proposal raises. To deal with those proposals properly would take some little time.</p>

<a name="100209-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="100209107000116"></a>The provisions that the noble Baroness proposes would require the threat to have been from a Government or a person outside the United Kingdom. This would specifically get round the reason why the Act could not be used for domestic terrorism. However, even if it worked, it would mean designations on a reasonable belief basis, and we do not believe that that would be the right standard. Parliament would have to review the information relied on for a designation. It would require both Houses to approve designation within 28 days although many of our cases will have been charged or conducted on the basis of intelligence. In either instance, we could not disclose information of that sort.</p>

<a name="100209-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="100209107000117"></a>There are very many issues. I say to the noble Baroness, with the greatest respect and understanding, that we are all trying to do the very best we can. However, the decision that was made by the Supreme Court was to enable Parliament to have sufficient time to discuss and debate these issues with a sense of decorum and propriety. I know that that is what the noble Baroness wants, and I know that that is what every person who has spoken in this debate wants. It is simply impossible for us to do justice to the issue which the noble Baroness wishes to raise in such a truncated process. I therefore invite her to think very carefully about the response that she has had both from the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes.</p>

We have already dealt with the sunset provision and my amendment would not alter that. It would merely put in place a different interim regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="100209107000119"></a>I did not sit through the proceedings on the 2001 legislation, but I find it difficult to believe that the Government allowed Parliament to ignore the kind of matters that the noble and learned Baroness has just raised. As regards freezing assets in respect of those who are subject to Section 4, surely that must have been considered and debated, and the Government must have been clear in their mind that all the corners had been covered.</p>

Clause 2 and its provisions are necessary to ensure that there is no gap in the UK's asset freezing regime caused by the quashing of the terrorism orders. The clause validates actions taken by any person, except the Treasury-a very important exception-to maintain existing asset freezes during the period between the court quashing the terrorism order on 4 February and this Bill receiving Royal Assent by providing that the orders will be treated as validly made, should their actions be questioned. It does not, and cannot, put them in the position where they have a legal obligation to freeze assets for this period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="100209107000123"></a>My belief is that since the orders are focused on what has happened here, it is unlikely that any freezes have been made in the Channel Islands or the other places, so there is no need for retrospective cover. Therefore, retrospective cover for the banks is not required. Having thought about where we are, that is my construction. If I am wrong on any of that-I do not believe that I am-can I write to the noble Baroness and clarify the position? I do not think I am wrong because, to the best of my recollection, I saw no papers in relation to the Channel Islands or the other places that have been mentioned. That is confirmed by the note I have received. If it is wrong on mature reflection and correction, I will let the noble Baroness know.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, has Amendment 11A in this group. My amendments are lifted directly from the draft full Bill, which is being published in the form of the Command Paper. They deal with reports to Parliament and independent review. If the Government think that these issues are appropriate for the fuller legislation and are measures that should be applied in future, why not now? The first of the amendments, Amendment eight, requires a report from the Treasury to Parliament on the exercise of the powers within 28 days and then on a three-monthly basis. The clause in the draft Bill refers to a report. That might bear a little expansion, and I have therefore added subsection (4), which gives some idea of what might be included in such a report. That is information regarding designations made, licences granted and proceedings taken for an offence. The noble Baroness's Amendment 11A requires a monthly report. My instinctive reaction is that that is a bit often and a bit of a heavy imposition, but I look forward to her arguments.</p>

<a name="100209-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="100209107000131"></a>I take as my starting point that this Bill is far from perfect. It legitimises three orders with the barest minimum of parliamentary scrutiny. We have had no real opportunity to consider the substance of the orders, despite the valiant efforts of those on the Liberal Democrat Benches in seeking to get some of those issues debated. We are resigned to an imperfect emergency legislative solution to the problem of the Supreme Court's decision, and we have to await a proper Bill to replace it, but I do not believe that means that Parliament's involvement in the Bill should end.</p>

<a name="100209-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="100209107000132"></a>In the draft legislation contained in the Command Paper issued last week, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, pointed out, Clause 24 sets out the requirement for a quarterly report. A quarterly report, or indeed any report, to Parliament cannot remedy deficiencies in the Act itself, but it is a useful way of reminding Parliament about legislation which can be used to interfere with the rights and liberties of individuals. It is also a useful way of reminding the Executive that they are accountable to Parliament.</p>

<a name="100209-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="100209107000133"></a>My Amendment 11A mirrors Clause 24, somewhat more exactly than the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, with the one exception that she has already pointed out; namely, that it calls for a monthly rather than a quarterly report. The reason for this is simple. This temporary provisions Bill can last only until the end of the year, and will, I hope, be gone sometime before that. In that circumstance, we believe that while the imposition of a monthly report might add a bit to the workload of the Treasury, that is a tiny matter when weighed against the civil liberties issues on the other side of the balance, because we are keeping in place a Bill which many of us regard as imperfect.</p>

<a name="100209-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="100209107000134"></a>Amendment 8, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, goes a little beyond the draft clause, as she explained, and I have no problem with the changes that the Liberal Democrats propose. I hope that I have explained why, even within the context of her amendment, a monthly frequency would be better. I hope that the Government can see that these are reasonable amendments, in the context of this Bill, which has an unsatisfactory legislative solution to a problem. The amendment would not upset the scheme of the emergency Bill, but it would go some way to putting Parliament back where it should be, which is reviewing the practical impact of legislation on the lives of individuals. I hope that the Government will seriously consider accepting either my amendment or that of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, or be prepared to come back later this evening with a version of their own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="100209107000135"></a>I find it difficult to support the other amendment in this group. I do not believe that this Bill, when it is an Act, will be in force long enough to make a review of the Act a worthwhile proposition, so I do not think that would be a sensible use of resources, going forward.</p>

These amendments will introduce vital safeguards. This Committee has recognised that this temporary Bill may be on the statute book for another 10 months, despite its imperfections. The Committee has been told that pre-legislative scrutiny may take three months. The temporary measures will inevitably have a very adverse effect on individuals, including those in respect of whom there may be no more than a reasonable suspicion that they may be associated with terrorism.</p>

<a name="100209-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="100209107000137"></a>In those circumstances, it is vital, in order to ensure the protection of the interests of those individuals, and to ensure that this House can perform its vital function of holding the Executive to account, and being informed about what approach this House should take to the substantive legislation when it comes forward, that we see regular reports on the operation of this Bill. The Minister referred at Second Reading, and has referred earlier, to the need for a fair balance. I cannot see what can be weighed in the balance against such a requirement, other than the very minor consideration of administrative convenience.</p>

Amendment 11A would require monthly reporting. We recognise the point of these Amendments. The Government understand and support the need to ensure accountability and transparency in the use of our powers. However, with the greatest respect, the amendments are not required. The Treasury already lays a written report before Parliament on the operation of the UK's asset-freezing regime. This report is made on a quarterly basis, which we believe is the right period for such a report, and it includes more than the noble Baroness's amendment requires. As well as information on designations made and licences granted, our-currently quarterly-report details the total assets frozen and the number of case reviews and delistings each quarter. We would be happy to add proceedings taken for an offence to the report, as suggested by the noble Baroness. The next report is due shortly. I am not sure that we could add that information for that report, but I certainly hope so for subsequent reports. I therefore ask that these amendments be withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="100209107000139"></a>The purpose of Amendment 9 is to appoint an independent person to review the operation of the Bill three months after it comes into force and every three months thereafter. We have included a clause in the longer Terrorist Asset-Freezing Bill, which is available in draft on the Treasury website, to the effect that an independent person should be appointed to review the operation of the Bill nine months from the day it is passed and then annually. However, an independent review is not required for the operation of this temporary

It is a temporary measure, which has a fixed sunset provision. In the course of giving pre-legislative scrutiny to the longer Bill, attention may well be given to the current orders and how they are implemented, but this does not require a formal independent review of this temporary Bill, a point that was made very eloquently in the contribution from the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. I therefore ask that this amendment is also withdrawn.</p>

Will he explain why the Government's own draft legislation to replace this temporary Bill includes a specific requirement to table a report? If we were considering the draft Bill and I had tabled an amendment to Clause 24, would the Minister not say that the Treasury already does a quarterly report on asset-freezing? I am a bit mystified as to why the draft Bill has a specific requirement to table a report, which seems like a good idea, and why it should not be applied to the Bill that we are now considering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="100209107000147"></a>To avoid doubt, I should say that it is very important that these disclosures are made. I am a member of Liberty, and I have very strong beliefs in justice and in individual freedom. In presenting these proposals to Parliament, only after very careful consideration do I weigh the needs of national security against the risks of encroaching on individual liberty. One of the ways in which Parliament monitors that is through regular, comprehensive and detailed reporting. That remains an essential part of our commitment in support of this temporary legislation.</p>

Did the orders that have now become defunct because of the action of the Supreme Court contain the power to report? If this temporary Bill takes those orders into account, there is no fuss; after all, it has a sunset clause. I can understand the Minister saying that the permanent Bill should have it, but will he answer the noble and learned Lord's question, because I have not heard the answer?</p>

Many statutes impose obligations on the Secretary of State to report to Parliament, particularly in the context of terrorism, and they do so because it is thought important to put such a duty into the Bill, given the importance of the subject matter. A Minister could always say, "That's unnecessary because I am giving a commitment to Parliament that we will do it anyway", but does the Minister not accept that, in the context of this very sensitive Bill and given the circumstances in which it comes before the House, it is particularly important that such an obligation is put into the Bill?</p>

I have made it very clear that, for the time that this temporary legislation is in place, we intend not only to continue to report quarterly but to augment the reports by providing an additional line of information, as the noble Baroness proposes.

However, it would cost the Government very little to stand behind the good faith that they say they have used in relation to using the order-making power in the past and their wish for us to help them to deal with the problem that has been created by the Supreme Court. It would not cost the Government much but it would give some people comfort to see them taking seriously the representations that have been made. This is a peculiar Bill and, in many respects, it is not satisfactory. We would like a special reporting requirement attached to it. It would last for only this year because the Bill will go at the end of 2010. We think that it would be an act of good faith on the part of the Government if the Minister took this proposal away and brought it back later this evening. Thus, neither of us would need to press the point now.</p>

As regards Amendment 9, I take the point that with a sunset clause it might be a bit heavy-handed to seek an independent review. It could be useful but perhaps it is a bit much in the circumstances. However, with regard to reporting, about which far better arguments have been made than those that I advanced in moving the amendment, we have heard assurances about accountability and transparency, and the arrangements which the Government have in place. I do not for a moment doubt the Minister, who is a good chap.</p>

<a name="100209-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="100209122000002"></a>The first amendment provides that the licence to be given by the Treasury will ensure that the reasonable domestic needs of the designated person and his family can be met. Since I tabled the amendment, I have seen the Statement made by the Minister on 5 February, and published afterwards, which deals at some length with the licence regime as it has been applied and as the Government will continue to apply it, and which gives assurances that in addition to the basic expenses listed-the basic humanitarian needs which I was amused to see included, at the top of the list, taxes; taxes might be a humanitarian matter to some, but they might not be so regarded by the designated person-other expenses will be allowed.</p>

<a name="100209-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="100209122000003"></a>The wording of my amendment was taken direct from the Insolvency Act. It seemed to me that there were parallels between this situation and bankruptcy, where the bankrupt is allowed enough leeway and enough income to ensure that his reasonable domestic provisions can be met. The Minister's Statement talks of taking an approach so that designated persons have access to their income and other property in so far as it can be arranged,</p>
<ul><a name="100209122000102"></a>"without giving rise to risk of terrorist finance".</ul>
<p><a name="100209122000071"></a>It seemed to me that that was something of a circular argument. The Statement also says that the controls are those,</p>
<ul><a name="100209122000103"></a>"necessary to protect against terrorist finance risks."-[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/2/10; col. <I>WS36</I><I>-37</I>.]</ul>
<a name="100209-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="100209122000004"></a>However, as that is the basis for the designation and for the very heart of the order, I am not quite clear about its purpose within the licensing arrangements. One needs to start at the other end-not the fact of the designation, but protection for the families in particular. My main concern is that there is no legislative minimum and no possibility of challenge. That is why I have tabled this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="100209122000005"></a>I tabled the second amendment, on legal representation, because I was shocked to discover that financial contributions to legal proceedings, or indeed to representation for a designated person in proceedings, are in themselves offences. I understand that the role of the Justices in the recent Supreme Court case was to act as intervener, because that was all that they could do. It seems to me to be a basic provision that legal services should be allowed to be available. I beg to move Amendment 10.</p>

<p><a name="st_223"></a>
<a name="100209122000006"></a><b><a name="100209-0013.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100209122000112"></a>Baroness Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I assure the noble Baroness that the Government share the concerns that she has expressed, both in making sure that those who may be affected have the necessary wherewithal to meet their living expenses and, indeed, in relation to legal representation. We agree that it is essential that the impact of the asset-freezing regime on designated persons and their families is proportionate and to ensure that they have full access to legal representation and funds to meet their everyday needs. However, we believe that the noble Baroness's amendments are unnecessary, since the Government already operate a licensing regime precisely to ensure that these needs are met, taking into account the specific circumstances of each case. She will know that that may vary and that what may be an absolute necessity for one family may be an unnecessary matter for another. For the moment, the licensing regime is able to recalibrate those issues directly in relation to the individual needs of the family concerned. I welcome the opportunity to make that clear to the House and to put those comments on the record.</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="100209122000007"></a>I hope the noble Baroness will be pleased to know that the Treasury already takes measures to ensure that all reasonable expenses can be met through the operation of the active licensing regime. For example, it is already our policy not to restrict a family's access to benefits due to them. Currently, all families are receiving their full entitlement for benefits; for this reason, we do not believe that the amendment achieves anything not already achieved by the operation of the licensing regime. However, I absolutely understand that the noble Baroness was framing this to get an assurance on how it works.</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="100209122000008"></a>On the amendment that deals with legal representation, I hope that I have made it clear that I completely agree with the noble Baroness that it is essential that persons subject to an asset freeze have unrestricted access to legal services. However, it is already the practice of the Treasury to issue a licence for legal aid immediately when someone is designated; that ensures that legal representation is provided immediately. The amendment is therefore in that regard unnecessary, as I hope the noble Baroness will agree. The Government consider it inappropriate to exclude all legal services from the prohibitions, for example when legal expenses are met by release of frozen funds. It may be necessary to conduct some checks to ensure that the funds are applied for the stated purpose. For those reasons, I hope the noble Baroness will understand that although I am resisting her amendments, I affirm her concern about both issues.</p>

The Minister mentioned benefits; we know from the judgment that that was not always the case. The argument again is that the amendments are unnecessary because this is what we do.

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="100209122000013"></a>This group of amendments refers to two different clauses. Amendment 116 has been tabled to Clause 158, which deals with positive action, recruitment and promotion. The others have been tabled to Clause 196, which is about harmonisation, and enables a Minister of the Crown to amend by order the Act which will result from this Bill, and the Equality Act 2006, in order to ensure consistency-both of provision and  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_690"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 690</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with European law. I will not go into the detail of this clause at this point. We have tabled amendments which will allow discussion later.</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="100209122000014"></a>This group of amendments relates especially to the use of "thinks" rather than "can demonstrate". We have been having detailed discussions on the semantics of this Bill-around the definitions of "reasonable" and "proportionate"-and I am sure noble Lords will also have an opinion on the use of "thinks" in these clauses. Our main contention is that, given that the powers provided by these clauses are quite wide, it is sensible to have a less subjective test for when the provisions can be used. If the test were to be made more objective, the person or Minister responsible could be properly held to account for their actions. A test based on a subjective opinion, however, will be much more difficult to judge.</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="100209122000015"></a>In another place, the Minister dismissed these concerns, stating that this,</p>
<ul><a name="100209122000104"></a>"is not a "thinking" process which can just come to someone over breakfast".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Equality Bill Committee, 30/6/09; col. 613.]</ul>
<p><a name="100209122000072"></a>I am sure that for most people it would not be. However, there is nothing in this Bill or the Explanatory Notes which makes that clear. Can the Minister please explain what the "thinking" process would include? We obviously expect and hope that the Minister making decisions regarding harmonisation, and the person making decisions about the use of positive action, would do so with the utmost regard for best practice. However, the use of "thinks" seems to belie the serious implications of the use of these powers. Does the Minister agree that, given the strength of these powers, it would be beneficial if the test for their use were made stricter?</p>
<a name="time_35"></a>
<a name="100209-0013.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="100209122000107"></a>8.45 pm</h5>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="100209122000016"></a>In another place, the Minister commented that it would be unproductive if an employer were to be put off using the clause relating to positive action if the test were raised and he had, for example, to find an expensive consultant to provide some statistical analysis to demonstrate that the use of the powers was justified. As I pointed out a little earlier, we on these Benches support the provisions for positive action as long as that does not give way to positive discrimination. However, I wonder whether our amendment would really have as damaging an impact on the use of the clause as the Minister in another place feared would happen. Does the Minister agree that most employers would be able to demonstrate, first, that persons who shared a protected characteristic suffer a disadvantage connected to that characteristic or that, secondly, participation in an activity by persons who share a protected characteristic is disproportionately low? One would not need to spend a lot of money to have a consultant find statistical evidence; instead, it would just raise the bar for the thinking process.</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="100209122000017"></a>This would mean that it was clear in the Bill that this is an important decision that requires reasoned, objective thinking and an evidential basis. I am sure that most employers would be doing that anyway. The aim of the change would be to catch only those who were not, to provide them with clear instruction about  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_691"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 691</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when is the appropriate time to use these broad powers, and to make sure that there is sufficient justification. That would not be off-putting to employers, as surely that sort of thinking is what the Government mean to encourage when they use "thinks". If not, can the Minister inform the Committee what the word is supposed to denote?</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="100209122000018"></a>The use of the word "thinks" in these two clauses raises further concerns when it is noted that in Clause 158 the person must "reasonably" think, but that in Clause 196 the Minister does not even have the limitation of "reasonably" in order to use the powers contained there only on a thought. Given that the Minister in another place specified that those thoughts could not just occur over the breakfast table, can the noble Baroness account for the fact that "reasonably" has not been included here? I feel sure that the Minister will reassure us that all decisions are expected to be reasonable. If that is the case, why is that word included in Clause 158? Surely, the noble Baroness cannot be claiming that Ministers are intrinsically more reasonable than other employers?</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="100209122000019"></a>Again, we advocate the use of "can demonstrate", with the intention that the Minister should have to be able to demonstrate the objective thought process and to be held accountable for the decisions made. I do not feel that the change that these amendments would effect would have too great an impact on a process that the Government are assuming would occur anyway. The noble Baroness will correct me if I am wrong-indeed, I suspect that she may wish to do so-but we on these Benches think that it would be sensible if the need for an objective and justifiable decision was laid out in the Bill rather than using a word which, to many, denotes a more subjective decision without the need for demonstrable evidence. I beg to move.</p>

The principle of proportionality is a two-stage process. The first stage is that one must show that there is a legitimate aim; the second is to show that the means employed are reasonably necessary to achieve the aim. One does not need to raise the bar or to treat this as a coercive provision to be strictly construed because it is very important-the most reverend Primate has already indicated this-that the gateway into using these voluntary measures of affirmative positive action to overcome disadvantage and the effects of past discrimination is showing that it is a reasonable view. The word "reasonable" has an objective meaning. It means that you cannot take leave of your senses. Reason has to be applied.</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="100209122000021"></a>As regards the term "reasonably thinks", the first stage, which is the easy stage, is to show that there is a legitimate aim. As I said earlier, the legitimate aim is spelt out in the Bill. If one were to raise the bar, it would completely stultify the effect of these voluntary provisions. I have said before that when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister and introduced in 1989 far more radical and coercive measures that still apply, have worked for 70 per cent of the workforce and have reduced discrimination against Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland, there was no approach of this  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_692"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 692</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>kind, which, frankly, is inappropriate in a remedial statute. I should have thought that if the Conservatives win the election and govern the country, they would welcome the fact that these positive-action provisions will be taken up voluntarily by the private and public sectors. We can then begin to deal with patterns and practices of unjust discrimination in a more positive way, avoiding the need for unnecessary individual litigation. I cannot put it as well as the most reverend Primate who spoke from a common-sense, non-lawyer point of view, but it is absolutely vital that we keep the threshold as it is.</p>

<a name="100209122000022"></a><b><a name="100209-0013.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="100209122000119"></a>Baroness Turner of Camden:</b> My Lords, I cannot really see what advantage one would get by replacing "reasonably thinks" with "can demonstrate". How does one set about demonstrating that there is a disadvantage in a work situation? I should have thought that it was reasonable to take on board this wording where an individual responsible for appointments or whatever in a work situation would reasonably think. I cannot see anything wrong with that, but to wait until you can demonstrate something is much more difficult. I much prefer the wording proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, of "proportionate means". That is very good. Therefore, I see no advantage at all in replacing "reasonably thinks" with "can demonstrate"-quite the contrary.</p>

<p><a name="st_231"></a>
<a name="100209122000023"></a><b><a name="100209-0013.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="100209122000120"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, this group of amendments relates to two different clauses-158 and 196, so I shall address the relevant amendments separately. Amendment 116 would make it a requirement for employers to rely on the statistical evidence to support the use of positive action measures to tackle disadvantage or underrepresentation within an organisation's workforce. This same amendment was tabled in another place. The Government resist this amendment. The Bill uses the formulation "reasonably thinks", so it already requires a decision-maker to act in a reasonable way when deciding whether to use positive action measures. We believe that "reasonably" introduces an element of objectivity and raises the threshold for decision-makers. It means that, when making the decision, the employer must apply logical and rational principles and a failure to do so would give rise to a challenge. Therefore, any use of these measures must be backed by some form of evidence or justification that supports the belief that people who share a particular characteristic are disadvantaged or underrepresented; otherwise, such a decision would be open to challenge, so clearly the employer cannot simply opt to use positive action measures on a whim.</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="100209122000024"></a>Clause 158 sets out the circumstances in which employers could apply these positive action measures and the action that is permitted. Clause 158(4) also ensures that employers would not be able to abuse the provisions by ensuring that any action taken must always be a proportionate way of accomplishing the intended outcome. As has already been mentioned by noble Lords, using the formulation of "can demonstrate", as proposed in the amendment, would create a higher threshold based on undisputable statistical evidence, which we consider would have a chilling effect on the willingness of employers to use positive action measures. I am not saying that it is devastating, but that it is  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_693"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 693</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>chilling. It would discourage employers from using the positive action measures, even when they had identified the need to tackle disadvantage or underrepresentation -the gateway mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and the right reverend Prelate.</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="100209122000025"></a>Amendments 130 to 133 will be discussed in a later group, so I will limit my remarks. They would limit ministerial flexibility in deciding whether use of the harmonisation power in Clause 196 is appropriate and, if so, the timing and extent of its use.</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="100209122000026"></a>The provision grants Equality Ministers of the future the flexibility they need in order to keep the Bill, when enacted, a coherent and harmonised piece of legislation in the years ahead. I can offer reassurance to noble Lords, should they require it, that use of this clause would not be at the whim of a Minister dreaming something up over breakfast. While the initial trigger on its use would result from ministerial consideration following advice from officials, there are a number of constraints on the power's use and in-built requirements to explain and demonstrate why it would need to be deployed in any given case. The word "thinks" in Clause 196(1)(a) concerns the question of whether the Minister considers the relevant criteria are met and the Minister is therefore bound by public law principles to act reasonably.</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="100209122000027"></a>The harmonisation provision, particularly the important procedural safeguards that we propose, will be debated more fully when we reach Clause 196, but I remind the House that this power can be used only where a community obligation is to be implemented through the Equality Acts. There will be little by way of subjectivity on this point. It will be clear that action is needed when regulations are brought forward to implement, for example, a directive under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. With regard to consultation, it is inherent in such an exercise that the Government will need to demonstrate why the power needs to be used in those particular circumstances.</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="100209122000028"></a>In addition, in response to concerns of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, the Government are proposing amendments that would add further checks on its use-for example, by requiring further consultation if the initial consultation led to changes to the proposals and an increase in the frequency of reporting to Parliament on the power's use is proposed. We will explain that when we reach Clause 196.</p>

<a name="100209-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="100209122000029"></a>I conclude by highlighting that all regulations intended to be made under this power must be laid before and debated by both Houses of Parliament. As with the consultation, the Minster will by definition need to demonstrate to Parliament that regulations under Section 2(2) of the 1972 Act trigger a need to retain harmony in the law through use of this power, and that any consequential adjustments are necessary. A new clause proposed by the Government after Clause 196 also requires that an explanatory document be laid before Parliament along with the draft regulations describing the results of the consultation, among other things. Ample accountability is built into this provision and it is important to understand that particular pieces of language taken in isolation do not provide the complete picture. I urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The intention is to probe this area and discover what changes could be made, what changes should be made and what changes the Government hope to make to ensure that private hire vehicles are accessible to people with disability.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100209-0014.htm"/>


<a name="100209-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="100209122000032"></a>We therefore tabled an amendment to come after Clause 159. This contains the order-making power which would allow the Secretary of State to make regulations to ensure that disabled people could get into and out of private hire vehicles in safety, get into and out of private hire vehicles in wheelchairs and travel in private hire vehicles in safety and comfort. These reasonably far-reaching regulations could also specify the size of door openings for passengers, the floor area and the amount of headroom in the passenger compartment and the fitting of restraining devices to prevent a wheelchair from moving while the vehicle was in motion.</p>

<a name="100209-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="100209122000033"></a>Will the Minister let us know whether any research has been carried out to show how many private hire vehicles are currently accessible for people with disability? Is she able to provide any figures which would demonstrate the disadvantage currently experienced by people with disability, thereby pointing to the need for regulation-making powers? We on these Benches are concerned to ensure that, where necessary, changes are made.</p>

<a name="100209-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="100209122000034"></a>Throughout the passage of this Bill, we have tried to underline the point that, where it is necessary to ensure equality, people with disability can be treated in a more favourable way than people who are not disabled. We are pleased to see the Government's letter of 26 January, which stated that they were "minded" to accept Amendment 120A tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins. This amendment would seek to ensure in a new clause that suitable numbers of wheelchair-accessible taxis operate throughout England and Wales.</p>

<a name="100209-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="100209122000035"></a>We welcome the intention of this clause, but I ask for clarification on a couple of points. The amendments appear to give further powers to the Secretary of State, thus removing them from the local authorities. Can the noble Baroness explain why this is necessary if the local authorities will already be subject to the public sector equality duty? Is this a symptom of the vague, and so far undefined, nature of the duty, making it necessary to give powers to the Secretary of State, or is it an indication that the Government already doubt the way this duty will work?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="100209122000036"></a>I hope that in her response the noble Baroness will also indicate what consultation and discussion have taken place with the Local Government Association and taxi organisations about this matter, and what views were expressed. I also wonder whether she might be able to address some more specific questions to do with the capability of a vehicle to accommodate a wheelchair. We have been informed that no wheelchair is crash-tested for a situation where it is rear-facing. Despite this, most private hire vehicles can accommodate only rear-facing wheelchairs.</p>

<a name="100209-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="100209122000037"></a>Is the noble Baroness aware that this is the case, and does she agree that it seems unsuitable and that perhaps changes need to be made? We are also informed that no council arranging school transport carries out checks to see whether wheelchairs are crash-tested and certified. Can the noble Baroness inform the Committee whether such checks or similar are required to be carried out, and does she not think that there is a case for calling for such safety measures?

I welcome the support of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. The proposed new clause would mean that taxi-licensing authorities which have a policy of controlling taxi numbers could not refuse to grant a taxi licence for a wheelchair-accessible vehicle if fewer than a prescribed proportion of taxis in the district were wheelchair-accessible. At present, a taxi-licensing authority outside London can refuse to grant a licence if it is satisfied that there is no significant unmet need for taxi services in the district. As a result, a licensing authority with a quantity-control policy and relatively few or no accessible taxis in its fleet can refuse applications for wheelchair-accessible vehicles. Noble Lords can imagine what that means for a wheelchair user who needs a taxi when, for instance, they arrive in the area by train. They are stranded. One must also think what it means for those living in the area when they need to get to an urgent appointment or visit friends and have a social life.</p>

The proportion of accessible taxis would be prescribed by the Secretary of State following economic assessment and consultation. The provision of accessible transport is essential for equality of opportunity. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</p>

In the General Synod of the Church of England, we received a report from a number of disabled people, and access was one of the greatest areas of concern. The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, would address that concern, and I support it, because it strikes the right balance. Access is absolutely critical.</p>

<a name="100209-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="100209122000044"></a>Amendments 121, 122 and 123 relate to the ability of taxi-licensing authorities to maintain lists of wheelchair-accessible taxis and private hire vehicles that operate in their area. Drivers of such designated vehicles are required to perform the duties in Clause 163 to carry and assist disabled passengers who use wheelchairs. Clause 165 enables Scottish licensing authorities to maintain lists only of wheelchair-accessible taxis and private hire vehicles that hold a special licence to operate a local bus service. They will be unable to list wheelchair-accessible taxis and private hire vehicles that operate under conventional licences. This would mean that the drivers of vehicles with a conventional licence would not be obliged to carry out the duties in Clause 163, even though their vehicle was capable of carrying disabled passengers who use wheelchairs.</p>

<a name="100209-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="100209122000045"></a>The amendments will align the position in Scotland to that in England and Wales. This will give greater assurance to disabled people that, when they require a wheelchair-accessible taxi or private hire vehicle, the driver will assist them to enter and exit the vehicle and, if they decide to remain in the wheelchair while travelling in the vehicle, will ensure that the wheelchair is secure and safe and that they travel in reasonable comfort.</p>

<a name="100209-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="100209122000046"></a>Amendment 120A is in the name of my noble friend Lady Wilkins. Taxi licensing and provision is a complicated area, and steps to improve access to taxis for disabled people are always welcome. It is unacceptable that a licensing authority which controls taxi numbers can routinely refuse applications for wheelchair-accessible taxis when it has very few wheelchair-accessible taxis in the district or, indeed, none at all. This new clause provides an ideal means of enhancing accessible taxi provision in these areas.</p>

<a name="100209-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="100209122000047"></a>I thank my noble friend Lady Wilkins for her amendment, which is compatible with the aims of the Bill and has the effect of improving accessibility for disabled people. In making any regulations under this clause, the Government would, of course, consult interested parties before reaching a decision on the proportion of taxis which must be wheelchair accessible and on the specifications of the wheelchair which taxis must be capable of accommodating. Therefore, the Government will accept Amendment 120A.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="100209122000048"></a>I now turn to Amendment 120 and the legitimate points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. I have already mentioned the issues of safety and the appropriate provision to be provided in taxis and licensed vehicles. The noble Lord raised a very reasonable point about safety and taxis. This is not in my notes but it should be. I have already mentioned that checks on safety are included and would be included in the regulations that arise out of my noble friend's point. I will undertake to ensure that the issue is properly addressed in the regulations and guidance which arise out of these provisions. I shall also write to the noble Lord and the Committee on this matter. From the wisdom that is offered to me from time to time, I can say that vehicles used for taxis are tested in accordance with European safety regulations and those requirements include crash testing. They must also be designed to accommodate wheelchairs safely in rear-facing orientation. We have taken that on board.</p>

<a name="100209-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="100209122000049"></a>The noble Lord's amendment is a probing amendment on this subject, and its principal objective would be to require all private hire vehicles to be wheelchair accessible. That would be incredibly burdensome to the private hire industry. Looking at the range of private hire vehicles which are available, we need information to be available to disabled people about what is in their area so that we can move forward in an orderly fashion. To say that all private hire vehicles have to provide for wheelchair access may be a step too far. However, the private hire vehicle trade is fundamentally different from the taxi trade: taxis can ply for hire, stand in ranks and be hailed in the street, whereas private hire vehicles must be booked in advance through a licensed operator.</p>

<a name="100209-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="100209122000050"></a>I should point out that, as the amendment is drafted, it could be seen to be technically defective as it refers to private hire vehicles plying for hire and of course the noble Lord will be aware that that is illegal. We think that converting or replacing all private hire vehicles would be so costly to the trade that it would no doubt force many operators out of business. Given the important role that private hire vehicles play in providing public transport, I am sure the noble Lord would not want to go in that direction.</p>

<a name="100209-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="100209122000051"></a>However, there is scope for using legislation to enhance the service which disabled people receive from private hire vehicles. In addition to the general duty not to discriminate, drivers of private hire vehicles designated as wheelchair-accessible vehicles will, under Clause 163, be required to assist their wheelchair passengers. I hope that explains why we do not agree with Amendment 120 and why we would like to accept Amendment 120A.</p>

In the light of that case, I lay out very clearly that our position is firmly in support of the new provisions that address the hole left by this judgment. We want to ensure that people with disability receive the right level of protection from disability-related discrimination. We are fully supportive of the alterations that need to be made to the letter of the law to return to what it was mistakenly thought that the spirit of the law already encapsulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="100209122000055"></a>We ask, however, what has happened so far as consultation is concerned, in particular between the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the landlord associations. We on these Benches believe that reversing the Malcolm decision is necessary and right. Nevertheless, we would want to ensure that this was done in such a way as to make certain that there were no loopholes whereby a landlord could not get rid of a problem tenant simply because they claimed to have a disability that was not in fact the case.</p>

<a name="100209-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="100209122000056"></a>The effect of the reversal of the Malcolm decision will be that the mandatory grounds of possession-Section 8 of the Housing Act 1988 for a rent arrears of two months and Section 21 for shorthold tenants who have reached the end of their tenancy-will mean that landlords still have to justify possession. However, landlords are rightly concerned that in cases of indirect discrimination, the grounds of possession will become discretionary. This could become important if, for example, a tenant blamed their anti-social behaviour

Furthermore, will she inform the House how much evidence of proof would be needed to justify obtaining an order for possession against a person with disability in a situation of indirect discrimination? What form can that proof take? Moreover, does the Minister accept that in practice it will be very difficult for landlords to recoup the costs of defending claims of possession, even where the claims are won?</p>

However, as the noble Lord was asking me about the consultation process, I recalled that when in 2008 I was involved in the discussions on building this Bill and the Malcolm case was concurrent, the DWP conducted a public consultation late in that year. I cannot give the noble Lord chapter and verse on who took part in that consultation in terms of landlord organisations, but I undertake to find out and let him know. However, I know that the consultation took place and informed how we proceeded with the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="100209122000062"></a>I appreciate that this amendment is meant to clarify the relationship between the disability provisions of this Bill and housing legislation, and that that relationship has caused some confusion in the courts. However, the difficulty in those cases was that the scope of the landlord to justify his treatment of the tenant under the DDA was very limited. One of the changes the Bill has made to the disability provisions is to provide a defence of objective justification to discrimination arising from disability and to include disability within

We believe that this allows for greater fairness than a blanket prohibition on disability considerations being taken into account in some possession proceedings. I hope with that, and my undertaking to write to the noble Lord if I have not covered all the points he raised, he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

It seems to me that where a tenant behaves badly-does not pay the rent or destroys the premises or whatever-and when he is served with notice to quit says, "It's because I have a disability", the question would be of fact, of causation, in the individual case. What was the real reason for the behaviour so far as direct discrimination is concerned? If the tenant behaved badly, there would be no objective justification, and he could be removed. It does not seem to me that there is a need for much guidance because I hope what I have just said is plain and obvious. It all boils down to the facts of the individual case and whether it is really attributable to disability or to misconduct.</p>

We have spoken a great deal about the order-making powers contained in Clause 195, which allow exceptions to be made to the provisions regarding age discrimination. We have debated the need for these regulations, their timing and which areas they will cover, and we have received assurances from the Minister that regulations would be introduced to allow exceptions relating to age-specific holidays such as those provided by Saga, insurance provision and other financial services. These would be in one order and due to come into being at the same time as these sections in the Act. I hope that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster can quickly reiterate that reassurance.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="100209133000002"></a>We have not spoken about the nature of the power contained in subsections (3) and (6). Those who have read the third report of the committee on this Bill will know that it has raised significant concerns about the strength of these powers. Its worry centres around the fact that, with these subsections, orders can be made which also impose requirements by reference to guidance or documents specified in guidance. This guidance is obviously not necessarily subject to parliamentary procedure. Therefore, while the power in Clause 195(1) is subject to affirmative procedure, the sub-delegation powers which allow requirements to be made by reference to guidance or other documents contained within that, mean that these requirements are capable of avoiding the affirmative procedure. This means that it is possible to bypass parliamentary control over the nature and extent of the exceptions. We have therefore  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_704"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 704</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tabled Amendments 126A and 126B, which would remove these powers of sub-delegation. The committee objected not only to the use of these powers, but also that the Government had offered no justification for them. We have subsequently seen, in a letter from the Minister, justification which states that the guidance would be too detailed for legislation, but it was necessary to have an order which required guidance to be complied with because this would give certainty to business about how a business was allowed to operate.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="100209133000003"></a>We have constantly fought for certainty for businesses and very much want to ensure that. The Government's amendment would allow a certain amount of scrutiny because it would make the date for the guidance to come into force subject to the negative procedure. Can the noble Baroness support this decision to compromise with the recommendations of the committee with evidence of any precedent to enshrine guidance in legislation in this way? Does she consider this to be an appropriate procedure and is the negative resolution strong enough? I should also like her to comment on any discussion she may or may not have had with the committee on this matter. Furthermore, can she clarify what would happen if parliamentary scrutiny showed that there were problems with the guidance? Would the only option then be to vote against the commencement date? If that were the case, would it not be more difficult for businesses, and in fact provide less certainty, because they would have to wait for the changed guidance to be implemented and go through the procedure again, even though there might be only a relatively minor change?</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="100209133000004"></a>We understand the need for clarity and certainty, but it would be very helpful to hear what discussions have been had with the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and whether it is satisfied now with the changes. After all, the noble Baroness will have noted that in the report the committee's reaction was strongly opposed to these measures. It is vital for your Lordships now to know what its response is in order that we can then say that we are content with the amendments. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="100209133000007"></a>The role of guidance in the exceptions from age discrimination outside the workplace has been raised in debates on the Bill, and, as the noble Lord, said, by the Delegated Powers Committee in its third report of 2010. The committee's concerns arise in essence because these provisions, which allow for sub-delegation, require strong justification. Government Amendment 126C addresses the committee's concern about sub-delegation by ensuring that guidance made under a power conferred by subsections (3) and (6) can come into force only on a date that is specified in an order. This order cannot  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_705"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 705</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be the same one as that specifying the exceptions to which the guidance relates, and it will subject to the negative procedure in Parliament.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="100209133000008"></a>Government amendment 135ZA is consequential. It applies the provisions in Clause 200 for making orders and regulations under the Bill to those made by the Treasury, as well as those made by a Minister of the Crown. Parliament will be able to debate the provisions, which will be supported by any guidance in the context of the exceptions order, which is subject to the affirmative procedure. Amendment 126C then gives Parliament the opportunity to consider any guidance that is issued. I hope noble Lords will agree that, by including in the Bill scrutiny of the power to bring any guidance into force, this amendment satisfies the concerns expressed by the committee. We have, of course, been in dialogue with the committee.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="100209133000009"></a>Guidance will not alter the scope of any of the exceptions. That would be outside the extent of the power, which therefore cannot be used to amend substantive provisions in the legislation. It will allow us to set out what steps service providers need to take to take advantage of the exceptions so that they are clear about what they need to do to comply with the legislation.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="100209133000010"></a>The justification of the ability to make guidance is straightforward; it is there to ensure that exceptions under Clause 195 can operate as effectively as possible. Section 45 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the effect of which is replicated in paragraph 22(3)(b) of Schedule 3 to the Bill, is a precedent. Under that provision, the use of sex as a factor in determining premiums is permitted on the basis of relevant and accurate actuarial and statistical data that are published and updated in accordance with Treasury guidance. Insurers who comply with the disclosure requirements, and who rely on the data that they disclose, can take advantage of the exception when setting premiums.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="100209133000011"></a>We envisage similar arrangements for using age as a factor in the insurance industry. Without the ability to issue guidance, all the detail on how to comply with an exception would need to be set out in the Act. This would be cumbersome, and inconsistent with the drafting of the rest of the Bill. It would also be harder to make minor necessary changes to the detail to cater for developing practices and procedures in the financial services sector, for example, because a fresh affirmative resolution instrument would be required for every such change.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="100209133000012"></a>The guidance-making provision is particularly important for financial services as age-based exceptions are likely to be complex, and considerable detail will be needed to provide sufficient certainty to service providers. The guidance will be needed for matters such as giving full effect to the proposals on transparency -data publication-and signposting and referrals by one insurance company to another. We aim to consult on the draft exceptions order in autumn 2010. We will consult on any amendments to that guidance unless circumstances require the amendments to be made urgently.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="100209133000013"></a>However, guidance may not be limited to financial services. While the exceptions that are also planned for other services, such as age-based holidays and commercial discounts, are likely to be more straightforward, they  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_706"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 706</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may require such guidance-for instance, to make clear the steps that service providers must take to come within the exception. Health services are far more complex, and it would not be sensible to rule out the use of guidance in that sector too if it is eventually decided-and to the extent that it is decided-to use the power in Clause 195 to make exceptions in relation to health and social care. In most areas, having the exceptions in legislation will suffice, but at least some will need more detail so that service providers can understand their responsibilities. The noble Lord asked what would happen should the commencement date be voted against. It would mean that the guidance would not come into force.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="100209133000014"></a>Amendments 126A and 126B, which would remove subsections (3) and (6) from Clause 195, would remove our ability to provide that clarity. If we could not make guidance, we would have two choices; either granting wide exceptions, which I think nobody would want, or including extremely detailed and often sector-specific provisions in the legislation. Neither of these are satisfactory options.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="100209133000015"></a>We have listened to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. Amendment 126C specifically addresses its concern about parliamentary scrutiny. It ensures that the guidance cannot be used if Parliament is not happy with it, while retaining the necessary advantages offered by guidance. The noble Lord asked me to reiterate assurances about how Clause 195 will be used. It will be just as the noble Lord described. The power will be used to make an order, subject to affirmative resolution, setting out exceptions to the ban from age discrimination to come into force on the day of the ban.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="100209133000016"></a>The noble Lord referred to holidays for older people and exceptions. I reassure the noble Lord that we are doing further work and consultation to ensure that we get the exceptions right. On 27 January, we published a policy statement, which provides further clarity as to the exceptions which we are developing. I will ensure that the noble Lord receives a copy. There will be a further opportunity for consultation on the detail of the exceptions when we consult on the draft order that will contain them in the autumn. I trust that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The new clauses proposed under the amendments would remove three minor rules of law which treat husbands and wives unequally, and they equalise the legal position in respect of civil partners. The amendments would not only bring our law up to date by eliminating provisions that are clearly discriminatory and redundant, but would also remove the existing incompatibilities in UK law with Article 5 of Protocol 7 to the European Convention on Human Rights. That article protects the right to equality between spouses, except for any special provision the state needs to make to protect children. These amendments would leave it open to the Government to proceed with signature and ratification of Protocol 7 to the convention should it choose to do so, as I hope it will, to fulfil the long-standing commitment.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="100209133000021"></a>The proposed new clause to be inserted under Amendment 129ZA abolishes the common-law duty for a husband to maintain his wife. This rule has long been superseded by statutory remedies for obtaining maintenance during a marriage. Consequently, I believe that there is no longer a need for a common law duty to maintain in favour of one spouse only.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="100209133000022"></a>The new clause set out in Amendment 129ZB abolishes a second common law rule, that of the presumption of advancement. This presumption discriminates against husbands and is outdated. The presumption of advancement is a rule of evidence in court proceedings which provides that where there is no evidence to the  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_708"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 708</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>contrary, a husband or father is presumably making a gift when he transfers property to his wife or child. But when a wife transfers property to her husband or a mother to her child, the presumption of advancement does not apply. Unless there is evidence to the contrary, she is presumed not to be making a gift and her husband or child hold the property on trust for her. The effect of the presumption of advancement is clearly discriminatory and its abolition will not have any unfair or undesirable effects, and therefore this amendment seeks to abolish the presumption.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="100209133000023"></a>In order that the UK can ratify Protocol 7, abolition of the presumption of advancement is extended to Northern Ireland. I understand that the Northern Ireland Executive have agreed to this step in principle and will make the necessary arrangements for a legislative consent motion. I am grateful for their assistance.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="100209133000024"></a>The final rule to be addressed is the statutory provision in respect of money and property derived from a housekeeping allowance currently in Section 1 of the Married Women's Property Act 1964. It provides that if a husband pays a housekeeping allowance to his wife, any savings or property derived from this allowance in the absence of an agreement to the contrary belongs to the husband and the wife in equal shares. However, if the wife pays the allowance to the husband, the Act makes no similar provision. Amendment 129ZC amends Section 1 of the 1964 Act so that it applies equally to husbands and wives, and money and property derived from a housekeeping allowance are owned by the husband and wife in equal shares regardless of who paid or received the allowance.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="100209133000025"></a>The final clause set out in Amendment 129ZD inserts a new Section 70A into the Civil Partnership Act 2004 to provide for the equal division of housekeeping allowances paid by one civil partner to the other. This simply mirrors the effect of the previous amendment to the Married Women's Property Act for civil partners, ensuring that their rights are developed in parallel.</p>

<a name="100209-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="100209133000026"></a>I conclude by stressing that these amendments are long overdue and represent an important step in remedying outdated inequalities in our domestic law. In addition, I hope that the Government, if they accept them, will make good their commitment, which is on the record, to sign and ratify Protocol 7 to the convention, dating from the 1997 White Paper, <I>Rights Brought Home</I>.

This is, however, not the most appropriate time to get into discussions about Protocol 7, because there are wider issues to be addressed which deserve significant scrutiny. This is a debate for another time, and perhaps the Minister might be able to inform your Lordships when an appropriate time might be. In her Second Reading speech, she made reference to the fact that the Government would continue to seek a suitable legislative vehicle for these changes. Has she found such a vehicle yet? If so, can she give us a brief steer as to what vehicle is going to be used?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="100209133000028"></a>Furthermore, can she confirm whether Amendment 129ZA is in fact necessary? The Question for Written Answer of the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, about what legislative changes would need to be made to enable the UK to ratify Protocol 7 was answered by the late Lord Williams of Mostyn, who said that the common law presumption of "advancement" would have to be altered. I am informed that the judgment of the House of Lords in the Stack and Dowden case has already changed the law in this respect. Am I correct in that assumption? If so, we recognise the good intentions of these amendments but regret that it may be that the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill-I am nervous about ever saying this-is mistaken about the legal changes. However, where the noble Lord is concerned, I always stand to be corrected.</p>

That is a completely separate matter and no doubt can be debated hereafter if necessary. All I am concerned to do tonight is to sweep away archaic and outmoded provisions and secure equality between the spouses in that respect. One advantage of that would be to leave it open to the Government to take that further step. As far as the other point is concerned, I am not a family lawyer. I have not the faintest idea whether the comments of Lord Williams of Mostyn and the events in the House of Lords did or did not have the effect he said. However, it seems to me that the Government can now tell us whether or not they think that this is necessary.</p>

I would be equally loath to question anything that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has said, but, with all the other things going on, there has not been time to pose these questions to him. I have in mind the considerable inequalities that still remain between husbands and wives, men and women, with regard to pay, the percentages who get the very top jobs, and pension arrangements. I have to say again that, as far as the European regulations were concerned, I found it extremely disturbing that on issues such as annuities, women and men were not treated the same even though they were equally entitled, by what they had earned over the years, to the same annuity. I still find these things worrying. I would like to be reassured that they are being taken into account; that the Minister has the answers to them; and, above all, that my noble friend Lord Lester took all that into account when he was deciding that all these things could just be finished with completely.</p>

These amendments also address those aspects of UK law that are incompatible with Article 5 of the 7th Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="100209133000032"></a>Article 5 of the 7th Protocol provides that spouses shall have equality of rights and responsibilities between them and in their relations with their children both during the course of a marriage and in the event of its  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_710"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 710</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>dissolution. It does not prevent states taking such measures as are necessary to protect the interests of the children. Of course our legislation makes the welfare of children the courts' paramount consideration when making decisions.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="100209133000033"></a>These amendments therefore remove three minor legal provisions which discriminate between spouses. Although technically removing provisions which appear to benefit one spouse over the other, in reality the amendments confer no practical advantage or disadvantage on either spouse. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, set out very clearly the three provisions in question, so I will not reiterate those points.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="100209133000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked me about new Clause 129ZC and whether it is absolutely necessary. He cited my erstwhile friend Lord Williams of Mostyn in relation to the amendment. We believe that new Clause 129ZC amends the final rule so that it applies equally to husbands and wives and so that property derived from a housekeeping allowance is owned by the husband and wife in equal shares regardless of who paid or received the allowance. So we do believe that it is necessary.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="100209133000035"></a>In addition, new Clause 129ZD, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, inserts a new Section 70A into the Civil Partnership Act 2004 to provide, as he said, for the equal division of housekeeping allowances paid by one civil partner to another. This is in line with the Government's objective that civil partners should have parallel rights to those of married people, and the Government are very pleased to accept this amendment. As the noble Lord says, these amendments represent an important opportunity not only to remedy outmoded inequalities in our domestic law but also to remove this barrier to ratification of the 7th Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. The Government have long indicated their commitment to ratification of the protocol, and I am grateful to the noble Lord for tabling these amendments to the Bill, which will allow us to move this process forward.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="100209133000036"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked about scrutiny of the 7th Protocol and what vehicle would be used for legislative changes. The amendments moved today suffice to make our law compatible with the 7th Protocol, so we have the perfect vehicle right before us today. We are considering that very vehicle now. There would need to be the usual consideration under the Ponsonby rule of the ratification of the 7th Protocol, but that cannot now be completed in this Parliament. In particular, it would require an affirmative vote in each House.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="100209133000037"></a>The noble Lord asked whether presumption of advancement remained after the case of Stack v Dowden. The presumption of advancement still applies after that case, which relates only to ownership of the domestic home and not to other property.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="100209133000038"></a>I well understand the concern expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, when she suggests that women still have a very tough time with regard to equality in insurance, pay and so on. I reiterate that the Government are totally committed to equality. We wish to remove the provisions that treat either husbands or wives in a discriminatory way. In practical terms, women will not lose out as a result of this Bill, as I have explained, and it will remove

We believe that accepting the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, is a very good way forward, and I urge your Lordships to accept them.</p>

I share the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, about wider inequalities that cannot be removed, but this is a very modest mouse of a series of proposals that are needed to scrap some archaic laws. It does not seek like a lion to sweep away all inequality against women, although I wish it could. The very fact that the Bill team could produce answers immediately to highly technical questions reminds me that I should apologise through the Committee to them for having singled out two members of the team for special praise. I am reminded that they are a team as a whole; by singling out two of them, I did not mean in any way to discriminate against the others. As for scrutiny of ratification of human rights treaties, or any treaties, the House knows that for years I have been saying that we need a mechanism in this House for a treaty scrutiny committee. I am delighted that the Ponsonby rule has been firmed up as it has, but it needs to be made stronger. Finally, above all, I thank the Minister and noble Lords very much for accepting the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="100209133000041"></a>Overall, the role that Europe has played in shaping our current body of equality legislation has been positive. Indeed, much of the relevant European law is based on legislation that was previously in place domestically. However, although it is based on similar concepts and structures, European law has from time to time required us to amend or extend our domestic regime. Our ability to do this without the aid of primary legislation is limited by the extent of the power in Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. As the scope of EU equality law is not generally as wide as domestic equality law, this has resulted in a patchwork of protection and a lot of confusion that led to the Discrimination Law Review-culminating in this Bill, one of the main aims of which is to simplify and harmonise the thicket of legislation that has grown up over more than 40 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="100209133000042"></a>The harmonisation power will future-proof the Bill, so that changes required from Europe can be incorporated into domestic law without disrupting the harmonised approach we have achieved in the Bill. The Government have paid close attention to comments made by the Delegated Powers Committee about the power in its third report of the current Session. These have prompted us to bring forward amendments to which I shall turn after considering the committee's concerns.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_713"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 713</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="100209133000043"></a>The committee noted that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_93"></a><a name="100209133000098"></a>"Clause 196 contains an exceptionally significant Henry VIII power",</p>

<p><a name="100209133000074"></a>enabling the Government, when implementing an EU obligation, to extend the effect of the implementing provision beyond what is required by the obligation. Of course, I agree that this is a significant power; in fact it is vital to ensure that the Bill when enacted retains clarity and coherence. An ability to remove anomalies that may arise seems just common sense.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="100209133000044"></a>The committee also noted that the Government did not provide a precedent, and that the power's extent is much wider than suggested by the example given in the Explanatory Notes. For a precedent, I point to Section 260 of the Civil Partnership Act 2004, which allows Orders in Council to make similar provision outside the scope of European law to those made using Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act, where European law applies. Most of the Bill's provisions are within the scope of Section 2(2) for almost all relevant purposes, and Schedule 24 makes it clear that there are large areas of the Bill to which the power does not apply at all.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="100209133000045"></a>The committee was concerned that the power could be used to replicate in other strands the implementing provisions of an EU obligation which was restricted to a single strand. The power could indeed be used to copy over to the colour and nationality elements of the definition of race any provisions that may be required by European law for the rest; that can only be a positive thing. There will be times when, if we rely solely on Section 2(2), cracks will begin to appear and anomalies to creep in. Without this power, those anomalies will eventually accumulate to the disadvantage of all. However, in the light of the committee's concerns, we are seeking to place some further procedural constraints on this exercise.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="100209133000046"></a>Government Amendment 131A will prevent Ministers circumventing the minimum 12 weeks' consultation that must take place prior to the power's use. We now accept that any weakening of this requirement would be hard to justify in view of the committee's concerns. Amendment 131B ensures that, where the consultation results in any changes of policy, those changes must in turn be consulted on.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="100209133000047"></a>Amendment 134, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Warsi and Lady Morris, seeks to increase the frequency with which a Minister must report to Parliament on the harmonisation power's use from five-yearly to annually. We originally opted for five-yearly reports, both because we expect this power to be used infrequently, and because when it is used full accountability will be built into the process. A requirement to report annually would be overkill. However, in response to the committee's concerns, Amendments 134ZA and 134ZB increase the frequency of ministerial reporting from every five years to every two years. We think this strikes an appropriate balance; I therefore ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment-before she has even moved it, if she will forgive me.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="100209133000048"></a>Amendment 134ZC inserts a new clause that makes detailed provision about the making of orders under this power. It requires, in particular, the Minister to lay an explanatory document before the House alongside a draft order. This document must say why the  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_714"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 714</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>harmonising provision is being made, and explain why the Minister considers that the conditions for using the power are met. It must give details of the consultation, the responses received and any changes to the proposals made as a result of those responses. This procedure will enable Parliament to challenge the Government in a detailed and informed way each time they seek to use this power.</p>

<a name="100209-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="100209133000049"></a>Finally, I will speak to Amendments 134B and 134C, which are consequential to the substantive amendments relating to exceptions for marriage and broadcasting respectively, which the Government accepted earlier in this Committee. We do not consider that it would be appropriate for the harmonisation power to be used to affect these exceptions-hence Amendments 134B and 134C insert references to the relevant provisions into Schedule 24, putting them outside the scope of the harmonisation power. I beg to move.</p>

We are trying to future-proof the Bill, but I entirely accept the concerns expressed by the noble Lord and that he will wish to return to them at a later stage.</p>

I am indebted to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee for bringing these points to our attention.</p>

<a name="100209-0017.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="100209133000056"></a>Although it has not been spoken to, I should like to comment on Amendment 136ZZA in the names of the noble Baronesses, Lady Warsi and Lady Morris, which seeks to probe why the provisions for the control of secondary legislation do not currently apply to an order which makes provision in consequence of the commencement of some or all of the Bill, but which is in a separate instrument, as provided for in Clause 200(7). The absence of such control was noted by the Delegated Powers Committee in its third report of the current Session. This was not an oversight. We had already provided that any such orders that made consequential amendments to primary legislation should be subject to the affirmative procedure. However, we did not believe that such control was strictly necessary for other orders because they can contain only minor, consequential and transitional provisions. But equally this is not an issue where we would seek disagreement  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_717"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column 717</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with the committee, so we are happy to accept the principle behind the noble Baronesses's amendment on the basis that it responds to the committee's findings. We have accordingly introduced our own Amendments 136ZZZA and 136ZZZB, not because that of the opposition is defective, but because the advice of counsel is that it would be clearer to take the slightly less convoluted language we propose. We therefore urge the noble Baronesses not to press their amendment.</p>

<a name="100209-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="100209133000057"></a>The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in its report on Parts 1 to 5 of the Bill recommended that an "affirmative" parliamentary control procedure apply to any regulations made by Ministers to amend Section 1, that add or remove public authorities subject to Clause 1-the public sector duty regarding socio-economic inequalities. We, the Scottish Government and Welsh Assembly are grateful for the recommendation of the committee and happy to accept that an affirmative procedure should apply to such regulations. The socio-economic duty is obviously novel and innovative, and it is appropriate that Parliament should give careful consideration to any changes we propose to the list of public bodies subject to it. Amendment 135A therefore makes the necessary changes to Clause 200 to ensure that any regulations under Section 2 made by Ministers of the Crown are subject to the affirmative procedure. Amendments 136ZA and 136ZB make the necessary changes to Clauses 201 and 202 respectively to ensure that regulations made by the Welsh and Scottish Ministers under Section 2 are also subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="100209-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="100209133000058"></a>The Delegated Powers Committee identified in its second report of this Session an omission in relation to the parliamentary control of Orders in Council, which Amendment 135 rectifies. While the vast majority of secondary legislation in the Bill will be delivered by ministerial order or regulations, Clause 82, headed "Offshore work", uniquely uses an Order in Council to specify where and how the Bill, in so far as it relates to work, applies to offshore workers. An Order in Council is appropriate because Clause 82 concerns the application of the Bill beyond UK territorial waters. Due to an oversight, the Bill does not provide a parliamentary procedure for Clause 82 because it currently contains no reference to "Orders in Council". Such orders should, as with other secondary legislation, be capable of annulment by either House of Parliament. Amendment 135 achieves this.</p>

<a name="100209-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="100209133000059"></a>I am again indebted to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee for bringing to our attention a slight uncertainty in the drafting of Clause 200. As it highlighted, this formulation could be regarded as ambiguous as to whether it includes those special cases mentioned in subsection (3) of the clause which should be subject to the negative procedure. Amendment 136 therefore clarifies that these orders should be subject to that procedure. Amendments 136ZAC and 136ZCC do exactly the same in respect of the powers of the Welsh and the Scottish Ministers. I beg to move.</p>

It highlighted that subsection (1) of Clause 200 disapplies the hybrid instrument procedure for all the powers subject to the affirmative instrument in this Bill. I am grateful that the Minister and her team have looked into the eight affirmative instruments already in light of the report of the committee. We now see that we were right to table these amendments and raise the concern that perhaps it was not necessary to disapply the hybridity procedure from all these instruments when it applies only to a few. The Government have recognised that and have now limited the disapplication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="100209133000066"></a>Amendment 136ZZB would remove the blanket exemption from the hybrid procedure that Clause 200(10) currently affords the Bill. This has been tabled following the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee's decision to draw the House's attention to the provision in its third report of this Session.</p>

<a name="100209-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="100209133000067"></a>As the noble Lord remarked, the Government have been re-examining subsection (10) in light of the committee's comments, and we accept that it would be helpful to clarify on the face of the Bill precisely when we consider the hybrid procedure should be disapplied if it arises. However, we do not think it necessary to remove the exception completely as the noble Lord proposed.</p>

<a name="100209-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="100209133000068"></a>The reality is we think it highly unlikely that powers in the Bill would be exercised in such a way that the House would consider the hybrid procedure to be applicable, but it is a theoretical possibility. In a handful of cases where those circumstances might arise, we consider the hybrid procedure would be unwarranted so we think it appropriate to provide that the procedure should not apply in specified cases.</p>

<a name="100209-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="100209133000069"></a>There are safeguards in these cases. Before adding any new bodies to either of the lists, for example, under the socio-economic duty and the public sector equality duty, and making specific public sector equality

Similar consultation will be carried out before the specific duty regulations are made. We have also provided that orders and regulations made using these powers will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="100209-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="100209133000070"></a>Government Amendment 136ZZC narrows the exception down to the clauses which could theoretically be subject to the hybrid procedure; for the reasons I have explained, we do not think that would be warranted.</p>

<a name="100209-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="100209133000071"></a>I hope that the House will agree that our proposal is measured and that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<ul><a name="100209101000278"></a>
<p>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Asylum (Designated States) Order 2010.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="100209101000003"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="100209101000285"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, this is the sixth order that we have brought forward adding countries to the list of those to which the non-suspensive appeal provisions in Section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 apply. This section allows the Secretary of State to add a country to the list if he is satisfied that there is in general no serious risk of persecution of persons entitled to reside there and that removal to that country of persons entitled to reside there will not result in a general breach of the UK's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000004"></a>The section also provides that an unsuccessful asylum or human rights claim made by a person entitled to reside in a designated state must be certified as clearly unfounded, unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that the claim is not clearly unfounded. The effect of such a certification is that a person must leave the United Kingdom before appealing the decision to refuse their claim, while still having an out-of-country right of appeal.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000005"></a>I should add that the test to determine whether a claim is clearly unfounded, and therefore certifiable under the provisions of the 2002 Act, can be applied to any asylum claim-those made by residents of designated states and those made by residents of other countries if the claim is considered to be clearly unfounded.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000006"></a>Since their introduction, the powers to add countries to the list have been used on a progressive basis to ensure that the provisions work well and are successful in stopping people making unfounded applications for asylum and unnecessarily prolonging the appeals process. The evidence to date on the 24 countries already on the list demonstrates that this is indeed the case and that the powers have made a significant impact in  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC148"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reducing the number of asylum applicants from those countries. Asylum intake from the 24 designated countries in the first year of designation has shown a consistent drop of 49 per cent on average.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000007"></a>On the decision-making process for considering an asylum or human rights claims from a resident of a designated country, each claim is given full and proper consideration on its individual merits by a fully trained caseworker. Applicants are entitled to legal aid and advice as part of the process, as well as the right of appeal against any refusal decision, albeit from outside the country. Fail-safes in addition to those already in place for asylum claims from those not entitled to reside in designated countries are built into the process. These include senior caseworker approval for each and every decision, thus ensuring the integrity of the decision-making process, and judicial review of decisions certified as clearly unfounded, where an applicant believes that their case was wrongly certified.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000008"></a>As a result of this process, we have been able to remove from the United Kingdom individuals whose asylum claims were established to be unfounded and who have diverted resources away from processing claims of those in genuine need of international protection. In view of the successful operation of the provisions thus far, we have decided that the time is right for us to add a further two countries to the list. The draft order adds South Korea and Kosovo to the list. The addition of the latter is a technical amendment, as Kosovo was designated as a province of Serbia in 2003. Kosovo became independent of Serbia on 17 February 2008 and, therefore, is now added separately in its own right. The number of asylum claims from South Koreans is in real terms relatively low, but is none the less disproportionately high given what we know about the situation in South Korea.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000009"></a>The assessment as to whether a particular country meets the test for designation is based not simply on the number of applications received from people who are entitled to reside in that country or the percentage of those applications that are unsuccessful. We instead consider the general conditions for the population in the country itself, not the profile of claimants who have made applications in the UK. Broadly speaking, we would look to see what evidence there is of persecution or human rights breaches within a country and how widespread such treatment is.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000010"></a>In considering the two countries listed in the draft order, we took into account our published country of origin information material, which utilises a wide range of recognised and publicly disclosable governmental and non-governmental sources. I remind the Committee that we gave an undertaking to consult the Advisory Panel on Country Information on the country information that is used as a basis for the decision to designate a country. The APCI was an independent body created under the 2002 Act to advise the Secretary of State on the accuracy and objectivity of country information produced by the Home Office in the context of asylum applications. The APCI has now been replaced by the Independent Advisory Group on Country Information under the auspices of the independent chief inspector of the UK Border Agency, so we consulted the IAGCI.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC149"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000011"></a>The panel's role in the country designation process is solely to consider the country of origin information material; it has no power to comment on the decision whether or not to designate. The panel considered the country of origin information produced on the two countries proposed in the draft order and confirmed that it is satisfied with the country information for these two states. The extension of the list to include these countries is not to say that they are totally safe for everyone; what we are saying is that we are satisfied that South Korea and Kosovo meet the legal test.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000012"></a>The draft order represents a gradual increase and progressive use of the powers under the 2002 Act and builds on the programme to reform our asylum and immigration system. At the same time, we continue to ensure that we do not deny legitimate claims a right and proper hearing and that we provide a safe haven for those in genuine need of international protection. I therefore commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000013"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="100209101000286"></a>Viscount Bridgeman:</b> My Lords, we on these Benches support the order and I thank the Minister for his comprehensive explanation of the background. We note that the Republic of Korea-South Korea-and Kosovo are the subject of the order. I have three questions. In fact, I now have two, as the Minister has given an assurance that each asylum claim is assessed on a case-by-case basis. First, can the Minister say how many asylum applications the Government receive on average per year from these countries and what the most common cause is of asylum applications? Secondly, how regularly is the list reviewed and according to what criteria?</p>

<p><a name="100209101000014"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="100209101000287"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for introducing the order and for explaining the effect of putting a country on the white list, which, as he said, already applies to 24 other countries. A person from those countries on the list whose application for asylum is unsuccessful no longer has the right of appeal.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000015"></a>The last time we had a designated states order was July 2007, when I asked, for the second time, whether the Government had considered the use of the power to designate states in respect of straight people only, given that so many countries tolerate hate speech and violence against homosexuals or even pass explicitly anti-gay legislation, such as the Bill in Uganda, which President Obama has described as "odious". I had no answer on either occasion, so I try for the third time to persuade the Minister to agree that subsection (5C)(h) would allow the Secretary of State to designate a state for persons of a given sexual orientation if he considers that appropriate and, further, that the persecution of gays in some states would fully justify this use of the power.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000016"></a>Before I turn to the two states covered by this order, let me deal with the statistics that the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, requested. They are already available, as the Minister may remind us, on the Home Office website, although they are slightly difficult to find-I had to ask the assistance of the Library this morning in locating them.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC150"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000017"></a>Although Kosovo became independent on 7 February 2008, as the Minister explained, it is not distinguished separately in the figures; presumably, it is included under Serbia and Montenegro. Is it the intention to separate out the Kosovo figures? Why was that not done immediately Kosovo became independent?</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000018"></a>As regards Korea, the figures show a substantial inflow of asylum applicants, curiously enough peaking in the third quarter of all the past few years that I have looked at. For example, in quarter 3 of 2009 there were 3,630. I shall deal later with the reason why some of these people apply to the UK for asylum.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000019"></a>On Kosovo, the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, EULEX, is the largest civilian mission ever launched under the common security and defence policy, with about 3,000 personnel. Its central aim is to assist and support the Kosovo authorities in the rule of law, specifically in the police, judiciary and customs areas. There is also a UN mission, UNMIK, with a budget of over $200 million, and the Secretary-General has a special representative, who told the Security Council last month that,</p>
<ul><a name="100209101000254"></a>"Northern Kosovo ... remains a flashpoint. Relations between the Kosovo Serb and Kosovo Albanian communities there remain tense".</ul>
<p><a name="100209101000249"></a>The SRSG reported "positive news" on the relocation by the EU and USAID of 140 Roma families on a heavily lead-contaminated site in northern Mitrovica to more suitable residential accommodation, but all the people on this site need immediate medical attention. They also need to be part of a social inclusion plan that addresses the problems of minority IDPs from a human rights perspective and deals effectively with the equally poisonous inter-ethnic environment that affects the Roma in Kosovo in particular.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000020"></a>A state that needs such huge inputs from international agencies but still has not solved many of its own human rights problems does not appear at first sight to be one in which the Secretary of State can be satisfied that there is no serious risk of persecution, particularly of minorities. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe reported last October that the UNHCR was recommending against the return of existing Roma refugees and it urged member states not to return failed Roma asylum seekers to Kosovo until the UNHCR considered that it was safe to do so. Here, again, I appeal to the Minister and ask whether the Government have considered exercising the powers in subsection (5C)(h) of the parent Act to designate the state of Kosovo in relation to persons of a particular ethnic orientation so that Roma may be exempted from this order.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000021"></a>On Korea, we have one major concern. At some point in 2008-perhaps the Minister can give the exact date-the UKBA began refusing the asylum claims of North Korean nationals on the basis that they had or were entitled to South Korean nationality and that, irrespective of the risk in North Korea, they could safely be returned to South Korea. A major country guidance case on the legality of this approach is due to be heard by the tribunal in April or May 2010. I have given the Minister notice of the case and of the reference to it.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC151"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="100209101000260"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000022"></a>The arguments are that North Koreans do not automatically qualify for South Korean citizenship and that it is not lawful to compel them to take up a new nationality just to relieve the UK of its refugee convention obligations. By way of analogy, the Home Office does not expect all Jewish asylum seekers to apply for Israeli nationality under the law of return before it has substantively determined their claims. Therefore, it should not expect North Korean nationals automatically to apply for South Korean nationality. Alternatively, even if North Korean nationals are automatically also nationals of South Korea de jure, their nationality is not effective because the South Korean authorities put considerable practical barriers-such as those in relation to obtaining passports-in the way of accessing safety in South Korea.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000023"></a>I am oversimplifying an extremely complex set of legal arguments and we understand that the Home Office has instructed counsel from Blackstone's to present its case at the tribunal. That is a very unusual move at this stage in litigation, but cases have been won by Refugee and Migrant Justice before immigration judges in the last month or so, on precisely the same arguments, for clients who would have been caught by the certification provisions had the designated states order been in force at the time. It is therefore a matter of considerable concern that the UKBA is proposing to add South Korea to the white list at this time, before the current litigation on behalf of North Koreans has been settled.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000024"></a>I recognise that designation orders are not meant to be retrospective. No doubt the Minister will repeat the assurances that the noble Viscount asked for and which were given on this point in another place, but what happens if the test case is successful? The courts would then have decided that North Koreans are not returnable but the Government will say that Parliament has decided that they are because they are de jure South Korean nationals. We ask for an undertaking that, if we pass this order, it will not apply to asylum seekers asserting North Korean nationality.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000025"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="100209101000288"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lords who have participated and, as usual, asked testing questions. I turn first to the questions asked by the noble Viscount. I can assist with those about the number of asylum seekers, but less so with those about reasons, because we do not record them. We do not have a central record. On numbers, taking the three years 2007, 2008 and 2009, we had 25 applications from South Korea in 2007, 10 in 2008 and five in 2009. From Kosovo, we had 50 applications in 2007, 70 in 2008 and 20 in 2009. The figures for 2008 and 2009 are provisional.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000026"></a>To digress to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about why the applications come in the third quarter, that will, I am afraid, remain a mystery, at least to me. It is not a question that I have an answer to. I have already dealt with the question of assurance. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, as ever, put to me a series of testing questions with great knowledge and research. I can probably do some justice to these, but not as much as he might wish. On the certification of heterosexual people only, I take on board the noble

Gay people's situations will be considered as part of a country's general situation, but I take the noble Lord's point and I will respond to him in more detail on that.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000027"></a>On Kosovo, we are not saying that such countries are safer for everyone but in general we accept that they have a legal system that does not discriminate against groups of people in law. I can reassure the noble Lord that numbers for Kosovo are recorded separately from those for Serbia and Montenegro. Since 2003, Kosovo has been a fully designated state, separate from Serbia. Our judgment is that it is generally politically, ethnically and religiously stable and has a good human rights record. There are some areas of concern, which I think the noble Lord cited: societal discrimination against ethnic minorities and homosexuals; domestic violence against women; some concerns about human trafficking; and abuses that take place. These do not generally reach the Article 3 thresholds and avenues for redress are available. I will, as I have said, respond to the noble Lord in greater detail in writing.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000028"></a>With regard to North Korea, again, I shall write to the noble Lord on why asylum applications have been refused. Our in-country guidance is that asylum applications from North Korea should continue to be considered on their individual merits. If an application is refused and the individual is entitled to reside in South Korea, the claim is considered to be clearly unfounded. The case will be reconsidered for certification but it should be noted that that will be after the case has been looked at on its individual merits. However, as I said, I shall write to the noble Lord on that broader issue.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000029"></a>I shall also write to the noble Lord on the question that he raised in respect of the AIT. It is very important that we consider carefully the situation in North Korea. We cannot give the undertaking that the noble Lord requested but I give a commitment to investigate the matter and to write to him in the detail that his question deserves. I hope that with those assurances the order will commend itself to your Lordships.</p>

Section 303(5) of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 amends the CROW Act to include coastal margin in the definition of access land. It also inserts a provision that enables the Secretary of State to specify certain land as coastal margin.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000031"></a>The Marine and Coastal Access Act is a great achievement. It took almost a year to complete its passage through Parliament and came out all the stronger for the careful scrutiny that it received in this House and the other place. Today I offer my plaudits to the noble Lords I see before me who contributed to the deliberations in our extensive scrutiny of the Bill, which we all enjoyed and look back on with the greatest pleasure, given that the outcome was so constructive. I also pay tribute to the excellent pre-legislative scrutiny work completed by Members of this House in the Joint Committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000032"></a>Part 9 of the Act provides for improving access to the English coast. It does this through introducing new sections into two existing pieces of legislation: the long-distance path provisions of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949; and Part 1 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. New Section 3A of the CROW Act, inserted by Section 303 of the 2009 Act, enables amendments to be made by affirmative resolution order to the existing provisions in the CROW Act as they will apply to coastal land. The draft Access to the Countryside (Coastal Margin) (England) Order before us introduces necessary amendments to the CROW Act which are appropriate to the circumstances on the coast and which, alongside the 2009 Act, will help us to deliver our vision for clear, consistent and, as far as possible, continuous access along the English coast.</p>

We considered carefully all the comments received, which in general have supported our consultation proposals, but we have amended the proposals in some respects as a result of the views expressed. I believe that we have before us a way forward that will contribute to striking a fair balance between the interests of the public and the interests of landowners and occupiers.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000034"></a>Article 3 of the order sets out descriptions of land to which the right of access under Section 2(1) of the CROW Act will apply. The descriptions include the line of the English coastal route, land within 2 metres either side of the line of the route, land to the seaward of the route and land to the landward of the route where it is foreshore, cliff, bank, barrier, dune, beach or flat.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000035"></a>Part 1 of the schedule to the order amends the categories of excepted land at Schedule 1 to the CROW Act as they apply to the coastal margin, removing some existing categories, amending some categories to allow the coastal route to go though and adding new categories appropriate to the circumstances of the  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC154"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>coast. Part 2 of the schedule amends the general restrictions at Schedule 2 to the CROW Act, in particular the requirements for control of dogs; for example, it introduces a requirement that a person on the coastal margin accompanied by a dog must keep the dog under effective control and it relaxes restrictions on angling-related activity, for obvious reasons as far as the coast is concerned. Part 3 of the schedule amends the process for making exclusions or restrictions of access and adds a new power to restrict or exclude access to areas of salt marsh or flats where they are unsuitable for the public.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000036"></a>The changes are proportionate and appropriate. The flexibility in the Act and the extensive consultation that Natural England will undertake prior to recommending any route will ensure that all interests are taken into account and that any necessary exclusions and restrictions are in place from the outset. I commend the order to the Committee and I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000037"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="100209101000291"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the order, which we welcome. Those of us who saw through the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, of which he kindly reminded us, will have fond memories of those days spent in Committee but a year ago; it seems a distant memory. However, it is not under that Act that the order is being made; the Minister rightly said that the purpose of the order is to amend the CROW Act.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000038"></a>I must declare an interest: I am a farmer and landowner. Although I do not farm on the coast, I am a member of the National Farmers' Union, which I know made submissions to the consultation process.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000039"></a>The schedule is where the key matters lie. If I pose questions to the Minister, it is just to get clarification of quite complex legislation that has many impacts, not only on the coastal route strip but also on the margin, which is also part and parcel of the coast. The order in some cases changes arrangements for existing CROW Act land and an owner's ability to control visitors and activities on it. It is important to try to set those in context.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000040"></a>First, land ploughed in the previous 12 months for the purpose of growing crops or trees is no longer excepted if it is part of the coastal route strip. As I understand it, the margin will be able to be accessed, contrary to what we were led to believe when we discussed these matters. We understood that the strip was confined and that "spreading room", as it came to be known, would not extend into ploughed land adjacent to the coastal strip. Can the Minister reassure us on that? Similarly, land within 20 metres of a dwelling is no longer excepted if it is part of coastal margin-that means the spreading room area. Assurances were given about privacy and I hope that the provisions do not affect the privacy of people whose property happens to be in that situation.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000041"></a>A golf course is no longer excepted if it is on the coastal margin, which will mean that, in most cases, the whole golf course will be spreading room available from a coastal path, in the sense that there would be no natural landward boundary on most golf courses. That means that much of coastal links would be fully

People could have a picnic, play a game of football or whatever on the golf course. That may not seem a likely possibility but, none the less, it is something about which I am sure that people who run golf courses would be concerned.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000042"></a>The land used for flood defence or sea defence works, too, is no longer excepted. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me, because I live in an area where the sea bank is very important and can represent a jolly good walking route-indeed, I use it myself-but there may be more delicate circumstances where, because of natural sand dunes, pedestrian access could over time create problems with the vegetation that holds the sand dunes together. I hope that alternative path arrangements will be encouraged if at any time access to the defence works poses a threat.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000043"></a>I am glad that the coastal margin and spreading room elements will not include-I believe that I am right to say-a regulated caravan or camping site. We were given that assurance when discussing the Marine and Coastal Access Bill. I am pleased about that, but we also need to be mindful of the fact that policing it will be burdensome and that the privacy of people on those sites may be vulnerable. I hope that the impact of that right will be reviewed, so that if it presents a problem it can be revisited at some stage. As expected, fishing is allowed. I think that all of us welcome the fact that sea angling, which is a sport enjoyed by many people, will still be allowed along the coastal path-indeed, it might be encouraged by the improved access.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000044"></a>I express some concern about the dog requirements. We know that dogs must be kept on a lead from 1 March to 31 July, but on margin land they do not have to be kept under a lead as long as they are under control. The Minister will know as well as anyone that keeping dogs under control is a fine art. It is hard to know just what can be done if a dog runs out of control. What rights would owners have if dogs got out of their control in the spreading room area?</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000045"></a>I note that Natural England supplants the national park authorities and all the countryside bodies, such as the Forestry Commission, in relation to coastal margin, which means that the management of that element of their activities will come under Natural England's control. I hope that a proper working relationship will be encouraged between those bodies. No doubt there have already been discussions. It would be useful if the Minister could reassure us on that point as well.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000046"></a>I have already mentioned the whole business of dogs on the coastal margin. Access to salt marshes or flats may be denied if Natural England believes that the land is unsuitable for public access, but will that include nature reserves and bird breeding areas? I read that that could be the case. The order says specifically that access to the coastal margin cannot be made indefinitely for nature conservation or heritage preservation. Have I got that wrong? It would be rather surprising if paths were allowed through areas where birds were breeding and there was an imperative to provide for the security of breeding grounds.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000047"></a>I move now to the effects on farming. Last Saturday, Radio 4's "Farming Today" investigated the operation of the CROW Act. There were interviews with a

Both claimed-I think that this is good news-to have no quarrel with people who obey the rules, but the farmer had had people light barbecues on his land and use the fencing for the purpose and, on one occasion, a wooden gate to keep a fire going, while the landowner claimed that the removal of signs indicating where access was allowed was a daily occurrence. What responsibility will Natural England have to monitor and replace signs? Both claimed that dogs normally stray from the path, as do people when the ground is wet and they are not wearing boots. The result of the first is fouling on farmland and of the second is soil compaction. Instances were given of dog faeces passing on a parasite that is fatal to cattle. There are problems with allowing public access to farming areas.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000048"></a>The training of racehorses in the gallops was debated at length in 2000 when the CROW Act was introduced and the record will show the concerns expressed about walkers using paths while horses are being exercised. The rules put in place to protect both parties are expunged in this order; indeed, gallops are expressly permitted as margin land. Who will be liable in the event of injury to a person by a horse or damage to a horse caused by the presence of a person on land adjacent to that used for training?</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000049"></a>We talked about golf courses earlier. In the event of members of the public straying on to golf courses, does the golfer have responsibility for ensuring that his hook shot misses the rambler? Who is liable in the event of such an accident occurring, or do people wander on to a golf course at their own risk-in which case, who advises them that that is the case?</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000050"></a>A number of matters arise from the order but, on the whole, we recognise how important it is for the safeguarding of the principles of coastal access, which we support. We hope that the Government will keep the order's operation under review at all times and, in co-operation with Natural England and local authorities, will revisit it should there be a situation in which it needs to be reviewed because of situations arising.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000051"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100209101000292"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My Lords, I, too, am pleased to be present at this reunion of-I am not quite sure what to say-old colleagues. We should perhaps toast as an absent friend the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, who, along with the Minister, did so much to get the marathon Bill past the rest of us. I understand that people are now calling the Act "MACA". I am not sure whether that is a desirable acronym, but that is what happens nowadays.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000052"></a>The Minister said that the order is a way forward. I am not sure whether that is a pun about the coastal path or whether the coastal path is going round in circles, but the order is very welcome. I was delighted to hear the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, say that the Conservatives welcome the order and that they support, in his words,</p>
<ul><a name="100209101000255"></a>"the principles of coastal access".</ul>
<p><a name="100209101000250"></a>It is possible-but perhaps not likely-that after the coming general election the noble Lord may have more to do with the implementation of this order than the noble Lord, Lord Davies. I remain to be convinced about that, but we will see. Who knows?</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000053"></a>As far as I can tell, having tried to go through the order with a fine-tooth comb, it is in line with the Act and the commitments and statements made by the Government and Ministers as the Bill was going through this House and the House of Commons. As always in these matters, I am astonished by the complexity of the order. I wonder whether modern legislation needs to be quite as complex as it is; the country did not collapse 30, 40 or 80 years ago when Acts of Parliament were much simpler and there was much less secondary legislation. However, we are where we are and we get what we are presented with. As always, I blame computers because they make it all possible. However, as I said, the order seems to be generally in line with the Act and what we were told and I very much welcome it.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000054"></a>As the Bill was going through your Lordships' House, we made the point that nearly everything in the order should have been in the primary legislation. When the CROW Act was passed nearly 10 years ago, the equivalent regulations were in the primary legislation, particularly in Schedules 1 and 2. I still do not understand why it was not possible to amend them directly through the Marine and Coastal Access Bill as it was going through the House and before it was passed. However, we are where we are and we now have the order in front of us.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000055"></a>One general question concerns where we are with the draft scheme. I understand that the consultation period has now closed and I wonder how long it will take Natural England to present the definitive scheme to the Secretary of State for approval.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000056"></a>One or two minor points struck me as I was going through the order. Some of them are repetitions of points that I made when we were discussing Part 9 of the Marine and Coastal Access Bill as it was going through the House, while the others have just occurred to me. These will probably come to light when we see the final version of the scheme but, more important, as we see the proposals for each section of coast. The proof of the pudding will be in how it works out in practice. Some of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, in connection with the relationship with farmland, farmers and farming will have to be resolved locally on the ground and we will see in two or three years' time whether it succeeds or not. We need to come to a solution that is, if not the most desirable, acceptable to all the different parties involved. Clearly there will have to be compromises.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000057"></a>Article 3, which covers descriptions of coastal margin, refers to part of the coastal margin as being, as we would expect,</p>
<ul><a name="100209101000256"></a>"land which is seaward of ... an approved section of the English coastal route and lies between",</ul>
<p><a name="100209101000251"></a>that route and the sea. I started thinking about what would happen when there were breaks between the path and the sea. It occurred to me that if there was a building-say, a coastguard's cabin-on top of the cliff, everyone would take the common-sense view that there was a hole in the access land in the coastal margin where that building was and that the coastal margin would continue either side of the building.  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC158"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Therefore, the margin would continue on the seaward side of such an interruption, even though technically it would not run continuously between the path and the sea.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000058"></a>However, I wondered how big an obstruction would have to be before Natural England said that there was no longer access to the foreshore. An example might be a housing estate that goes right up to the edge of the foreshore. Because of the nature of the foreshore there-perhaps there is a cliff and then the foreshore-the coastal path has to go round the back of the housing estate. Alternatively, there might be some sort of defence installation or perhaps a caravan site that the path cannot go through, or, if the path can get through, there will still be a gap between the path and the foreshore. How big does the obstruction have to be before access to the foreshore is stopped, or will such access always be presumed where it is possible and sensible, even if quite a big obstruction forms excepted land between the foreshore and the path? Again, I suspect that that is something that we will find out in practice when we look at the proposals that Natural England comes back with, but it is an interesting question that I do not think we have discussed before.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000059"></a>Article 5 concerns cases where the landward boundary is to coincide with a physical feature. I simply repeat the point that I made before. If that physical feature is a cliff that can be climbed on or if it has important natural features-perhaps plants or birds nesting-it is important for a number of reasons that the boundary should coincide with the cliff top and not the cliff bottom. That issue has arisen in a number of places on ordinary CROW land. I made that point when we discussed the Bill as it went through the House and I make it again now.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000060"></a>Part 2 of the schedule concerns restrictions to be observed by persons exercising right of access and relates to Schedule 2 to the CROW Act. The important point to make here-it has been made many times but is still misunderstood by some people-is that these restrictions apply to the right of access under the CROW Act but do not apply to any other access, whether by right or by permission, that exists on that land.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000061"></a>Specifically, in relation to coastal land, if there are at the moment common-law rights-for example, of access to the foreshore on horse-are they affected in any way by this Act? Do they still exist and apply? Equally, if people have, by custom or by permission of the landowners, been able to do things on land that are specifically excluded from the right of access under CROW, will they still be able to do them if the same conditions continue? This was a source of great confusion when the CROW Act was first passed and it is still sometimes a source of confusion because of the wording. If you are on the land because you are exercising the right of access under CROW, these restrictions apply. If you are on the land by virtue of some other right, or by consent, these restrictions do not necessarily apply. They may, but not necessarily, and they certainly do not apply in the form set out in the order. That is a very important principle because this Act, like the  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC159"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>CROW Act, is not intended to restrict existing activities that happen because people are there either by right or with permission.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000062"></a>I heard what the noble Lord said about salt marshes and flats. It is clear that in some cases it is sensible that there should be restrictions, but I hope that these will not be automatic restrictions whereby just because something is a salt marsh or a flat people are not allowed to go there. There are many salt marshes and flats to which it is perfectly reasonable for people to have access. "Unsuitable" is the sort of word that appears in legislation and potentially gives lawyers a field day. However, if common sense is applied, we can reach a satisfactory situation.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000063"></a>Finally, I hope that Section 26 restrictions, which are for nature conservation and heritage preservation, will not be used in a blanket or draconian way where they apply to climbing on cliffs. At the moment a whole series of extremely intricate rules and regulations applies to where climbers can climb on cliffs where birds are nesting. They are generally known to climbers as "bird bans". I remind the Committee that I have been a climber all my life. These rules are negotiated in a very intricate way by the British Mountaineering Council and its local representatives, the RSPB and its local representatives and other local nature conservation bodies. They apply particularly to sea cliffs and they work. They are completely voluntary; there are no sanctions for breaking them.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000064"></a>I make a point that I have made once or twice in your Lordships' House: when you have a group of fairly anarchic, disorganised people, such as rock climbers, who by and large are not organised in clubs, organisations or societies but do it off their own bat, the system works. It works because the people taking part in the climbing accept it. It has been negotiated by their representatives, the BMC and their local access representatives. Any attempt to bring in bans on a wider, more blanket basis, which are clearly not related to the particular circumstances of particular birds on particular cliffs, would not work because people would start to ignore them. It is just one of those things. We have a system that a lot of people put a lot of effort into. It works and everybody agrees that it works. The fact that there are climbers on adjoining parts of the cliff is a disincentive to those who might want to abseil down and steal eggs or whatever they might want to do. It is a system that works and I urge that any attempt to put blanket statutory bans on these cliffs should be resisted. That would work, in practice, far worse than the present voluntary system.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000065"></a>That is the end of the party political broadcast on behalf of rock climbers. I end by, once again, thanking the Government for the order and looking forward to walking on the first of the new paths and the access land that is opened up.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000067"></a>I shall pick up on one or two important points raised by my noble friend Lord Taylor, as well as one raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, who asked how big an object would have to be before the route  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC160"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>went around it. What about any listed buildings,  which might be much smaller? Pure size may not be the answer.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000068"></a>I declare an interest as a member of the NFU and the CLA, which is perhaps more relevant to discussions on access.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000069"></a>My noble friend mentioned golf courses, many of which I suspect will be privately owned. I have the joy of playing on a small, nine-hole course at Southwold. That is a public course and members of the public who go over it know that they are likely to get hit by balls if they do not look where they are going. My noble friend's point, however, is important if accidents occur. Would the individual be liable, or would it be the club? There are two different ways of looking at the same question.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000070"></a>I am sorry to return to the question of dogs, because we spent an awful lot of time on it when discussing the CROW Act. I am glad that dogs will be required to be on leads at a particular time, but I am still concerned about the phrasing of the definition of "control"; that is, the owner is,</p>
<ul><a name="100209101000257"></a>"confident that the dog will return".</ul>
<p><a name="100209101000252"></a>We happen to have a really super Labrador who is gun-trained and was trialled. He is not just a normal shooting dog; he has done trials as well. I could not be 100 per cent certain that, if something occurred, he might not take a liking to it and perhaps go and have a look for himself, while ignoring me-he does not normally ignore me, because that is the way he was trained before we had him. How confident is the Minister about that provision? What happens if the dog in question is out of control and somebody comes across it? When we discussed the matter previously, colleagues from Wales mentioned going through the Brecon Beacons, where sheep graze as well. They said that when dogs got out of control, the farmer invariably received a mouthful of abuse. Where do the respective parties stand in the law? The provision is idealistic-and I believe in an ideal world-but it is still not quite as it might be.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000071"></a>That brings me back to the whole question of this not having been dealt with in detail in the Act, because, as we know, we can talk about these things today but there is no way in which we can alter them. I do not want more legislation to be brought in-for goodness' sake, we have enough-but will any guidance be given? Is this the final document? What are the public told about access? Will there be guides or encouragement? What is written down?</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC161"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>six thrown-away cans of beer. A walker need only be walking without shoes to get their foot cut, as might a dog. What is stated about the whole question of livestock, or even someone's dog, getting injured by litter left by someone else? That sounds trivial-I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will tell me that I am worrying unnecessarily-but in this litigious age the honest truth is that an increasing amount of litter is left by people in lovely countryside. I would very much like to have that clarified.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000074"></a>Another point that my noble friend did not raise is where access will allow walkers to walk through areas such as a holiday camp, which may have its chalets further up but coastal access goes through the site. All the people working there will have had clearance from the Home Office to work with children, for example. If it is opened up to general access, which we all believe in, what is to stop people who might take a different view of their walk in the countryside? Has the Minister given that any thought? It could be a problem, although I hope very much that it is not.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000075"></a>I turn to nature reserves and breeding seasons. Just up the road from where we stay is lovely Minsmere, which has free access and seems to work extremely well, but it is organised. The areas that I am more interested in are natural breeding areas that are  not organised or supervised. Again, I seek clarification on that.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000076"></a>On the whole, apart from registering my disappointment that we were unable to deal with the specifics of coastal access when we took the Bill through, I welcome the order, but we need to be sure that it will work. In fairness, I mean that not just from the point of view of the farming community but for those who are going to walk and enjoy the countryside. We do not want bad experiences.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000077"></a>Lastly, in Committee on the Bill, I asked: if someone has an accident on the cliff or on the foreshore, whose responsibility is it? Is it that of the lifeboats or of the local authority? Where does the responsibility start and finish? I am still not quite clear about that. With those few words, I thank the Minister for introducing the order.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000079"></a>I have declared my interest as a farmer and as the manager of a golf course. In responding to my concerns when we discussed this issue in Committee on the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, the Minister's words, as <I>Hansard</I> recorded them, were:</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000080"></a>It is interesting to look at what the consultation has amounted to. Prior to our consideration of the Bill, there was consultation by Natural England in a February  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC162"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>2007 paper. At Annexe 2, it says that the availability of continuous access was considered. The problems with various developments were highlighted, such as the ones that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, was worried about, including caravan sites and golf courses. The paper ended by saying that providing suitable diversions or ways through could make a real difference to the continuity of access.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000081"></a>I have recently been in touch with the English Golf Union, which was included in this consultation and was required to undertake studies in four areas-Suffolk, Devon North, Durham and Cumbria-where it identified 18 golf courses that would be affected. It presented its findings to the coastal lands advisory group. Last year, presumably as part of the 8 September consultation that the Minister has referred to, the EGU received a pro forma, which had to be completed by 1 December, that asked, at question 19: "Do you agree that where there is no suitable route for the seaward side of a golf course, the route should pass through the golf course?". The answer that the EGU gave to this highly conditional question was yes, provided that the route could be planned in consultation with the golf club managers. It was left with the impression, though, that this legislation would not greatly affect golf courses. There are 147 golf courses that abut coastal areas within their bounds, so there is a considerable involvement of businesses. The EGU, like others, received notice of this current measure on 20 January, yet here we are on 8 February actually considering the matter. I am not yet sure whether the consultation that was put out and ended in December contained the text of the measure that we are looking at today.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000082"></a>My noble friend Lord Taylor raised quite a few questions about the margins of golf courses once the route is established. One of my worries is that in the terms of the Act, as far as I understand it, all the land to the landward side of the route is included as access land up to the first definable boundary. That is liable to become access land--that is, available for the activities that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, described. The question is whether the first definable boundary is likely to be a wall, a fence or something like that-this is where the question arises of the whole course being included-or does the Minister think that the edge of a fairway would be a definable boundary?</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000083"></a>Another approach that might have offered a solution appears to have been removed under the measure that we are considering today. Under the CROW Act, landowners had the power to request the closure of access for periods of up to 28 days as long as an alternative was provided. Presumably, that could have provided the protection that golf club competition days might have needed, particularly with regard to the issue of danger to the public. Tempers get quite hot on golf club competition days and heaven knows how much care some golfers might be inclined to take. Why was that not considered in this difficult area?</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000084"></a>I understand that there is a proposal that on campsites access will be restricted to the route itself and that further access land surrounding the route will not be created. Will this be the approach that is taken in respect of golf courses?</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000086"></a>While I am on my feet, I entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, about the points that she made about litter. The amount of litter that people spread everywhere nowadays is appalling. The amount of litter on mountains is appalling, as is the amount of litter even on crags, which must in many cases come from climbers. That is why from time to time the BMC organises teams of volunteers to do crag clean-ups. It is a curse of this age, with which we all ought to be completely obsessed until we stamp it out.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000087"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="100209101000296"></a>The Duke of Montrose:</b> Perhaps I may respond to one point with something of an anecdotal nature. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, does not necessarily have to blame climbers, because when I was once sitting on the top of Ben Lomond a piece of rubbish blew past me. I sat there for another 10 minutes and it blew  past me again. It was going round and round.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000088"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="100209101000297"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken and for the volley of questions to which I am meant to produce a response-presumably before 7 pm, as the Committee will not continue for much longer than that. I am not entirely surprised, as we will all recall our extensive discussions on these important issues regarding the coastal path during the passage of the Bill. I am keen to commend the order but I also wish to provide reassurance on the points that have been raised about the consultation that will take place and the decisions that will need to be taken before the construction of the coastal path is achieved in any significant dimension. I emphasise that the creation of the path will involve a process of consultation and, therefore, judgment will be exercised by Natural England, taking into account all those factors that have caused anxiety.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000089"></a>I take first the most obvious point. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked what will happen when the coastal path goes through ploughed land. We would not expect the extensive provision and width that will apply to aspects of the path when it causes no inconvenience to anyone and does not adversely affect farmland. The narrowest definition of the path would obtain in the circumstances that the noble Lord mentions. We have indicated that greater breadth might occur elsewhere, where local interests are readily reconciled to that extra dimension. It is clear that, in order to realise the concept of the coastal path, Natural England will seek to pursue a path as close as possible to the coast, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, emphasised. However, we all recognise the number of issues that manifestly need to be taken into account. Much of today's discussion can be summed up against the background that, before decisions are arrived at, full consultation will have taken place and Natural England will have regard to such factors. That will be the situation with regard to ploughed land.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000090"></a>The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, spoke with great authority about golf courses, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, and the noble Lord, Lord  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC164"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Taylor. I have some experience of golf courses and seaside courses in particular. I know that the issues raised by noble Lords are interesting and significant, but many golf courses already tackle such issues with the minimum amount of difficulty. A large number of golf courses include private rights of way. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is absolutely right to say that nothing at all in this order, or the Act from which it derives, in any way subverts, destroys or ends the rights that already obtain through historical factors and the exigencies of existing provision.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000091"></a>Those who play on golf courses often have to cope with such a situation and they do so with a degree of consideration. Also, the normal law of negligence will apply in these circumstances, although it will depend on the facts of the case as to whether a court decides that the golfer owed a duty of care to the walker and whether the danger was foreseeable. Most golfers are all too well aware of the dangers and many of them take out their own insurance. Most golf clubs whose courses have rights of access for the public insure all their members against any potential danger. In fact, they do so even when there are no rights of access. If a road adjoined a course, a stray golf ball could cause an accident and I assure noble Lords that a club would be singularly ill advised if it did not have insurance in those circumstances.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000092"></a>I do not think that the coastal path creates anything new. It may affect new areas but, following the concept of how golfers live with members of the public who have a right of way, there is nothing novel in this situation. The normal law of the land applies and people have to act with consideration where propelling a golf ball at considerable speed creates risks for those who are within range. Those are the inevitable facts of that pursuit, to which some of us are drawn for reasons that we would not dare to go into in rational company. I give way to the noble Baroness. She is concerned about the land.</p>

The natural law of care and concern and the absence of negligence must obtain. A golfer must have some regard to those who are on the path and, by the same token, people on the path are not meant to put themselves into absurd jeopardy with regard to the golfers.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000095"></a>The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, said, I think, that 137 golf courses have a coastal element to them. I do not know how many golf courses have rights of way but very many do. I could not possibly give the number but I can say that accidents are few and far between. Under the law of the land, proper conduct is necessary so that people are not put at risk. I am simply saying that golf courses cope with rights  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC165"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of way now and I cannot think of any reason why they should fail to cope with regard to the coastal path. Golf courses are different-of course I understand that-but the same features obtain.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000096"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="100209101000300"></a>Baroness Byford:</b> I am sorry to come back on this and I trust that I am not nit-picking. I was simply asking the noble Lord to confirm that, where areas are already agreed, the situation will not change. I was not arguing about insurance and so on but asking about the situation where the public already have access. Is the new coastal access path likely to change the arrangements that already exist on the golf courses concerned?</p>

<p><a name="100209101000097"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="100209101000301"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> It depends where the path goes in relation to the golf course. I freely admit that the coastal path will affect some golf courses that are currently by the sea and have no public rights of way across them; that is bound to be the case. Natural England will consult the golf course owners about this and there will be discussions about it. Just as in the assurance that I gave to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, with regard to ploughed land, on land where the public may face some kind of danger because of a legitimate pursuit on land alongside it, the path will be at its narrowest definition. The golf course will have to adjust to the fact that the path goes across its land, as all golf courses that have public rights of way adjust and provide the necessary arrangements at present. The practice is carried out with accidents being few and far between. We have to rely on good sense prevailing in those circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000098"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0003.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="100209101000302"></a>The Duke of Montrose:</b> I am reassured to hear the Minister say that he considers that on golf courses the path will have its narrowest definition. Under the Bill at the moment, even with existing rights of way, the whole golf course might be added to the existing right of way as a form of access land. The question is what will be allowed as a definable boundary. Would it have to be something physical and impenetrable or just something visible?</p>

<p><a name="100209101000099"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="100209101000303"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> Even on the most extensive golf course by the sea, even if it is linear, there could be only two or three holes that would be affected by a narrow path-the narrow definition of the right of way-proceeding along the coastline and along the course. Those circumstances have nothing to do with the other holes, but I recognise that the path being there, affecting those two or three holes, creates an issue. However, that already obtains with so many courses that I do not think that the coastal path raises anything different in law, in terms of anxiety and public concern, from what obtains at present.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000100"></a>The other significant area that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, raised-he was ably supported in this by others who contributed to the debate-was the issue of dogs. I emphasise that it will be important that we have an effective communications strategy for dog owners so that they are aware of their rights and responsibilities. There is no doubt that in certain circumstances, as we all know, dogs can have a serious effect in the countryside; that is why we have a clear  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC166"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>definition of the law about where farm animals graze. We accept that there should be a general restriction requiring the keeper of a dog to keep the dog under effective control.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000101"></a>We set out in the order the sort of actions required of any person in effective control of a dog and exercising the right of access to coastal land. The requirements where a person may be considered to be keeping a dog under effective control are that the keeper of a dog keeps the dog on the relevant access land-after all, it is only that land that is available to the owner and therefore to the dog-and keeps the dog on a lead or keeps it in sight, remains aware of its actions and is reasonably confident that the dog will return reliably and promptly on command. In other words, the dog owner is responsible for the dog. In fact, we expect within that framework that people will act responsibly and will know, whenever they are going along the coastal path, that it will be necessary for dogs to be under control.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000102"></a>Natural England will be able to restrict dogs to leads or exclude dogs for land management or nature conservation reasons on coastal land. It may be, after all, that a dog would be a severe disturbance in a nature conservation area, so Natural England may say that in such an area it is not prepared to allow dogs on the coastal path. This is all part of the necessary consultation. Natural England is guided by the major priority of creating a coastal path that goes around England. By the same token, it has to take into account a range of other interests. If it is dealing with an area of the environment where a dog would be a severe disturbance to wildlife or would give rise to any other aspects of disturbance that an animal might create, it will be up to it to impose a prohibition if necessary.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000103"></a>A number of other issues were raised. On the question of dunes, to which the noble Lord referred, and other areas where it might be possible to walk but which will have to be looked at with care because of the topography, again I make the obvious point that Natural England will have regard to that topography. If the path can be established in a permanent form that does no damage to an area and its features, that will be done. If, as the noble Lord seemed to suggest, this was not possible on a long-run perspective or even a perspective over several years-for instance, if the coastal path was defined on somewhat shifting sands and changing topography-we would expect Natural England, for obvious reasons, to take account of that fact and for the path not to pursue that course.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000104"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, asked whether the path would be at the bottom or the top of a cliff. It is not going to be on the top of a cliff that is subject to erosion such that within a matter of a year or two of being defined it becomes inherently dangerous. There are some parts of East Anglia where the erosion is  so rapid that the most considerable care would have  to be taken.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000105"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="100209101000304"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I wish to make it clear that, when  I was talking about the top or the bottom of a cliff, I was referring to the landward boundary of the coastal margin and not about the line of the path.</p>

After all, he expressed the view that, on the whole, that is the preferable location for the coastal path. All sensible people in certain parts of the country will agree with him because it is from the cliff top that views over the sea and inland can be experienced. We can all call to mind areas where that may not be possible or safe and where the path should be at the bottom. That is unlikely in areas of erosion because the waterside is unlikely to be much safer than the top of the cliff.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000107"></a>We are asking a body with a real sense of responsibility to create this path, to consult local interests and to take into account the factors articulated in the passage of the Bill on which assurances were given. I hope that the Committee will accept that that is how we expect Natural England to respond.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000108"></a>We do not regard the issue of privacy in this legislation in quite the same way as we regarded it with CROW. In that Act, we were concerned with a great many inland areas where it was anticipated that one could state right of access to the land without necessarily going too close to a dwelling, so privacy could easily be protected. It is more difficult with a coastal path, because dwellings are likely to be closer to where the path is obliged to go along the edge of the land. Natural England will seek to avoid locating the route where there could be an adverse impact on property.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000109"></a>In the same way, where the route might be quite wide when it approaches a campsite or, in particular, a caravan site that has some permanence to it-I know some campsites have permanence but noble Lords have raised the issue of caravan sites-if the path does not circumnavigate the caravan site and it is only practicable for it to go through the site, the path will be narrowly defined. The noble Baroness talked about access, but the coastal path does not create a fresh problem of access to a caravan site or campsite. After all, by definition, these areas are not bounded or encased in huge steel fences and owners and proprietors therefore take responsibility for access. However, if the path goes through a caravan site, it will be at its narrowest definition at that point. By the same token, assurance will be expected to be given that dogs are kept on leads, as well as all the other factors that ensure that walkers meet their obligations.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000110"></a>I am sure that I have not been able to respond in full to a number of other issues, but this has been a fairly long debate. It has not been as long as the debates that we had on the Bill, but it has been pretty extensive. I hope that noble Lords will accept that the order gives effect to an Act that commanded widespread support throughout the House. We all expressed the extent to which we could see benefit arising from the coastal path. It is quite clear that the obligations on Natural England are substantial. It concluded its consultation on the draft scheme last week. It is now looking at all the responses and we expect the final scheme to be submitted to the Secretary of State as soon as its analysis is complete. We will then know the terms under which Natural England envisages giving effect to the proposals.</p>

The noble Lord has given me the chance to note that I did not say anything about litter, an issue that the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, raised. I make the obvious point that litter, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said, is a curse of our contemporary society. We all know the terrible damage that it does to areas of scenic beauty. We are bound to anticipate that, on a coastal path of several hundreds of miles, litter problems will occur from time and time and in certain places. The only two solutions to the problem of litter are, first, that those responsible for clearing it up take their duties seriously-but we all know how difficult that is in remote areas such as the coastal path-and, secondly and most crucially, that the public are educated to the obvious fact that they should not destroy the very beauty that they have come to appreciate by being on the coastal path in the first place.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000115"></a>The regulations meet a government commitment, given during debates on the Animal Welfare Bill, to introduce welfare regulations for racing greyhounds. They will create minimum welfare standards for all greyhound tracks in England, without imposing disproportionate burdens on an industry that is already subject to the high standards required by the Animal Welfare Act. We know that welfare groups would prefer regulations that cover many more aspects of the sport. We have listened to those concerns but are confident that the regulations, combined with the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act, will provide significant protection for racing greyhounds. The regulations require all English tracks to meet the same minimum welfare standards. The standards will be enforced either by the local authority, or by a body that has United Kingdom Accreditation Service accreditation as an enforcement body.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000116"></a>Our consistent advice to the self-regulated sector of the greyhound industry has been that, to remain self-regulated in the 21st century, it must have UKAS accreditation. We have been assured that the Greyhound Board of Great Britain is on schedule to secure accreditation, and that it will be in place by the end of March. That means that most tracks in England will not require a local authority licence, as their membership of the GBGB and its UKAS accreditation, will ensure that those welfare standards are being enforced. The remaining six or so independent tracks will be required to be licensed by their local authority to the same standards.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000117"></a>All tracks will need to have a veterinarian present for all race meetings, trials and sale trials. The veterinarian must inspect every greyhound before it runs and will administer treatment to any greyhound that is injured while running. The vet will also be required to make a record, to be kept by the track, of any greyhound that is injured during a race or trial. These records can be used by the track and the track vet, over the long term, to judge whether there are any improvements that track managers could make to reduce the number of injuries. The regulations will also require that the veterinarians be provided with appropriate facilities to carry out their work.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000118"></a>All greyhounds that race and trial at tracks in England will be required to be permanently identified by both earmark and microchip, with the details placed on one of a number of databases that are available to hold such records. The criteria for suitable databases are set out in Part 2 of the schedule to the regulations. The Great Britain Greyhound Board has its own database, with standards that meet the requirements in the schedule, so most dogs will be on one central database. The remaining small minority of greyhounds that race only on independent tracks also need to be chipped and tattooed, but their details will only need to be recorded on a suitable database.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000119"></a>Tracks will be required to keep records of all greyhounds that race or trial at the track, and owners and trainers will need to produce ID the first time that the greyhound runs at the track under their ownership. Tracks will also be required to keep kennels for at least 20 per cent of dogs that attend a meeting. The GBGB requires kennels for all greyhounds that race. However,  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC170"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this is aimed at maintaining integrity. We do not believe that we can justify, for welfare purposes, requiring all greyhounds to be kennelled. However, we accept that some kennelling must be available where trainers bring multiple greyhounds to a meeting. It may take independent tracks some time to install such kennels and we have therefore provided a lead-in time for this important requirement.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000120"></a>These regulations are a proportionate and targeted response to the welfare problems within the industry. For the first time, a set of standards will apply to all tracks in England. The regulations will ensure greater welfare at tracks where injuries are most likely to occur and will improve the traceability of greyhounds both during and after their racing lives. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000121"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0003.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="100209101000310"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, we welcome the introduction of these regulations. There has been considerable concern about the welfare of greyhounds and with one substantial exception these regulations appear to address that concern. The key issue relates, as the Minister pointed out, to the fact that the 27 tracks covered by the Greyhound Board of Great Britain will not be regulated under these regulations. Those tracks will not need the licences introduced by the regulations, provided that they obtain UKAS accreditation. That is a very good device and we are confident that they will do so.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000122"></a>I have a note regarding seven independent tracks which will require local authority licences. I have a number of notes on the whole issue of those licences, but, given that we do not wish consideration of other matters to be put under pressure, I shall skip to my principal concern: there is no specific cover for the welfare of dogs off the track. To this extent, there is a risk that the Government will create the illusion of tackling the greyhound scandal, as reported in the media, but fail to get to grips with its essential elements.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000123"></a>There is nothing about breeding, which is a hot topic in the dog world. Above all, there is nothing about euthanasia. Are the Government content to rely on the general provisions of animal welfare to deal with this? I should indicate my interest as I occasionally attend the meetings of the Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare, which is meeting at this present time. It estimates that 4,728 retired dogs were not accounted for in the period under review. Even simple sums show that the annual cohort of racing dogs is around 7,000 out of 14,000 dogs racing at any one time-dogs have a two-year active life in the racing world. It would appear that 4,500 are rehoused. Everyone knows where a proportion of those dogs have gone, but there is a black hole in relation to the remainder. It is particularly disappointing that while the Government have conducted a consultation on this process, they did not consider that issue.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000124"></a>The outcry about the number greyhounds killed at the end of their racing career was well publicised in the <I>Sunday Times</I>. At the time, one could have been forgiven for concluding that concern about premature death and the means by which it was achieved by far outweighed concern about conditions on racetracks. The Government claim on page 3 of the Explanatory  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC171"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Memorandum that there was insufficient evidence to support the introduction of regulations concerning retired greyhounds. As page 9 of the memorandum points out at paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4, the number of dogs not recorded as rehomed is several thousand. There is certainly no reason to disbelieve the figures for deaths quoted in the paper and on the radio during the passage of the Animal Welfare Act. To that extent, the regulations ignore this and they represent unfinished business.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000125"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100209101000311"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> My Lords, we on these Benches also broadly support the order. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, declared that he was an irregular attender at the All-Party Parliamentary Greyhound Group. I am afraid that I need to declare an interest as an all-too-regular attender at Oxford, Swindon, Reading, White City, Wimbledon, Haringey, Wembley, Birmingham Hall Green, Brighton and Catford in my misspent youth. I stopped going to the dogs about a quarter of a century ago, but I should declare that I was responsible for leading the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, astray when we were both special advisers; I introduced him to dog racing at Wimbledon. I believe-the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, will tell me if I am wrong-that to this day he and the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, have a share in a slow dog running there. Like probably too many noble Lords I speak from intimate knowledge of this matter, but from a long time ago.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000126"></a>These regulations apply to only a few remaining flapper tracks, as dog-fanciers call them in this country-that is, independent tracks-and I would appreciate if we could know how many there are left; whether it is six or seven, I am amazed by how few there are. Perhaps the Minister could write to us and let us know. These tracks are the remnants of a long tradition of working men, often retired miners, enjoying this sport, particularly in the north of the country.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000127"></a>We share some of the same concerns about whether the regulations go far enough and whether the welfare of dogs is properly covered. Given how far the sport has now declined, though, one has to accept that the capacity of those tracks to spend a lot more is very limited. I am sure that the Government are right to say that to go further would be disproportionate because there would then be a danger that these tracks would close.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000128"></a>I want to ask particularly about the questions raised by the League Against Cruel Sports and the RSPCA as to whether there should be more access to statutory information so that they can protect injured greyhounds or greyhounds that may well be coming to them after they have left the sport. Have the Government considered that?</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000129"></a>In general, though, we would appreciate knowing how many independent tracks there are left. We broadly support the order.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, referred to his past involvement with greyhound racing and I have been involved with it for about 50 years. Consequently, I think I know something about greyhounds and the greyhound industry.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000131"></a>I speak on behalf of the parliamentary group in commending this regulation. We do so because we believe that we have made extensive progress over the past few years in the welfare of greyhounds. I concede to the criticism that may be made of greyhounds' welfare that, years ago, that was not always the case. However, our group has spent considerable time in the past four or five years concentrating on the important issue of greyhound welfare in conjunction with Defra and Ministers, who have come continuously to our group meetings in order us to discuss how we can progress this important issue.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000132"></a>I believe we are making good progress. This is a very important regulation, particularly, as the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said, for the independent tracks-the old flapper tracks-which until recently were not under any control at all. It ought to be recognised that our own parliamentary group and the GBGB, the organisation for greyhounds, have taken a great deal of the initiative to bring about the present situation. When we talk about the independent tracks in this legislation, it is they that we feel ought to have the benefit of the oversight of local authorities.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000133"></a>It is fair to say that, under the accreditation system that applies to registered tracks, we already have the high regulations that are included in these regulations. All I urge on noble Lords today is that this is a very important milestone but it is not the end. We have continually to be vigilant about greyhound welfare. We must concentrate, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said, on rehoming, which is very important. A few years ago probably only 25 per cent of greyhounds were being rehomed; I think the figure is now around 80 per cent. But that is still not good enough; we  still need to make further progress-and we will  do so if we have noble Lords' support for these regulations today.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000134"></a>Incidentally, as we know, the regulations went through the House of Commons this morning, where honourable Members approved them. I hope that both Houses of Parliament give their blessing to these regulations. We shall continue, as an all-party parliamentary group, to represent all our interests, the interests of greyhounds and the interests of those who, as the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said, enjoy the pleasure of greyhound racing. It is a great sport and many thousands of people enjoy it, but it can only succeed and be a good and happy sport that is pleasurable for people if we know that, at the end of the greyhounds' racing days, they will have a happy and contented life. We all want to see that. That is why we work in harmony, in B-flat, with the animal welfare organisations to achieve it.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000135"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="100209101000313"></a>Lord James of Blackheath:</b> I am never quite certain when it is appropriate to speak in these Committees so if I am out of order tell me now. I speak as an owner of greyhounds, past and present, and I have two concerns to raise today. The first has to do with the greyhound orphanages, which are wonderful creations but very  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC173"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>expensive to put your dogs into. It costs roughly £5.50 a day to lodge them there; it can take up to 200 days or more to find them a home; and you can face a bill for £1,000 for a dog that has retired. How much better it would be if a subsidy could come into those orphanages from the racetracks themselves in some form of earlier levy that would make it a better incentive for the owners to contribute their dogs to the orphanages. They are beautifully run and very successful, but they take time.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000136"></a>I come to my second and far greater concern. I currently have two dogs that raced for me and are now retired. Both are subject to one thing that is quite appalling: they have been tattooed in each ear. As a result, they have a lifelong aversion to anybody touching their ears, to the point where they scream. It was done very painfully and it is not a nice process. The Irish are particularly brutal on it because they use a longer number. Furthermore, the dogs that come from Ireland-this is deplorable-are all terrified of their ears being touched because they are dragged around by plastic pincers in the yards there. We ought to make some sort of law against those dogs being imported to this country as a disincentive to the Irish to do that. We should have some far stricter control on this deplorable treatment of these lovely animals.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000137"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="100209101000314"></a>Lord Hoyle:</b> I was a member of the animal welfare group that looked into this matter. While the noble Lord, Lord Bilston, has had greyhounds that run, whenever I go to a track, unfortunately for me, I never win at all. So whatever I say in relation to that does  not apply.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000138"></a>I am pleased that we are going as far as we are, but I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that we should go much further. We should be looking at what happens with the breeders, the kennels and the rest. I am concerned about the fact that there are still greyhounds-we estimated 4,700 in the report-that are unaccounted for.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000139"></a>This is a start. I was pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Bilston, say that it was not the end; that we have to go much further. We have to see what happens to the dogs. I agree with what was said about Irish dogs, which account for a large percentage of our greyhounds. In many cases they do not enjoy even the minimum welfare standards that we have here and that needs to be looked at. Something needs to be done about them because greyhound racing is very dependent on dogs coming in from Ireland.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000140"></a>I shall not prolong the debate because many of the things I wanted to say have been said. We ought to be able to account for a greyhound from its birth, through its short racing life and through to what happens to it when it has finished racing. I look forward to these regulations being only the start. We should extend them to breeders and trainers and ensure that good welfare standards also apply when greyhounds have finished racing.</p>

I should add that although she is among my many loss-making investments, she is the most beautiful and much preferable to any of the others.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000142"></a>I chaired the recent committee of inquiry into the sport whose report put dog welfare at the centre. I should declare that, when a young teenager, I was an assistant to the bookmaker at the old Earls Barton track, certainly a flapper by any standards. I have never forgotten the occasion when he was driving home and he pulled a revolver from his pocket, showed it to me while driving and simply said, "You get some dodgy people at the greyhounds". You get some nice ones too, though.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000143"></a>I support these regulations. I know that for some dog welfare people they do not go far enough, but that is always the case. I spoke to a leading executive from the Dogs Trust this week and she said that they were not quite enough, but they were pretty good. We can be pleased with that.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000144"></a>The independent tracks are the main welfare issue. We suggested the regulations, and they are the most practical way to approach the issue. On a visit to a flapping track in Lancashire, near Bolton, I had the most pleasurable greyhound evening of my life, so the objective should not be, as some people suggested to my committee, to eliminate these independent tracks; rather, we should help them and encourage them in stages-they cannot do it immediately-to become UKAS-accredited and part of the mainstream. We should not claim to be against them.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000145"></a>The noble Lord referred to the "greyhound scandal". That is an unfortunate and excessive phrase to use about the sport. Frankly, that is typical of media trash. When I was on the committee, I deliberately asked that journalist to come to give evidence so that we could question him. Not to my surprise, having worked on the same newspaper myself, he was too busy to come to be grilled. Do not talk about the greyhound scandal, especially because of the enormous improvement that has taken place and is continuing.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000146"></a>The issue of retired greyhounds is a major factor, but the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, when he was chairman, did an enormous amount to advance that. The provisions for retired greyhounds are now excellent and are wholly to the credit of the committee. I thank the Government. I have a question regarding paragraph (6)(2) in Part 1 of the schedule, on greyhound injuries. It rightly relates to licensed tracks keeping, through the vet, records of injuries. I am unclear as to whether tracks are encouraged or required to publish those records. My impression was that different tracks, because they have different configurations and surfaces, keep different records. It would be helpful if the sport was aware that some tracks were more injury-prone than others. Perhaps they could be encouraged to alter and improve the surfaces.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000147"></a>Apart from those points, I congratulate the Government and the department on the progress that they have made. I hope that noble Lords will wholly approve of what is before them.</p>

I am grateful for the recognition that the regulations take the welfare of greyhounds forward substantially, and for the endorsement of noble Lords who have worked with the all-party group and in other quarters to produce the benefits which the regulations will bring.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000149"></a>I noted a number of points of criticism. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, in his opening remarks, somewhat echoed by noble Lords on the Committee, said that the regulations could go further. The Government think that the Animal Welfare Act gives considerable protection to greyhounds. The additional factors that are part of the regulations take matters a good deal further. The basic provisions of the Act are nevertheless an important and substantial basis for the care of greyhounds. The debate highlighted that the position of racing may be well covered and safeguarded.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000150"></a>I apologise that I said there were six independent tracks, but I was corrected. The figure is certainly seven and I do not know why on earth I dared to strain such august company with an incorrect number. Why do we not get figures from those seven tracks about safety? There is the obvious anxiety that they might not record injuries effectively if they thought that fingers would be pointed directly at them regarding their record compared to other tracks. We are interested in the overall welfare of greyhounds.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000151"></a>We persist in our stance that it is better that the Greyhound Board of Great Britain produces overall statistics in which we can measure either the improvement or, heaven forbid, a deterioration in greyhound welfare, whereas identifying individual tracks might be a counterproductive measure-not least because I have again noted that noble Lords have suggested that someone can pay up for additional welfare. This is not an industry that is enormously replete with funds, and where the funds are, it is often difficult to prise them away for the benefit of the greyhounds themselves.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000152"></a>There is no question of a compulsory levy. The industry would not stand for that in the consultation. I am, however, happy to report, although they have scarcely been mentioned in this debate, that an interest group related to greyhound racing is bookmakers, who are contributing towards a levy for welfare, and that gives extra resources. We can build upon what we have here.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000153"></a>We are, of course, concerned about the aspect that concerned all noble Lords in this debate: the welfare of greyhounds after they finish racing. The noble Lord, Lord James, was entirely in order in making his contribution, and a very constructive contribution it was. One part that was very constructive, although I cannot follow him in his construction, is his point that if dogs are treated cruelly and painfully then, as intelligent animals, they sustain the mark of that cruelty. With regard to aggressive tattooing of the ears, though, we are not able to restrict greyhounds from the Republic of Ireland. We are part of the European Community,

The noble Lord knows that; he is not one who advocates great distraints upon trade, and he will recognise that we would get into trouble if we introduced the dimension of putting a distraint on the importation of greyhounds from the Republic. We must expect, though, that when we set standards for our tracks and the care of our animals, in due course those standards will be reflected in other dogs that arrive here. The Irish practice that the noble Lord has referred to as being unacceptable will gradually not be perpetrated there as they follow the patterns that we use for identification here.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000160"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="100209101000323"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government &amp; Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My Lords, before I explain these orders, noble Lords may find it helpful if I say a little about the work of the PPF in the year since we last debated these orders.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000161"></a>As noble Lords are aware, the Pension Protection Fund protects members of defined-benefit occupational pension schemes and members of defined-benefit parts of hybrid defined-benefit and defined-contribution schemes. It pays a statutory level of compensation if the sponsoring employer of the scheme experiences what is called a qualifying insolvency event-for example, where a company enters administration, where there is no possibility of a scheme rescue or where there are insufficient assets in the scheme to pay benefits at PPF compensation levels-that is, 90 per cent for deferred and active members and 100 per cent for people over normal pension age. The fund is administered by the board of the Pension Protection Fund, which is a public corporation.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000162"></a>The Pension Protection Fund is funded from three sources: the assets of pension schemes that transfer to it, including any recoveries from former employers; a levy charged on the schemes that are protected by it; and investment returns on those assets. The fund ensures that members of eligible defined-benefit schemes still receive a meaningful income in place of the pension they had worked for and would have received, had their employer not experienced a qualifying insolvency event and the fund of which they were a member not been unable to pay benefits at Pension Protection Fund levels.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000163"></a>Since 2005, 181 schemes have been assessed by the Pension Protection Fund following an employer insolvency event. At present 363 schemes, with around 203,000 members, are currently being assessed. As at the end of December 2009, 109 schemes had transferred into the PPF and over 32,800 people were either receiving PPF compensation or due to receive it in the future. The average yearly payment per person is around £4,000.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000164"></a>When the 2009 versions of these instruments were debated around this time last year, 74 schemes, with around 20,000 members, had transferred into the PPF, and 295 schemes, with around 134,000 members, were in assessment. This increase in numbers over the previous year shows the challenges that the PPF has had to face and the results of its efforts over the past year. The PPF's contribution is welcomed, I am sure, by noble Lords. At these difficult times, I am sure that the  12 million people protected by the PPF will be particularly glad to know of its protection.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000165"></a>However, I know that noble Lords will also be keen to understand that the PPF is fulfilling its statutory purpose and that it will continue to be able to pay compensation going forward. Let me be clear on this: with around £3.7 billion under management, and a levy intended to raise £720 million in 2010-11, there is no doubt that the PPF has the liquidity to pay a monthly compensation bill of around £6.5 million.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000166"></a>Importantly, under even the most taxing economic scenarios that we have tested, the PPF could continue  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC178"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to pay compensation for at least 20 years into the future. However, it is right that we should be vigilant, and we and the PPF continue to monitor its position.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000167"></a>Despite the welcome news that the recovery has begun and that the UK is no longer in recession, we know that employers sponsoring defined-benefit pension schemes will continue to experience insolvency events, and the PPF will continue to play a vital role in supporting pensioners in retirement.</p>
<h5><a name="100209101000272"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="100209-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000168"></a>I turn to the first instrument for debate, the draft Pension Protection Fund (Pension Compensation Cap) Order 2010. A cap on the level of Pension Protection Fund compensation is applied to those scheme members who are below their scheme's normal pension age at the point immediately before the employer's insolvency event. These members are entitled to the 90 per cent level of compensation when they retire.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100209-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000169"></a>Under the Pensions Act 2004, increases to the compensation cap are linked to increases in the general level of earnings. To increase the compensation cap for 2010-11 we must consider average earnings in Great Britain, as measured by the average earnings index and published by the Office for National Statistics for the 2008-09 tax year. That shows an increase of 3.5 per cent. An increase of 3.5 per cent gives a new cap of £33,054.09 for the 2010-11 tax year. This means that the total value of compensation payments for members below normal pension age shall not exceed £29,748.68 for the new tax year.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000170"></a>The new cap will apply to members who first become entitled to compensation at the 90 per cent level on or after 1 April 2010. The pension compensation cap order ensures that the level of the compensation cap is maintained in line with the increase in earnings, as required under the Pensions Act 2004.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000171"></a>I turn to the draft Occupational Pension Schemes (Levy Ceiling) Order 2010. The pension protection levy is the responsibility of the board of the Pension Protection Fund. The levy ceiling is one of the statutory controls on the pension protection levy. Rather than set the rate of the levy, it restricts the amount that the board can raise in any one year.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000172"></a>The levy ceiling for 2009-10 was set at £863 million. Under the Pensions Act 2004, the levy ceiling is increased annually in line with increases in the general level of earnings in Great Britain, using the rate for the 12-month period to 31 July in the previous financial year. The order before the Grand Committee uprates the levy ceiling by 0.9 per cent, bringing it to £871,183,684.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000173"></a>That does not mean that the pension protection levy will increase to the ceiling. The board of the Pension Protection Fund is responsible for setting the actual levy for any year, but must not set one that is above the levy ceiling. The board understands the pressures that businesses are under in the current economic climate. In August 2007 the board made a commitment to set a levy estimate of £675 million for the following three years, indexed to earnings, subject to there being no change in long-term risk. The PPF has kept that commitment and announced that it will  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC179"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>increase this year's levy estimate only by earnings, which means that for 2010-11 the levy estimate will be £720 million.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000174"></a>However, the annual increases in the ceiling ensure that after 2010-11 the board of the PPF could in future increase the levy up to the levy ceiling if it considered it appropriate, subject to a statutory 25 per cent limit on the year-on-year increase.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000175"></a>I can confirm that I am satisfied that the statutory instruments before us are compatible with the rights in the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000176"></a>The two statutory instruments before us provide that the Pension Protection Fund compensation cap and levy ceiling are uprated in line with increases in average earnings. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000177"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100209101000324"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, these are pretty standard uprating orders but they give us an opportunity to discuss a consequence of Labour's great recession that is often overlooked. When a company goes into insolvency, an employee does not just lose his job and his salary; he is also in danger of losing his pension entitlement. A record number of companies went into insolvency during the recession that we have just barely come out of-over 3,000 more than went bust in the previous recession in the 1990s. It is no surprise that the Pension Protection Fund website shows a record number  of pension schemes seeking compensation. The list of transferred schemes is pretty bad, with a rise from  12 schemes in 2007 to 53 in 2008 and 41 in 2009, and, as the Minister informed us, the number of schemes still in the assessment period is much higher.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000178"></a>Ensuring that the Pension Protection Fund stays sufficiently funded to meet its commitments to these schemes is critical. I hope that the short-term cash flow problems that the recession caused are now over. However, the board of the fund has decided to amend its insolvency probabilities in order to take into account the effect of the economic climate on companies. The board notes that even companies regarded as low-risk have seen increased levels of failure, and previously healthy companies that survived the recession will now face the greatest increase in levies. These changes will not be implemented until the financial year 2011-12. Therefore, it is clear that the effect of Labour's mismanagement of the economy will continue to be felt throughout the UK for many years to come.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000179"></a>However, the biggest elephant in the room whenever the health of the Pension Protection Fund is discussed continues to be the Royal Mail pension fund. We are fast approaching the date by which the revaluation of the scheme will have to be announced. Since the Prime Minister bottled the Postal Services Bill, postal workers across the country have been left in limbo, knowing that their scheme is running an unsustainable deficit that the Pension Protection Fund cannot possibly afford to compensate. The current problems that the PPF is facing as a consequence of the recession will  be as nothing compared with the demands that will be placed on it if that scheme is forced into insolvency.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000180"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us that his department has not just brushed that problem under the carpet until the election. Remaining in

Are discussions with the Royal Mail pension plan ongoing, and are the Government still committed to implementing the Hooper review, with its plan for saving the pension fund, in full?</p>

<p><a name="100209101000181"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="100209101000325"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> My Lords, this is an annual event. I think that that we last discussed these orders about 10 and a half months ago. I am not going to make a party-political broadcast but, as the noble Lord, Lord Freud, said, this is an appropriate opportunity to ask one or two questions about the state of pension funds generally and about the PPF in particular.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000182"></a>I am sure that, as an accountant, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, will be able to help me. I am only an economist and statistician and I am afraid that, despite his kind letter and explanation, I am still struggling to understand exactly why one figure has gone up by  3.5 per cent while the other has gone up by 0.9 per cent. I understand that the 3.5 per cent is the increase in average earnings between March or April 2008-I am not sure which month was used-and March or April 2009. That is clear enough, but can the Minister tell me exactly what figure is being used for the 0.9 per cent? It relates to 31 July, but which year? I am still in the dark, so can he tell me which figure I should look up in the Labour statistics for that?</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000183"></a>Last year, the noble Lord pointed out that the PPF was paying out £3.7 million a month in compensation. Today, he tells us that that figure has jumped to  £6.5 million, so one sees how the pressures are building. He also said last year that, on the basis of the analysis that had been undertaken, the PPF had enough cash to continue to pay benefits for at least 25 years. However, this year he tells us that the calculation is now 20 years. Perhaps he can confirm that.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000184"></a>There is a more general point. We are talking here about very long-term liabilities and a long-term pension fund. It is the same sort of defence that one hears from the Government when one tries to raise serious questions about the long-term viability of public sector pension schemes. It is not a question of running out of cash in the short term but a question of these liabilities being properly provided for.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000185"></a>I have one or two more detailed questions on the PPF and the figures that have come from its very useful publication, the <I>Purple Book</I>. One should pay tribute to the PPF for the way that it reports properly and has built up in the <I>Purple Book</I> a good picture of pension funds in this country. Frankly, it was a scandal that this was never available before. The PPF is talking here about its sample of around 7,300 schemes. I am surprised that it says that open schemes still constitute 27 per cent of schemes. Could the noble Lord comment on this? For any of these questions, if he does not have the full answer, could he look into it and write to me? Admittedly, that figure is down from 31 per cent in 2008 and 36 per cent in 2007. It is not entirely clear from the way it is written whether that 27 per cent refers to schemes that are open to both new membership and new accrual. Could the Minister clarify that?</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC181"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000186"></a>We also see that there has been a catastrophic decline in the funding position of the schemes that the PPF <I>Purple Book</I> refers to. Again, could the Minister confirm that? Aggregate funding on a Section 179 basis has gone down from a £12.3 billion surplus in March 2008 to a deficit of £200.6 billion in 2009. That is down from an even bigger surplus of £87.4 billion in March 2007. The full buy-out funding level is even worse, falling from 62.9 per cent in March 2008 to only 57.7 per cent in 2009. On the technical provisions basis, we are talking about a deficit that has gone up from £98 billion a year ago to £329 billion this year. For all that one fully accepts that there is no danger of the PPF running out of money in the short term, there is a good deal of evidence that the pressures are building. We will also come to the growing insolvency figures. When a company fails and the pension fund lands on the PPF, the size of the black hole in each case is likely to be much more.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000187"></a>There were over 50 per cent more liquidations in the third quarter of 2009 than at the low point in 2007. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Freud, that I am glad he is so sure that the recession has ended. We have had one-quarter of barely perceptible economic growth, which is well within the margin of error. I would not be at all sure that the recession has ended. It certainly has not ended as far as many of these hard-pressed manufacturing companies are concerned. This tends still to be the area where the big defined benefit schemes and liabilities are.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000188"></a>Those are my main questions. I will also ask about something I raised last year but is still a serious problem. As well as liquidations, what is the effect of the continuing tide of pre-pack administrations, by which companies get rid of the pension fund and some of their debts and start again, particularly in phoenix administrations? Are there figures from the last year for how many pension funds of companies in that category have been dumped on the PPF?</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000189"></a>Finally, on risk reduction, we are told on page 20 of the Red Book that the total number of contingent assets-which are pledged by the company to help support the pension scheme; it is a perfectly sensible way of doing things-has risen by 30 per cent from 452 for the previous levy year to 587 for this year. What is the total value of those assets in each year?</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC182"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which have taken us through the consequences of what has been a worldwide recession, were opposed by his party. If we had not taken the steps that we did to stabilise the banking system and put in the fiscal stimulus, matters would have been a great deal worse. Therefore, I do not accept the noble Lord's proposition to start with.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000194"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="100209101000329"></a>Lord Freud:</b> I cannot let that pass. The mismanagement encompasses the whole period, not just the period of rescue. Running an economy at a level of gearing in both the private and the banking sector, which is what has happened, has left us in a much worse position than that of the bulk of European countries. That is a level of financial mismanagement which even the Minister, with his considerable expertise, would find it hard to argue his way out of.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000195"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="100209101000330"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I remind the noble Lord that we are straying somewhat from the orders. Pretty much every time that we have talked about regulation and its scope, his party has argued for less onerous regulation across the banking system and across a whole range of other areas.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000196"></a>The noble Lord talked about people losing their jobs and being in danger of losing their pensions. In previous recessions, that is what happened. We now have the Pension Protection Fund; it did not exist before, and we had the interim arrangements around the FAS. The Pension Protection Fund means that if a person's employer becomes insolvent and their scheme is underfunded, they can rely on a stream of income in retirement. That simply did not exist before.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000197"></a>The noble Lord talked about insolvency probabilities. This issue is still out for consultation. It is important that the PPF considers how best to assess this risk, but, at the end of the day, it is a matter for the PPF.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000198"></a>The noble Lord strayed rather ingeniously to get on to the future of Royal Mail under this order. That is obviously a matter for BIS, and the Pensions Regulator is responsible for regulating scheme funding. Royal Mail will submit valuation and recovery plans in the normal way, like every other pension scheme. Issues around the future of Royal Mail and the Hooper plan are not matters for our deliberations today.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000199"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, wanted clarification on the percentages and on where they were derived from. The 0.9 per cent relates to the 12 months ending July 2009; 3.5 per cent is the earnings factor for the 12 months ending April 2009. In fact, it may be 2008 rather than 2009, because the earnings factor is related to the year preceding the year with which we are dealing.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000200"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="100209101000331"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> It is possibly still not crystal-clear to the Minister. Is it the whole year compared with the previous year, as opposed to a month? The percentage cannot have moved from 3.5 to 0.9 over those three months. Something is still not quite clear, I think.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000201"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="100209101000332"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I am sorry; it is for a whole year period. I will write to the noble Lord specifically to confirm that, but that is why.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000202"></a>The noble Lord asked about the PPF's assessment, which was over 25 years but is now to be over 20 years. To be clear, the modelling still indicates a period over 25 years. I think that I said it would be at least 20-I was being conservative, with a small "c", as ever on this. The modelling has now been reviewed by the National Audit Office in its positive report published last Friday.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000203"></a>The noble Lord referred to the PPF's 7,800 series of reports. An updated report is issued today. I do not know whether he has seen it; it may be helpful if I update him on that. The aggregate funding position of the almost 7,400 schemes protected by the PPF is estimated to have worsened slightly over the month to a deficit of £51.9 billion at the end of January 2010-compared with a deficit of £32.6 billion at the end of November 2009-but the scheme funding is better than it was a year previously, when there was a deficit of £183.6 billion. I know that the noble Lord understands full well that those figures refer to a net of aggregates that swing around increases in asset values and changes in gilt yields and what they mean for liabilities.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000204"></a>The noble Lord asked about the 27 per cent of the sample that constitute open schemes and he wanted clarification on whether that meant open both to new members and to new accrual. I look for support from the back of the Room, but I am not getting it, so I shall have to write to the noble Lord.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000205"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="100209101000333"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> On several of those points, I should be quite happy to have a written answer, if that suits the Minister.</p>

Around the whole issue of buyouts, buy-ins and the raft of arrangements that may be in place, the market has generally cooled during the past year-perhaps not surprisingly. Subject to those detailed points, on which I owe the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, an answer, which I shall share with the noble Lord, Lord Freud, I commend the orders.</p>

<ul><a name="100209101000283"></a>
<p>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Rail Vehicle Accessibility (London Underground Metropolitan Line S8 Vehicles) Exemption Order 2010.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="100209101000207"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0005.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="100209101000337"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> My Lords, this House has always demonstrated a keen interest in the accessibility of rail vehicles, and that is why we are here today. We know that, without public transport that they can use, disabled people are limited in their ability to get to work, visit friends and family, participate in leisure activities or access healthcare and education facilities. The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998-or RVAR-are just one example of the action we have taken to ensure that public transport services are increasingly available to the estimated 11 million disabled people in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000208"></a>More than a third of the national rail fleet, more than 5,600 vehicles, is already compliant with RVAR, and almost all older rail vehicles have been made more accessible during refurbishment. We have also set an end date of 1 January 2020, by which time all rail vehicles must be accessible.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000209"></a>However, it is sometimes not possible for new trains to meet the requirements of RVAR in full and the Rail Vehicle Accessibility (London Underground Metropolitan Line S8 Vehicles) Exemption Order 2010 will allow London Underground to introduce new trains on the Metropolitan line which are fully compliant with RVAR in all but five respects. These can be directly traced to the significant operational and infrastructure challenges that London Underground faces and are similar to those granted by Parliament for London Underground's new Victoria line trains in 2008. These were the first London Underground trains to be built to modern accessibility standards and we learned a number of lessons during that process which have been applied here to the new Metropolitan line stock to minimise a number of exemptions which are necessary.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000210"></a>The first and second exemptions requested relate to audible and visual warnings of door closure. They will allow LU to use an audible and visual door-closure warning which is shorter than that required by RVAR-1.75 seconds as opposed to three seconds. Until all the new trains are delivered, they must run alongside existing vehicles which were designed in the 1960s and consequently fail to meet many aspects of modern accessibility standards. I should share with the Committee the information that I grew up in Metroland and travelled daily to school on those A-stock trains from the first day of their introduction over 50 years ago.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000211"></a>As there will be a mixture of new and old vehicles on the Metropolitan line until 2013 and on the other sub-surface lines until May 2015, it would be  confusing and potentially hazardous to have two  different durations of door-closure warnings on the  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC185"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>same route. As it would be difficult and wasteful to change the warnings on existing trains for the one or two years that they remain in service, allowing London Underground to continue with its current warning periods will provide consistency and allow disabled people to be confident about what the warning actually means.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000212"></a>London Underground is already committed, as part of the terms of its similar Victoria line exemption, to undertake a trial to establish whether a compliant warning is appropriate for its operations without impacting on the safety of all passengers once all its new trains are introduced in 2013. The results will inform the position on the Metropolitan line and future policy in this area.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000213"></a>The third exemption relates to the announcements made on board the train at each station. RVAR requires both the next stop and terminating station to be announced while the train is stationary at a station. This requirement was originally included to enable passengers to distinguish between fast and stopping services. For key sections of the Metropolitan line, where there are branch lines and junctions or where there is a choice between fast and stopping services, we have insisted that compliant announcements be made. However, at certain non-key sections-by that I mean, predominantly, the stretch between Aldgate and Baker Street, where there are no branches or junctions and all trains stop at all stations-the exemption will allow some, but not all, of the mandated information to be given during transit between some stations instead.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000214"></a>To insist on the provision of all the mandated information at these stations would greatly limit the amount of other information that can be given to passengers at that time, such as connections to other routes and services. Additionally, some platforms on the line will be shorter than the trains arriving there, and London Underground wishes to use the passenger information system to ensure that customers move towards an opening door in time for them to alight should they wish to. Again, similar exemptions were granted for London Underground's new Victoria line fleet and it is undertaking a trial to determine what announcements passengers find most useful. These results will inform future policy.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000215"></a>The fourth exemption will allow the placement of a horizontal handrail in the designated wheelchair spaces on each train. This recognises the level of crowding which passengers on Metropolitan line services can experience at peak times and addresses concerns about standing customers falling against or on to wheelchair users due to the lack of an appropriate handrail or other support in this area. This is an issue that we have sought to address in revised RVAR regulations, which we expect to introduce later this year. Consultation on a draft of those regulations, completed in 2009, indicates unanimous stakeholder support for this amendment and will render similar exemptions unnecessary in future.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000216"></a>The final exemption concerns wheelchair users' access from the platform to the train. We share London Underground's view that it is impractical to use manually-   


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC186"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deployed boarding ramps on a frequent metro service because of restricted space on platforms, the limited amount of time that each train waits-at peak times, there will be 32 trains an hour at Kings Cross or one less than every two minutes-and the 3.4 million people that the system handles every day. Instead, LU will provide "platform humps"-raised areas on the platform which are positioned to allow level access to those carriages which have wheelchair spaces. These have already been successfully trialled on the Northern line, and wheelchair users prefer this solution since there is no need to involve staff and it allows independent travel.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000217"></a>These time-limited exemptions are linked to London Underground's step-free access programme which is providing a step-free route from the street to the platform. The order provides exemptions at each station which will expire on the dates given as each station becomes step-free. The number of exemptions will therefore progressively diminish until the work is completed in December 2013, and London Underground has already allocated £5.5 million to complete this work.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000218"></a>This is extremely encouraging but, while the new trains have lower floors than those they will replace, and stepping distances will reduce significantly as a result, some platforms will remain non-compliant. At nine stations, provision for step-free access has yet to be established, and the order therefore provides for the exemption to fall at such time as this is provided. For a further 12 stations, an exemption with no time limit has been sought, since the geometry of the platforms currently presents an insurmountable barrier to level access.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000219"></a>Perhaps I may explain. Some platforms on the Metropolitan line form the oldest stretch of underground line in the world, dating from the 1860s when attitudes towards customer accessibility were very different. Some platforms are severely curved or of compromised height where the line is shared with other London Underground or National Rail lines. In those circumstances, allowance must be made for the different height, size and shape of trains which use the same track and platforms. There is no known solution to these problems at present. Although London Underground is exploring possibilities, setting an expiry date for these exemptions would be entirely artificial. We and the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee believe that this is an appropriate response to the issue and will continue to monitor the situation closely. If a novel solution were developed, the exemptions could be revoked at any time.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000220"></a>In summary, we believe that the order represents a sensible approach to these issues. Similar exemptions were granted for similar reasons for the new Victoria line trains which are currently being introduced into service, and will allow London Underground to resolve some of the challenges which compliance with RVAR represents in the short term to a metro service with high frequencies, inaccessible stations and a mix of old and new vehicles. The order will enable London Underground to replace a fleet of vehicles first introduced in the 1960s with new trains that are significantly more

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000221"></a>The order's provisions are supported by the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, the Office of Rail Regulation and London TravelWatch, which is the official organisation representing the interests of transport users in London. I commend the order to the Committee look forward to hearing the views of noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000222"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100209101000338"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> My Lords, I start by thanking the Minister for his clear introduction of the order. I should say immediately that it is largely uncontentious, although it raises some issues about the amount of time that will elapse before Metropolitan line trains are fully compliant with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. We appreciate that the consultation has been undertaken on this and that broadly there seem to be few disagreements with the order.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000223"></a>We appreciate that the Metropolitan line is the oldest Tube line and therefore was not built to accommodate the standards that we now demand: that disabled people should be able to travel without hindrance, or with as little hindrance as possible, to enable them to live as full lives as possible. The uniformity of the timing of announcements across all the trains seems to make sense as it means that the wheelchair-bound, who need to know how long they have to exit or enter the train, can do so with confidence, and the timing announcements are of course invaluable to blind people, who rely on them to enable them to judge when they should, in particular, leave the train. We accept that the 1.75-second amendment to the order, to be held for the time being, is sensible across the piece. A change to three seconds would be of greater benefit, but we assume that that will come in due course if the timing of the trains can also be sorted out-that seems to be a problem as well.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000224"></a>The one major area of concern is, of course, step-free access. While I hear what the Minister says about the humps that will be used, which seem to be a perfectly useful and sensible measure, without step-free access the trains are unavailable to those in wheelchairs and, it has to be said, to mothers with buggies. I know we are talking here about disabled access but there are other people in the world who have moveable vehicles, and mothers with buggies are among them. As a result of this, they will continue to have to use other stations or make different journeys for a number of years to come.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000225"></a>Step-free access is also germane in the context of movement from the station entrance to the platforms. If there are no lifts or escalators then wheelchair users and mothers with buggies cannot get to the trains. I noticed that this matter is being looked at, and the salient remark was made that people should not be allowed to get out of trains on to a platform to which there is no step-free access, but this is a continuing problem. There are a number of stations in London, not only on the Metropolitan line, where it is just impossible for anyone who has any wheels at all to get themselves down to the Tube.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000226"></a>Will the Minister explain in more detail what plans are being made to provide step-free platform access and entrance-to-platform access, and who is responsible for the latter provision-the mayor or LUL? The Minister explained this quite clearly but it is important to establish it: is it correct that a significant number of stations will never be able to accept trains that are compliant because the platforms themselves cannot structurally be made to fit the trains or to be accessible to them? We ought to be clear that there will be, as I think the Minister said, nine platforms that will never be accessible for these trains.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000227"></a>With regard to the provision of accessible trains so that all the trains on this line will comply with the Disability Discrimination Act, 2020 has been cited as the date by which all trains will be compliant. I think 5,600 trains out of 26,000 have already been done, but what progress is being made to ensure that the target will be met, and are there any contractual disciplines to ensure that it is? With that, we are happy to accept these orders.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000228"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="100209101000339"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> We, too, support the order. In many respects the railway outside London is very old, as is much of its rolling stock, and the modifications necessary to meet these standards will be incredibly expensive. The noble Baroness touched on the subject of stations to which there will be no step-free access, and at many of these the cost of providing lifts will be very high. One of the problems in a democracy is deciding where limited money will be spent; in the end, we have to make judgments that some people may find unacceptable but which the majority may accept. The order is a good and clear agreement as to what can best be done.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000229"></a>As to the introduction of new rolling stock, both for London Underground and the big railway, there will be a lot of obstacles between now and the date that the new rolling stock will become available. The Government have still not published their rolling stock plan for the big railway and London Transport is in tremendous contractual trouble as a result of the PFI arrangements that the Government introduced and which were supported manifestly by the Prime Minister. It is difficult to see how the necessary rolling stock will be provided to meet the dates outlined.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000230"></a>I shall make one other point that is not strictly related to London Underground. Disability discrimination legislation applies equally, of course, to road transport, with which I am more familiar, and bus companies have invested hugely in buses that kneel and that have ramps, visible handrails, audible warnings, visual warnings and so on. However, the Government have manifestly failed to deal with the big objection that often these buses cannot berth alongside the kerb because of the flagrant breaches of parking restrictions that are allowed. On the railways we have the benefit that the train will pull up at the platform; unfortunately, bus passengers have no guarantee whatever that the bus will be able to get to the kerb.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>

<p><a name="100209101000232"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="100209101000340"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to both noble Lords for their contributions. We now have a happy tradition where the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and I debate these issues more or less on our own, quite often in this Room. We have done so again today. I thank them both most sincerely for the constructive and helpful speeches they have made. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, strayed a little wide of the order relating to the Metropolitan line, and I hope he will appreciate that I cannot comment on access to buses today. However, I am sure that he, with his usual ingenuity, will find an opportunity to return to that subject at some stage in the future</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000233"></a>I am able to answer the questions that the noble Baroness put to me. She rightly drew attention to the problems at stations where, at present, we have no solution, normally because the levels are wrong or because they are severely curved. As I said in my opening speech, the exemption does not have a time limit applied to it for the 12 stations for which it is sought. We accept that there are problems there. The mayor is responsible for allocating the budget for London Underground and how he allocates the budget in this area is a matter for him. Some of the work required would be very expensive and it is he who will have to decide what the correct priorities are.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000234"></a>However, the order ensures that the platforms listed in the schedule are made step-free by the exemption dates. As a consequence, the number of exemptions should fall as the works are completed. I am sure that London Underground will note very carefully what the noble Baroness said about mothers with buggies-or, indeed, dads with buggies. They, too, need to get on and off trains. She is right to draw attention to them.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000235"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about the progress being made to ensure that the 2020 RVAR target is being met and whether any contractual difficulties are being experienced. So far, as I said, 5,600 vehicles are already compliant out of a total fleet of about 16,000. The department is working closely with industry and with DPTAC to ensure that the end date is met. That has already included work to bring the older vehicles up to compliance in recent franchises-that is a condition of new franchises. At this stage, we do not expect contractual issues to get in the way of meeting the 2020 target.</p>

Presumably, conditions are attached to the contract or the delivery date not being met. There must be something that says that the contract must be delivered at a certain time and that, if it is not, what the penalties are.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000237"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="100209101000342"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> Yes, the penalties are in the legislation and the requirement to make vehicles compliant is part of the new franchises, so a train operator that failed to comply-as I said, we have no knowledge that there is likely to be any difficulty in this area-would be in breach of its franchise, with the implications of that for the continuation of the franchise.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000239"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="100209101000344"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> I think that the noble Baroness was referring to the compliance of the national railway.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000240"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="100209101000345"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> I was referring to the contract that must at the moment be in place for the new trains and for the improvements to be made to the old trains. I was asking: in that contract, what are the penalties if it is not met?</p>

<p><a name="100209101000241"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="100209101000346"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> I apologise to the noble Baroness for misunderstanding her. I thought that she was asking about the national picture. The position with the Metropolitan line is that all the new trains are capable of complying with the regulations now. With the order, we are effectively holding back the implementation of the RVAR regulations so that the new trains can run on the same track alongside the stock that I used to go to school on in 1960, the A-stock trains. Those trains are being progressively phased out. By 2015 the whole of the Metropolitan line will be served by the new trains, and they will all be fully compliant.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000242"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="100209101000347"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> Will the date be met? The tension I am trying to get at is that we have these exemptions coming in. As I understand it, the new trains are all due to be delivered by 2020. What are the penalties to the company if they are not? It is not the exemptions to the disability Act that I am worried about at the moment; it is what happens if the trains that we are exempting are not built and ready. What are the penalties to the company for that?</p>

<p><a name="100209101000243"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0006.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="100209101000348"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> I think that the noble Baroness may be misunderstanding one of the elements in the order. The order exempts the new trains temporarily so that they can run in an identical manner to the 50 year-old A stock. Those trains will be compliant when they are the only trains operating on the Metropolitan line. The other exemptions that we are discussing under the order are the exemptions that apply to things such as stations, which in the majority of cases can be met but, as I said earlier, there are 12 stations where we cannot put an end date on the exemption because the engineering work that would be required is too considerable. The trains on the Metropolitan line will all be compliant by 2015; what will not be compliant by 2015 are all the stations. There will still be stations that, because of their curves, will not be compliant.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000244"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, asked about the Government publishing their rolling stock plan. Again, that goes a little wide of the order, but I can tell him that the plan is still under development and we will be writing to the Committee with the details when the work is completed.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000245"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="100209101000349"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> My Lords, I should not like <I>Hansard</I> to indicate that I had not understood what the order was about. I think I have probably indicated that I did understand it, but I was widening the issue  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC191"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column GC191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>slightly to say that these trains are due to be provided by 2020. There must be some contractual arrangement by which they are provided by 2020 fully compliant, and, if they are not, there must be some contractual penalties. I do not mind if the Minister does not have the answer, but that was my question. I agree that it went slightly wider than the order, but I want it to be understood that I understand what the order is about.</p>

<p><a name="100209101000246"></a><b><a name="100209-gc0006.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="100209101000350"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> The noble Baroness is right to press this matter. From my understanding, there is no contractual obligation because the company responsible, Metronet, has gone into liquidation. Does LUL simply pick up what the bankrupt company has left and does it have to adopt all the contractual obligations? It seems a very strange way for a company in liquidation to perform.</p>

<a name="100209-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100209101000248"></a>The position is that the Secretary of State is required to ensure that all rail vehicles are compliant by 2020, except the heritage vehicles, which we debated some while ago and which are exempted indefinitely for reasons that we agreed at that time. New trains have to be compliant from the moment they come in. Therefore, all the new trains that come in on London Underground will be compliant unless an exemption is sought for operational reasons. In the case of Metropolitan line trains, the operational reason is the fact that the new trains are running on the same track and offering exactly the same service to customers as the 1960 A-stock vehicles. When the A-stock vehicles are withdrawn, the new trains will become entirely compliant and the exemptions will no longer need to apply. The contractual obligation is indeed on the Government and on Transport for London because that is what the law says: it is what happens with new rolling stock coming in after the passage of the legislation. I hope that, with those answers, I have satisfied the Committee.</p>

<a name="10020988000003"></a><b><a name="100209-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="10020988000090"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Davies of Oldham):</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Rural Affairs and Environment (Dan Norris) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="10020988000004"></a>I should like to announce the publication today of a public consultation on the implementation of two key pieces of European pesticides legislation.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="10020988000005"></a>In September 2009, the European Council of Ministers agreed two new pieces of legislation-the Plant Protection Products Regulation<sup>1</sup> (the regulation) and the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides<sup>2</sup> (the directive). These are part of the EU's thematic strategy on pesticides which aims to minimise the risks to health and the environment from the use of pesticides.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="10020988000006"></a>This consultation is the first of a two-stage consultation process; its purpose is to seek views on the transposition of the directive and two measures relating to the provision of public information on pesticides under the regulation. We are also seeking views on how the UK should use charging arrangements provided by this legislation and another regulation on maximum residue levels of pesticides in food and feed. The second stage will be to consult on the draft legislation transposing the directive.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="10020988000007"></a><I>Sustainable Use Directive 2009/128/EC</I></p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="10020988000008"></a>This directive will need to be transposed and implemented by member states by November 2011. Its overall objective is to establish "... a framework to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides by reducing the risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment and promoting the use of integrated pest management and of alternative approaches or techniques such as non-chemical alternatives to pesticides".</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="10020988000009"></a>Key features of the directive include: the establishment of national action plans; compulsory testing of application equipment, certification of operators and distributors, and access to certification for advisors; a ban (subject to derogations) on aerial spraying; special measures to protect the aquatic environment, public spaces and conservation areas; minimising the risks to human health and the environment through handling, storage and disposal; and the promotion of low input regimes (including integrated pest management (IPM)).</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="10020988000010"></a><I>Plant Protection Products Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009</I></p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="10020988000011"></a>The regulation is essentially a revision of Directive 91/414/EEC that currently governs the approvals regime for plant protection products, but with some new elements. The regulation's overall objective is to "... lay down rules for the authorisation of plant protection products in commercial form and for their placing on the market, use and control within the Community [and] ... ensure a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment and to improve the functioning of the internal market through  


<notus-date day="9" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS40"></a><b>9 Feb 2010 : Column WS40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the harmonisation of the rules on the placing on the market of plant protection products including active substances, while improving agricultural production".</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="10020988000012"></a>The regulation updates the existing regime and aims to increase the level of protection for people and the environment as well as speeding up decision-making and providing clearer rules. The majority of the regulation is directly binding and is not therefore included in this consultation. There are, however, two discretionary provisions in the regulation where we have undertaken to consult.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="10020988000013"></a>The two provisions are:</p>
Article 31: Authorisations-Notification of Neighbours; andArticle 67: Recording and Disclosing Information on pesticides.
<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="10020988000014"></a>They concern the provision of information in two main categories: advance notification to neighbours who could be exposed to crop spraying activity; and making available records of plant protection products used, on request by the competent authority.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="10020988000015"></a>I believe that there should be a high level of transparency and public access to information about the approval system. The regulation provides an opportunity to consider the introduction of measures that would provide greater transparency of pesticides use post-approval. Despite the precautionary nature of the approval system and the high level of protection that it affords people, animals and the environment, people may wish to know about pesticides that they see being used. This section of the consultation explores the costs and benefits of options for providing access to this information.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="10020988000016"></a><I>Charging arrangements</I></p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="10020988000017"></a>The regulation, the directive and Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on maximum residue levels (the MRLs regulation) all provide for member states to recover the costs of work carried out under that legislation. The regulation introduces new requirements to the regulatory regime that will be charged to pesticide authorisation holders. All three pieces of legislation provide for member states to recover certain costs that are not currently recoverable.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="10020988000018"></a>The consultation invites views on how charging arrangements in the UK should operate in future, and our top priority will continue to be the protection of human health and the environment.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="10020988000019"></a>The Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD) of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is the delivery body for Defra's responsibilities for pesticides and is undertaking this consultation on behalf of Defra. The consultation covers England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each administration will consider its own approach to the outcome of the consultation.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="10020988000020"></a>I will be holding meetings with key stakeholder groups during the consultation period to listen to their views. A copy of the consultation has been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses and is available on Defra's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/pesticides/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/pesticides/index.htm</a>.</p>

<a name="10020988000021"></a><b><a name="100209-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="10020988000091"></a>The Minister for International Defence and Security (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Quentin Davies) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="10020988000022"></a>I announce changes to the internal arrangements for formulating and delivering Science and Technology (S&amp;T) to the UK Armed Forces. From 1 April 2010, the Science Innovation and Technology (SIT) Top Level Budget (TLB) within the Ministry of Defence (MoD) will stand down. The task of setting MoD's S&amp;T policy and strategy will move to the Centre TLB under the direct control of the MoD chief scientific adviser. This will ensure that this key aspect of defence is at the heart of future policy and decision making.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="10020988000023"></a>The MoD will continue to look to the broadest possible supplier base for the delivery of the majority of its S&amp;T requirements. Delivery will be supported by an enhanced defence science technology laboratory (Dstl) which will continue to be the MoD's in-house focus for S&amp;T knowledge, skills and advice. Under the new structure, Dstl will also be responsible for the planning and delivery of the defence research programme. However, Dstl, as now, will only undertake research activity which by its sensitive, operationally critical or international nature, should only be performed in Government.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="10020988000024"></a>These changes will enable a clearer organisational structure for Defence S&amp;T and will reduce overheads within Defence S&amp;T management, to reinvest in research. As a consequence of these changes, around 100 posts will be removed from the current S&amp;T organisational structure.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="10020988000025"></a>Implementation of these changes will be undertaken by a project team, reporting to the chief scientific adviser, which will work with the MoD trade unions to ensure delivery of defence S&amp;T, particularly for operations, is unaffected.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="10020988000032"></a>It has become the more important to make this move now that every other EU member state, with the sole current exception of Denmark, has either allowed television product placement already or has expressed a firm intention to do so. Not to do so would jeopardise the competitiveness of UK programme makers as against the rest of the EU, and this is something which we cannot afford to do.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="10020988000033"></a>UK audiences have been used to product placement in films and, subject to them not being unduly prominent, imported television programmes, especially from the United States, for many years. However, allowing television product placement in domestic UK programming will be an important departure. It is right for us to proceed with caution and in particular to be very careful about the types of product for which it is permitted.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="10020988000034"></a>Our legislation will therefore specify some important exceptions, in particular the prohibition of the placement of alcohol and foods and drinks high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS foods). The Government also fully share the concerns that have been expressed about the potential impact of product placement on the editorial independence of broadcasters and viewers' trust in what they see on television. We believe that our proposals will safeguard these.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="10020988000036"></a>The Government will lay regulations under Section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972, giving legal effect to the requirements of the EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive on TV product placement. However, TV product placement will not become permissible immediately the regulations come into effect.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="10020988000037"></a>Their effect will be to allow Ofcom to permit product placement under its code regulating the content of TV programmes, and Ofcom will need to run a public consultation on the detailed changes to this code before these can come into effect.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="10020988000038"></a>Only after that has happened, and Ofcom has amended its code, will it be possible for TV companies to show programmes which they have made or commissioned and which include product placement. We envisage that this stage would be reached later this year.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="10020988000039"></a>The EU directive requires that member states prohibit product placement but permits them to derogate from that in the four separate genres of "cinematographic works, films and series made for television or on-demand services, sports programmes, and light entertainment programmes". Our legislation would therefore follow this pattern of imposing an overall ban on product placement except in these four genres.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="10020988000040"></a>The legislation will not provide more precise definitions of these terms. Instead, it will allow Ofcom to intervene in the event that broadcasters unacceptably stretch the envelope and include product placement in programming which cannot properly be seen as falling into any of these permitted categories. The existing powers, including the code-making powers, which Ofcom has allow it to do that in an appropriate and effective way.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="10020988000041"></a>The responses to our consultation have confirmed that there is concern about the possibility of product placement in current affairs, consumer and religious programming. The Government share these concerns, since some programmes in these categories could be seen as falling into the "series" genre specified by the directive, and we have concluded that it is important that our legislation ensures that product placement is not allowed in them. It will therefore contain specific prohibitions to that effect.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="10020988000042"></a>News programmes and bulletins are not covered by the four genres of programme which the EU directive permits to contain product placement. Our legislation will therefore have the effect of preventing product placement in any TV news programming, as the directive requires.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="10020988000043"></a>Our legislation will not permit product placement in the BBC's licence-fee funded services. This will continue to be prevented by the BBC's charter and its agreement with the Government.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="10020988000045"></a>The directive prohibits the placement of two specific types of product, that is tobacco products (as well as any other placement by or on behalf of a company whose principal activity is the manufacture or sale of tobacco products) and prescription medicines. The Government have decided to move significantly beyond this. Our legislation will specifically prohibit the placement of products and services in the following categories</p>
 alcoholic drinks;foods and drinks high in fat, salt or sugar;gambling;smoking accessories;over-the-counter medicines; andinfant formula and follow-on formula.
<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="10020988000046"></a>In reaching this decision the Government have had the issue of potential effects on health and welfare, and especially children's health and welfare, particularly in mind. The directive contains a ban on product placement in children's programmes, and our legislation will enact that. However, children's viewing is not confined to children's programmes.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="10020988000047"></a>An alternative to a ban on placement of HFSS foods and alcohol might have been restrictions of some kind on their placement in shows which have a large child audience, or which are shown before the watershed. But this would be complex to administer and would not provide the certainty which the Government seek.</p>

<a name="100209-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="10020988000048"></a>In the circumstances we intend to legislate for a complete bar on placing these products. This as an important aspect of the cautious approach that we need to take.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="10020988000050"></a>Our legislation will also, as required by the directive, specify that product placement should not affect editorial independence, be unduly prominent, or directly encourage purchase.

The directive requires that audiences are alerted to the presence of product placement in a programme by signalling at the beginning and end and after advertising breaks. The legislation will contain this requirement and it will be for Ofcom to determine, after its own consultation, how it is met.</p>

We made sure that women's voices were heard at the conference. Foreign and Commonwealth Office Ministers attended a civil society event on 26 January 2010 which offered human rights activists an important opportunity to make statements, ask questions and lobby. Five Afghan women also attended the Prince of Wales' reception on 27 January 2010, where they used the opportunity to lobby President Karzai, Angela Merkel, Hillary Clinton, Richard Holbrooke as well as the Foreign Ministers of India, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, Norway, Afghanistan, Belgium, France, UK Ministers, and senior North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials. These events were followed by the presentation of a statement by Afghan women to the London conference itself, delivered by Arzo Qanih, one of the civil society representatives and spokesperson for the Afghan Women's Network. A written statement on behalf of Afghan women was also circulated to all conference participants.</p>

Indeed the text on page 130 of the ring-bound version in box 5.3 stated the correct figure: "Nordhaus (2006) shows that just a small increase in hurricane intensity (5-10 per cent), which several models predict will occur 2-3°C of warming globally, could alone double costs of storm damage to around 0.13 per cent GDP".</p>

We have not raised their cases specifically-among the many hundreds of political prisoners in Syria-but with the EU are focusing our lobbying on small number of high-profile individuals (such as the prominent human rights lawyer Haitham al Maleh).</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_154"></a><a name="10020993000209"></a>The criminal justice system in Syria is in need of reform and, where possible, we have sought to push this process forward. Unfortunately, it is common for detainees to be denied access to legal representation for some time while in custody. Of particular concern is the Supreme State Security Court, a special court that exists outside the ordinary criminal justice system to prosecute those perceived as challenging the Government. This court is exempt from the rules of criminal procedure that apply in Syria's criminal courts. Defence lawyers usually see their clients for the first time on the day of the trial and the court denies them the opportunity to engage in oral defence or call on witnesses. Most trials consist of four short sessions, often less than 30 minutes each. Defendants have no right to appeal their verdict to a higher tribunal.</p>

On 20 January 2010, my honourable friend Ivan Lewis raised the cases directly with the Iranian ambassador, expressing concern at reports that they faced imminent execution. Mr Lewis reiterated our long-held concerns about the trials not meeting international standards, and urged the Iranian Government to show clemency.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_156"></a><a name="10020993000212"></a>These executions undermine Iran's claimed commitment to justice, human rights, and democratic values. Our long-standing opposition to capital punishment under all circumstances is clear; we raise these concerns with the Iranian authorities bilaterally and through the EU at every appropriate opportunity. We did so on over 70 separate occasions last year, and will continue to do so.</p>

The first exempts an employee from tax and national insurance contributions (NICs) on the benefit of an employer-provided work bus service, subject to certain conditions. There is a second exemption from tax and NICs where an employee benefits from an employer giving a subsidy or other support to a bus service provider to introduce, continue or improve a local public bus route. This exemption is subject to certain other conditions and does not apply where a subsidy is provided for local bus services generally.</p>

However, an employer can provide an interest-free loan, or a loan with a rate of interest below normal commercial rates, to an employee. Subject to certain conditions about the amount of the loan, the interest foregone on the loan is not treated as a taxable benefit. This loan may used to assist the employee in the purchase of a season ticket for public transport by bus or rail but is not confined to this purpose.</p>
