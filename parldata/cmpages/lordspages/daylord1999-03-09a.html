<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Judd </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "90309-01_para0"></a>What will be their position at the April 1999 NATO summit in Washington towards United Nations Security Council authorisation for all future NATO operational missions other than territorial defence of the alliance itself.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="90309-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, all NATO operations must have a basis in international law. Each case needs to be looked at on its own merits. In many cases a United Nations Security Council resolution would be needed to authorise the use of force. But force may be used also to defend a non-NATO state at its invitation or, in exceptional circumstances, to avert an immediate and overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. Does she not agree that until recently it has been held that for any operation by NATO, save for an operation dealing with a need within, or a threat to, the member countries of NATO, it would be necessary to have the explicit authorisation of the Security Council? Can she comment on the evolving doctrine that the situation is now changing to one in which NATO feels entitled to take action on its own authority when it feels that to be necessary, seeking, if possible, the support of the United Nations? Does she not agree that when the United States has such unchallenged ascendency in the world it has an unrivalled opportunity to build up global security institutions in the interests not only of its own future but also that of the world as a whole.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, cases have arisen, for example, in northern Iraq in 1991, when, in the light of all the circumstances, a limited use of force has been justifiable as the only means to avert an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe in support of purposes laid down by the Security Council but without the Council's express authorisation. Such cases, by their very nature, must be exceptional and would depend on an objective assessment of the factual circumstances at the time and of the relevant decisions of the Security Council bearing on the situation. It is important to stress that all NATO decisions are taken by consensus. Not a single member of the alliance can force the other members to act if the allies are opposed. All our allies <P>


<a name="column_116"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 116</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would not agree a NATO operation, I believe, unless they considered it was in accordance with international law.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that we are in danger of becoming involved in spurious moral judgments which have no relation whatever to our national interests?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   No, my Lords, I do not agree with that. The globe is becoming a smaller place and what happens in other countries has a direct effect on the United Kingdom and on our immediate allies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister comment on the problem of China's attitude to Macedonia where a member of the Security Council has reason to try to interrupt what would otherwise be a peacekeeping operation for reasons that are entirely territorial? Is there any mileage in the possibility of working out a code whereby those taking part in a NATO operation would know that the operation fell within certain guidelines. Can she say whether that would mean acting in accordance with international law?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, a number of cases could probably be adduced where particular members of the Security Council have, for reasons of their own, sought to block what was believed to be a perfectly sensible Security Council resolution by other members of that body. For that reason it is important that we pursue some flexibility. I stress that that flexibility must be within the bounds of international law, which is understood not by a small group in NATO but by a full consensus. Currently, there are 16 members, and, as from Friday, there will be 19, who must believe that they are acting within international law. The Secretary General of NATO made that clear this morning when he addressed the NATO conference in London.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that central to the question of NATO's out-of-area activity is Europe's ability to act in crises which are on Europe's own doorstep? Does she therefore agree that it is extremely important that there should be a European chain of command within NATO to enable Europe to act, using NATO assets, where the situation demands?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, it is important that we recognise the vital element of a proper consensus within NATO. If the noble Lord is implying that somehow the European members of NATO could act without that consensus, we may have a difficulty. I have difficulty with his idea of a specific European chain of command that would be outside that consensus. However, we believe it right that Europe should have a unified and coherent voice in the world. As a leading European member of NATO, the EU and the WEU, the United Kingdom has a stake in improving <P>


<a name="column_117"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 117</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Europe's abilities to respond to crises. That is why my right honourable friend the Prime Minister raised certain ideas in St. Malo and why we are trying to develop those within NATO.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, will Her Majesty's Government bear in mind that Article 2, paragraph 7, of the United Nations Charter prevents the United Nations intervening in the domestic jurisdiction of states and that recent dangerous conflicts have been internal, within recognised individual states, so that the United Nations may not be able to act in such circumstances?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   Yes, my Lords, that is why I pointed out in my initial Answer that on occasions non-NATO members may invite NATO in. I assume that the noble Lord is thinking of cases involving a degree of internal conflict which, sadly, we have seen all too recently and where the result of not taking any action would be an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe. That is why it is so important that Her Majesty's Government and like-minded members continue to pursue the criterion of overwhelming humanitarian need.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that there is a difference between "authority to act" and "chain of command" and that whereas the authority to act must be reserved, in my view, to the United Nations, the chain of command can reasonably be devolved once the authority to act has been given?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, of course I agree that there is a difference. The authority to act must be taken by consensus. In case there is any misunderstanding between us, I was trying to point out to my noble friend Lord Ponsonby the importance of consensus in taking any decision to act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, in the light of her replies, particularly to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, does the Minister agree that Article 5 of the NATO Treaty has no validity at all for the defence of NATO countries, particularly if the aggressor is another NATO country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, operations under Article 5 of the NATO Treaty are in exercise of the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence, preserved under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Therefore, enforcement action by NATO under Article 53 of the UN Charter may require Security Council authorisation. I hope that I have been perfectly clear. I thought that the Question was about authorisation other than that relating to the territorial defence of the alliance and that the real question in my noble friend's mind related to out-of-area activity and to overwhelming humanitarian need, which your Lordships debated only last week. That was the point I was endeavouring to answer.

<A NAME="90309-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "90309-01_para1"></a>Whether they intend to expand or contract the network of quality controls on British institutions of higher education which they inherited from the previous government.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="90309-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment   (Baroness Blackstone): </B>  My Lords, the report by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and his colleagues in July 1997 proposed a range of new developments for quality assurance in higher education. We support the work of the Quality Assurance Agency in implementing the new arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, how much further does the Minister think that the new bureaucracy should go? The other week I saw a paper which proposed to apply to postgraduate education the same language of "key stages" and "levels of development" that was developed for the control of primary schools. That does not seem necessarily the best way to control or to examine PhDs. No doubt the Minister is fully familiar with all the jargon of QAA, QCA, TQAC, SACCA, SCQF, SCOTCAT, NICATS, InCCA and so on and so forth, which is rolling over us, but does she accept that the cost of imposing on universities all those new controls and procedures may become excessive?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, we need to strike a balance between ensuring value for the money spent on higher education--a great deal of public money is involved, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, well knows--and that the burden of scrutiny is as light as possible. It is also important that prospective students and employers have accurate information about the quality of the work carried out by universities with regard to both research and teaching. Perhaps I can reassure the noble Lord that the new arrangements that the QAA will be putting into place will allow universities and colleges of higher education to work jointly with the QAA to try to reduce that burden of scrutiny and to produce a programme which links in with an institution's internal scrutiny arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Beloff: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that one reason for the excessive bureaucracy to which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, refers is that the standards of a number of institutions are so low that it is necessary to control them in great detail, but that the price that we pay for that is that perfectly respectable universities which, for decades or centuries, have managed to look after their own standards are penalised by their staff being engaged in unnecessary form-filling when they should be either teaching or engaged in research?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I do not entirely agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, has just said. Indeed, I am sure that he will not be surprised to hear that. I am glad to say that the QAA has found that <P>


<a name="column_119"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the vast majority of universities, whether new ones or old-established ones, have very good quality teaching and are performing well in that respect. However, at the same time, I accept that there are differences in standard. We now have a much more diverse system of higher education, with nearly 35 per cent. of young people going to university at this time. This means that the intensity of scrutiny ought to vary according to the internal quality assessment procedures of universities, and any other evidence. So some universities will need only a very light touch in terms of such scrutiny, while others will need rather more careful attention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I am surprised at the answer of my noble friend the Minister. Certainly my experience has been that all that such scrutiny does is impose a burden on academics who are trying to get on with their job. I know that one should not dwell on the past, but one cannot help but reflect on the time when an academic really engaged in academic work. Does my noble friend have any evidence about the amount of time that academics are now required to spend on filling in such forms? I have seen no evidence to suggest that it achieves anything, but I do know that it occupies a great deal of people's time when they could at the very least be doing some teaching.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may point out to my noble friend that my experience is slightly different to his. I actually believe that this sort of external scrutiny can be most helpful to institutions and, indeed, to academics who are working in them. However, at the same time, it should not be so burdensome and so onerous that it prevents them getting on with their work. There is a sensible balance to be obtained. I repeat what I said earlier: universities are in receipt of a great deal of public money and, like everyone else who is in receipt of such moneys, they have obligations to ensure that what they are doing is of the highest possible standard. They should welcome those who come in to check on this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, in the hope that the weight of inspection can be varied with the quality of the work being inspected, can the Minister say whether she accepts that the whole edifice of our education system--including higher and further education--depends on the quality of teaching in primary and secondary schools? Therefore, can the noble Baroness say with what weight and care inspection of the teacher training institutions, which are responsible for the level that that teaching eventually achieves, will be carried out?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, what happens in primary and secondary education is vital. It is primary and secondary schools which will deliver good students to our universities and to our colleges of further education. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, is well aware, Ofsted is responsible for the inspection of the teacher training element of education courses. But the QAA--the Quality Assurance Agency--is responsible for other aspects of the work of education departments and their quality in terms of what they <P>


<a name="column_120"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 120</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provide as far as concerns teaching and the nature of the courses that they offer. That partnership is a good one; indeed, they need to work collaboratively together.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Glenamara: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend the Minister agree that the quality control in British universities now is tougher and more stringent than it has ever been? Indeed, if nothing else, this has placed the University of Northumbria well up in the top section of "Division One" of all British universities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I entirely accept what my noble friend said about the University of Northumbria. Indeed, I am delighted to say that there are many new universities, which were formed recently following legislation earlier this decade, that are similarly performing extremely well in terms of the quality of their teaching.

<P>

<A NAME = "90309-02_para0"></a>What progress has been made in the payment of compensation to former miners in Wales suffering from emphysema and other diseases.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="90309-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>   My Lords, to date the Government have made payments totalling &#163;25 million to former coal miners and their widows and &#163;6.5 million has gone to those living in Wales. We have tendered for a national spirometry testing programme, which will enable us to make further offers of interim payments and, in some cases, full and final settlements from April. We have also agreed with the plaintiffs solicitors the levels of compensation that will be payable and we are close to agreeing the medical assessment process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Islwyn: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister for that reply. I am glad to hear that some progress is being made. However, does he appreciate that over 30 Welsh miners who were seeking compensation have died in recent weeks? Therefore, does that not indicate that a speedy settlement is vital? Will the Government now concede the principle that those miners who have had medical examinations and been awarded industrial injuries benefit should be given compensation without a further medical examination?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, clearly we are acutely aware of some of the tragedies regarding those people who have died while this complicated process has been going on. However, as it is an area of considerable uncertainty to many people, I must make clear the exact situation. The court settlement was solely concerned with chronic bronchitis and emphysema; it did not cover pneumoconiosis, which is a separate disease. In the case of those people who are receiving benefits under the Industrial Injuries Disablement <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Benefit Act for chronic bronchitis and emphysema and where we do have records which show that they had been working underground for 20 years, payments have been made.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-02_para1"></a>However, for people who are receiving benefits under the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Act we are not able to make payments because we do not know the extent of the chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Moreover, we have no records stating how long the miners worked underground. That is why we brought forward the spirometry testing programme to provide us with more information. In those cases we can make settlements as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, may I take it from the reply of my noble friend the Minister, which I found most encouraging as far as concerns those cases which are being dealt with, that the Government are fully implementing the pledge given by me from that Dispatch Box on the issue--namely, that the Government would, under no circumstances, act as if they were a company of insurers taking advantage of every weakness in a claimant's claim?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I would certainly like to say that we are carrying out that pledge. Without wanting to cast any aspersions on insurance companies, our aim has always been to make payments as speedily as we can, subject to the need to do so fairly and in line with the very specific High Court settlement. Of course, we have to agree every step with the Plaintiffs' Solicitors Group. We are proceeding as fast as we can in this complicated case, though not as fast as we would like.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, having had to deal with the problems of pneumoconiosis during my time in the coal industry, and having witnessed now the problems associated with emphysema and related diseases, I believe that the Government have made good progress in dealing with a complicated situation. However, in view of the improvements made in mining technology, does the Minister think that such problems can be avoided in the future?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the Government are always considering ways to improve health protection. The evidence of the British Coal health surveillance, especially its programme of X-ray screening, showed that the introduction of the Coal Mines (Respirable Dust) Regulations 1975 have brought substantial improvements. However, we are concerned to ensure that the prevalence of this disease, which has reduced dramatically, continues to decline further in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, should not the House be appreciative of the compassionate and just arrangements that the Government have adopted in this matter? However, would it not be possible to extend such consideration by perhaps not separating emphysema and bronchitis victims from those suffering <P>


<a name="column_122"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from pneumoconiosis? Does my noble friend accept that there still is a residual despair which was generated in the last Parliament when enormous resources appeared to be devoted to delaying this matter as much as possible? Can my noble friend tell the House how much was spent on combating and delaying the just and deserving case which this Government have accepted?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, we have moved with all speed since the High Court judgment. We have, of course, had to make a clear distinction between the different groups of people involved as considerable differences apply to them. Since we have been in power every step has been taken to rectify a situation which had gone on for far too long without corrective action being taken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lofthouse of Pontefract: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate the present Government's efforts to assist in this problem. However, I cannot understand why the Government and Ministers cannot pay industrial injuries benefits to the men who have already been assessed. These men have undergone examinations and have been awarded industrial injuries benefits. For the life of me I cannot understand why the Government cannot accept that these men have no need to undergo further medical examinations with all the delays that that will cause. Also, some of them will die in the meantime. It seems to me that there is a simple way out; namely, to pay these men immediately. I cannot understand why the Government will not concede that request.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the Government would like nothing better than to make immediate payments to these people. However, one has to appreciate that the High Court settlement is specific as to the conditions that have to be fulfilled with regard to this matter. We can see no way to conduct this matter fairly and in line with the requirements of the High Court without a medical assessment process. Until that is done we cannot reach a settlement without it being subject to further legal action, which I do not think would be in anyone's interests.

He emphasised that after the best local government settlement for seven years, unjustified cuts to library services are not acceptable, and that he would <P>


<a name="column_123"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be taking immediate steps to investigate a number of authorities where significant cuts were being contemplated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bragg: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister for his reply. However, is he aware that for many people local libraries are not just a corner-shop university and not even just an educational source, but a vital asset inside a community? Is he aware that for many people they bind a community together--people from all generations and from all kinds of backgrounds? Is that taken sufficiently into consideration when the axe is swung--as it is being swung now--on so many local libraries? This is not just a matter of closing down local libraries but of helping to close down communities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is entirely right about the importance of libraries. The Government are seized of that fact. The local authority financial settlement will add &#163;2.6 billion to local authority finances in the forthcoming financial year. That is a 2.9 per cent. real increase. The real increase in the environmental protection and cultural services block which provides the funding for libraries is 3.8 per cent. Therefore there is no good justification for the kind of cuts which my noble friend rightly deplores.

<P>

<A NAME="90309-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, in supporting the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Bragg, to the Minister, I ask the Minister whether he is aware of the research that points to a link between those children who truant and subsequently become involved in crime and the high levels of illiteracy among those children, and the remarks of the Secretary of State for Education yesterday that 75 per cent. of those who are in our prisons today have a reading age of only 10. In those circumstances does not the Minister agree that the Government's initiatives in promoting, for instance, literacy hours in our schools--which I strongly welcome--are being undermined by those who make a mockery of such policies by promoting the closure of public libraries as part of their public expenditure cuts this year?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I was not aware of the specific research to which the noble Lord refers. Indeed I should be grateful if he could point me towards it. Certainly the conclusions are not surprising. It is true that illiteracy and poor reading are closely associated with social exclusion and, of course, with crime. As I said in my previous answers, the Government are determined that library authorities should fulfil their statutory responsibilities. I hope that that determination has the support of the noble Lord.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to superintend, and promote the improvement of, the public library service ... and to secure the proper discharge by local authorities of [their] functions". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That does not entitle the Secretary of State to take over their library services except in the most extreme circumstances. This Government and preceding governments have always taken the view that the precise way in which local authorities discharge their responsibilities should be a matter for local decision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-03_spnew13"></A><B> Viscount Falkland: </B>   My Lords, is not there a strong case for the statutory obligation to be more tightly focused? Furthermore, is the noble Lord aware that in Lambeth there is considerable public outcry at the moment about the closure of small libraries on the basis that they are uneconomic, whereas the facts appear to indicate that that council has neglected buildings, mismanaged book provision and messed around with opening hours? It appears to me to be a classic case of asset stripping.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the position is not quite as simple as the noble Viscount suggests. There is a balance to be drawn between the statutory obligations on local authorities to fulfil certain functions and the need for local determination of priorities, which I hope those who are seized of local democracy and subsidiarity will support. I do not want to make any comments on Lambeth in particular. However, I caution against thinking that the closure of libraries is the only way to make cuts. Libraries must have a network, of course, but they also have to have decent opening hours, good book stocks and adequate staff for the purposes of information management which is what libraries are about.

(".--(1) For section 25 of the Trustee Act 1925 substitute--
<BR>
"Delegation of trustee's functions by power of attorney. 
<BR>
25.--(1) Notwithstanding any rule of law or equity to the contrary, a trustee may, by power of attorney, delegate the execution or exercise of all or any of the trusts, powers and discretions vested in him as trustee either alone or jointly with any other person or persons.
<BR>
(2) A delegation under this section--
<BR>
(a) commences as provided by the instrument creating the power or, if the instrument makes no provision as to the commencement of the delegation, with the date of the execution of the instrument by the donor; and
<BR>
(b) continues for a period of twelve months or any shorter period provided by the instrument creating the power.
<BR>
(3) The persons who may be donees of a power of attorney under this section include a trust corporation.

<BR>
(b) each of the other trustees, if any;
<BR>
but failure to comply with this subsection shall not, in favour of a person dealing with the donee of the power, invalidate any act done or instrument executed by the donee.
<BR>
(5) A power of attorney given under this section by a single donor--
<BR>
(a) in the form set out in subsection (6) of this section; or
<BR>
(b) in a form to the like effect but expressed to be made under this subsection,
<BR>
shall operate to delegate to the person identified in the form as the single donee of the power the execution and exercise of all the trusts, powers and discretions vested in the donor as trustee (either alone or jointly with any other person or persons) under the single trust so identified.
<BR>
(6) The form referred to in subsection (5) of this section is as follows--
<BR>
"THIS GENERAL TRUSTEE POWER OF ATTORNEY is made on [date] by [name of one donor] of [address of donor] as trustee of [name or details of one trust].
<BR>
I appoint [name of one donee] of [address of donee] to be my attorney [if desired, the date on which the delegation commences or the period for which it continues (or both)] in accordance with section 25(5) of the Trustee Act 1925.
<BR>
[To be executed as a deed]".
<BR>
(7) The donor of a power of attorney given under this section shall be liable for the acts or defaults of the donee in the same manner as if they were the acts or defaults of the donor.
<BR>
(8) For the purpose of executing or exercising the trusts or powers delegated to him, the donee may exercise any of the powers conferred on the donor as trustee by statute or by the instrument creating the trust, including power, for the purpose of the transfer of any inscribed stock, himself to delegate to an attorney power to transfer but not including the power of delegation conferred by this section.
<BR>
(9) The fact that it appears from any power of attorney given under this section, or from any evidence required for the purposes of any such power of attorney or otherwise, that in dealing with any stock the donee of the power is acting in the execution of a trust shall not be deemed for any purpose to affect any person in whose books the stock is inscribed or registered with any notice of the trust.
<BR>
(10) This section applies to a personal representative, tenant for life and statutory owner as it applies to a trustee except that subsection (4) shall apply as if it required the notice there mentioned to be given--
<BR>
(a) in the case of a personal representative, to each of the other personal representatives, if any, except any executor who has renounced probate;
<BR>
(b) in the case of a tenant for life, to the trustees of the settlement and to each person, if any, who together with the person giving the notice constitutes the tenant for life; and

(c) in the case of a statutory owner, to each of the persons, if any, who together with the person giving the notice constitute the statutory owner and, in the case of a statutory owner by virtue of section 23(1)(a) of the Settled Land Act 1925, to the trustees of the settlement."

<A NAME = "90309-04_para2"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, I undertook at the Committee stage of the Bill to introduce a government amendment to meet what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, had sought to achieve by the addition of a Keeling Schedule, having explained, I hope to your Lordships' satisfaction, why it was that we preferred an alternative approach. Clause 5 in its amended form substitutes a new Section 25 of the Trustee Act 1925 for the present Section 25 in relation to powers of attorney granted after the Bill comes into force. In its present form, Section 25 allows the trustee to delegate by power of attorney, for a period of up to 12 months, the exercise of the trust's powers and discretions--that is, functions--vested in him or her as trustee.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-04_para3"></a>This power to delegate is, however, subject to various safeguards intended to protect the interest of beneficiaries from excessive delegation. In brief, these are that the trustee may not delegate to a sole co-trustee, unless a trust corporation; must give notice of each appointment to specified persons; and remains liable for the acts and omissions of the attorney. The powers conferred by Section 25 may be excluded or restricted by the document, if any, creating the trust. That comes from Section 69(2) of the Trustee Act 1925.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-04_para4"></a>I have spoken briefly to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, and I understand him to be satisfied with the effect of this amendment. I trust that on this occasion I have given him no cause to feel even slightly niggled. I think my undertaking was rather broader, and I have come back with an amendment before the Bill goes to the other place. I hope that he is satisfied. I beg to move.

<A NAME="90309-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Brightman: </B>   My Lords, I should like to thank the Minister for this amendment to Clause 5 of the Bill, which I wholly support. It is a great improvement on my own amendment which I tabled at Committee stage in the form of a Keeling Schedule. The method of the noble and learned Lord in dealing with Clause 5 is, quite honestly, superior to a Keeling Schedule. I am certain that all lawyers and non-lawyers concerned with the administration of trusts will be grateful to the Minister for simplifying the effect of the amendment.

<A NAME="90309-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I now make an intervention slightly more serious than my previous one. I welcome this minor but useful Bill. In doing so, I wonder whether the Government will be prepared to look again at the procedure for dealing with Bills of this kind. I understand that there are at least 20 Law Commission Bills waiting in the queue. A fast-track procedure for uncontroversial Bills could cut the backlog for the Law Commission. Furthermore, a fast-track procedure could be used for other purposes--such as the deregulation and pruning of redundant legislation and minor amendments to current legislation--thereby reducing excessive use of Henry VIII clauses. The Government have just published a discussion paper on the deregulation process. While <P>


<a name="column_129"></a>

<BR>
("(3) With the exception of this section this Act shall not come into force until the Secretary of State has laid in draft before the House of Commons an order contained in a statutory instrument making such provision relating to the tax liability of the CDC as will encourage private sector investment in it, and the order has been approved by resolution of that House.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we did not have the intention to speak at Third Reading as both the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, and myself hoped that this amendment would be accepted at Report stage. Unfortunately this was not the case. We have therefore had to bring it back once again despite the Minister's welcome assurances that amendments to the Bill to include tax provisions would be introduced at a further stage. We, the Liberal Democrats, and I trust Her Majesty's Government, believe that a CDC PPP must be tax efficient to be successful. We would be failing in our duty as a revising and scrutinising Chamber if we let this Bill go through to the other place without this aspect on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para4"></a>I wish to make it absolutely clear that this is in no way meant to be a wrecking amendment. Without these essential tax provisions the CDC/PPP Bill is seriously flawed. We understand that the Minister argued at Report stage:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we believe that secondary legislation would be the wrong way to make this kind of provision concerning tax".-- [Official Report,2/3/99; col. 1557.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
He argued that it should be done by primary legislation. If it is so important, why do the Government present a Bill without such crucial provisions already in place? I am afraid that if the Minister is unable to accept this amendment we will have no alternative but to test the will of the House. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="90309-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches would rather not use the procedure of testing the will of <P>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the House on Third Reading. However, the Minister made it clear at a previous stage that our amendment was unacceptable. This in no way detracts from our support of this worthy Bill. I look forward to the Minister's erudite comments on how the amendment is flawed, a subject upon which he waxes so lyrical. The House would be failing in its role as a scrutinising Chamber if it did not raise certain points.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para5"></a>The Bill is deficient in that without tax provision the CDC will not be able to operate in the private sector. The Minister may say that he has given a copper-bottomed guarantee on the Bill. However, it would be an act of faith for us to allow the Bill to go through all its stages in this House with the provision that the Government will have worked out the problems associated with the Bill by the time it reaches the House of Commons. At the moment, there may be a copper bottom, but there are severe holes in the shape of the Bill. I very much hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, but I fear that he will not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I will not follow the noble Lord's metallic arguments. However, I am afraid that I will have to repeat part of what I said at Second Reading because I have been asked, quite reasonably and properly, for the same assurances again. I can confirm that it is the Government's view that the CDC has to be tax efficient if it is to achieve its goal of investing in developing countries using private capital raised in the context of a competitive private investment market dominated by offshore funds. The Government have already agreed the broad principles for a tax solution that will provide the CDC public-private partnership with the required tax efficiency. Work is continuing on the details. However, I am sorry that such work has not been concluded to a sufficient extent to allow us to bring forward the necessary amendment to the Bill today. We intend to introduce the necessary amendments to the Bill at the appropriate time in the House of Commons.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para6"></a>I repeat what I said about the amendment. It would require the Secretary of State to lay before the House of Commons an order-making provision as to the tax liability of the CDC, such provision as will encourage private sector investment in it, and to have that order approved by the House of Commons. We certainly agree with the aim of the amendment but, as I have said before, we disagree with the approach in that the proper way to make the necessary provision about the CDC's tax is by amendment to the current Bill and not by secondary legislation. The amendment is also technically defective because the Secretary of State does not currently have power to make tax provision of this kind by secondary legislation. The amendment probably--I say "probably" because these are arcane and legal questions--does not give her any such power. Even if the amendment must be read as impliedly giving some power, the extent of that power is poorly defined.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para7"></a>I am sorry about this but I think we can come to a reasonable conclusion. I have made it clear that if the amendment is added to the Bill it would be the Government's intention to ask the House of Commons to remove it and to make the necessary substantive <P>


<a name="column_131"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provision about tax by further amendment to the Bill. On that basis, if the noble Baroness wishes to put her amendment to the House, I would advise my noble friends not to oppose it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-05_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, I understand that we are unable to have the details of the tax provisions at the moment and that should the amendment be accepted it might be removed in the other place.

<A NAME="90309-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Geddes </B>   rose to move, That this House take note of the Report of the European Communities Committee on Airline Competition (32nd Report, Session 1997-98, HL Paper 156).
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this inquiry into airline competition was carried out by Sub-Committee B of the European Communities Select Committee of your Lordships' House. The inquiry was prompted by the revival of the 1989 Commission proposal to extend the powers of the Commission to apply the EC competition rules, particularly Articles 85 and 86, to airline services between the European Union and third countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para13"></a>The sub-committee took evidence over the period May to July of last year, our report was published in November of last year and the Government replied, very comprehensively if I may say so, in a letter dated 22nd February of this year. I say "very comprehensively" because it was exactly that, but there are one or two items of the Government's reply on which I should like some answers. However, I should emphasise to your Lordships that the reply of 22nd February has not been discussed by Sub-Committee B, so any views that I express today are personal views and not those collectively of the sub-committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para14"></a>We were superbly advised throughout our inquiry by Dr. George Williams of Cranfield University. Perhaps I may express the committee's very real appreciation to him. We also had the excellent services of Miss Kate Ball as the Clerk to the sub-committee. Sadly, we do not have those any longer. She has been, I think it would be correct to say, promoted to the Public Bill Office, but I should also like to express our appreciation to her for the way, as a very new Clerk in your Lordships' House, she assisted in that inquiry.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para15"></a>The committee heard 10 sessions of oral evidence over the period I have described, including from the Competition Commissioner, Karel van Miert, and from <P>


<a name="column_132"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Glenda Jackson MP, the Minister of State at the DETR. We also took evidence from five separate airlines--British Midland, Delta, Lufthansa, Virgin Atlantic and British Airways: they are put in strict chronological order. However, we did not--the report emphasises this and I wish to do so again--receive any reply to an invitation for evidence from Air France. It simply did not have the courtesy to bother to reply in any shape or form. That becomes quite indicative in a subsequent part of the report, to which I will refer.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para16"></a>Currently, competition rules with regard to airlines are applied by both the Commission and member states. If this was not your Lordships' House, I might describe it as a "something" muddle. The Commission's proposal has three parts. First, it would give the Commission sole power to apply competition rules to flights between the European Union and third countries. Secondly, it would provide for consultation between European Union and third countries in cases of dispute. Thirdly, it would give the Commission further powers to grant block exemptions for certain activities by airlines.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para17"></a>In paragraph 2.1 of the Government's response the Government appear to be stating that block exemptions are given to agreements and practices which promote competition in the consumer interest. But I must say-- I should be grateful if the Minister could comment on this--that my interpretation of Article 85 of the treaty is rather different from that of Dr. John Reid in that, as I read it, Article 85 states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"exemptions may be given to a category of agreements between undertakings which does not ... afford such undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products in question". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
We are getting into a slightly legalistic jungle here, but that is a very different interpretation from the one we received from the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para18"></a>As the Government rightly point out in the third paragraph of the introduction of the reply of 22nd February, the committee found itself obliged to go much wider than the original narrow European brief in that--this is a truism--the airline industry is truly global and is characterised by a whole battery of alliances, which we summarise in appendix 3 to the report. Those alliances are in themselves potentially anti-competitive.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para19"></a>The thrust of our report--and we say it at least twice in bold type in our conclusions--is that consumer interest should be paramount in regulating airline competition. We found, and this is why we had to go wider than the apparently narrow initial brief, that much of the distortion in competition comes from the European Union/US airline market. That is the nub of the whole airline industry of the world.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para20"></a>In particular, we found the restrictions on ownership on either side of the Atlantic to be seriously anti-competitive, with the US not allowing more than a 25 per cent. non-US ownership interest; within the EU the equivalent figure is 49.9 per cent. Although we realise that it is perhaps some distance away, we recommend that as soon as possible those two restrictions should be lifted.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para21"></a>We emphasise, and I anticipate that this may evoke considerable opposition from one or two speakers in this debate, that responsibility for competition should lie at <P>


<a name="column_133"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the highest practical level. In the context of the European Union that is with the Commission. Having heard very good evidence, we came to the conclusion that the Commission is better placed than member states to apply rules effectively and consistently. We also reached the unanimous decision that the committee would give less special treatment to member states' airlines than national governments have done or continue to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para22"></a>Historically, airlines have been accorded special treatment. There are very good reasons why that should have been so, not least strategic reasons. But we could not bring ourselves to say that that situation was any longer justified. The industry has moved on. In our opinion there is no further reason for such special treatment. Indeed, our report goes further, in stating that the industry should be treated like any other industry, ending current anti-competitive practices. We appreciated that that could possibly mean the demise of a number of what have previously been termed "national" airlines. However, we concluded that the necessity for such national airlines no longer stood up. If some of the smaller airlines have to go to the wall, so be it. We were of the firm conclusion that, while initially that might hurt or appear to hurt the airline industry within the United Kingdom, the airline industry in this country is by far the most "deregularised", if I may use that awful word, and therefore best equipped to take advantage of such deregularisation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para23"></a>We then moved into the deep, thick jungle of "slots". The more we looked into the matter, the more complex it became. First and foremost, to our amazement, we could not find a single witness who could tell us who owned slots--slots being the right to take off from and land at an airport at a designated time. We even asked the Minister directly: "Who owns slots?"--to which he equally directly replied, "I have no idea". The same answer came from all the witnesses. We did, however, go deeper into what are known as "grandfather rights", which have grown historically. As I understand it, if Imperial Airways happened to have the right to take off at 0930 from what we now call Heathrow, the airline kept that slot in perpetuity. It did not matter whether that 0930 flight was originally destined for Paris, and the destination subsequently became Singapore, and after that Dallas; that 0930 slot remained with Imperial Airways, BOAC and now British Airways. My noble friend Lady O'Cathain may choose to comment on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para24"></a>We came to the firm conclusion that airlines that held grandfather rights had significant anti-competitive power over potential competitors. We were of the firm belief that no airline should be allowed to dominate at any particular airport. The Government have commented on that in their reply. They state that at the hub airports--they specifically mention Heathrow and Gatwick--congestion causes the domination. We challenge that statement. We accept that it is partly due to congestion, but state that it is also caused by the stranglehold of grandfather rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para25"></a>As I have said, we did not like the linking of slots to routes. We wanted the two to be separated, so that if an airline dropped a route it therefore lost the slot. But so <P>


<a name="column_134"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>far as Brussels is concerned, we pressed strongly in our report for a reform of the slot allocation system. I underline that by pointing out that the system was due for revision in July 1997 and that that review has not yet seen the light of day.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para26"></a>In the long term, the committee supported an open and competitive bidding system for slots. I hope that speakers in the debate will comment on that. The question of slots is a very difficult one. We have produced an opinion; other members of this House may well put forward other opinions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para27"></a>I am delighted that the speakers in this debate include five members, other than myself, of Sub-Committee B and two further members who have joined the sub-committee since our inquiry. From a list that effectively contains 15 speakers, that is extremely good representation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para28"></a>I shall not bore your Lordships by attempting to go through the entire report. I hope that all present have read it. In conclusion, I wish to repeat the highlighted start to Conclusion 116. The committee states, shortly and to the point,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The needs of the consumer should be paramount". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
We believe that most strongly. We want competition rules to bring that about. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para29"></a>Moved, That this House take note of the report of the European Communities Committee on Airline  Competition (32nd Report, Session 1997-98, HL Paper 156).--(Lord Geddes.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My Lords, the great value of this report is that it lays bare, in the clearest and most concise way that I have yet seen, the ways in which airlines, and the Governments that protect them, can operate against the public interest. The report goes much wider than the narrow matter of the proposed European Union regulations regarding air services between the European Union and third counties. I feel absolutely free to praise the merits of the report. Although I am a member of the Select Committee on the European Communities, I am not and was not a member of Sub-Committee B which produced the report and clearly was so ably chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Geddes.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para30"></a>At present, most governments in the developed world, not only in the European Union, are active in promoting competition between the providers of goods and services as the best way of ensuring that the public enjoy lower prices, a better quality of service and greater choice. But as this report so rightly concludes, the way in which this one particular industry, the airline industry, operates does not achieve those objectives.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para31"></a>For much too long national governments, though not all, within the European Union and elsewhere have promoted, protected and cosseted their own national so-called flag carriers, their own particular national "champions". As the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, indicated, some of those national airlines are not necessarily viable but are simply state-supported totems of national vanity, distorting competition. As a result, the consumers and, of course, taxpayers are <P>


<a name="column_135"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disadvantaged. As the report rightly says, from the point of view of the public and the consumers' interests in competitive prices and quality of service the,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"maintenance of national airlines is irrelevant". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para32"></a>Airlines get special treatment in the national and European Union competition policies and, in my view and as the report indicates, it is time that that changed. There are so many ways in which an established airline is immunised and protected from competition. Take the system of taking off and landing slots at airports, to which the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, referred. It has become increasingly anti-competitive as demands for slots has increasingly outstripped supply at Europe's congested airports. The system of so-called "grandfather rights" and the way airlines can switch slots between routes give the established airlines powerful weapons against any upstart new entrant competitor.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para33"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, said, the sub-committee had a problem in trying to discover who owned slots at airports. It is amazing that no one, not even the Government nor the European Commission, could answer that question. I was interested in British Airways' response. It rather cleverly said: "It's a metaphysical question", which probably cannot be answered. Perhaps I am being too cynical, and the next speaker will probably think I am in saying that it might be in the interests of British Airways that it is all so uncertain.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para34"></a>Most of the recommendations of the report follow naturally from its analysis. As it says, any continuance of the block exemptions granted by the European Union competition rules should be strictly justified--if they are to continue--in the interests of consumers and the promotion of competition. Normal competitive conditions should be the objective for further development of the airline industry and we should aim for an open and competitive slot allocation system. Again, I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, and the report.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para35"></a>I suppose it also follows naturally from the report's analysis that the European Union Commission should apply the competition rules and it would apply them more effectively and consistently than member states have done to date.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para36"></a>However, I have one little quibble with the report. Perhaps I may remind your Lordships of the de Havilland merger case in 1991 when certain individual European commissioners seemed to cast their votes in that case more according to the national interests of their own countries than in accordance with the European Union's competition rules. I do not, therefore, share the report's dismissal in paragraph 112 of the idea of an independent European Union competition authority, perhaps on the lines of the German federal cartel office or the Bundeskartelamt.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para37"></a>Of course, it is a pity that the proposals of this excellent report seem to stand no chance whatever of acceptance by member states. In its response to the report, the United Kingdom--and I hope that the Minister will not think me too unkind in saying this--offers warm words about supporting in principle that normal competition law should apply to international scheduled aviation. The <P>


<a name="column_136"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>report states that at paragraph 8. But the Government emphasise several times in their response the strength of the traditional system of bilateral agreements and seem anxious to preserve the role of the individual member states. I should like to think--and the Government have a chance to consider this further and at greater leisure--that there will be greater support from the Government for the report's proposals in practice and not just in principle.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-05_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted that the House has been given the opportunity to debate the report of the Select Committee. At the outset I have two declarations of interest to make. I am now a member of Sub-Committee B of the Select Committee, but was not a member at the time of the committee's deliberations, nor when it published its report. The second declaration seems superfluous as it has already been alluded to by the first two speakers: namely, I am a director of British Airways.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para38"></a>I welcome this wide-ranging and comprehensive report and see it as encapsulating three very positive points: first, the strong emphasis on the fact that the customer comes first. That was better put by the committee in Recommendation 12 in that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The needs of the consumer should be paramount". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
My noble friend Lord Geddes stated that recommendation twice. The second positive point is the assertion that there should be no long-term special deals for airlines. Thirdly, there is the recognition that Europe is now central to aviation policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para39"></a>While I agree with many of the recommendations made by the committee, there are three areas which I feel need further elaboration or explanation to make it even more valuable to the non-technical but very interested reader. I hope that some brief comments from me might help in that regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para40"></a>First, I am somewhat disconcerted by the implication in the first recommendation that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a good deal for the consumer", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
embodies as its first criterion the need,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to offer the consumer lower prices". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Frankly, as a marketing person I have always asserted that the offer should be "good value for money". Good value for money does not always imply lower prices. I am sure that we have all experienced occasions in our lives when we wish we had spent a little more on particular goods or services which would have resulted in better overall value. A cheap washing machine that breaks down every year or so is not exactly good value for money compared with one which cost more initially but is reliable and offers greater flexibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para41"></a>So it is with all consumer goods and services. Air transport is no exception. It is the customer's choice whether he or she flies with a "no frills" airline with no meal on board and offering only one flight a day or prefers the more expensive option with greater flexibility of schedules and a higher level of cabin service.
<P>


<a name="column_137"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para42"></a>Just as an aside, noble Lords have probably noticed that I referred to the "customer", but the report refers to the "consumer". I have always differentiated between the words "consumer" and "customer", believing that the word "consumer" indicates the whole market but the word "customer" indicates specific individuals within that market. Some airlines try to make the consumer feel like a customer; that is, people who are individuals with individual needs and wants. That is also the choice which the passenger makes. It is competition at its most detailed level.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para43"></a>The second point I wish to make is that I feel that there could be some misunderstanding in the nomenclature used in describing airlines as "national" airlines. Over the years, rather as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, suggested, that adjective has come to be used as shorthand for "state-financed and operated airline". We have no such airlines based in the UK, although my noble friend Lord Geddes said that if national airlines were forced to become regular, some British airlines would suffer. In my understanding of the terminology, they would not suffer because we do not have any British national airlines. What we have are airlines which have, if you like, British nationality. But we must not confuse them with the state-owned and operated airlines like Air France or Aer Lingus, to name but two of those located closest to this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para44"></a>The United Kingdom is particularly fortunate in having a very successful civil aviation industry. We have only approximately 4 per cent. of world GDP and some 5 per cent. of world trade, but we have a 9 per cent. share of the international aviation industry. Just a word of warning: any attempts to dismantle the UK industry would create a disproportionate disadvantage to UK airlines compared with their competitors in Europe.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para45"></a>The third and final area I would comment upon relates to the committee's recommendations on slots--Recommendations 15 to 23 inclusive. In my whole career in the civil aviation sector--as a young, innocent and raw economist in my first job, which happened to be with an airline, and many years later as a director of British Airways--it always seemed to me that the most complex area one deals with is slots. It is very complex and there is greater misunderstanding about this than about any other issue in the sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para46"></a>What are slots? Why do we have slots? Why does no other sector of industry have slots? Should slots be tradeable? Slots, as has already been said, are a direct result of congestion or the inability to provide sufficient airport space to accommodate the traffic required to satisfy consumer and customer demand. Slots are a problem world-wide but in some countries the problem is much more pressing than in others. In the US, for example, slots seriously come into play only in the highly congested airports of New York and Chicago. But the US, of course, has vast tracts of land in which airports can be accommodated and a huge market composed of people who take a flight to go from A to B within the country as the best way of gobbling up the miles.
<P>


<a name="column_138"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para47"></a>It is all so different in European countries and in particular in the UK. Congestion in the UK is due to government restrictions on expansion of airports. To define slots as national assets when government policy has constrained the infrastructure is tantamount to confiscating airlines' business and would be utterly wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para48"></a>An airline using slots is analogous to a train using a track. The train company undertakes to provide a service and in the provision of that service it has to use a track. It negotiates the use of the track for certain times of the day and publishes its timetable. Passengers get to know the times of the trains and the company provides the services to them. If, however, experience shows that traffic from London to Plymouth has fallen off and that traffic from London to Bristol has taken off, the train company, in the interests of providing a service to all its passengers, will negotiate to run extra trains on the one line and to curtail services on the other. A similar situation exists with airline slots. This flexibility is required by the airline in order to provide services to its passengers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para49"></a>The right to a slot was initially protected by conventions contained in the scheduling guides published by the International Air Transport Association, IATA. Slots are ranked according to priorities: regular scheduled services are in category 1, for example, and category 3 is air taxis or people with small private planes--or even large planes. This convention has been adopted by and large by EC Regulation 95/93, which is now enforceable as law in the UK, with the rights granted by it recognised and enforceable in UK courts. The regulation confers rights and UK airlines are entitled to use and deal with those rights in accordance with that regulation and with the general law.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para50"></a>The very structure of this situation has given stability to airlines to plan their schedules and to engage in fleet planning, leading in turn to huge advance orders for aircraft, which coincidentally help UK companies such as Rolls Royce or the joint UK-French consortium of Airbus. Without the security of the slots it is doubtful whether any serious long-term planning could be undertaken. Would the customer benefit? I very much doubt it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para51"></a>Investment by airlines, persistent, determined and long-term commitment to route development, all depend on the security of slots; but slots should never be tied to specific frequency levels on specific routes. Here I disagree with my noble friend, Lord Geddes, because I believe that does not take into account changing patterns of market demand. We all know how fashion changes for holidays to various regions or countries. Similarly, economic developments in other countries could seriously affect demand for travel to those countries. There has been a recent example with the economic downturn in the Far East. It would be insane to suggest that, if an airline had X number of slots allocated only to a Far East route and Y number to a thriving route in Europe, it could not reschedule some of the Far East slots to provide for the extra supply to <P>


<a name="column_139"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the European destinations. That would not be serving the customer and would be economic madness. Distorting market forces is not the best policy to adopt.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para52"></a>New routes are tested out and existing routes are given more or fewer frequencies, as economic factors drive changing market dynamics. Change is healthy and ensures that supply is put where the demand is, and we all know that demand is always changing. Tie slots to routes and we consciously distort those market forces. In my view, slots are as important as brands and I think we would agree that governments do not have the right to interfere with brands. Until the necessary infrastructure is in place to satisfy consumer demand, airlines will inevitably want to build up slot banks at airports.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para53"></a>A great deal of misunderstanding also exists with regard to the selling of slots. As slots are assets why cannot they be sold? They have a value based on the investment made in them and, like any other asset with an investment content, they should be tradable. Trade in slots does go on. Only last month I read of a part-exchange deal undertaken by a large British airline with a small airline. It involved swapping several less desirable slots for prime time ones and "parting with &#163;2.5 million"--according to the Sunday Times of 21st February. It is naive to think that this can or should be stopped.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para54"></a>The airline business is very competitive, nationally and internationally. Indeed, the UK airline industry is as competitive as any sector I know. The customer gets good value based on his or her preferences. It is a success story and has evolved strongly over many years. It is unsubsidised and, directly or indirectly, employs hundreds of thousands of people. The committee's report tends to disregard that and concentrates on what it sees as anti-competitive practices writ large. Believe me, those who strive to provide the best service to the customer do not see it that way, and I hope that I have given some grounds to consider that things may be different from what the report suggests.

<P>
<A NAME="90309-05_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bridges: </B>   My Lords, I am glad to take part in this important debate. I should begin by explaining that I was a member of the Select Committee which approved this report, although I have since retired from the Select Committee on the expiry of my term. I then made it clear that I did not wholly agree with the conclusions of the report and would explain my reasons when the report was presented to the House. I do so now, except on the subject of slots, where I believe the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, has made a very strong case for suggesting that this matter needs to be looked at afresh. I must also admire the metaphysical skills which the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, has just demonstrated to us.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para55"></a>I have been considerably involved in international civil aviation in the past, particularly as Minister (Commercial) in the British Embassy in Washington for the four years 1976 to 1979, which covered the period of the renegotiation of our bilateral civil aviation treaty with the United States, and I was a member of the <P>


<a name="column_140"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>British negotiating team led by Mr. Patrick Shovelton. I also had some continuing responsibility for civil aviation as the Deputy Secretary (Economic) at the Foreign Office for the three years following, 1979 to 1982.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para56"></a>In approaching this subject it is worth observing that our role in international civil aviation is very significant. This is partly for reasons of geography. We are, as it were, the Clapham Junction of international air travel. We also have a good record for air safety. What matters, however, is the geographical hub and the wide range of destinations to distant continents which are available in London. Thus I recall that when U Thant was Secretary-General of the United Nations and wished to revisit his native Burma he found it easiest to cross the Atlantic, to spend a night in an hotel at Heathrow and to take a direct flight to Rangoon the next day. Even 30 years on, when so much has changed in civil aviation, it is still the case that travellers in the eastern United States will locate the widest choice of flights to destinations in Africa, the Middle East and south Asia by travelling via London; and converse journeys produce the same result.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para57"></a>This explains the telling statistic in the report just quoted by the noble Baroness, that although we have only 4 per cent. of world GDP we have 8 per cent. of world aviation output. This share has been won by a combination of geography, competitive efficiency and dependability. There are many operators who want to gain market share, both in Europe and elsewhere, which would be at our expense.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para58"></a>My first concern, therefore, is that although the Commission's proposal is designed to improve the effectiveness of its competition policy--which is clearly a laudable objective--the main result I would expect to see from the proposals, at least in the short term, would be a reduction in our share of the market. The Commission may well be in agreement with that supposition. However, although the Commission is not concerned with that, it concerns us.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para59"></a>My next reason for doubting the conclusions of the report relates to the Commission's competition policy. That is the legal base for its initiative. The Commission's record in the area of competition policy does not exactly inspire confidence. In the past the Commission has been regrettably weak in taking action to curb state subsidies, notably over steel but also over state-owned airlines such as Air France and Sabena. I do not find its claim to be acting in the interests of the aviation consumer convincing. If that is its prime concern there are some other areas in which it can use its existing powers to help consumers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para60"></a>For example, there is the ridiculous IATA rule that discounted fares are available only if the passenger stays over a Saturday night. The ostensible reason for this rule is to encourage tourism. Instead, it boosts airline revenues by millions of euros every year at the expense of the consumer. There is also the current method of off-loading block airline seats to tourist agencies and bucket shops and charging premium prices to those who have to travel for business or urgent family reasons. This means that those who have to travel subsidise those who <P>


<a name="column_141"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do not and are going on holiday. That has always seemed to me to be very unfair. If the Commission can act in those areas it will help the consumer. It already has power to act if it chooses to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para61"></a>It is clear that the Commission wants to assume these fresh powers in order to conclude new aviation agreements, in particular with the United States, that are binding on other member states. It is evident from its public activities that the Commission is sympathetic to the US desire for what the Americans call an open skies agreement. But this is a one-way street, as the Americans want the freedom to earn money in our skies without opening their own. They want the right to fly from a US airport to intermediate stops in Europe, with traffic rights here to an ultimate destination elsewhere in Europe or further afield. That one-sided arrangement prevailed under the first bilateral agreement, Bermuda I.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para62"></a>At that time Pan American had a fleet of small jets stationed in London which transported passengers arriving on its transatlantic flights to other destinations in Europe. In effect, Pan Am ran a European travel service. That right was removed under Bermuda II, and the Americans now want it back in spades to cover Europe as a whole without conceding reciprocal rights in the USA. Until the Commission shows signs that it will stand up for European rights--it has not done so up until now--I do not believe that we should concede the authority that it seeks for specific reasons of its own relating to the extension of its authority and competence. I therefore support the position of Her Majesty's Government and British Airways on this question.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para63"></a>The time may well come when it is appropriate to confer on the Commission the authority that it now seeks. The situation may change fundamentally if, for example, a second generation of supersonic airliners with a long intercontinental range--a successor to Concorde--were developed. That could significantly change the way in which civil aviation operates globally. Further, the improvement in the competitive position in Europe may endow the Commission with a broader attitude, which I believe that it lacks at the moment, and the experience and skill that enhance the position of the consumer and the Commission's own public standing. Attitudes may also change in the United States. As a result of deregulation in the US air ticket prices have risen and the choice of alternative routes has declined.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para64"></a>I recall a conversation in Washington in the 1970s that I had with Professor Fred Kahn of Ithaca, New York State, who had been brought in to advise the Carter Administration about deregulation of the aviation industry. He was a fascinating man and was the architect of deregulation in the United States. He had a bright and active mind and was a brilliantly clever advocate of his thesis. I was puzzled about where all this would lead. I invited him to lunch and asked him the following question, "But, Fred, if your policy actually works, surely the President of the United States could not allow Pan Am to file for bankruptcy?".

<A NAME="90309-05_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, I shall not follow the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, entirely down the line to which he has diverted us in this debate. I begin by congratulating the chairman, my noble friend Lord Geddes, for getting a slot for this debate even at this late stage some three months after the publication of the report. In his speech my noble friend gave a masterly and concise introduction to this debate. Among the many points that he made, which have also been made by other noble Lords, was that the airline industry was different from any other. The airline industry is different in all kinds of ways: it is different because a firm in this country cannot take over another airline; it is different because of what I call a pseudo-cartel into which the thorny subject of competition inevitably comes; and it is different because of the regulatory regime that is applied. One cannot just buy or rent an aircraft, find two airports at different ends of the route one wants to fly and launch one's service. All kinds of hurdles have to be jumped.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para66"></a>The first hurdle is a bilateral agreement. The agreement may be extant or perhaps a new one is needed. In either event one must apply to one's own government for this purpose. That government may well own their own state airline or, in other cases, give preference to their former, now privatised, state airline. In another context, an example of this may be that Ministers and parliamentarians in this country are encouraged to fly by BA when on government or parliamentary business. Noble Lords may not regard that as a very competitive attitude.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para67"></a>However, having obtained permission from both governments under the bilateral agreement one then needs space at an airport at each end of the route. Alas, it may not be the airport that one wants to fly to because international airports are limited. Therefore, one may well have to find a local airline to transport the passengers to where they wish to go. In the jargon, one needs a code-sharing agreement. Lastly, one needs passengers. That is the only part of the operation over which one has complete control. At every previous stage one finds obstacles in one's way. The whole procedure up to the final stage is potentially anti-competitive.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para68"></a>Over the past five years the intra-EU industry has become substantially deregulated, bringing with it benefits to the consumer. An instance of this is the journey that I made with my family to Malaga over the new year. I was offered ticket prices from &#163;69 to &#163;400 depending on when I wanted to fly and with which airline. It is interesting to note that in some cases the earlier I booked the more expensive it would be. I can <P>


<a name="column_143"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tell my noble friend Lady O'Cathain that I decided for myself which produced value for money. Incidentally, that was neither the lowest nor the highest priced tickets. It would not have been so easy had I wanted to fly to Bangkok or Bogota. I would not have had the range of options, although the Commission believes--probably rightly--that if a major trading block of nations became involved in the negotiations it would have more clout than national governments acting on their own to negotiate a better deal for passengers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para69"></a>As the committee state in paragraph 3, it is certain that the policy should be to introduce normal competitive conditions and that this can be done effectively only at the highest practical level. I understand the criticism that has been made in this respect. Nonetheless, it is quite clear that we could have achieved a far better deal had we acted in blocks rather than as individual countries. It is for the Commission to ensure that third country deregulation is achieved fairly between member states, with strict application to such things as dominant positions of individual airlines, mergers and state aids. Code sharing--it is, after all, only a way of getting round the current ownership regulations and rules--should be negotiated away in the longer term. That cannot be done by national governments acting on their own. Nor, I believe, can we achieve a sensible, reciprocal agreement on slot allocations.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para70"></a>When all is said and done, if slots are freed up at the European end, and remain restricted in, say, America--my noble friend mentioned Chicago--or China (I accept that that is more unlikely), nothing much is achieved. However, slot allocation is an intra-European problem too and the Commission could and should do something about that first, and quickly. The most pernicious part is the so-called grandfather right. If one gains a slot on one route and decides that that route is uneconomic, one can keep that slot and use it to fly to another destination, provided one can find a slot at the other end. The result may well be that one freezes a competitor off the replacement route. That is anti-competitive in anyone's book.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para71"></a>I should like to see a scheme where such slots go into a pool and are reallocated. That could be for a monetary consideration. However, that method is far from ideal as the larger airlines potentially would be able to outbid the smaller ones. A fairer scheme would be for the relinquished slots to go into a hat, rather like the allocation of the monthly short debates in your Lordships' House. New routes would exist but not necessarily operated by the same airline. Airlines would hate that method. Indeed, it is more than possible that the BA/American Airlines deal foundered on the Commission's insistence that slots would have to be relinquished as a condition of allowing the deal to proceed. However, I must not be drawn into a conspiracy theory.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para72"></a>I turn from the particular to the general. What is without doubt is that a Commission ruling must occur if only because of an alarming admission by the Government in their original explanatory memorandum. Page 101 of the report refers to it. The explanatory memorandum stated <P>


<a name="column_144"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that allowing the Commission greater enforcement powers would fetter the Government's power--I stress that--to conclude bilaterals which,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"often include requirements which limit competition, such as limiting the number of airlines operating and the airports served. Those may not be compatible with the competition rules in Article 85 and 86 of the treaty". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Like the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, I rest my case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-05_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Macclesfield: </B>   My Lords, I, too, as a member of the Select Committee on airlines, do not propose to repeat what has been said by my colleagues. I wish only to underline their comments.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para73"></a>The DTI issued recently an excellent White Paper on competition. As chairman of the Regional Development Agency of England's North-West, I am well aware how important the issue is as we look towards the 21st century.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para74"></a>Much of the evidence before the inquiry demonstrated a very protected industry--a system aided and abetted by previous governments since the Second World War and now part of the culture within Whitehall. As the report states, that culture is entirely historical in terms of defence of the realm, opening up trade routes and national prestige. A previous government were enlightened in their decision to privatise British Airways. Seemingly, no one told Whitehall, and British Airways continues to enjoy comfort and support as though it were still a public sector vehicle. Worse still, the effect on regional or provincial airports is serious for the following reasons. (I refer to paragraph 121 of the report.) First, a thriving regional airport is the most effective economic driver for the development of the region. Secondly, at present British Airways effectively controls slots at Heathrow and Gatwick. Is it appropriate that a private sector company should control the development of regional airports and determine the economic opportunities for English regions without reference to government? That is what it effectively does.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para75"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, spoke eloquently. Clearly, slots were the key issue for British Airways. I am not surprised because that is how it controls its competitive position. However, the rabbit is out of the bag. When British Airways attempted to negotiate some arrangements with American Airlines, the European Commission required both airlines to give up slots if they wished to achieve those arrangements. They did not do so because they did not wish to give up the slot. The airlines would not only have to give up transatlantic slots; their preference would be to give up regional slots. I can understand British Airways arguing that point, but it was not in the national interest, nor in the interest of the development of our English regions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para76"></a>Thirdly, the effect on regional or provincial airports is serious because British Airways can, and some believe that it does, effectively block the international flights to regional airports because they affect its competitive position.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para77"></a>Fourthly, business passengers are being forced to fly to Heathrow or Gatwick to catch their international flights, when they could easily fly from one of our <P>


<a name="column_145"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>leading regional airports. Do we not have enough congestion already in London? At least one third, if not 50 per cent., of our business travellers could fly from a regional airport if allowed to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para78"></a>This is a wonderful opportunity for my right honourable friend in the DTI to practise what we preach: that is, real competition and the transformation of our regional economies; and to stop British Airways and Whitehall (one could not tell the difference in the evidence between the two groups) hiding behind negotiations with the United States of America or the proposed authority of the European Union.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_time7"></A><H5>4.16 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-05_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Haslam: </B>   My Lords, I, too, wish to express my thanks to my noble friend Lord Geddes for the commendable way in which he steered us through this complex competitive situation which surrounds the airline industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para79"></a>With the exception of the newly emerging small airlines, primarily operating from developing airports, competition in the mainstream airline industry is still constrained, particularly in relation to first-class and business fares, which have continued to rise despite sharp falls in fuel costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para80"></a>It is argued that the airline industry is unique. It is claimed to be still very new and too complex internationally to behave like other industries. However, industries such as telecommunications and computers are newer and equally international but clearly in competitive terms they are now responding like other global industries. It is highly significant that the US, which has the toughest reputation of any country for anti-trust legislation, and in particular for its vigorous application, has been willing to link uniquely its so-called open skies agreements with anti-trust immunity for international airline activities, which appears to underline that it is acceptable for the industry to pursue anti-competitive actions with relative impunity.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para81"></a>Having been exposed in my career to European and national regulatory authorities in such industries as chemicals, synthetic fibres, plastics, sugar and steel, I have seen dawn raids and company and personal fines for price collusion and price fixing. Regrettably, there has been little or no evidence of such activity in relation to the airline industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para82"></a>Another related worrying feature is the perception that there are still unhealthy continuing sweetheart relationships between some European governments and their respective national airlines. The growing development, too, of major alliances between airlines linked to code sharing clearly reinforces anti-competitive activities, and unfortunately this trend seems to be accelerating and widening.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para83"></a>Another major inhibiting factor to genuine competition, already referred to by a number of my colleagues, to genuine competition surrounds slot allocations at major European airports. For example, prior to 1982, British Airways controlled slot allocations at key UK airports. We were told, however, that Chinese <P>


<a name="column_146"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>walls were established between the airline operators and the slot allocators. I bow to no one in my admiration for the splendid role my noble friend Lord King played in building British Airways. If I had been in his shoes, I know I would have found these Chinese walls extremely frustrating!
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para84"></a>Nevertheless, British Airways acquired a dominating number of "grandfather slots" in those early days which have proved anomalous and anti-competitive. Slots are now controlled by the Airport Co-ordinator Limited, owned by a consortium of 11 airlines. Even this appears not entirely unbiased in that it is still very difficult for emerging airlines to gain access to major airports. However, this approach compares well with Germany and Spain, where I believe the national airlines even now still control slot allocations.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para85"></a>I fully support our committee's recommendation that airline regulation, predominantly at the member state level, should not continue--as I have already indicated, that has not been very effective--and that hence it should become the European Commission's responsibility. Nevertheless, it must be accepted that a team of experts will quickly need to be assembled if the Commission is to deal effectively with the wide range of existing and emerging problems without protracted delays.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para86"></a>Such a change could produce a desirable improvement, but it will certainly not be the ultimate solution if the airline industry is to behave globally like other industries, which must be the final objective. The greatest stumbling block is the current ownership and control restrictions, primarily in the US and European Union. These restrictions prevent non-US carriers from acquiring more than 25 per cent. of a US airline, and, conversely, in the EU non-EU carriers cannot acquire more than 49 per cent. of an EU airline. If these restrictions were to be removed, it would provide the opportunity for airlines on a global scale to merge rather than rely on the ever-growing proliferation of alliances, which are very poor alternatives and which should then be phased out.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para87"></a>Recognising the vested interests involved, these fundamental changes will undoubtedly involve protracted negotiations and will clearly not happen overnight. However, once this long-term objective is established, the airline industry will be able to begin the process of restructuring and reshaping itself to behave like other global industries and thereby meet the needs of its wide range of consumers by providing lower prices, higher quality of service and greater choice.

<P>
<A NAME="90309-05_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Montague of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, I joined Sub-Committee B at the beginning of this year, so I was not a member of this inquiry. However, by chance, when I was chairman of the National Consumer Council in the late 1980s it carried out a similar inquiry. It was therefore natural that I should re-read its report and compare it with that of the Select Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para88"></a>It is an encouraging experience. Of course there are a lot of problems and challenges ahead, also some very serious threats, but so there were nearly 15 years ago. <P>


<a name="column_147"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We overcame many of those and with open minds and determination I have no doubt that we shall do the same again. Indeed, within Europe we are moving towards internal liberalisation, just as is the United States within America.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para89"></a>One major disappointment, however, must be the lack of an open skies agreement between our country and the United States. Some European Union countries do have agreements with the US.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para90"></a>Having been the beneficiary of a great deal of deregulation, it is ironic that we have been negotiating with America for very many years. We need to be reminded that the major hurdle lies with America, where its domestic market is virtually closed to external competition. Restrictions, as we have heard, on foreign ownership of airlines and an important example of an old-fashioned concept. Competitive fares and good service are what matter to consumers, not which flag is on the outside of the aircraft. Indeed, one wonders whether the role of government in the airline industry should go beyond ensuring safety and competition. All kinds of industries are consolidating internationally and, frankly, it is a little naive that governments should remain determined to promote their national carriers in the air.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para91"></a>There are some things that we can do now internally to show that we are not merely paying lip service to the benefit of competition. For example, why cannot we declare open skies to UK regional airports? There is spare capacity at airports such as Manchester and it is quite improper that opportunities to grow new routes from the regions, and the considerable number of jobs which that creates, appear so far to have been sacrificed to the interests of our national carriers and the national airports.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para92"></a>As we have heard and know, one of the great problems is now slots. The growth in passenger movements is remorseless and it is an issue that we continue to shirk in the name of history and the past. I refer to "grandfather" rights. They were appropriate in the past, but just as every other aspect of air travel is market oriented, so should be slots. In my opinion, these should become a market, based on 10-year leases, with leaseholders having the right to trade them during that period. This should be carried out as a phased reform so as to provide reasonable protection to the airlines, which currently seem to believe that they possess the slots in perpetuity. The income from this market activity should come to the state, which has spent and continues to spend substantial sums of money on aviation matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para93"></a>There are also some further short-term steps which should be taken while we untangle history. For example, there are nearly 4,000 all-cargo aircraft using Heathrow airport annually, and it would seem sensible that these should be required to be routed to alternative airports, as should the non-scheduled private flights, including those which are chartered. I commend that for consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para94"></a>I also wonder whether slots should be destination- specific, subject to seasonal and demand considerations, as against airline-specific, which they are at present. The deregulation which we have enjoyed during the past two <P>


<a name="column_148"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decades has already been extremely beneficial in assisting into being the European Consortia Airbus Industries, which has broken Boeing's de facto monopoly and caused the price of the production of aeroplanes to be competitive and to keep this cost low.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para95"></a>Not all of our current problems arise from the past. The recent passenger tax, which I do not believe to be wrong in principle, has been implemented without sufficient thought to the totality of its outcome. I would remind the House that it is &#163;10 on flights within the European Union and &#163;20 on flights outside the Union. Therefore, Zurich, for example, is outside the Union and a &#163;20 figure applies. Yet the lowest single easyJet fare from Luton to Zurich is &#163;19. It can hardly be logical to have a tax which is greater than 100 per cent. of cost. I recognise that that is an anomaly, but it demonstrates dramatically how much wiser it could be to have a tax calculated as a percentage and not as a flat rate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para96"></a>Furthermore, the tax is of a once-applicable nature, although it is on a return flight basis, but only one-third of passengers going on the very cheapest flights decide on their return airline or flight. So it means that those who are in that category have to pay the return tax twice. The anomaly which the flat rate tax produces can be seen in the latest British Airways return cut-price flight to New York. The cost of that flight is &#163;143 and the tax is &#163;51, which is nearly 40 per cent. That is clearly an unreasonable amount.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para97"></a>Finally, I turn to the new young airlines which are playing such an important part in bringing down prices and helping consumers. Their influence is such that established airlines are having to be price competitive, which is very healthy. But some airlines which have got up to tricks in the past may be trying to damage unfairly their new young rivals.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para98"></a>When an existing airline starts what it claims to be a new airline offering price-competitive seats, it is extremely important that that competition is fair and not subsidised. We need to have totally transparent accounting in such situations so that we can be assured that there is no cross-subsidy by virtue of some of the expense of the parent not being charged to the subsidiary.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para99"></a>As I stated earlier, great steps have been made in improving air travel for passengers. We must be determined to ensure that none of that momentum is lost.

One of them has just sat down, but we heard a notable speech from the noble Lord, Lord Montague, to which I shall refer later. However, as one of the amateurs dipping his toes into this unbelievably complicated subject of fares and slots I should say first how grateful I am to my noble friend Lord Geddes and, above all, to his committee for producing this fascinating report.
<P>


<a name="column_149"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para100"></a>Secondly, I should declare an interest as one of that favoured group referred to by my noble friend Lord Geddes; namely, the consumer. My noble friend Lady O'Cathain would describe me as a customer and she is absolutely right in that. I shall speak as a customer.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para101"></a>My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale will attest to the fact that between 1984 and 1989 I made in the region of 1,150 flights. That was just within the United Kingdom and was sometimes with the airline for which my noble friend Lady O'Cathain has spoken and sometimes with other airlines. Currently I am one of the more frequent flyers in your Lordships' House since once or twice a week I fly to my home airport of Edinburgh, usually travelling from Heathrow. Perhaps I may give just one example of how airline competition, which is the main thrust of our discussion this afternoon, has improved, certainly in the 28 years that I have been coming to your Lordships' House. Just before coming into the Chamber I examined the A-Z of air timetables. I found that on any week-day morning there are seven flights leaving Edinburgh Airport for London Heathrow, London Gatwick, London Stansted, Luton Airport and London City Airport. There are seven flights leaving between 6.30 and 8 a.m. in the morning and seven in the reverse direction. I have not been able to check the figures, but in 1971 there would have been two or three at the most in each direction. In addition to that, there are three trains leaving Edinburgh between 6 and 7 a.m. Each of those provides competition. It seems to me that, in the air, the customer is certainly king.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para102"></a>I declare an interest in that occasionally I fly the Atlantic, but that is normally only on parliamentary business. Once a year, with other Members of your Lordships' House and the other place, I fly to Zurich, which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Montague. We do not necessarily fly to Mulhouse-Basle where one is flying to what I understand is technically Switzerland. However, one may obtain very valuable 50 per cent. discounts since that airport is considered to be within the European Union. But we fly to Zurich and I shall have more to say about that later.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para103"></a>I am particularly taken by paragraphs 103 and 116 of the report. I see that my noble friend Lady Seccombe is in her place. She also flies to Zurich with us. Paragraph 116 refers to competition providing a very good deal for the consumer. As my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale pointed out, occasionally the consumer may be wearing different hats at different times of the year. Occasionally one may be flying on a business flight and, occasionally, one flies with the family on a holiday flight. Indeed, those different aspects of the customer or consumer are catered for with increasing helpfulness by competition within the airlines.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para104"></a>My noble friend Lord Geddes spelt out the problem of slots, which are particularly crucial in the United Kingdom thanks to our geography; but they are affected also by environmental aspects as is shown in the ongoing inquiry in relation to the fifth terminal at Heathrow.
<P>


<a name="column_150"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para105"></a>I was fascinated by the discussions on the ownership of those slots. Indeed, I refer your Lordships also to paragraph 391 on page 100 in the evidence of the Minister and paragraph 418 on page 110, which was evidence given by the managing director of ACL. There are wonderful, disparate arguments as to who owns slots and who would control them. I found enormous encouragement in paragraph 415 as to the precise breakdown of the slots. I shall read that carefully as I sit in the aeroplane at Heathrow or Edinburgh being told that there is a 45-minute delay. I appreciated that in particular.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para106"></a>I was extremely interested in the proposals made by the noble Lord, Lord Montague, in relation to trading in slots. I have often read of that in my daily reading of the Financial Times which, perhaps among others, has some views on that complicated subject. I ask your Lordships to glance at paragraph 3.3 of the memorandum and the evidence which was given by Sir Michael Bishop of British Midland Airways Ltd, pointing out the enormous difficulty and importance of the various airports, and in particular competition, and allowing airlines to fly in the slots and the timing of that. Reference was made to the three major airports in Europe--Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt and London Heathrow. But of particular interest to me was paragraph 2.3 of the evidence given by that airline which referred to a flight which is extremely well-known to my noble friends Lady Seccombe, Lord Geddes and myself when we fly to and from Zurich. Your Lordships will see from the evidence that that is apparently the sixth busiest air route in Europe and yet, according to one piece of evidence which is to be found at paragraph 27 on page 10, that has been turned into what has been called a duopoly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para107"></a>I am careful in declaring an interest because when my noble friends come skiing with us once a year we are made to take part in a little ski race and we put on sexy little bibs. What do we find on them? It is Swissair. Therefore, I must be careful and I hope that they may forgive me in the year 2000. However, I hope that your Lordships will glance at the bottom of page three, which has a table detailing the cheapest available flexible business flights on some of those routes. What happens when there is competition? There was competition on the London to Zurich route. Your Lordships will see that in the three years from 1995 to 1997 the business fare went from &#163;202 to &#163;308. Evidently there were three airlines flying from London to Zurich. Now there are only two.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para108"></a>Thanks to a young lady in our transport office, whom I call "Kind Katie", I was advised this morning that the cheapest return business fare from London to Zurich is &#163;464. That is not lira, not drachma, not Swiss francs but pounds sterling. That may be an extreme example, but it is a fairly tough, hard-hitting example of what can happen if some arms of competition are removed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para109"></a>I am particularly pleased to see that I am to be followed by my noble friend Lord Mountevans. He is quoted in evidence as saying on 20th May last year that air travel prices have fallen so steeply that what once was the privilege of the few has become the facility of the many. I enjoyed his eloquent words then, as I do <P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para110"></a>I conclude by thanking my noble friend for the superb way in which he has set out the conclusions of his committee. I am not 100 per cent. sure that such views are a long-term solution, or that the Commission should have the final decision, but in the jungle of fares and slots I know that my noble friend and his colleagues will be my guide on any problems that I may have in the air or on the ground. I am most grateful to them for that.

<A NAME="90309-05_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Gladwyn: </B>   My Lords, long ago, in the mid-1960s, I was involved in international affairs on behalf of BOAC, dealing with bilateral treaties. So I suppose that my speech in today's debate could be described as the grandfather slot. It is true that, as a hereditary Peer, my slot tenure is precarious. But I suppose that Virgin Atlantic may consider British Airways itself to be a hereditary airline. After all, it is the heir of corporate generations with imperial origins.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para111"></a>The Select Committee, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, has produced a most remarkable report which is extremely instructive. It focuses on two proposals concerning the role of the European Union Commission, which are supported by the committee. They would grant the Commission greater authority in regulating extra-EU air services. Those are generally seen as a further stage towards an ultimate goal, the replacement of national bilateral treaties with treaties negotiated by the Commission itself. The recent legal actions initiated by the Commission show an earnest of its intent to proceed in this direction. Several member states seem to be wavering from their previous opposition to such a development, especially if the terms of their existing US bilaterals can be preserved.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para112"></a>It must be the case that the EU would have greater clout if dealing directly with the US. Even then, with the US being the hive of global aviation, with an internal market many times larger than that of the EU and producing the greater part of the transatlantic traffic, it would never be a contest of equals. However, on several matters the Commission might expect success, one being the fly-America policy for all US government carriage and another the method of agency commissions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para113"></a>Yet another matter is the issue of wet-leasing. That particularly affects the air cargo market. Air cargo is, in many ways, the Cinderella of air transport. Its interests often come at the bottom of the bilateral negotiating stance. The British air cargo industry is by far the largest in Europe, accounting for 70 per cent. of the business. Because the wet-leased operations almost always touch US points, the present rules prevent airlines of the British Cargo Alliance from competing in the global market with giant US cargo operators such as Atlas. In the world of air cargo, the trade is already going the way of shipping, with globalised freedom to trade.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para114"></a>Naturally, a European Union bilateral would enable all EU airlines to participate, which would be a great step forward. However, it is hard to believe that the US <P>


<a name="column_152"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would ever drop domestic ownership restrictions in totality, although I suppose it might lower them to the minimal majority ownership which at present pertains in the EU. The committee points the finger at both the US and the EU for having them at all, but, so far as I know, no other developed country in the world outside these two areas has opened its domestic routes to foreign owners.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para115"></a>The committee's report emphasises that the prime criterion in the regulation of airline competition must be the needs of the consumer rather than the protection of the airlines. We would all agree with that. However, in the context of this debate, the customers whose needs we should be considering are those who want to make use specifically of UK points, in others words, our own actual and potential customers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para116"></a>Of the total transatlantic passenger traffic, the UK share still stands at the surprisingly high level of 40 per cent. There is a danger that EU-negotiated treaties could have the effect of diminishing that share, as even Virgin Atlantic concedes. Traffic at present transitting UK points would tend to deviate to direct flights to continental points. Elsewhere in the world, if the EU were eventually to negotiate treaties with countries that do not accept open skies, the allocation of rights to specified EU points could further act against the total UK global share.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para117"></a>Dealing with the barriers to competition, the first identified by the committee is the system of airline alliances which have become such a dominant factor on the transatlantic routes. These enable US carriers to enjoy immunity from US anti-trust laws and so partake in collaboration on tariffs, timings, capacity allocations as well as code-sharing and so on. That would never have been permitted in my day, although it was commonplace on long-haul routes to destinations other than the US. On third and fourth freedom sectors those alliances tend to restrict direct competition. On the other hand, they tend to enhance competition on fifth and sixth freedom sectors by offering alternative routings.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para118"></a>Here again, surely we have to distinguish between our own customers and those of Europe as a whole. Faced with the realities of those alliances, and especially the Star Alliance built around Lufthansa in Europe, how can we reasonably expect to maintain our share unless British Airways can form its Oneworld Alliance with American Airlines as part of a renegotiated UK/US bilateral?
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para119"></a>The second barrier is the method of slot allocation at saturated airports, particularly at Heathrow and Gatwick, but increasingly elsewhere. I understand the logic that has brought the committee to recommend a slot system which would be regulated by government, rather than self-regulated by airlines. All the same, there is a certain contradiction in a system which envisages de jure free competition in the air, but at the same time imposes strict de facto control of it on the ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para120"></a>I appreciate the great apprehension of the major airlines, particularly British Airways, that they will be fatally penalised by such a system in favour of new <P>


<a name="column_153"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>entrants when, at the same time, they are battling with so many existing competitors, large and small. Much would depend on how closely the new authority made the decisions. To link slots to routes would be draconian. I note that in the US, although the FAO governs slots, in practice it is left very much to the airlines to trade in them. Surely that would be the best way to proceed. As to the ownership of the slots, I feel that even the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, would agree that the airlines who possess them can be described as tenants rather than owners. Perhaps the noble Baroness will remain in the Chamber until our debate on regulated tenancies, in which I shall speak.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para121"></a>The needs of the consumer must be paramount in airline competition. That is the message of the report. If that implies the provision of ever more convenient services at ever more attractive tariffs, there must be a qualification. The air transport industry will have to accept increasing concerns about environmental issues. These may well predicate future inhibition in airport construction and reduction in atmospheric pollution, and thus tend to restrict the capacity within which airlines are able to compete.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para122"></a>Generally, I cannot see that political considerations could ever be totally eliminated from air transport, even from bilaterals negotiated directly by the Commission. When it comes to the crunch, the Commission would be subject to heavy pressure among its members. Even if it was trying to protect the best interests of the EU as a whole, the interests of the airline consumer might sometimes have to take second place to some other interests, not necessarily those of aviation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para123"></a>From all this I conclude that EU bilaterals are a desirable aim for the future, but that until and unless they are agreed by the Council of Ministers, it is better not to grant the Commission the greater regulatory powers it is seeking because of the duality that would impose on an extraordinarily complex issue, as is already apparent from the powers that it has already acquired.

<A NAME="90309-05_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Mountevans: </B>   My Lords, as I listened to the debate, I wondered what a noble Lord of 30 years ago would have thought if he had participated in a debate on aviation, as it then was, with IATA to no small extent controlling the frequencies, the fares, the sharing of revenue between two airlines which are flying in a common pool, and even controlling air mail. If one could look back that far and then consider what has been said today, one would realise how very far we have come and what great progress we have made in the past 25 or 30 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para124"></a>I, too, congratulate my noble friend Lord Geddes, his colleagues, advisers and officials on a most interesting report. The evidence and conclusions give much food for thought, but, in this context, I am not yet persuaded to eat from the proffered European menu.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para125"></a>I share the belief that we have one of the world's most successful airline industries. Several previous speakers have given us the figures which confirm that. It is an <P>


<a name="column_154"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>industry which we owe to the policies of the previous government and to those, our entrepreneurs, who seized their opportunity.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para126"></a>Sir Michael Bishop has quoted me, just as my noble friend Lord Lyell has just quoted me. When I made those remarks last May I had several points in mind. I had in mind the fact that in spite of inflation, politics, taxes and many other extraneous interferences, air travel has become genuinely more accessible. Indeed, for many of us, air travel is good value. As my noble friend Lady O'Cathain said, it is important that we judge not the cost but whether we are getting value for money.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para127"></a>Thinking further, I can see some of the reasons for that. We have had liberalisation and thus we have had lower fares and seat-only charters. Low-cost airlines are now emerging. We have vastly increased efficiency and greatly increased yield maximisation, with the airlines responding to the commercial reality that a seat that earns perhaps &#163;150 is a far better proposition to them than a seat that earns nothing because an empty airline seat is one of the most wasteful commodities. We have also had technological change, with bigger and more efficient aircraft. Most important of all--I have already mentioned this--we have had the entrepreneurial skill which has capitalised on all those developments.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para128"></a>However, although our aviation industry is faced also with restraints, I feel that Britain's aviation industry has mastered many of them in what is almost a world-leading way. We may have lost the old empire, but we have done a lot to develop an empire in the air.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para129"></a>I find it interesting--I am sure that other noble Lords will find it similarly interesting--that KLM has seen fit to buy British in the form of what is now KLM-UK. More interesting still, I find it enchanting that a Greek shipping magnet, Mr. Iannanis, can choose to set up a low-cost airline here and can, as he announced last week, begin to extend his low-cost operations so that they are no longer Britain-centric. He is now setting up a base in Geneva and flying to other parts of Europe.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para130"></a>Looking at this from the consumer's point of view, I must admit that I was concerned 20 years ago that privatisation and liberalisation would restrict freedom of choice. At that time, there was considerable American and Australian evidence that choice would die. Of course, one would have a choice, but only in the rush hour when serious money was to be made. How wrong I was. Then, there were two airlines linking London and Stockholm perhaps four times a day and pooling much of the revenue; now, there are five or six airlines, with more than a dozen flights, and numberless fares tailored to suit both the operator's need to make a profit and the consumer's pursuit of value for money.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para131"></a>I have to ask myself if European--by which I mean Brussels--involvement would build on that success. I am not persuaded. Does a Eurocrat live in the profit-led commercial world? I doubt it. Our UK experience shows that civil servants can add value if, as gamekeepers, they turn poachers. The evidence given by Mr. David Holmes to the committee proves that, as does in another context John Welsly's contribution to the history of the railways in recent years. But I see no such <P>


<a name="column_155"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>personalities emerging from Brussels; rather I see penny packet interference in the railways and an attempt to gain irrelevant influence in aviation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para132"></a>For Brussels to put itself forward as a serious influence in the latter industry beggars belief when one looks at the state aid which has been mentioned by many previous speakers. To date, Brussels has permitted specific aid to national carriers of perhaps &#163;6 billion-plus. If I broadened the definitions--and why should I not, as Brussels keeps moving the goal posts, as we remember in the context of Air France last year?-- I could generate a figure of perhaps &#163;8 billion, which is a year's turnover for British Airways. What kind of a level playing field is that?
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para133"></a>Looking further, I see Brussels becoming involved in the British Airways/American Airlines association and in other global alliances whereby airlines seek to enhance their strengths, their service to consumers, and thus their viability. I also see Brussels seeking to interfere in slot allocation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para134"></a>None of those interferences gives me any cause for optimism; rather, I would like to see Brussels concentrating on its existing remit by levelling the European playing field. To quote Bob Ayling of British Airways:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Freedom of the skies means nothing unless the frontiers of the state pull back from this [aviation] industry". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
He was speaking of Europe, but he could have been referring to Brussels, the soi-disant umbrella organisation of European nations, or some of them. When Brussels has sorted out the internal market and levelled the playing field, it could start looking beyond. However, in looking beyond Europe, it must demonstrate its ability to add value not only for airlines and for nations but in particular for customers or consumers.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para135"></a>Banana wars are topical. On present evidence, I feel that European interference in aviation matters beyond the existing jurisdiction could be the biggest banana of all.

<A NAME="90309-05_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, as a member of Sub-Committee B of the Select Committee of the European Communities, which participated in the inquiry, I welcome the evidence and congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, not only on chairing the committee with a light hand but on the committee managing to reach a unanimous decision. As has been said, the evidence is absolutely fascinating. The whole report concentrates on medium-term issues. Nothing can be done this year, but I submit that many of recommendations need tackling now.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para136"></a>I should like to refer briefly to competition and the benefits for the customer because I believe that attention to the customer's needs has often been sadly lacking. Both throughout the evidence given to the committee and in this debate, competition is seen as a good thing because it reduces uncompetitive practices and is seen to lower fares and provide a better service. Many noble Lords have given examples. In theory, we already have open access and competition in Europe. Indeed, there <P>


<a name="column_156"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have been some wonderful stories, including that from British Midland, about lower fares, but the last time that I tried to go to Vienna, the cheapest ticket that I could find cost &#163;550 return; and if I wanted to change the return flight I would have to upgrade to club class. The noble Lord, Lord Mountevans, quite rightly said that air travel used to be the privilege of a few. However, if one is paying &#163;550 and one is not able to change the return flight, I suggest that that does not make it very accessible to most of the people who would want to buy such a ticket.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para137"></a>I am pleased that the Government agree with the general view that competition is a good thing and that airlines should be treated "as any other industry"--that appears in paragraph 8 of their response--using UK and European competition law together. One of the criteria or constraints that the committee spent much time discussing, and which many speakers have mentioned this afternoon, is slots. The noble Lord, Lord Haslam, said that ACL was owned by British Airways until 1982. In fact, if the noble Lord looks at the evidence he will see that the year was in fact 1992. So, up to seven years ago British Airways controlled the slot allocating organisation at our major airports. The company is now owned by 11 airlines.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para138"></a>I was interested in the criteria that ACL used in allocating slots. On page 105 of the committee's report, many different primary criteria are listed. I shall not mention all of them, but the first one is, "Historical precedence". We then get:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Schedule change, New Entrants, Introduction of Year-Round services, Effective period of Operation [and] Joint Operations". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
We then move on to the secondary criteria. The first is, "Size and Type of Market Served", the second "Competitive requirements", and the third,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"World-wide scheduling constraints e.g., curfews", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The penultimate refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Needs of the travelling public". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I do not think that I need say more. As many speakers have said, that is what needs changing; indeed, it needs changing fast.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para139"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, talked about the problem of predicting and providing. I am not persuaded that the UK's economic position would be adversely affected if we did not go ahead with continuing to predict and provide for time immemorial. As the Government say in their response, the constraints in capacity in the south east will stop us predicting and providing pretty soon.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para140"></a>I think that there is an argument for making airlines pay tax on their fuel because, after all, motorists do. Indeed, it all contributes to emissions in the same way. I believe that the revision of the European directive 95/93 on slot allocation on a European basis is urgently required. I suggest that that should include the removal of "grandfather rights" when you want to move routes. I believe that to be very important.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para141"></a>I turn now to the ownership restrictions which, again, have been mentioned by a number of speakers in the debate. The report recommends that all ownership restrictions should be removed as quickly as possible. <P>


<a name="column_157"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I accept that the UK Government have made some progress in the matter. However, as has already been said, the 49 per cent. restriction in the EU and the 25 per cent. restriction in the US is a severe barrier. Very helpfully for those of us who are amateurs in transport, this report defines the eight freedoms of the air in paragraph 44 on page 12. Members of the committee started off thinking that there were only five, but then, when we received more evidence, we discovered that there were in fact eight. Surely the objective must be that all countries allow all eight freedoms of the air to be applied to flying to or from their countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para142"></a>The Commission has to sort out the continuing subsidies of certain EU airlines. I agree that the "bailing out" which has been going on has to stop. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, said, US protectionism goes rather further. He mentioned the "fly-America policy". I did not know whether that would be helpful. I understand that this requires all US personnel, post, mail, "government carriage", freight, and so on, to fly in US airlines to and from the United States. If Britain or the EU had the same legislation, nothing would fly between here and the US without changing planes in Iceland, Greenland or somewhere else. It is a farcical situation. I believe that we should negotiate across the Atlantic, as in so many other matters, from a position of strength. The EU has the greater capability of doing this in the long term, if it is given the tools to do it. As has been mentioned, the British Cargo Airline Alliance estimates that British airlines are probably losing &#163;200 million worth of business a year because of the present situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para143"></a>I believe that the concept of British and "other" airlines is becoming very much out of date in this international situation. As the noble Lord, Lord Mountevans, said, there is no reason why any airline which lands here and brings in benefit to the country should not base its maintenance, its administration and, indeed, anything else here if it makes money. That is the key to the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para144"></a>I conclude that the European Commission is better able in the long run to negotiate agreements with third party countries. I believe that it should be permitted to do so. It is more of an equal size compared with the US, which is one of the major markets but not the only one. There is always a risk of other countries playing individual member states off against one another. The Government say that they are in favour of a more liberal regime, so I hope that they will move forward to encourage other member states to agree with them. I also hope that the recommendation that the Commission should negotiate as one body in a robust way with third countries, especially with the US, will be supported. The target should be full and open access with no ownership restrictions, and that should apply equally on both sides of the Atlantic.

<A NAME="90309-05_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Methuen: </B>   My Lords, I, too, should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, for introducing this debate on the Airline Competition report. It is always a pleasure to take part in these inquiries by <P>


<a name="column_158"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Sub-Committee B, which the noble Lord so ably chairs. From these Benches we are in general agreement with the thrust of the report. We think it sensible that the responsibility for anti-competition regulation should be transferred to the Commission. It is a matter of international trade as well as competition and, therefore, falls naturally within the remit of the Commission. We also believe that the Commission will have more clout in negotiating international deals, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para145"></a>Many of the present conditions in the airlines come about due to the historic tradition of a national flag-carrying airline, supported by government subsidies. Though this may have been a good thing historically on grounds of security, finance and air safety, it is not now true. Other speakers commented on the fact that certain state airlines are still subsidised and mentioned the committee's inability to gain evidence from one of those in particular.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para146"></a>I find it amazing--as indeed we say in the report--that in these days of global international companies there are, almost uniquely, such severe restrictions on the foreign ownership of airlines: 25 per cent. in the US and 49.9 per cent. for non-EU holdings in EU airlines. The result has been the alliances which have proliferated between international airlines. Whether those alliances are always of benefit to the customer is a very moot point. I wonder to what extent they will actually last because there has certainly been an indication of a relatively short life for some of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para147"></a>Our report highlights our concerns about putting the customer first. But there are numerous aspects to that, depending on who the customer is. The needs of a business traveller, a tourist or holidaymaker or, indeed, a backpacker are quite different. The business traveller is probably the least price sensitive, but is driven by the constraints of time and comfort. He may well be influenced by frequent flyer programmes if he has any influence over the booking of his flight, though that would probably be done for him by his company. The backpacker is concerned with getting the cheapest possible flight and will put up with awkward schedules and dates to gain that advantage.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para148"></a>Another impediment which has not been mentioned so far in the debate is the design of computerised reservations systems. There are some 10 major systems shared by the various airlines. Those systems offer the ticketing agent a series of computer screens showing the various airlines and their flight offerings. Research shows that about 80 per cent. of flights are chosen from the first screen displayed, to the detriment of those airlines appearing on later screens. The agent may well have a financial incentive in selling flights on those earlier screens. Hence it is essential for any new airline entering the market to be able to counter that problem, perhaps with the system having some degree of randomness designed into it as regards what appears on the first screen. Eighteen months ago the Commission proposed a code of conduct for these systems to tackle those problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para149"></a>A further factor mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, which affects ticket sales, is the load factor of the aircraft. As I understand it, after a certain <P>


<a name="column_159"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proportion of the seats have been sold and the flight date approaches, the remaining seats may be sold at marginal cost as all the fixed overheads of the flight will have been met.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para150"></a>I wish to comment on the vexed question of airport slots. As our inquiry progressed we became more and more embroiled in this subject. The question of who owned the slots was uppermost in our minds. I wish to quote from a recent Consumers Association report on airline competition which has already been mentioned. The USA rule allowing slot trading states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Slots do not represent a property right but an operating privilege subject to absolute FAA control. Slots may be withdrawn at any time to fulfil the Department's operational needs". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
A Conservative transport Minister in the previous government said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No airline has a legal right to a ... slot. Rather airlines have permission to use a slot and this must be subject to the public interest". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
It is interesting to compare this situation with the use of slots on the railways. Perhaps we should also consider the goodwill involved in this matter, although we accept that this is a far less tangible factor. This would seem to me to indicate a dubious case for the holding of grandfather rights for slots. As has already been said, the airport co-ordination committees which allocate these slots are made up of the incumbent airlines. One cannot help but think that they will tend to distribute largely in their own interest, and hence those co-ordination committees should be seen to be truly independent. As regards bidding for slots, as has already been said, I am concerned that if an auction is held, the wealthiest airlines will outbid the new starters. There does not seem to be any magic formula to solve the slot allocation problem. I shall await the outcome of the Commission's revised slot allocation procedure with interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para151"></a>Finally, I wish to discuss regional air services. The operational value of a slot to the incumbent airline is dependent on the route. We must resist attempts to separate regional and international services to different airports. Both Heathrow and Gatwick should operate as hubs for the convenience of the customer. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Macclesfield, said, we should have more regional hubs with both international and regional traffic. That would alleviate some of the environmental considerations mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para152"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, mentioned tax on fuel. I cannot help feeling that that would merely result in airlines buying fuel at the place in Europe with the lowest tax load, obviously having regard to safety considerations. However, we generally support this report and I have found this a most interesting debate.

<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para154"></a>I believe it is important to look closely at the situation we are now in, and how we got there, before we consider any changes to it. As has been made clear in the report and indeed in the debate this afternoon, civil aviation is something we in this country are particularly good at. It is one of the jewels in the crown. British Airways in its evidence points out that the UK has 1 per cent. of the world's population, 4 per cent. of the world's GDP and 8 per cent. of world output of air transport services. We have 40 per cent. of the total US/Europe air transport market. I understand that as UK airlines have over half of that, that means our airlines have nearly a quarter of the world's busiest intercontinental market. Heathrow is the world's busiest international airport, Gatwick is high up the list, as is Manchester, and Stansted is growing fast, as are many of the other regional airports. Employment in aviation and related sectors is enormous and growing.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para155"></a>Aviation is one of this country's great success stories and we should therefore be very, very careful before we agree to any proposals that may affect our position. One has only to look at the current threats to the position of the City with talk of withholding taxes, and to the art market by other proposals emanating from Brussels to know that we have to be on our guard.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para156"></a>So, how did we get to this pre-eminent position? We did so because the government throughout the 1980s and 1990s pursued a policy of encouraging competition that has been of great benefit to the consumer and to the industry itself. First, we allowed competition on domestic routes. We then privatised British Airways. We were impatient at the proposals for liberalisation coming from Brussels, so we began negotiating liberal bilateral agreements with other like-minded European governments such as Holland until the rest of Europe caught up. It is interesting, but not at all surprising, that those countries that pursued liberal policies now have the most successful airlines, while those countries that were eventually dragged kicking and screaming to liberalisation have the least successful, in some cases near bankrupt, airlines. The biggest threat to competition recently has been state subsidies to just those airlines. One hopes that this is now over, but I cannot help mentioning that it was the commissioner who would now like to expand his empire with these proposals who was responsible in a previous role for allowing these subsidies to go on for much longer than they should have done. The report is incidentally strangely silent on the issue of state subsidy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para157"></a>The effects of competition on fares can be clearly seen in the figures provided by British Midland in its evidence. It clearly shows that when there are three or more airlines on a route, fares fall. Take Frankfurt to Heathrow for example: between 1986 and 1992 fares <P>


<a name="column_161"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rose by 61 per cent. When British Midland came on the route as the third airline in 1992, they fell by 12 per cent. between then and 1997. Where there has not been a third airline on a route, fares have gone on going up, by as much as 46 per cent. in the example of Munich given by British Midland. However, I believe that just looking at fares can be misleading. As airports such as Heathrow get busier and busier, there is likely to be an increasing premium charged for the convenience of travelling from the most popular airports, particularly at peak times. What is important for the passenger is that there is a choice of price at all levels. Zurich seems to be a classic case mentioned this afternoon by a number of noble Lords. I, too, shall mention it. My wife came back from Zurich only last Friday on a scheduled Easyjet flight to Luton for just 46 Swiss francs, or just over &#163;20, which I think is a remarkable fare. Easyjet is now of course patronised by distinguished members of the present Government and they must be pleased with it, although I gather, like my wife, they only fly one way on the airline.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para158"></a>I congratulate the low cost carriers such as Easyjet, Debonair, Ryanair and British Airways' Go on what they are doing for the passenger. I thought Mr. van Miert was somewhat dismissive in his evidence of the low cost carriers. He may be right about the rest of Europe but in this country they are thriving. It is vital that the competition authorities keep a watchful and benevolent eye on their activities, or rather on the activities of their larger rivals.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para159"></a>So we have arrived at a fairly good situation in this country. In my view the role of government in this is to facilitate competition when they can, for example by negotiating liberal bilaterals, and otherwise generally regulating with a fairly light touch. Government should certainly not get involved with those activities that are properly the role of commercial airlines or airports and on the whole should let market forces play their full part.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para160"></a>Turning to some of the recommendations in the report, I note that there are no fewer than nine dealing with the old chestnut of slots. It has been a subject which has occupied nearly every speaker in the debate. It is worth remembering that slots only have a value when there are not enough of them to go around. This is obvious, but sometimes it seems to be forgotten in some of the wilder comments about the alleged iniquities of the present system. They are also only part of the equation when it comes to operating a route. There is the enormous cost of buying or leasing an aircraft, ground handling, ticketing sales, marketing and so on. An incumbent with all these things already in place is bound to have an advantage over a newcomer in all these areas long before slots become an issue. That is true of any business.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para161"></a>Since time immemorial, the way to deal with an excessive demand over supply, and where supply cannot easily be increased, has been to have an open market. I believe that the time has now come for that with slots. It is time to get away from the pretence that slots do not get bought and sold and to legitimise this trade. The report is somewhat scathing of grandfather rights and <P>


<a name="column_162"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>seems to believe that slots should and could change hands more easily. I believe, to some extent, that that ignores the enormous investment that airlines have put into their routes. It is also true that even though slots are hard to come by at Heathrow, there are airlines that were newcomers a few years ago which have, with patience and determination, managed to build up the necessary portfolio of slots to operate the routes that they wish. Obviously they would have wished to do this quicker. A legitimate trade in slots would facilitate this, but even under the present system it is possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para162"></a>If there were a market in slots, the issue of ownership would arise. As the report points out--and noble Lords have referred to this--no one seems to know who, if anyone, owns them at the moment. The reason for this is quite straightforward: it is because when the majority of slots came into use they had no value because supply was sufficient, and so the issue of ownership did not arise. In my view, on the old premise that possession is nine-tenths of the law, the user should own the slot. It is, after all, the airlines that have built up the business at the airport to the point where the slots have acquired any value. If new slots were created, by either the airport operator or air traffic control, they could be sold on the market, with the proceeds going to whoever created the extra capacity. Another advantage of a market in slots might be that an existing operator who really did not have to operate at the peak could transfer to a less valuable time of the day, or even transfer his service to another, less busy, airport.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para163"></a>If one believes, as I do, that the operation of market forces has been one of the main factors in the success of British aviation, then one would have to disagree with two of the recommendations in the report. The first is the proposal to allocate slots specifically to regional air services. During my time as Minister, I think it was British Midland which transferred its Liverpool- Heathrow service to a European destination. If I remember right, this was not done just to release the slot; it was done because the Liverpool route was losing money and the aircraft could be better employed on the European route. The decision naturally caused some concern locally, but I do not believe that there are many who would now argue that the decision was not the best one for UK plc overall.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para164"></a>It is also everyone's wish to expand direct overseas routes from regional airports, and Manchester has in particular been most successful at this. It is, after all, only a few miles from Liverpool. It is also common policy to encourage better surface transport, particularly rail, not least for environmental reasons. It is much better for UK plc to allow market forces to transfer a 50-seat commuter aircraft from the regions to a jumbo with 400 passengers from Tokyo, while improving rail links in this country, with, for example, a westbound rail connection at Heathrow. But that is perhaps a subject for tomorrow's debate rather than today's.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para165"></a>Another recommendation I cannot agree with is the linking of slots with routes and requiring an airline wishing to transfer a slot to a different route to put it in a pool to be reallocated. That would almost certainly result in a complete freeze on all movement. What airline is going to risk a transfer if it might lose the slot <P>


<a name="column_163"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to a competitor and end up with a 100 million US dollar aircraft idle on the ground? Surely it is precisely because airlines have been able to make their own commercial decisions in these matters that we have the success that we now have. The report is also silent about who, in both these matters, should actually decide these things. Are we going to have a whole new bureaucracy developing--no doubt subject to political interference--which will decide which regions should be served and which should not, and whether airline A is better than airline B to serve a certain destination? That would be a return to the type of licensing which we spent so many painful years negotiating to end in Europe. Much better to leave these things to those who really understand them--that is the airlines--which have to live with their commercial decisions day in, day out.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para166"></a>I am also somewhat concerned by what appears to be a proposal in paragraph 129 to nationalise the ownership of slots. I am sure that given half a chance the Government would like to get their hands on some more money from the travelling public--and I have no doubt that while I have been listening to the debate they have already done so in another place this afternoon. But I am glad that the Minister at least was very clear that the Government do not own slots.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para167"></a>Turning now to the negotiation of bilaterals with third countries, I note that the report concludes that, although the proposals do not provide the Commission with the mandate, most witnesses accepted that the proposals would have the effect of increasing, at least de facto, the Commission's competence to act on such issues. This is another subject that gives me some concern: because of our very strong position in aviation in Europe we have potentially the most to lose. As witnesses have said, if the Commission is unable to negotiate a truly liberal and unrestricted deal with a third country--and that will, I feel, generally be the case--then there will be winners and losers in Europe. For example, it would not be much use to British aviation if an American airline was given an extra route to this country in exchange for, say, a Greek airline getting an extra route to the States from Athens.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para168"></a>The Air Transport Users Council in its evidence said, at paragraph 17 on page 30:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The UK is an extremely powerful player in the world aviation scene and, with most third countries, is likely to be able to negotiate an Air Service Agreement that is beneficial to UK industry, the economy and consumers. While the Community is likely to be in an even stronger negotiating position, any benefits that it wins will be spread more evenly among Community Member States and there is no guarantee that the net outcome for UK consumers would be better". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Curiously it goes on to say in the next paragraphs that despite this it still favours the Community being involved in aviation relations with third countries. I believe that the Community making agreements with Switzerland and central and eastern European countries should be as far as we go at the moment. I also dispute the assertion made by some witnesses that the Commission is likely to be in a stronger negotiating position with, for example, the United States than this country is on its own. Where is the evidence for this? It certainly does not seem to be happening with bananas at the moment.
<P>


<a name="column_164"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para169"></a>The committee rightly stresses the importance of ownership and control as the real issue affecting airline competition world-wide, particularly in the European Community and the United States, and that removing ownership and control restrictions is a vital step towards a truly competitive global airline industry. I agree with that, but I would go further. I have already referred to the sorry saga of state subsidy, but while we still have state owned airlines operating in Europe there is always the danger of state subsidy. Those airlines also have an advantage over their private sector competitors in that the state is standing behind their borrowings, etc. Ideally I would like to see all European airlines in the private sector so that they compete on equal terms and all have to stand on their own two feet.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para170"></a>I appreciate that this ambition may take some time to achieve, as will, I fear, the wish of the committee that we negotiate with the US on relaxing and eventually removing ownership and control restrictions on US airlines. If my memory serves me right, this is not an issue we can negotiate anyway with the United States Government as it is a matter for Congress, which shows no inclination to change the law. Meanwhile in Europe we have to accept that some airlines--some so-called national flag carriers--may not survive the new competitive market, and that will be painful for some. Incidentally, while we do want to see ownership and control restrictions lifted, we do not want to see the emergence of flags of convenience, given their history in the maritime world.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para171"></a>In conclusion, I thank the committee for its report. I am conscious that in the time available to me I have not covered all the issues. I shall leave code sharing for another day. I also note that the Commission's proposals have met with little support from member states and were not taken up when we held the presidency in the first half of last year. I wonder whether the Minister can let us know the present position so far as these proposals are concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para172"></a>I also note that Sir Michael Bishop, in his evidence, spoke of the learning curve and said that the point in the process by which the Commission should take over all responsibility is a long way away. It could be, he said, five, 10, 15 or even 20 years away, and that the proposals the Commission would like to see enacted are very premature for the airline industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para173"></a>Any student of airline competition in this country, or indeed in Europe as a whole, will recognise that Sir Michael and British Midland have done more for competition than almost anyone else, so his words deserve particular attention; and I would certainly not disagree with them.

<P>
<A NAME="90309-05_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Select Committee, and the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, in particular, for a cogent report. This is not the most accessible area of policy within my department and I have gone through a fairly rapid learning curve myself in preparation for the debate. I congratulate the committee on illuminating some of these areas in relation to both aviation policy and competition policy. <P>


<a name="column_165"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I have the dual task of putting on the record the Government's response to the Select Committee report and of touching on as many of your Lordships' comments as I can in the process.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para174"></a>Perhaps I may start by focusing on the specific Commission proposals which originally prompted the Select Committee report. Clearly, the Select Committee has understandably and helpfully gone much wider than that. The committee's inquiry was prompted by the European Commission's proposals to amend regulations which apply the Community's competition rules to aviation. In brief, the Commission's proposals would extend the scope of the two regulations to cover services outside the EU. At present they apply only to intra-EU services. In the interests of simplification, I shall use the term "EU" although in some cases it would be more strictly accurate to refer to the EEA.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para175"></a>As far as concerns the political status of the original proposals and in response to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, I should say that there has been no progress on these proposals in that they were not supported by member states. They were not considered during the Luxembourg, UK or Austrian presidencies and, at present at least, we have no indication that the German presidency is likely to table them for discussion. Nevertheless, they raise some important issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para176"></a>As to the present situation, the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, referred to a "something" muddle and others have been even less polite. However, there is a certain clarity about the present position. The Commission already has sole competence for applying the EC competition rules to airline services within the Community. As the example given by my noble friend Lord Berkeley of the flight to Vienna indicates, there is still some way to go in that area. Outside the Community, competence is shared between the Commission and the member states under the transitional arrangements in Articles 88 and 89 of the EC treaty. On cases affecting extra-EU routes, member states have the sole power to grant exemptions under Article 85.3. But even there the Commission has a power of investigation and it may authorise member states to take measures to end any infringements it finds. An example of this shared competence is the continuing investigation into the proposed British Airways- American Airlines alliance which is being conducted both in London and in Brussels.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para177"></a>The full effect of the Commission's proposals would be to confer full powers of investigation and enforcement on the Commission, including the sole power to grant exemptions. As a result, the Commission would investigate and rule on all significant aviation competition cases regardless of what market was concerned. The member state most closely involved would therefore lose its locus except for participation in an advisory committee in which all the other member states would also participate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para178"></a>The Government believe that competence for the application of the Community's competition rules to aviation should move in parallel with competence to negotiate traffic rights. That is actually what has <P>


<a name="column_166"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 166</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>happened historically. The two regulations were originally adopted when a single aviation market in Europe began to emerge and their scope was extended to cover domestic services when such internal services were opened to competition. The principle of parallelism has also applied in dealing with third countries. The Commission has already obtained a mandate to extend the single market to 10 central and eastern European countries. As part of this process it will assume responsibility for applying the EC competition rules on service to these countries. This is entirely logical. The same will apply when the EU-Switzerland aviation agreement is concluded.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para179"></a>There is a clear logic in that parallelism, as a number of noble Lords have implied. However, the Commission's proposals would break that link. As noble Lords have said, for a long time the Commission has tried to persuade member states that it should negotiate on their behalf with third countries. In reality, we are principally talking about the United States. The Council of the member states has declined to give the Commission that mandate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para180"></a>The UK has been one of the member states resisting the Commission's request because in our view we can best serve the interests of the UK and of the UK aviation industry by negotiating with the US on our own account. Since member states retain the right to negotiate bilaterals with third countries, there is therefore no case for giving the Commission at this stage exclusive competence to apply the competition rules on routes outside the Community. If and when the Commission obtains a mandate and concludes a Community-level agreement with the US, the case for extending competition rules would be much stronger. The Government do not rule out that situation in the longer term. However, we do not believe that it is applicable at this stage. In other words, like the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, we adopt the St Augustine position on this matter. We need to think long term but for the moment we stick to the traditional position, which is supported by many other member states.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para181"></a>If we adopted the regulations as they stand they would extend Community competence into the area of external aviation relations. They include provisions which would mean that bilateral talks would be subject to oversight by the Commission. In effect, the Commission would be achieving some degree of negotiating authority, indirect and secondary though it may be, by the back door when we have not been prepared to grant that by the front door. That is the view of other member states--not just of the UK--and would include some of those member states which have been more sympathetic than us to such a mandate. The committee concluded that it would not support the Commission in negotiating bilateral agreements without a political mandate from the Council of Ministers. The Government very much endorse that view.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para182"></a>Perhaps I may look in a little more detail at the whole question of the EC-US negotiations. The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, said, probably in relation to this, that things have not changed much since his time as an aviation Minister. The noble Lord, Lord Bridges, <P>


<a name="column_167"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 167</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>referred to occasions some time ago when the UK-US negotiations were going on. Although the noble Lord, Lord Mountevans, is correct to say that there have been massive changes in the aviation industry, some principles do not change. It has been our aim for some considerable time to liberalise the UK-US aviation market. The question is whether bilateral or Community-level negotiations are most likely to achieve those aims.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para183"></a>As things stand, we believe that the UK has the chance in the near future to conclude a liberal bilateral agreement with the US, one which delivers the consumer benefits and preserves a framework of fair competition, balance and commercial opportunities for airlines in both countries. By contrast, whatever the theoretical or long-term benefits, a Community-level agreement would take some considerable time to achieve. One reason why several EU member states have so far declined to give the permission a mandate is that there is no agreement on the form that that mandate would take. While some countries, like ourselves, would support a liberal mandate, others would not be ready for their carriers to compete freely in business with the US and other EU airlines.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para184"></a>I agree with what several noble Lords have said that the US's own record is not exactly lily-white in these circumstances. The US has not pursued the pure milk of free competition in relation to aviation and in relation to the protection of their own airlines in regard to slots, landing rights, open skies and ownership. The Commission's present proposal, however, would envisage a dual process in which some countries would negotiate their own transitional arrangements with the US whereas the Commission would negotiate a long-term agreement. Whatever the long-term situation, that would seem impractical and would weaken member states' negotiating position. For example, in our own self-interest, the UK might have to hand over to the Commission our prime negotiating power--namely, access to Heathrow and Gatwick--for the purchase of restrictions or safeguards that would benefit other EU countries. Moreover, throwing our weight behind Community level action would not guarantee an acceptably liberal agreement. In these circumstances we prefer to continue to pursue actively our bilateral negotiations with the US.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para185"></a>I wish to make one further point in relation to competition. I mentioned the scrutiny of the BA/American Airlines alliance. At present, both the Commission and the member states have a role in applying competition laws on extra EU routes. I shall not attempt to deny that the current arrangements are potentially cumbersome. A one-stop shop would remove the need for co-ordination between two sets of competition authorities and the possibility of conflicting decisions. It might also reduce administrative burdens on undertakings seeking competition clearance. I certainly do not question the Commission's ability to take independent consistent decisions. But for as long as member states continue to negotiate bilateral arrangements with third countries they have an important role to play, and their role must be safeguarded. Their knowledge and understanding of the <P>


<a name="column_168"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>relevant markets are crucial for robust analysis leading to defensible competition decisions that are fair to all parties concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para186"></a>I now turn to the wider questions of airline competition which the Select Committee addressed. It is clear, as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and others indicated, that airlines are different from other areas to which competition rules apply. It is also true, as the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, indicated, that lower prices are not the only measure of the benefits to the consumer. As the noble Lord, Lord Methuen, indicated, there are in any case different kinds of consumer. It is also the case that consumer benefit is not the only interest that the Government have to pursue. There are environmental and planning considerations which also have their role to play.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para187"></a>In the EU, the UK has played a leading role in the establishment and development of the single European aviation market. Outside the EU, we are now seeking to liberalise our arrangements with other countries. However, we are inevitably constrained in some cases by the speed with which our bilateral partners are prepared to open markets. Last year, the CAA published a major report on the first five years of the single aviation market in Europe. While acknowledging that there was substantial room for improvement, the CAA concluded that on many routes competition had led to substantial price reductions for business as well as for leisure travellers. A number of major EU airlines have been privatised. Even among those that have not, there seems to be a growing recognition that a more commercial approach is needed. Those are benefits.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para188"></a>On the global front, major airlines are increasingly seeking to compete more effectively by forming alliances so as to reduce costs and be able to offer improved network services to passengers. As part of that process major airlines develop services at their "hub" airports, and operate an extensive range and frequency of services. Effective competition between airlines may take place nowadays, either head-to-head on specific routes or between alliances offering competing indirect services out of different hubs.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para189"></a>A number of noble Lords referred to the strong competitive position of the UK aviation sector. BA is obviously our major carrier, competing effectively with the largest airlines worldwide. But, uniquely in the EU, the UK is fortunate to have a substantial number of successful competitor airlines operating in the short haul markets, such as British Midland, and in the long haul markets such as Virgin. We also have an energetic and innovative low-cost airline sector, as the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, and others have said. We will continue to seek to open aviation markets wherever possible, to promote the interests of consumers and at the same time to maximise commercial opportunities for all UK airlines.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para190"></a>At this point perhaps I should respond briefly to the committee's points in relation to block exemptions. The committee was concerned that the continuance or any immunity of block exemptions from competition law should be strictly justified and in the interests of the consumer. The Government fully agree with the <P>


<a name="column_169"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>committee that any continuance of those block exemptions should be strictly justified in the interests of the consumer and the promotion of competition. The Government therefore support the Commission in its moves to withdraw block exemptions where they are no longer justified.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para191"></a>The other aspect of competition is the ownership and control of airlines. There are anti-competitive situations on both sides of the Atlantic. The Government agree in principle with the committee that the airline industry should ultimately be subject to the same competitive conditions as other industries. We agree that the traditional restrictions on ownership and control of airlines hinder the development of competition. Although within the EU national ownership restrictions have been broken down, as Community carriers may be owned by nationals of any member state, at the wider international level such changes can only be addressed on a reciprocal basis. We in the UK urge all our bilateral partners to adopt more liberal arrangements. However, progress can be achieved only by consent. That will mean that the break-down of ownership restrictions is likely to take some considerable time. Nevertheless, some bilateral agreements have been reached with other states.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para192"></a>I now move tentatively into the area of slots-- the "thick jungle" referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Geddes. The availability of take-off and landing slots and their related services is an important constraint on airline competition at any airport where demand is greater than supply. That applies particularly in the UK at Heathrow and Gatwick, where there are virtually no free slots at peak times. The process for allocating slots at congested airports is prescribed by European regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para193"></a>The committee expressed concerns over the current system of slot allocation and a number of noble Lords have repeated those concerns today. This is a pretty complex area. On the one hand, grandfather rights have their benefits. They enable airlines to plan ahead and to invest in route development with confidence. However, the time may well have come to question whether that is outweighed by the anti-competitive effect at congested airports.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para194"></a>It has been suggested that slots should be auctioned or traded between airlines as a means of supporting competition. Others believe that that would tend to favour the larger carriers with the greatest financial clout. Clearly there is an element of truth in that. Much would depend upon the overall package and the constraints that governments in the EU placed on the ability of airlines to buy and sell or acquire slots in that way. The Government believe that further consideration needs to be given to the implications of different regimes before they can reach a view on the desirability or otherwise of introducing some form of market mechanism into the slot allocation process.

<A NAME = "90309-05_para195"></a>A recommendation of the committee was that the Government should consider allocating a number of slots at major airports to maintain regional air services. The UK has already made proposals to the Commission that priority in the allocation of slots not <P>


<a name="column_170"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>claimed under historic precedence should be given to airlines that wish to use the slots for services to regional airports. The House will know that the Government are committed to developing regional airports and have made substantial moves to provide open access to all regional airports to bilateral partners on a reciprocal basis, and have relaxed controls, for example, on local authority owned airport borrowing powers so that we can develop airports such as Manchester and elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para196"></a>My noble friend Lord Montague raised a separate question, although it has some bearing on the competition area. It relates to air passenger duty. I am not aware of what has gone on in another place while we have been here. However, the situation prior to today was clear. The aviation industry is subject to relatively little indirect tax. The fuel used in international air travel is free of excise duty, unlike the fuel used in other modes of transport. As my noble friend Lord Berkeley implied, this is a slightly bizarre situation. Nevertheless, air passenger duty helps to offset that lack of taxation on aviation fuel and therefore broadens the national tax base.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para197"></a>In supporting APD, the Government do not believe that it indicates a disproportionate burden on air transport, nor do we believe that it is unfair to passengers. APD is payable on all departures from UK airports. It is different if we are travelling to EU or EEA countries where the APD is levied at &#163;10 or &#163;20 for other destinations. There is therefore a distinction between Zurich and Geneva in that passengers at Geneva, as at Basel, can disembark in France. Therefore, the EU/EEA rules apply, whereas in Zurich one is wholly in Switzerland and does not have the choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para198"></a>A number of other issues were raised in the course of the debate. Those matters raised by the committee give rise to serious questions in relation to the immediate period of competition policy in the UK and at EU level. They also raise issues of what the long-term position should be throughout the EU. As several noble Lords said, central to it is the fact that the aviation industry is one of which the UK can be proud. It is an industry whose development over recent years has put it in a position of considerable strength. We should make no changes which reduce that strength. We agree with the committee that airlines in the UK are well placed to cope with the challenges of the future. As noble Lords said, the increased competition has brought benefits to consumers and to Britain as a whole, as well as to British-based airlines.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para199"></a>There are existing restrictions which we need to change and dismantle. We shall look at ways in which to do so, but it will not happen overnight. We are committed to further liberalisation but we must be realistic that it will be harder to establish liberalisation more broadly than in the EU with countries with which we have less in common and many of which have national carriers to defend.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para200"></a>The European Commission will rightly continue to exercise an important role in regulating airline  competition. But as my honourable friend <P>


<a name="column_171"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Glenda Jackson explained in her evidence to the committee, we believe that those particular proposals from the Commission which gave rise to the report are premature. The Government, like the committee, cannot support proposals to extend the Commission's power to apply competition rules at this stage to extra EU services while member states continue to negotiate bilaterally with third countries. But we agree with many of the recommendations contained in the committee's report. I am grateful to the committee and to your Lordships for your contributions this afternoon. I have no doubt that the debate will continue.

<P>
<A NAME="90309-05_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Geddes: </B>   My Lords, following the correct statement by my noble friend Lord Brabazon, I too should have declared an interest and now do so as a non-executive director and very small shareholder in two small regional airports, one at Biggin Hill and one at Southend. I hasten to add that we have no slot problems at either airport so I cannot conceive that there is any conflict of interest, but I apologise to the House for not mentioning it at the beginning.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para201"></a>It would be invidious for me to try to comment on all noble Lords' speeches, other than to thank them most sincerely. The debate can best be summed up by my noble friend Lord Brabazon who succeeded in speaking from my own Front Bench for three minutes longer than I did in introducing the debate. That must show some degree of the interest that the subject provoked. If I may be a little naughty, I hope it may also show that on this side of the House we do not always speak with the same voice. So to say that we are all of one political persuasion in the broader context is not correct.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para202"></a>I thank most sincerely all noble Lords who have spoken, not least the Minister. His was an interesting and comprehensive reply which I wish to read at leisure and perhaps pick up points with him, if appropriate. I also specifically thank the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, who sat in for me in Sub-Committee B on a number of occasions at the end of last year when I was unable to chair it. I was and still am extremely grateful to him for taking that role on his shoulders.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-05_para203"></a>I can best sum up the position on which the committee found themselves unanimous by quoting from three paragraphs of our conclusions. Perversely, I start with paragraph 132 where we said that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Airlines have been afforded special treatment in the European Community's competition policy for historical reasons. We believe that these reasons are just that--historic. While we fully recognise the importance of safety standards and controls in the airline industry these should not inhibit the creation of a more competitive airline industry worldwide". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I then, curiously, go backwards to paragraph 131:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The true negative effects on competition within the European Community do not come from geographical Europe but from distorted competition between the European Community and other large airline markets, notably the United States". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_172"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 172</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Finally, I go back to paragraph 106 where we said--and we had no doubt at all, despite the wide spread of theoretical political opinion within the committee--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We consider that the responsibility for regulation of airline competition should lie at the highest practical international level. In the case of these proposals, this means the European Commission". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
We stated that. We believed that. I commend the report to the House.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para0"></a>There has been provision since 1969 for births, still births and deaths to be registered in both Welsh and English where the event takes places in Wales and where a qualified informant is able to give the information in Welsh to a registrar who can speak and understand Welsh. That arose from the context of the Welsh Language Act 1967.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para1"></a>This proposed Bill is an extension of those rights already in the statute. The Bill appears in the context of the Welsh Language Act 1993. As I have told the House on a number of occasions when dealing with issues of this kind, I was privileged until the end of last month to be chair of the statutory Welsh Language Board. I wish to acknowledge the assistance of the board and of ONS in the discussions that brought about the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para2"></a>The purpose of the Bill is to extend the provision to events taking place in England where the informant wishes to give details in Welsh. Under the original Births and Deaths (Registration) Act 1953, it is required that an event is registered by the registrar of the sub-district where it takes place. The facility to register an event bilingually obviously has not been available to Welsh residents. That has been a particular cause of concern for parents where births take place in England and also where the family of elderly persons and persons suffering death in England are unable to register the event bilingually.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para3"></a>The Bill overcomes the difficulty that might occur where the local authorities that administer the service in England require to do so bilingually by establishing a central register of births, still births and deaths occurring in England where Welsh speakers would seek bilingual certificates on payment of a prescribed fee. Welsh speakers will be able to make a declaration of the particulars to be registered before a registrar in Wales; the registrar will then send the declaration to the registrar for the district in England where the birth or death occurred and it will be registered in the normal way. The declaration would then be forwarded to the Registrar General who would record the details in the central register in both Welsh and English. That is the main effect of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para4"></a>There are two further aspects which I must mention. The first is to allow for certificates to be issued in Welsh or English. That is not possible at present. The Bill <P>


<a name="column_173"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provides for the issue of certified copies containing the Welsh-only or the English-only particulars from any bilingual entry of birth, still birth or death. Bilingual certificates will continue to be available, but the English and Welsh languages will now be placed on a basis of equality as far as this legislation is concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para5"></a>I also take advantage of this opportunity to put into effect the provision for short certificates of death. There is currently provision for short certificates of birth containing prescribed information extracted from the birth entry. There is no similar provision for still birth and death certificates. That is made available in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para6"></a>This Bill is a small piece of legislation which extends the existing statutory rights available bilingually. The ONS already has experience of central registers which are operated bilingually, in relation to surrogacy, abandoned children, adopted children and so forth.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para7"></a>I hope therefore that the Whole House can support this Bill, which operates within the spirit of the existing Welsh language legislation. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para8"></a>Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.--(Lord Elis-Thomas.)
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_time1"></A><H5>6.1 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Teviot: </B>   My Lords, it is a great pleasure to speak in support of the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, as I have been connected for a very long time with the registration service.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para9"></a>This short Bill will add lustre to the service. Thankfully, most of the original 1836 Registration Act remains in force. I think I am right in saying that certificates of births, marriages and deaths issued in Wales have always been issued in the two languages without any problem. The legislators in the 1830s were surprisingly enlightened and introduced various social measures, including this one.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para10"></a>Can the noble Lord tell me whether he has any news about the progress of the registration review which is now taking place? Especially, is there any news of the original 75 or 100 year-old registers being made public? Unfortunately, these records were not classed as public records in the Public Records Act 1958. I myself introduced no fewer than three Bills in the late 1970s and early 1980s for these records to be transferred from the Registrar General to the Public Records Office. The last time was in 1983 when the Bill, suitably drafted, was passed in this House, only to fail in the other place due to the dissolution of Parliament before the general election of that year.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para11"></a>This point is of particular importance to Welsh people because of the large number who have patronymic surnames. Genealogy and family history are of great interest and a hobby for many, but it is difficult to identify particular people from indexes. For example, in trying to find a John Jones or a William Jones living in a certain quarter of Merthyr Tydfil in the 1850s, one would probably find five or six in that registration alone. Open access to the original registers should make it much easier for people to trace their ancestors.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para12"></a>As we are on this point, and not wishing to miss an opportunity of this kind, I should like to point out to the noble Lord, and to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, who will be speaking later, that many of the original indexes in the local registry offices, as well the registers, are in a bad state of preservation due to age, storage and use, although it is now understood that such records should be kept in a proper repository. I am sure that for one reason or another this is very difficult. But do the Government have any plans for how to deal with this problem?
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para13"></a>To return to this Bill, it will be important for Welsh people living in England to record an event in their own language. It is important that people retain their own identity, and this Bill will help to fulfill that aim.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para14"></a>Finally, I hope that I have nothing to fear on the outcome of the registration review and that nothing radical will happen. The registration service rightly has a proud history. Please let it remain. A little tweaking is perhaps needed, but a major upheaval is not.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Prys-Davies: </B>   My Lords, I was delighted to see this very useful Bill in the legislative machine. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, for that achievement.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para15"></a>The Bill deals with what may appear to be a small issue, but it is an issue of great significance to a growing number of our Welsh citizens who wish to preserve their identity. The Bill confers a right and at the same time removes a grievance. As the noble Lord mentioned, he has recently left his distinguished position as the first chair of the Welsh Language Board. During his tenure of office one of his aims was to seek to remove obstacles and barriers to the use of Welsh in transacting official business. The Bill which he has introduced this evening will, if enacted, secure one additional reform.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para16"></a>The noble Lord has described the background to the Bill and has explained with clarity what it proposes to do. I believe that Clause 1 is the right way out of the problem which he illustrated and with which we are familiar. I am grateful that he has also explained Clause 2, which had baffled me at first reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para17"></a>I believe that the Bill is based on consultations with the appropriate bodies in Wales and that there is consensus on it in Wales. I am also grateful that the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, spoke in support of its contents. I therefore trust that the Bill will be acceptable to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para18"></a>May I say in passing that, since the Welsh Language Act 1967 and particularly since the Welsh Language Act 1993, we have seen a remarkable growth in the use of Welsh in official transactions and documents, and I warmly welcome this development. I believe, however, that we have to address our minds to what authoritative body there should be recourse in order to validate new Welsh terminology which is rapidly coming on stream. What is the place to which translators should go for advice? This question was first posed by Sir David Hughes Parry in his report on the status of the Welsh language which he produced in about in 1965. The question remains unanswered.
<P>


<a name="column_175"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para19"></a>I have been hesitant in raising the matter because it could be misunderstood. However, I receive letters on this issue from time to time from skilled translators of Welsh who think it is important that there should be a centre to which they can go for and obtain prompt guidance. I believe that this is also a concern of Cymdeithas Cyfieithwyr Cymru, the professional body that represents the interests of translators who work through the medium of the Welsh language.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para20"></a>These observations are not addressed to the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas; rather, they are urged upon the Welsh Office. I believe that there are many in Wales who would consider it a major contribution to the Welsh language if the Welsh Office put its weight behind the case for such a language centre. That is a case which has been developed elsewhere in detail. I would be grateful if my noble friend Lord McIntosh would convey that plea to his ministerial colleagues in the Welsh Office. If the case for such a centre still has no appeal, I fear that we may find ourselves worse off one day.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para21"></a>To revert to the Bill, I again thank the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, for introducing this Bill, which is a contribution. I hope that my noble friend Lord McIntosh will be able to confirm that the Bill is supported by the Government, that the House will give it a Second Reading and that it will have a speedy passage through your Lordships' House and another place.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Geraint: </B>   My Lords, my colleagues and I on the Liberal Democrat Benches wholeheartedly support the Bill so ably introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas. I remind the House that the noble Lord and I were elected to the other place in 1974. We both took the Oath in Welsh in March of that year. In October 1992 we were both elevated to your Lordships' House on the same day and took the Oath in Welsh. We are both Welsh to the core, and proud of it. We both believe in the politics of persuasion, not confrontation. That is our intent today in seeking to persuade the Minister to accept this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para22"></a>In the 1980s many politicians persuaded the then Conservative government to give the people of Wales their own Welsh television channel, S4C, which has now turned out to be a great success under the chairmanship of Mrs. Elan Closs Stephens of Aberystwyth. The people of Wales owe a great debt of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, for his uncompromising stand during the passage through this House of the S4C Bill. The noble Lord is well respected both in your Lordships' House and in his native Wales. We can only say thank you to him today for his endeavours.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para23"></a>We are also indebted to the previous Conservative government, especially the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, for introducing the Welsh Language Act 1993 which I believe is the cornerstone of the Welsh language for generations to come. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, on having chaired the Welsh Language Board with distinction over the past four or five years. Finally, I thank the present Government for giving the people of Wales the right to govern <P>


<a name="column_176"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 176</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>themselves. But what the people of Wales really need is their own parliament, with the same powers as those that have been given to our Celtic friends in Scotland. The noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, I and many other politicians in Wales are determined to see their dream come true one day. I wish the Births and Deaths Registration (Amendment) Bill well, and it is worth supporting.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_time4"></A><H5>6.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, this Bill also seems to me to be a useful reform. I echo the thanks of the House to the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas. I took the Oath in another place in the same month as the noble Lords, Lord Elis-Thomas and Lord Geraint, but in English. I took rather longer to cross the Central Lobby and take that Oath in English at this end, but I did so hand in hand, as it were, with my noble friend Lord Roberts of Conwy, who unfortunately is not well at the present time. The Welsh aspect of the Bill has been fully covered and appears to be satisfactory to the Welsh-speaking residents of England. I live in the Marches. We try to get along with our neighbours as well as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para24"></a>The other provisions have received a little less attention this afternoon, for example those relating to short certificates. I believe that they will be of equal assistance. People want to register a death, for example, when the deceased was a shareholder with the company concerned. On such occasions the cause of death is immaterial to either the relative of the deceased or the company. I believe that this is therefore one field in which freedom of information, otherwise supported by the Government, can be curtailed and less information given on the certificate. I support the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_time5"></A><H5>6.16 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, for bringing forward and explaining the Bill. It will be welcomed by those members of the public who are unable to avail themselves of the facility to have a birth, still birth or death which takes place in England registered in both the Welsh and English languages. It also extends the principle of equality of treatment of the Welsh and English languages, as promoted by the Welsh Language Act 1993. We understand the importance of being able to have a record in Welsh as well as in English of the significant milestones in family life, and we are pleased that the Bill extends the circumstances in which the Welsh language may be used.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para25"></a>The registration service has always been in the forefront when it comes to providing Welsh language facilities. It began to provide bilingual registration in Wales as soon as possible after the Welsh Language Act 1967 came into force. In 1999, when the people of Wales acquire their own Assembly, we are pleased that these new language rights can be provided. Before I leave this point, I should say to my noble friend Lord Prys-Davies that officials of the Office for National Statistics will consult the Welsh Language Board and the Welsh Office about the translations. My noble friend's comments on the translation will be <P>


<a name="column_177"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>welcome at the drafting stage. I shall ensure that both bodies are aware of his wider concerns about the quality of translation generally.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para26"></a>In addition to the very welcome extensions that this Bill makes to facilities for Welsh language registration, there are benefits, such as those referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Cope, for others who use registration services throughout England and Wales. Currently, with the exception of a shortened form of birth certificate, any certificate that is issued must include all the information that is registered, together with the details of any correction. The Bill contains order-making powers that will be used to make available other shortened forms of certificates, for example where the cause of death or correction to the information recorded in a register entry may be distressing to the family or the individual. We are aware of cases currently where families are concerned that death certificates containing intimate details of a loved one's last illness must be provided to banks or building societies when closing an account. We can understand the embarrassment that arises where details of a child's father have been struck out of the birth register and a full certificate highlights that alteration. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that any measure that helps to ease distress in such circumstances is to be applauded.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para27"></a>The Government therefore support the Bill which has cross-party support and seeks to implement one of the recommendations of the White Paper Registration: Proposals for Change published in 1990. That White Paper recommended a number of largely technical reforms of the registration service in England and Wales. Although some of the recommendations contained in the White Paper have been implemented, many remain outstanding. The fact that this route has been sought to implement one of the recommendations is welcomed by the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para28"></a>This Government are committed to the reform and modernising of the Civil Registration Service. The service has its roots firmly embedded in early Victorian legislation. The prescriptive nature of that legislation is impeding its development in the wake of social and technological change. The Economic Secretary to the Treasury has commissioned a review of the civil registration service in England and Wales by the Registrar General. The aim of the review will be the establishment of a framework for the service which is more responsive to the needs of modern society without compromising its fundamental purpose and integrity. I can say to the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, that it will include options about access to records and to the conservation of older records to which he referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para29"></a>The Government are pleased that there will be no charge to members of the public wishing to have events recorded in the central register. The cost to the public purse is likely to be minimal because there are already facilities--forms in Welsh and software--for registration in Welsh and English. There are also other centrally held registers which are already administered by the Registrar General.

<A NAME="90309-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his response to what has been a wide-ranging debate and for indicating the government welcome for this route, implementing proposals on the short certificate as set out in the White Paper, Registration: Proposals for Change. As the noble Lord emphasised, the measure will bring much comfort to families in bereavement.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para31"></a>We received support from the noble Lord, Lord Cope. It is always welcome in the Principality to receive support from the Marches. I am pleased at the cross-party consensus in this House on linguistic matters. It does not seem always to be the case outside the House. However I shall not go into that issue today; there will be other opportunities.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para32"></a>I was also grateful to the Minister for referring to the Registrar General's review of the registration service. No doubt it will reflect discussions on the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, to whom I am grateful. It is somewhat late to do anything about the Welsh patronymic issue at this stage. It is always possible to hyphenate names, but that sometimes complicates matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para33"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Geraint, for his wide-ranging discourse on Welsh history and politics. I have always appreciated his lead for consensus on important issues. I do not wish to digress to the powers of the National Assembly. However, the way in which we deal with primary legislation affecting Wales specifically will be a matter for some reflection in the future. I look forward to a developing relationship, through concordats or other means, between the Office for National Statistics and other arms of government and the Treasury and the National Assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-06_para34"></a>I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, for his intervention and expression of good wishes on my term with the Welsh Language Board. He was a strong supporter and advocate of bilingual registration for many years. I share his interest and concern in terminology and effective translation. Indeed, three years ago the noble Lord was responsible for preparing a detailed report on the subject for the Welsh Language Board.

<A NAME="90309-07_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Halsbury: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time. I do so somewhat nostalgically as I feel that this may be my swan song. Aged 91, I cannot believe that I shall be included among the 91 hereditary Peers on whom the axe will not fall in October, or whenever.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para0"></a>I begin by explaining how I became involved in this unsavoury subject. In about 1994, the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, finding herself overcommitted in the field of good works, asked me to take over a commitment that she had made which she found herself unable to fulfil. It was to chair a committee of inquiry into pornography, violence and the media. Being a member of the family child protection group whose chairman was the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, (then Dame Jill Knight), I felt that I could not take this matter on without her agreement. However, she decided to absorb that activity into the activities of her committee. So that was done. The noble Baroness was succeeded by the noble Lord, Lord Ashbourne, whom I am glad to see in his place. In due course we published the report.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para1"></a>It is no good publishing a report and leaving it at that. I felt that I was under some obligation to incorporate the recommendations of the report into a Bill which received its Second Reading in your Lordships' House in December 1996. It was overtaken in subsequent months by the impending general election which brought all business between the two Houses more or less to a standstill. During 1997-98, I was to some extent left on a free rein because I promised the incoming Government that I would not embarrass them with a controversial Bill during their first year of office; but that unless a measure was in the Queen's Speech preceding their second year of office I would resume my freedom of movement.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para2"></a>Accordingly, I embarked on a piece of research which had been on my mind for quite some time. Your Lordships may remember that a number of years ago an exhibition was put on by the police, I think in the Grand Committee Room, to instruct your Lordships and another place on the real bestialities which go on in the world of commercial pornography. In the course of discussions with a senior member of the vice squad-- I cannot remember whether that expression applies to this country or America--I asked why he did not attempt an ostensive definition of pornography. The word ostensive is a linguistic expression derived from the Latin ostentare, to show. One teaches children the meaning of nouns by showing them what they stand for. One says "dog" and points to a dog; and one says "daffodil" and points to a daffodil. That is how children learn their basic vocabulary. So I asked, "Why don't <P>


<a name="column_180"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>you make an ostensive list of all pornographic items which will appear in legislation?". He shook his head at me and said, "You would never come to the end of it. It simply could not be done".
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para3"></a>Being at a standstill in 1997 and 1998, I decided to find out whether it could be done. I made friends with the secretary and the librarian at the Royal College of Psychiatry, which has a prestige address in Belgrave Square. On my way to the House for Questions each day, I called in at the Royal College and did some homework in the library. Shelves full of books went through my hands. I turned to the indices and read them through until I came across a familiar term. I then turned to the text to see what it was. If it was what I wanted, I wrote it down. That is the origin of the schedule to the Bill. I commend it to your Lordships as at least a piece of research which will be useful on a future occasion, even if your Lordships do not like the shape of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para4"></a>I included in the Bill a preamble which, on the advice of friends, the Public Bill Office and the parliamentary draftsmen who advised, I have instead included in the text of the Bill. It may sound obscure, but I wrote as a preamble:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Whereas the young or the innocent at any age may by chance or through curiosity or seduction be led to peruse matter listed in the schedule to this Act, habitual recourse to which for the purpose of enjoyment may lead to corruption and depravity and their harmful consequences ... Be it enacted", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
and so forth. The essence of that appears in the middle of the Bill. If one ties the legislation only to corruption and depravity, defence counsel will turn to the jury and say, "You have read it. Do you feel corrupted and depraved?". Of course, no one feels corrupted and depraved by reading something for the first time. It is corrupting and depraving when one has habitual recourse to it for the purpose of enjoyment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para5"></a>I used two terms; "the young" and "the innocent at any age". By "the innocent at any age" I had in mind, for instance, a young priest or a novice nun who might be of full legal age but has never seen the evil side of life and might come across it by accident; left behind in, say, the dentist's waiting room.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para6"></a>Having defined the Act, I had to make a list of activities, which appears in the Bill, engaged in circulating the obscenities. It can be imported; it can be manufactured in this country; it can be reproduced by some photographic process after it has been manufactured; and so forth. It is another list.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para7"></a>In the context of those lists, I came across a legal doctrine which needs a little understanding because it is in Latin. It is, citatio unius exclusio alterius, which means that in mentioning one thing one excludes the other. It applies particularly to the relationship between species and the members which constitute that species. If you want to make a selection of members, you just recite that phrase. If you want to have the whole species, you just recite that phrase. If you try to mix the two and include the species and some of its members, you exclude all the others. I did not invent the doctrine; it is a legal doctrine about which I needed a great deal of help. By the time my advisers had finished with the Bill it was in a different state.

<A NAME = "90309-07_para8"></a>I have referred to this occasion as my swan song and I am reminded of a little jingle I heard when I was young:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-07_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Brentford: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Earl on his tenacity in returning to this subject once again and bringing it before your Lordships. He has been working on it for many years. I congratulate him also on his research enabling him to list in the Bill some 40 nouns and phrases. I further congratulate him on his opening speech and hope that the swan will continue to sing on many occasions, at least during the coming year.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para10"></a>The noble Earl said that, for him, the subject went back to 1994. I can claim that, for me, the subject goes back to the 1950s when my father, as a Member of another place, was a member of a committee which led to the Obscene Publications Act 1959. I have memories of travelling in our car to London with my parents. My father read some documents out aloud and my mother became highly emotive as we drove along the road, such was the language that was being read. Therefore, I have a remote interest to declare.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para11"></a>That legislation produced as a test "that which is likely to deprave and corrupt". The jury would be asked whether they felt depraved and corrupted by the material and counsel could wheel in sex therapists and sexologists to prove to them that the pornography could be helpful to impotent people and assist them in their sexual exploits. They would argue that it certainly did not deprave and corrupt.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para12"></a>Today, we must ask ourselves what values we wish to see permeated through the media and publications generally. Last night I watched a few minutes of a programme on sex education. It showed some teenage children who had indulged in sexual activity. Their parents were horrified by the fact that their son or daughter had met the person of the opposite sex only half an hour or so before engaging in sexual activity. Are our teenagers learning such values and, if so, from where? A television series about homosexuals tells a story of an adult male indulging in sexual activity with a 15 year-old (under-age) boy. I believe that that promulgates two values: first, that it is all right and positive to break the law; and, secondly, that sexual activity without a relationship is also positive and good.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para13"></a>What are the values that we wish to inculcate? Is pornography in any way contributing to our values? I believe that it is. It is a serious problem. Therefore, I welcome attempts to look again at this subject to see whether or not we can bring about some restrictions <P>


<a name="column_182"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which will enable publications to produce positive values and not what I believe are extremely negative ones.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para14"></a>We have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world. Is that a fact of which Parliament can be proud? We should be tackling this subject again. Your Lordships' House is perhaps the best place to begin that work. Whether this skilful Bill is the best way in which to carry forward that work is a question open to mind. I can see great advantages in it because if any charges are brought under it, it will be necessary to determine questions of fact rather than of opinion.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para15"></a>In the past few years there has been mooted an alternative phrase--that which is offensive to a reasonable person. Should a phrase along those lines be the basis in law rather than having an all-embracing schedule of activities? I was under the impression that the Home Office felt quite warmly towards that phrase as an alternative method of trying to tackle the subject again. I shall be interested to know whether the Minister has any views on that. An ideal way to tackle the subject of obscenity today would be for the Government to include a new definition, one way or the other, in law.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para16"></a>The phrase "that which is offensive to a reasonable person" leaves the issue clearly before the jury as to what would be offensive to them. It takes away the role of the expert sexologists who say that no pornography depraves or corrupts. It is purely left to the jury to decide. I prefer that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para17"></a>However, it is important to tackle the subject of obscenity one way or another to try to restrict it so that it is possible to stop the ever-increasing wave of obscenity which is hitting us from every direction. If our civilisation is to survive, we need to tackle the subject and curtail it so that we do not become one of the most depraved and corrupt nations in the world, which is the direction in which we are moving.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para18"></a>Therefore, I support the principle of the Bill. I look forward to hearing whether any noble Lord has other ideas as to the best way to tackle the subject. I warmly welcome the fact that the noble Earl has drawn attention to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_time2"></A><H5>6.43 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Annan: </B>   My Lords, I must congratulate the noble Earl on the charm with which he introduced the Bill. Anyone in his 90s, like the noble Earl, or even someone in his 80s, such as myself, has seen an enormous change in the nation's response to sexual morality. Things which were unmentionable in public, and just as unmentionable in the bosom of the family, are now bandied about in the media.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para19"></a>At the moment, it seems that we are a nation obsessed by sex. How did that come about? It is the result of 150 years or more of sexual repression. Towards the end of the 18th century, the influence of evangelical religion began to change public opinion. Restoration comedy, which was itself a reaction against Oliver Cromwell's diktats of closing the theatres, gave way to Sheridan's polite comedies; Fanny Hill gave way to Fanny Burney's novels. And then came the good Queen Victoria, who was repelled by the example of <P>


<a name="column_183"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 183</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>her loose-living uncles and presided over an age of sexual repression. We all know of Thackeray's complaint that in his novels it was impossible any longer to depict a man. We all remembered Dickens's great characters--Mr. Podsnap and Mr. Pecksniff.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para20"></a>Things relaxed a little in the 1920s, but right up to the Second World War the details of sexual behaviour were still taboo. Even then, books were prosecuted, films censored to a degree unbelievable today and the visual arts were policed for obscenity.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para21"></a>Then came the Wolfenden Report and the passage of the Obscene Publications Act 1959. The dam burst. Prosecutions of novels like Lady Chatterley's Lover were thrown out by juries and the new game was to outdo one's rivals in shocking the public. After nearly two centuries of repression, is it any wonder that there has been such a violent reaction? Is it any wonder that all sorts of people revel in the fact that now they can see or read about things for so long forbidden?
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para22"></a>I turn to the Bill. I was delighted by the noble Earl's account of the research that he had done, but I wondered whether he had read the report of the committee on obscenity and film censorship of 1979, Cmd No. 772. I ask because the Williams Report recognised, just like the noble Earl, that the present law is in a mess. Obscenity is not covered solely by the 1959 Act. A dozen or more Acts are involved--some prior to and some post 1959. In eight appendices, the workings of the present law were put under the microscope and the laws of other countries were examined. The report itself ran to 166 pages.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para23"></a>That committee considered that the terms "obscene", "indecent" and "depraved and corrupt" had outlived their usefulness in legislation. The law should be drafted on the basis of harm caused by the existence of the material in question. The public has a legitimate right and interest in not being offended, but harm alone can justify prohibition.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para24"></a>That means that only a small class of material should be forbidden to those who want it because it is not likely to cause harm. Moreover, the printed word should neither be restricted nor prohibited. It is not immediately offensive.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para25"></a>More important, the report argued that it would be an error to treat all the media uniformly. At paragraph 12.7 it stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No one can dispute that reading a magazine, watching a live show and watching a film are three very different experiences". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That was why, for example, the committee wanted a special board of film censorship to be set up.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para26"></a>The items to be banned were similar to those which the noble Earl cites in the schedule to his Bill; namely, sexual, faecal or urinary functions and genital organs and, in addition, scenes of violence, cruelty and horror. The restrictions should apply to matter or to a performance which is easily available. It shall no longer be a defence to say that an item had an intrinsic merit. As I read new Section 2A(4)(a) in the Bill, it still permits that kind of defence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para27"></a>The Williams Committee went on to reiterate that the principal object of the law should be to prevent material <P>


<a name="column_184"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 184</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>causing offence to reasonable people. Only a small class of material should be forbidden to those who want it. To carry prohibition further would be to go against the principle that an assessment must be made of the likely harm to people of an article that some may well dislike.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para28"></a>I hasten to reassure the House that I do not intend to summarise further the arguments and recommendations of the Williams Report. I merely wish to emphasise that to change the law relating to obscenity is a very complicated matter. The noble Earl's method of changing the law seems to be like detonating a landmine and blowing up everything. The Williams Committee preferred to identify targets and pick off those offending practices with a rifle.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para29"></a>I shall take one example from the Bill. New Section 2A cites certain exceptions to the kind of events that the Bill would criminalise. Among those is one provision that states that no offence would be committed if the article is published or publicly exhibited,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the interests of art, literature or science". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
These days the defence could argue that everything that the noble Earl deplores could be slotted under one of those three headings. Who has not seen pornography purporting to be a part of a sociological scientific study of certain practices? It is not only Lady Chatterley's Lover that would survive the accusation of praising anal intercourse. We have seen that juries will not convict simply because a book describes the kind of practices that the noble Earl cites in the schedule.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para30"></a>Finally, I cannot find in the Bill whether it would be illegal to simulate some of the acts in the schedule. We do not see coitus practised in films shown at the cinema, but we see it simulated all too often. If simulation is to be an offence, I believe that the noble Earl will achieve something far greater than Oliver Cromwell achieved, in that all cinemas would be closed and a good deal of television banned.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-07_para31"></a>Of course, I do not intend to vote against the Second Reading of the Bill, nor will I oppose it in Committee or on Report unless the Government decide to endorse the Bill in another place. I await the Government's view with considerable interest.

I want to commend the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, for his perseverance in bringing this matter to our attention for a second time. Many of us in this House and in the wider public are astonished that <P>


<a name="column_185"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 185</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the law does not have more teeth with which to deal with the horrific material that some of us have had the misfortune to come across. This is the first debate on the subject in this Parliament, so I hope that there will be a full range of views heard.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para0"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, has given us food for thought with this Bill. How can we successfully regulate the sensitive issue of pornography as we head rapidly towards the next century and when global technology allows hard-core pornography to be transmitted around the world in a matter of seconds?
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para1"></a>I am encouraged that so much attention in recent years has focused on child pornography and making sure that something is done about that particularly distasteful material. However, I am sure that noble Lords will agree that there is no room for complacency. It is a sad fact that pornography impacts upon relationships. It is stories of relationships damaged by this insidious material that convinces me that we cannot ignore the issue of what is and is not considered legally obscene.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para2"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, has adopted a list approach--favoured in principle by the police--for defining what should be obscene. I commend the noble Earl on the tremendous industry he has put into compiling this lengthy schedule. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that approach and the position taken by the Government on the Obscene Publications Act. I am sure that the House will have suggestions for refining the test proposed by the noble Earl and I shall watch with interest developments in Committee. Perhaps we shall conclude that a wide review of this issue is needed just as the Government has done for sex offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para3"></a>On a related subject, I am still concerned about the content of teenage magazines and the possibility of them falling into the wrong hands. It was brought to my attention that a 12-year-old girl purchased a copy of a recent issue of More. I understand that that magazine is aimed at 19 to 25-year-olds and falls outside the guidelines agreed several years ago for teenage magazines. That issue of the magazine contains explicit information which concerned the family of the young girl. Perhaps the Minister will write to me following this debate on how the teenage magazine guidelines are working and how to prevent younger girls from being sold magazines that are clearly inappropriate. Of course, it is not only girls' magazines that fall into the wrong hands. Men's magazines, such as Loaded, can also be bought by young teenage boys, which is as much of a concern.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para4"></a>I return to the main theme of the debate. I hope that we shall see some firm steps taken to reduce the amount of pornography legally available in this country.

<P>
<A NAME="90309-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for detaining the House by speaking in the gap. Your Lordships can console yourselves that if I had been in time to put down my name for the debate I would probably have spoken for longer.
<P>


<a name="column_186"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para5"></a>I wish to make two points. First, I congratulate the noble Earl on an enormously innovative approach to the issue. He confounds those who say that there should be a retirement age for your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para6"></a>Secondly, the substantive point that I make is that censorship of obscenity or pornography is often regarded and presented as a restriction of liberty. It is equally true that the results of the promotion and publication of obscenity and pornography can be a limitation of liberty. It can be a limitation of the liberty of women to walk dark streets in safety; a limitation of the liberty of parents to be confident that their children will not be the subject of a paedophile attack, induced into child pornography or seduced in other ways; and a limitation of the liberty of the taxman who has to pay for the cost of policing and punishing sexual crime and violence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para7"></a>There is absolutely no doubt from the evidence in America over the past couple of decades that there are strong links between pornography, sex crimes and violence. After a while soft pornography ceases to give the thrills that it did at first and people move on to hard pornography and from hard pornography they move on to acting out their fantasies. That has been proved again and again, and the evidence is now incontrovertible.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Annan, made great play with the 1959 Act. Things have moved on since then. In 1970 the US Commission on Pornography concluded that pornographic material has its cathartic value. By 1986 a great many members of that commission had decided that they were wrong and the Attorney-General's Commission on Pornography in the United States concluded that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"exposure to pornography produces an enhanced interest in deviant sexuality". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The process is referred to as "escalation". It results from the concept of normalisation--that is, the more you read about these things happening, the more you begin to believe that they may not be so awful after all and to say, "Lots of other people are doing them, so why shouldn't I?". One thus becomes desensitised. In any consideration of this subject, let us remember those who are today suffering from the crimes which arise out of pornography.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, has once again done the House a service in placing this Bill before us and in his great efforts of research and preparation. Personally, I should like him to remain eligible to take part in debates in your Lordships' House but, sadly, he is likely to be proved right about what is perhaps his swan song.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para9"></a>No Chief Whip would make suggestions about how one should vote on a matter such as this, even if this were not a Private Member's Bill but perhaps I should make it clear at the outset that the opinions I express are my own.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para10"></a>As has already been said, over my lifetime, which is only two-thirds of that of the noble Earl so far (in both cases), values have deteriorated out of all recognition, to the great detriment, I believe, of national life. As has <P>


<a name="column_187"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been demonstrated in the past few minutes, this House is very long-sighted, even if few of us can look back as far as the noble Earl and even if we can no longer see our collective future as clearly as we should like. It sometimes seems as if it will be impossible ever to reverse the process of decline and to raise standards once again. It must have seemed like that to many people in the last quarter of the 18th century but, by the last quarter of the 19th century, the pendulum had swung fully across, as the noble Lord, Lord Annan, reminded us. It was essentially public opinion, led by Queen Victoria and others, which reversed that pendulum swing. I believe that the time is coming when that will happen again.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para11"></a>However, the legal problems which have been discussed remain. Part of the reason for the decline in standards and values is that the limits were not fixed objectively but in terms of "tending to deprave and corrupt". As has already been said, the views of juries on that have altered as, notch by notch, the standards to which we have all become used have themselves declined. Competitive pressures on newspapers and magazines have led their proprietors and editors and, for that matter, television controllers to titillate audiences by ever more risque material both of a sexual and of an increasingly violent nature. The television authorities have proved reluctant to control that effectively, so that the boundaries have been pushed back and back, and juries have responded accordingly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para12"></a>Sooner or later, however, that process must stop--and it will take a change in the law to do it. As far as I can see, the best legal way of doing it is by something along the lines of this Bill. If the law specifically defines obscene acts by a list such as is provided in the schedule, it will be possible to enforce it. One can attempt either to pick out all those acts at once, in a long list such as is provided in the current Bill or, by the rifle-shot method of a short list, to pick off only a few items to start with. Obviously, that is a matter for consideration in Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para13"></a>At present, enforcement is very difficult. For a time, I was Paymaster General in the Treasury. I remember discussing this matter on a number of occasions with Customs officers and being shown magazines which had been confiscated at ports and airports. They were quite appalling. Customs and Excise had the advantage that the law on importation prevents the importation of indecent or obscene books or articles--that is not the whole of it, but it is the nub of that law--and that made it a little easier for Customs and Excise than for the police in comparable circumstances. However, enforcement is still difficult. Indeed, it is made more difficult by a European court ruling that anything which can legally be printed here cannot be refused importation because that is against free trade. The 1959 Act thus came into play even in Customs and Excise cases. It is therefore difficult for Customs and Excise also to draw a line and to know which confiscations by its officers at a port would be supported by a court. That is why I think that legislation such as this, and a list of the type contained in this Bill, will be necessary.

<A NAME = "90309-08_para14"></a>As I have said, it is a most difficult matter, but the principle of this approach has much to commend it. We should all be grateful to the noble Earl for putting this Bill before us and for restarting the debate in this form at this time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-08_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I too am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, for returning this subject to us. The issue of obscenity and the extent of the controls which it is appropriate for society to exercise over the availability of certain types of material induce strongly held views, as we have heard. As the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, indicated, this subject raises the difficult issues of morality and public decency. It relates to the relationship between individual interests and those of society at large. It involves difficult questions about the role and effectiveness of the criminal law in a society which all noble Lords who have spoken have described as changing rapidly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para15"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Brentford, asked me whether we were thinking of a test of what reasonable people would consider offensive. No; the definition of "reasonable people" is very difficult and we believe that "offensiveness" is a lower test than "harm" and that that test would therefore have the reverse effect to that intended.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ashbourne, asked me to write to him about a particular aspect, and I shall, of course, do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para17"></a>Perhaps I may turn to the faults of this Bill. I am not critical at all of the enormous amount of research and effort which the noble Earl has put into his Bill, but we have not yet considered the Bill. Most of the speeches have described a conceptual approach to the reform of the law, but we cannot look at law reform on a conceptual basis; we must look at the nuts and bolts, as I shall in a moment. However, perhaps I may first describe how the present law works.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para18"></a>As your Lordships know, that legislation is the Obscene Publications Act 1959. The test of obscenity in Section 1 is whether an article, if taken as a whole, is such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, to read, hear or see the material embodied in it. Section 4 of that Act--I think we should bear in mind that the noble Earl's Bill specifically seeks to delete that provision--gives a defence of public good. Such a defence is absent from the noble Earl's Bill. I am certain in my own mind that that is a deliberate absence because the noble Earl wants to strike out the defence. I am not criticising the noble Earl; he has done that deliberately; I am simply pointing out the consequences of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para19"></a>One needs to bear in mind also--this has not yet been touched on--the extensive powers of search, seizure and forfeiture that are available to magistrates by virtue of the Obscene Publications Act 1959. Several noble Lords have said that it is difficult to get juries to convict. That has been recited to me at first hand by senior officers in the obscene publications squad. Perhaps I may give the figures. In 1997-98, there were 275 prosecutions and <P>


<a name="column_189"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>189 convictions under the Act. However, that relates to proceedings before a jury. The powers of search and seizure are quite wide and extensive. If a magistrate is,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"satisfied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds for suspicion that, in any premises within the relevant area"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
that is his petty-sessional area--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"on any stall or vehicle, premises or stall specified in the information, obscene articles are kept for publication or gain", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
then a warrant may be executed, the material may be seized and an order for forfeiture may be made, with, of course, the power of appeal. So one can strike the commercial pornographer in that way. We should bear that fact in mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para20"></a>I promised to deal briefly with the scheme of the Bill and to indicate the view that I outlined earlier; namely, that it simply is not workable in any circumstance. Perhaps I may invite your Lordships to consider the detail of it. I do not apologise for so doing because we have not looked at the detail at all. I have in mind Section 2 of the 1959 Act which covers the prohibition of the publication of obscene matter in the way that the Act defined it and in the way that I have already cited.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para21"></a>Clause 2 of the Bill says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For Section 2 of the 1959 Act there is substituted"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
and then the rubric of "Offences" appears in the margin--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subject to section 2A below, any person who knowingly, whether for gain or not--
 (a) publishes,
 (b) distributes, transports or delivers,
 (c) provides for the public or private viewing of,
 (d) advertises the availability of, or
 (e) contributes financially towards the publication, distribution,
 public viewing or advertisement of, any obscene article shall be guilty of an offence". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I shall return to Section 2(1)(e) in a few moments to illustrate the dangers involved. However, we need to find out what "obscene" means by virtue of the noble Earl's definition in the Bill. We find the definition of "obscenity" as being that which is,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"set out in the Schedule". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
But no one has yet looked at the schedule in any detail. I must confess my own innocent ignorance in that many of the words in the schedule were not immediately familiar to me; indeed, they are not presently familiar to me. Nevertheless, I recognised one or two of them. The title refers to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"ACTIVITIES RELEVANT TO THE DEFINITION OF OBSCENITY"; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
we need to be quite careful about this. One of the activities relevant to that definition is:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Display of human genital organs". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
So Michelangelo's productions and drawings in life classes are obscene. Moreover, to take the matter a little further, a vast body of Italian painting is obscene. As we know, large numbers of paintings which are on display in both private and public collections do display human genital organs.
<P>


<a name="column_190"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 190</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para22"></a>The schedule goes way beyond the normal definition of obscenity that one would expect; for example, in the list we find:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Human urinary or excretory functions". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
These are remarkable propositions which need to be scrutinised with great care. I say that because I had not myself encountered the proposition in the past that urinary or excretory functions of the male species would be regarded as obscene if they were described or spoken about. There is much more damage here. However, there is something which is rather more lighthearted--namely, "Interlingual kissing". I am sorry to tell your Lordships that I had to seek assistance from my private office in that respect. I can safely say that apparently it is something which is as innocent as French kissing. But I am subject to correction from the noble Earl.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para23"></a>Let us move on to something more important:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Mutilation, torture or other acts of gross violence towards humans or animals, whether real or simulated". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Let us focus on that for a moment or two because it is serious. Would this apply--it undoubtedly would on this test--to any sober, scholarly work about the monstrous tortures inflicted in Nazi Germany upon 6 million Jews, gypsies and homosexuals? Let us consider it again:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Mutilation, torture or other acts of gross violence towards humans or animals, whether real or simulated". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Does that mean that a scholarly work about the Holocaust is obscene? I repudiate that. Does it mean that photographs which show the monstrous bestiality of the Nazi regime are obscene? Again, I refuse to accept that. Further, does it mean that descriptions in works like the Bible are to fall within the category of obscenity because masturbation or gross violence is mentioned in that work?
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para24"></a>Perhaps I may put to your Lordships a deeply sober and solemn thought. Does that wording mean that descriptions whether by word in the Bible or in the Gospels or in religious artifacts, paintings and so forth of the Crucifixion of our Lord are obscene? They would fall within that definition. I repeat it yet again:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Mutilation, torture or other acts of gross violence towards humans". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is not a blasphemous observation that I make; indeed, it is a deeply serious one.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para25"></a>There is a poet and playwright who is our national genius. I do not know where that definition would leave his productions--namely, "Othello", "King Lear" or "Coriolanus". Need I stop, or need I go on? The grossest violence, almost the most unimaginable violence, is portrayed in those plays. It is idle to say that it was a long time ago and that children can safely watch them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para26"></a>Perhaps I may be a little more lighthearted. Nymphomania is described as obscene and, therefore, any work of history--I believe that I am safe here--about Empress Catherine the Great would be in extreme difficulty. There is no reference to male over-indulgence--in other words, the male equivalent of nymphomania--so I shall not say anything about any possible records of current political life that one might or one might not be thinking about.
<P>


<a name="column_191"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 191</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para27"></a>Some of the points are serious, while others tend to be a little more frivolous. However, the point that I am seeking to make is exactly the one that the noble Lords, Lord Cope of Berkeley and Lord Annan made; namely, that it is not easy to get definitions right. If one has such an extensive list, which was certainly an eye-opener to me in the way I outlined, it simply is not workable.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para28"></a>The noble Earl was kind enough to indicate his assent by nodding his head when I put forward the proposition that he had deliberately, as his act of policy, so to speak, taken out the defence of the "public good". He does put defences in the legislation; but, similarly, they do not work. I shall spend a few moments explaining why that is so. The defence in fact is found in what are called "exceptions" in new Section 2A which says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No offence is committed under section 2"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
that is, the offence-creating section which I read out earlier--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if any of the conditions described in sub-sections (2) to (4) is satisfied". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The exceptions, or defences, are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The article is made for public viewing for education in matters concerning health, hygiene or medicine, and has been certified by the Secretary of State". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
So, far from reducing the power of the Home Office--and I see the noble Lord, Lord Baker, sitting in the Chamber, no doubt remembering the complaints regularly made about the Home Office wanting to interfere too much in people's lives--the Bill would require the Home Secretary to certify matter which is for public viewing for education regarding health, hygiene or medicine. That is simply not workable.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para29"></a>Subsection (3) of new Section 2A continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The article consists of a publication of a report of judicial proceedings or of any evidence admitted in such proceedings"; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
one can understand that. But then the overarching exemption follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The article is published or publicly exhibited--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) in the interests of art, literature or science"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
with no mention of religion, and--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(b) in whole or in part at public expense". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I shall spend a few moments on this analysis because it leads us to a position of unworkability, and really-- I say this as gently as I can--to a position which is nonsensical in this sort of analysis. It would mean that I could publish something in the interests of art, literature or science which would otherwise contravene the very wide obscenity test contained in the schedule. If I published it at public expense "in whole or in part", I would have a saver; but if I am a private patron and I am not funded by the public, I would have no saver. That is no way to litigate--or rather to legislate! It certainly would be a way to litigate. In fact my former colleagues at the Bar Council would regard this as a long running pension indeed! In the absence of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, "fat catterie" might well return to our land.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para30"></a>The provision simply will not work. I simply cannot understand why, if you publish in the interests of art, literature or science but not religion, and in whole or in part at public expense, you are saved, whereas if you <P>


<a name="column_192"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 192</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are a public philanthropist and are not funded at public expense you are not saved. Therefore the great private collections of the 19th century philanthropists would not be exempt from the measure, but the collections funded at public expense by the equivalent of the alderman in Beachcomber would be safe.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para31"></a>It is worth thinking about the following point. I am perfectly happy for it to be suggested that I am wrong in my analysis, but I do not think I am. If the Bible offends against the definitions of obscenity--I hope I do not need to repeat them, as I hope that noble Lords attended Sunday school and can remember them perfectly well--anyone who, in the proposed new subsection 2(1)(e),
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"contributes financially towards the publication, distribution ... or advertisement", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
of the Bible (for example, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge) is committing a criminal offence. As I said, I am perfectly happy to have my analysis destroyed but I do not think it is capable of being destroyed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para32"></a>I recognise that one or two of the remarks I have made have been rather lighthearted. However, there is something much more fundamental at issue here. The mere fact that some people behave differently to what your Lordships desire is not sufficient to make that criminal. There are many people who have different views on sexuality to what may be considered the norm, whatever the norm is. There are homosexuals, bisexuals and transsexuals who produce perfectly legitimate, respectable works of art or literature--I am not being patronising in the slightest--and who deal with their problems, their desires and their views in a perfectly legitimate way. It is not right to use the law to silence them. However, that is what this Bill would do.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para33"></a>I refer to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Annan, about the obsession--as it sometimes appears in this country--with purely sexual matters. There are many offences against mankind which are not related to sex. I repeat that I am grateful to the noble Earl for the enormous amount of research which he has done. That has rightly been applauded. I wish to be able to read accounts of the First World War, or of the conflict in Vietnam, or accounts of slavery in the southern states, or Lincoln's noble work before 1865. However, they are all obscene on the definition we have before us.

In so far as many of their remarks have been kindly disposed towards me, I thank them for that. It would be a mistake to think that I am at too deep an issue with the noble Lord, Lord Annan. He is a friend of mine and he has done the next best thing to what I would have liked, which is what I predicted he would do. Therefore I am grateful to him for showing me right on that score.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-08_para34"></a>I can give the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, a name for the male equivalent of nymphomania. It is known as satyriasis. How it escaped inclusion in my list I do not know. However, I am grateful to the noble Lord <P>


<a name="column_193"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 193</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for the correction. Clearly this Bill needs a Committee stage and therefore I must proceed with it on the assumption that it will receive a Committee stage. But what kind of a Committee stage will it receive? What I have done, as it were, to "keep the game going", is to write to the Chairman of Committees, the noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, to ask him to refer this whole matter to the Liaison Committee which is to meet at the end of the month to ask that committee how it thinks the Bill may best be dealt with; namely, whether it should be dealt with by a Select Committee of the House, or by a committee of inquiry, or something of that kind. In the meantime I wish the Bill to stand at this stage. I shall bring it back with a later proposal, either to refer it to a committee, or some alternative. On that basis, I hope that your Lordships will give it a Second Reading.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="90309-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office   (Lord Dubs) </B>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 8th March be approved.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this order provides the statutory underpinning for the six implementation bodies which the Fist and Deputy First Ministers agreed on 18th December and which were reported to the Assembly on 18th January and 15th February. The bodies relate to inland waterways, food safety, trade and business development, special EU programmes, language, and aquaculture and marine matters. They will be established by treaty made between the British and Irish Governments. The treaty was signed in Dublin yesterday by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State and the Irish Foreign Minister. It will take effect when my right honourable friend authorises the transfer of powers to the new Assembly. A copy of the treaty is at Schedule 1 to the order.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para1"></a>Your Lordships will recall that under the terms of the Good Friday agreement the two governments were required to make all the necessary legislative and other enabling preparations to ensure that the initial implementation bodies function at the time of the inception of the British-Irish agreement and the transfer of powers. This order, and the treaty, will allow the Government to meet that commitment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para2"></a>The House will also be aware that in January my right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced her intention to ensure that all the necessary legislative and other preparations for devolution were completed by 10th March. Again, this legislation is timed to allow the Government to deliver on that commitment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para3"></a>On the issue of timing, I should like to apologise to the House for the uncertainty surrounding the bringing forward of this order. I am aware that your Lordships <P>


<a name="column_194"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 194</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have had less time than usual to prepare for tonight's debate. As I hope the House will understand, however, the timing was dependent on negotiations which were only brought to a conclusion over the weekend.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para4"></a>I do not want to take up too much of the House's time with my introductory remarks. In particular, I do not think I need trouble the House with lengthy explanations about the various implementation bodies, details of which are contained in the articles and schedules to the order. Instead, I have arranged for an explanatory note to be placed in the Library of the House. Otherwise I would explain only that the order and its associated schedules deal with important matters as to how the various bodies will be structured and how they will operate, including their functions, annual reports and accounts, grants, accountability, finance and staffing.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para5"></a>There are two other points that I wish to emphasise. First, the order reflects the agreement reached between the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and the Irish Government about how the bodies should operate. The order and the treaty are the outcome of detailed discussions over recent weeks and represent the practical way forward for the agreement reached on 18th December. After devolution the British Government will, of course, have no role in the day-to-day operation of these bodies.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para6"></a>Secondly, I have already mentioned the timing of today's debate; it will allow the Government to meet their commitment to complete the necessary legislative preparations for devolution by tomorrow, 10th March. This was an important target date. This date was set back in January so as to ensure that we maintained maximum momentum behind the agreement. If your Lordships approve the order today, the legislative preparations for devolution will be complete. This will therefore be an important part of the process, as was recognised by the Front Bench spokesman for the official Opposition during yesterday's debate in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para7"></a>The leader of the Ulster Unionists also described the order as,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a significant step forward in the implementation of the agreement". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para8"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State had also hoped that 10th March could be the day when she would authorise the transfer of powers to the Assembly. Under Section 3 of the Northern Ireland Act 1988 she is empowered to do that if it appears to her that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"sufficient progress has been made in implementing the Belfast Agreement". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Regrettably, she concluded yesterday that that was not the case. As your Lordships will be aware, my right honourable friend announced that 10th March would not be the best time to run d'Hondt and thus appoint the executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para9"></a>During recent consultations with the parties, she had heard differing views: some wanted the running of d'Hondt to be delayed; others wanted it to go ahead immediately. All those who support the agreement remain committed to achieving full implementation of all its aspects as quickly as possible. All said they wanted to move forward on an inclusive basis. But, in the light of the differing views expressed, my right <P>


<a name="column_195"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>honourable friend concluded that if the d'Hondt procedure were to be run tomorrow it would not produce an effective Executive on which both communities would be represented. Some parties feared that running d'Hondt at that time might collapse the process.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para10"></a>In announcing her judgment, the Secretary of State also said that the decision could not be put off indefinitely. She therefore announced that she would be calling a meeting of the Assembly for the purposes of running the d'Hondt procedure no later than the week beginning 29th March; that is the week of Good Friday. This will give the parties the time and space to find a way forward. Many will be visiting the United States. There will be opportunities to build confidence and talk informally together, ready for an intensive round of discussions when they return to Belfast.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para11"></a>As my right honourable friend acknowledged, yesterday's announcement was disappointing. But, at the same time, with determination and courage on all sides, it is still possible to take the next steps to bring the agreement to fruition. We will be working closely with the Irish Government and all other supporters of the agreement to find a constructive way forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para12"></a>It is against this background that we are considering this order today. It will complete the legislative preparations for the new institutions under the agreement. The implementation bodies will, of course, operate fully in accordance with the terms of the agreement. This is spelt out in the treaty. Ministers in the North/South Ministerial Council responsible for the various bodies--or any additional bodies that they may decide to establish by agreement in future--will be fully accountable to the Assembly and Oireachtas.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para13"></a>Mechanisms to ensure proper accountability and transparency were included in the Northern Ireland Act last year. These include the requirement that the Executive Committee and the Assembly should be notified of the dates and agendas for meetings of the North/South Ministerial Council. And, of course, Northern Ireland Ministers will be accountable to the Assembly for their actions in the North/South Ministerial Council in the same way as they will be for their other responsibilities. By law, Assembly Ministers participating in the North/South Ministerial Council will be required to act in accordance with decisions of the Assembly or the Executive Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para14"></a>Northern Ireland Ministers will also require Assembly approval of any decisions that go beyond their defined authority; and any agreement in the North/South Ministerial Council which requires new legislation will require the support of the Assembly. Also, no agreement to establish a new implementation body can come into operation without the specific approval of the Assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para15"></a>What we have here, therefore, is a balanced package of measures to enhance North/South co-operation. The bodies will operate in a clear framework of democratic accountability, as defined in the agreement, supporting legislation and the procedures of the Assembly. These bodies, and any further bodies that may be agreed in the North/South Ministerial Council, will provide a foundation for close co-operation between the Northern Ireland administration and the Irish Government.

<A NAME = "90309-09_para16"></a>This order provides the statutory basis for the six agreed implementation bodies and is an important part of the path to peace in Northern Ireland. I commend it to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para17"></a>Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 8th March be approved.--(Lord Dubs.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   My Lords, I wish to congratulate the Government, Ministers and their officials on what must have been an extremely intense period of work which was very detailed, very delicate and very sensitive. It was carried out, as we learn, during negotiations, or reflecting negotiations, that extended even to two days ago. The First Minister designate and the Deputy First Minister--who, as we have just heard from the Minister, played an important part in the negotiations with the Irish Government--also deserve our congratulations. In consequence, they have all met the deadline established in the agreement for putting in place the legislative framework that underpins or supports devolution.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para18"></a>It was important that they should do that. It was important that the governments should show that they left nothing for later completion, not least so that Republicans should have no arguable case for claiming that either government had dragged their feet in implementing their part of the agreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para19"></a>Whatever one may think about the influence of mutilation or so-called "punishment attacks"--one is glad to note that they at least appear to have abated--by common consent one overwhelming element of the agreement remains unimplemented; that is, of course, the obligation on the paramilitaries to decommission. In the context of the Assembly we are concerned notably with Sinn Fein and the IRA. In that regard there has been a failure to decommission arms and explosives, and a failure even to commence the process. The argument is well understood--too well understood--and rehearsed and needs no lengthy exposition. I notice that in another place someone vividly encapsulated it yesterday by saying that one cannot claim to be a legislator in a democracy during the day and a field marshal at night. The reason is surely this: people cannot be expected to sit down and share legislative tasks and risk being told that they only yielded a point in an argument out of a fear that carefully retained weapons may be used. Indeed, there may well be a temptation to yield to such a threat. The Assembly must be rooted in confidence. The Assembly would not hold the confidence of the public were there to be any weakening on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para20"></a>Out of one's intense desire to see the agreement fully implemented and put in place and to see things moving on to completion, there is a risk of feeling that, because this is a single point--it may be described as a small point in volume terms--the issue can be fudged. I suggest that is not the way in which this issue should be regarded. Its importance is not proportionate to the text that it takes up in the agreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para21"></a>Although the Secretary of State put back the deadline for summoning the Assembly for the implementation of the running of the d'Hondt procedure until the week <P>


<a name="column_197"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>beginning 29th March and one must respect her judgment, Republicans must know--not least because of the stand taken and stuck to by the Taoiseach--that on this there is no more "give" to be had. There is no more movement--and, my goodness, there has been plenty--to be had from those representing Unionists in Northern Ireland. Nor, I judge, is there any movement from the two governments.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para22"></a>I look back over the years and note in particular the extraordinary progress of a political character that has been made in Northern Ireland and pay full tribute to the present Government's substantial part in it. However, I feel that it has been progress of greater political value to nationalists than to Unionists. It seems not only astonishing but also, I fear, deeply suspicious that it can be put to the hazard in this way. We all share in the intense hope to which the Minister referred that, in the breathing space the Secretary of State has accorded to the parties, the Republicans will do what from all sides--east, west and internationally--they are being urged to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-09_para23"></a>Meanwhile, when we are looking at the provenance of these new bodies, it is proper to recall not just the courage of Mr. Trimble and Mr. Mallon but also the earlier far-sightedness of the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux of Killead, who saw the value of Dublin and Belfast making common cause in areas of common interest--there are so many of them. He also saw the soothing value, if I may put it in that way, of putting north-south co-operation in the context of a geographically wider British-Irish relationship and the importance of making any new co-operative bodies accountable both to an assembly in the north and to the Oireachtas in the south. The noble Lord--it is only because of the shortage of notice that he is not in his place--and in part the previous administration were perhaps before their time in that regard. But I believe that we can all take much satisfaction from the arrangements that are before us today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-10_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the order and also for the background to it that he gave the House. I am extremely glad that it has been made possible to complete all the necessary arrangements by the required date. I accept the Minister's apologies and I agree that it was necessary to move quickly. The order certainly has been on or off. The disadvantage of moving quickly is that it is difficult to have full consultation on matters such as the lighthouse authorities which Mr. Trimble mentioned in another place last night. However, we need to strike a balance between the need to consult and the need to have the order in place today. I note that page 39 of the order, which covers lighthouses, refers to the need for further legislation. I hope that it will be possible to have full consultation beforehand.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para0"></a>Noble Lords will recognise that the order very nearly completes the jigsaw of implementing the Belfast agreement in full. We should leave no excuse for paramilitaries not to decommission. I am grateful for the comments of my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew on that point. Almost all parties to the agreement have <P>


<a name="column_198"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 198</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>met their obligations. They have all acted in good faith and the Secretary of State has bent over backwards to accommodate them. All parties have worked tirelessly, as my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew observed, but one piece of the jigsaw is missing. I refer to decommissioning. It has to happen and it has to happen soon.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para1"></a>I agree with the Minister's comments about starting the d'Hondt process. There would be no point in starting the process if we knew that it could not work.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para2"></a>We welcome the order. The Minister mentioned the need to maintain momentum. I totally agree with that. I hope that we can get the last piece of the Belfast agreement in place, and quickly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, our new Front Bench spokesman, my noble friend Lord Redesdale, had, unfortunately, when the debate was announced, already arranged to be in the Province. While that might seem to be a good illustration of the pulling power of the soon-to-be-devolved responsibilities envisaged in the order and the diminishing power of Westminster, I can assure your Lordships that that is not the case. It was merely the unfortunate shortness of time in the announcement of the debate. It has fallen to me to present the Liberal Democrat response to the order.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para3"></a>I reaffirm that we on these Benches remain fully committed to the Good Friday agreement. Although the process of implementing the agreement was never going to be easy, implementing it remains by far and away the best hope for continued progress in Northern Ireland. Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, we regret that so little has been done on the decommissioning issue and that it has been necessary to postpone the calling day for the new Assembly. Nevertheless, we wholly endorse the actions of the Secretary of State and hope that they may prove to be fruitful in this respect. Likewise, we wholeheartedly support the order, which descends directly from the Good Friday agreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para4"></a>I should like to pay tribute to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland for managing to reach agreement on the number and form of the six new bodies described in the order. Given the political pressures they have been under, and continue to be under, that was no mean feat. Coming as it did just before Christmas, its announcement was inevitably lost in the celebration of Christmas. That was a shame. The British and Irish governments also deserve praise for their part in facilitating the agreement, and in particular for fleshing out of what was a broad accord into the detailed proposals we have before us today. It is testimony to the diligence of those who have sought to detail every part of the agreement on the six bodies that we have such a volume of paper to support the order. However, it is the details that will determine the success or otherwise of the arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para5"></a>I should like to raise two small points relating to the bodies established by the order. First, with regard to the funding of the bodies, the order empowers the new Northern Ireland assembly to determine how much <P>


<a name="column_199"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 199</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>money it wishes to allocate to the new bodies. That is subject to the constraint set out on page 11 of the order that the bodies shall be funded in accordance with the provisions of the Good Friday agreement on the basis that they constitute a necessary public function. While that constraint is encouraging, it does not close off the possibility that funding for one or more of these bodies could become lopsided, with more coming from the government of the Republic than from the Assembly in Belfast, or vice versa. If funding were to become uneven in that way, it could influence the way in which the bodies operate and, perhaps more to the point, raise fears that it might do so. That, in turn, could retard seriously the effectiveness of the bodies. The best way to avoid that potential problem would be for the Belfast Assembly and the Dublin Government to agree that funding for the bodies should be split evenly between them. I welcome any comments on that suggestion that the Minister might have or any thoughts on his part as to how it is envisaged that the burden of funding the new bodies should fall between the two authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para6"></a>Secondly, I have a specific point about the new body set up to deal with the special EU programmes. The United Kingdom has a relatively poor record within Europe of taking up what is ours as of right. Opportunities to make the best of EU funding programmes have frequently been lost because the British Government have been unwilling to put up matching funds. These matching funds are often necessary before European moneys can be allocated. Consequently, no investment has occurred. With the role of procuring special funds from Europe being devolved to this all-Ireland body, it may be that the problem could get worse as the London Government are distanced further from the process. The further away they are in bureaucratic terms, the less committed London may become.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para7"></a>If that were to happen, it could be very unfortunate indeed. I do not need to explain how vital some of the EU special funding programmes are to Northern Ireland. I should therefore welcome an assurance from the Minister that every effort will be made to ensure that, where matching funds are required before a programme can commence, they will be made available when necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para8"></a>The order before the House is testimony to the fine working relationship that has developed between the British and Irish governments. I hope that the new bodies established by the order will benefit similarly from such a happy working relationship, both between the Belfast executive and the Irish Government and in themselves. They are an important beginning in establishing new relationships between North and South. From these Benches we wish them well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the support that has come from the speakers in this debate. The Government welcome the positive comments made.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para9"></a>Perhaps I may make a few brief observations. I very much agree with many of the remarks made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew. In so far as the Government have been successful in our policies in Northern Ireland, we have built on foundations to which <P>


<a name="column_200"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 200</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble and learned Lord himself made a significant contribution. That has to be acknowledged. When we took office, much of the groundwork had already been prepared; the noble and learned Lord had been assiduous in doing that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para10"></a>I understand and sympathise with the noble and learned Lord's comments about the need to meet deadlines. The experience of the Good Friday agreement and the various negotiations that took place indicated that setting Northern Ireland politicians deadlines means that they are more likely to reach agreement than if one gives them all the time in the world to negotiate. It was with that type of discipline in mind that the Secretary of State set one deadline--that was not possible; but that is why she set another deadline of about three weeks' time. It clears the mind and is a helpful way of encouraging local politicians in Northern Ireland to move forward from the position in which they now find themselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para11"></a>I very much agree with the noble and learned Lord about the enormous contribution made to the process by both the First Minister designate and the Deputy First Minister designate, and over many years by the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux. I am sorry that the noble Lord was not able to be present this evening. I also agree that fudging is not a helpful way forward. It will be very much up to the local parties in Northern Ireland to move forward. However, I believe that they understand the need to do so in a clear-cut manner.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para12"></a>I wish to comment about paramilitary attacks and beatings. Such attacks are appalling. The noble and learned Lord said that they had abated somewhat, and I believe that they have. However, as I said on an earlier occasion, one paramilitary beating, shooting or mutilation is one too many. None of us can be relaxed, and I know that the noble and learned Lord certainly is not while there are any such incidents at all, even though some abatement is clearly to be welcomed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para13"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, asked about the Commissioners of Irish Lights. It is a matter in which I understand the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, is also interested. Perhaps I may briefly explain the position. First, I warmly acknowledge the work that the Commissioners of Irish Lights have put in over the years. They have put in a great deal of work, and it has been very successful. I pay tribute to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para14"></a>The new Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission will become the general lighthouse authority for the whole of the island of Ireland. The change will require changes to the Merchant Shipping Act to make the body the lights authority. The lights function of the new body will continue to be funded by the General Lighthouse Fund. It will, however, take some time to prepare the necessary new financial arrangements and to consult the various interests before bringing forward legislation. The commissioners will be fully consulted and their experience will be invaluable in developing the new arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-10_para15"></a>The treaty and the draft order provide for enabling arrangements to be drawn up before the date of devolution or as soon as possible thereafter. I should like to say that that can be done within a week or two, but it is likely to <P>


<a name="column_201"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 201</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>take some months for these steps to be taken and the Commissioners of Irish Lights will remain the lights authority in the meantime. The new body will have two agencies; one for loughs, dealing with Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough, and one for lights. The existing staff of the Commissioners of Irish Lights will transfer to the new body and all their rights will be protected. The chief executive at the time of the transfer will be the chief executive of the lights agency. None of this, however, will happen until the Merchant Shipping Act is amended by primary legislation at Westminster. Clearly, there will then be an opportunity for consultation in the process of reaching that legislative stage. I hope that the noble Lord is reasonably reassured by that.

<P>
<A NAME="90309-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I am reassured. I thank the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may now turn to the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. She asked two specific questions. The first related to the funding of the implementation bodies. In the end it will be a matter for the two governments. It could be unbalanced as between the Northern Ireland and the Republic administrations. It may be that the best way, as the noble Baroness suggested, is that the funding should be split equally.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para0"></a>Initial funding for the first year will be a matter for the British and Irish Governments. Thereafter it will be a matter for the Northern Ireland administration, on the one hand, and the Irish Government, on the other, to decide on the amount and split of the funding. I hope that the various parties concerned will take note of the points made by the noble Baroness. It is clearly important that these bodies should have a sound and equitable funding basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para1"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about EU funding. She made one or two points which go rather wide of the order regarding the Government's approach to funding. I am not sure that I agree with her; however, perhaps we may leave that debate for another day. As regards EU funding in the context of this debate, it is essentially a matter for the two national governments. Both Governments, and the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, are presently negotiating with Europe to obtain the best deal for Northern Ireland. Additionality will therefore depend on the shape of the final programme. I could throw in words such as "Objective 1", "peace and reconciliation money" and so on. We do not know what will be the outcome of the negotiations. However, I take the noble Baroness's point that it is important for Northern Ireland, as indeed it is for the UK as a whole, that maximum benefit is gained from EU money. Indeed, the fact that an implementation body has been set up on this particular point makes it clear that both Northern Ireland politicians and politicians in the Republic regard the issue as important.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para2"></a>I repeat my thanks for the support that we have received. This is an important step on the way to long-term and permanent peace in Northern Ireland. I commend the order to the House.

<A NAME="90309-11_spopq0"></A><B> The Earl of Lytton </B>  rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will reconsider their proposals to limit fair rent increases following the Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/6) so that, in addition to necessary protection for tenants, private landlords will be able to obtain a fair return on property subject to regulated rents.
<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para4"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords who put their names down for this debate. First, I should declare some interests. I am joint landlord of some shorthold lettings and have two Rent Act protected tenants in properties that have been in my family for generations. I am also a shorthold tenant myself, paying, as all tenants think, an outrageously high rent. I must declare an interest as the unpaid non-executive chairman of an advisory service which mainly advises long leasehold tenants. However, I speak not from those interests but as a practising chartered surveyor.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para5"></a>The issue I raise relates to the capping of fair rents under the order referred to in the Question. I thank the Minister for allowing me to come to see him the other day. I hope he recognises that my concerns are not personal or political but technical.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para6"></a>I know that there are some bad abuses in the private rented sector. However, I wish to concentrate on the philosophy and technicalities relating to fair rents. Also, knowing the problems of inner-city areas, I want to draw away from that somewhat because in the wider world of the counties outside fair rent situations also arise.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para7"></a>I am sure that the House is well aware of the provisions relating to fair rents as set out in Section 70 of the Rent Act 1977 and the role of the rent officer in fixing and registering those rents. I am also certain that the House is aware that fair rents are not defined but are supposed to be fixed,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"having regard to all the circumstances", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para8"></a>of which the market must be one. There is an assumption that scarcity is to be eliminated or, put another way, the system assumes that demand does not materially exceed supply. That does not mean demand or supply at any price.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para9"></a>For many years, rent officers after 1965 had little evidence to go on beyond their own previously determined rents. The effects of rent control on security of tenure had largely destroyed the private rented sector. That remained the case for about 23 years until 1988 when, under new legislation, landlords could once again let properties at market rates.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para10"></a>It became clear, as time went on after 1988, that fair rents and market rents were often far apart. So much so that fair rents were frequently criticised. In the fullness of time, fair rents went up and were felt most acutely in some of the urban sectors where market values had increased most.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para11"></a>More recently, there have been court cases such as the Spath Holme case that reaffirmed what was understood in some areas as being market rent less a percentage, compared with the previous basis adopted <P>


<a name="column_203"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by rent officers of previous registered rent plus a bit, if I may paraphrase it that way. Arguably, the increases resulting were very severe in some cases. But, equally arguably, it was a process of readjustment caused by years of control of the market. It is interesting to note that rental increases seem now to be tailing off, but perhaps it is too early to draw a firm conclusion.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para12"></a>Rent regulation has had the effect of wiping off significant amounts of freehold value. The Government's own figures suggest 40 per cent. Interestingly, security of tenure alone in the commercial sector never did that. Fair rents are reckoned to be about 55 per cent. of open-market rents or, in other words, a 45 per cent. discount. Again, I have drawn on the Government's figures for that. This is quite high, given that in many parts of the country--and I am talking particularly about the counties rather than the metropolitan areas--there seems to be no shortage of residential properties to let, as evidenced by the large number of residential letting agents that seem to be springing up everywhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para13"></a>Accordingly, we have the anomalous situation where a category of tenant with a large measure of protection pays in general a very substantially lower rent than the unprotected tenant of a similar property is willing to pay in the open market. I find that rather curious.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para14"></a>As well as protecting tenants from excessive rent levels, fair rents need to produce a proper return to ensure that the property is adequately cared for. This has to cover not only the recurring costs of maintenance and outgoings but also periodic upgrading and improvement; at least, that must be the case if the accommodation is not to become obsolescent. If in some cases we are dealing with a number of ageing tenants, it seems to me to be right that the general condition and standards of a dwelling have to be kept up for that reason alone.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para15"></a>However, the reality is unfortunately that rent officers often attach very little importance in rental terms to such things as double-glazing, insulation, central heating, kitchen modernisation and so on, but are inclined to consider those as being a normal service of the landlord, to be paid for out of the normal rent; that is despite the specific provisions of Section 70(4) of the Rent Act 1977.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para16"></a>I have received information relating to the upgrading of flats, for example, where only tiny increases have been awarded after significant expense. My concern is that it does not reward the care and maintenance of the property or respect the interests of the tenants.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para17"></a>As the Minister knows, I had some concerns about the terminology used in the consultation paper that preceded the order being laid. First, it implied that the freeholds of fair rented property had in general been acquired by speculators with the aim of a capital gain. But certainly I could not find any evidence that that was generally the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para18"></a>Secondly, it identified the problems of fair rent increase as being principally the responsibility of private landlords rather than a complex and interactive web of causes, including the broader economic issues and, not <P>


<a name="column_204"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 204</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>least, the mismatch between the regulated and free market rents. So I felt that the situation had not been presented fairly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para19"></a>Thirdly--and this goes to the substance of the operation of the order itself--it was suggested that under the proposals fair rents would,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"continue to move closer to market rent levels where appropriate". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para20"></a>However, I could not see that that would happen in practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para21"></a>On the first point, I feel that the Government need to present the evidence. If there is none, then the claims made are wrong. But if there is the evidence, let us have it. I cannot find it. But if speculative activity is frowned on, then it cannot be used as it has been to justify low returns on the ground that there will be a capital gain when the tenant dies or moves. It is impossible to have it both ways.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para22"></a>For a true investor, realisable vacant value may have little to do with the current account return on the investment, especially if there is no intention to sell anyway. Not all regulated tenants are that old either; many, thankfully, have 30 or 40 years left to look forward to.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para23"></a>So the need is for a long-term sustainable situation that covers both sides. I felt that only one side had been presented. Clearly, when the market is interfered with there will be problems of adjustment later on. The small size of the sector does not make it a legitimate target, nor does it alter the need for balance, fairness and justice when presenting the issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para24"></a>I shall deal briefly with some of the effects, but as noble Lords will know, the proposals in the order would take the increase in fair rents to a maximum figure initially, on re-registration of existing registered rent, of retail prices index plus 7&#189; per cent., and thereafter RPI plus 5 per cent. on any subsequent re-registration. Obviously, if the fair rent comes out at lower than that figure, it will be the rent that is registered. But if it is the cap, then it is the cap that is registered. Rents can be re-registered every two years. Taking in the longer term a 5 per cent. cap plus RPI, we are talking about RPI plus about 2&#189; per cent. a year.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para25"></a>My concern is that after the 5 per cent. is applied and if the cap applies, that forms the benchmark for future calculations as to whether the cap should apply thereafter. So the effects are cumulative, unless I have misunderstood the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para26"></a>It must be obvious that the proposals are incapable of converging fair rents and market rents, as suggested in the consultation paper. The British Property Federation, for example, worked out that on the most optimistic count it would take 24 years for convergence to be achieved, assuming inflation only and no real growth in property values. On any other assessment there would be divergence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para27"></a>Increases in rent due to landlords' expenditure on improvements are to be allowed, but it has to be said that they must make more than a 15 per cent. difference in rent. But there must be a great deal of improvement to get any increase in fair rent at all, quite apart from the usual arguments about what constitutes improvement, as <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>I have already suggested. I find it difficult to think of any organisation that will invest seriously on those low levels in something as complex as a dwelling house. It is too chancy with the cost of repairs, renewals, insurance and other factors.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para28"></a>That means that if there is a need to invest in a rundown area, it will simply not be worth the while of the private landlord to do it. I must warn that that risks a return to a downward spiral of unwillingness to invest, in other words de facto disinvestment. That is one of my great fears.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para29"></a>All that imports into the fixing of fair rents the concept of affordability. The Minister may dispute that, but it is the essence of the phrase in paragraph 2.4 in the consultation paper which states--and I paraphrase--that many tenants are elderly and on fixed incomes. They have planned their affairs on the basis that they would be able to remain in their present homes.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para30"></a>I do not doubt the sincerity of the Government's views on social justice. But they seem to be doing that by overriding the principle that the maximum a landlord can receive is a fair rent fixed by the duly authorised officer. They do so by secondary legislation on grounds which specifically override the provisions of the 1977 Act, even to the point of dictating what goes on the rent register. The grounds clearly include some notion of personal circumstances relating to tenants--something that the same Act specifically excludes from consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para31"></a>There are very good reasons to converge the fair rents and the market rents, not necessarily to make them meet as one but at least to remove some of the discriminatory effects and the divergence which particularly affects classes of property owner and creates anomalies. There are certainly good reasons to insist on higher standards of conduct from landlords, but I think that the effect of the order will, if anything, be to drive the conscientious from the market. If there is no hope of a proper return, then the conscientious move out and the speculators move in, for some entirely improper purpose: they always seem to do so. The matters of which the consultation paper complains will become more rather than less likely.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para32"></a>Whatever one's views on fair rents--and I happen to think that they and the rent officer service command a lot of respect--it is curious to have a category of tenure that relies on the professional and statutory fixing of a rent that is fair but then for the Government to decide that the rent is not fair enough or that it ought to be attuned to the means of a financially disadvantaged class of tenant. I did say to the Minister when I went to see him that it looked uncommonly like a housing benefit limitation measure, but I am sure that he will refute it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para33"></a>If the Government believe in intervening in the market for social reasons, they need to explain the rules of engagement for doing so. If a social policy is the objective, they need to explain the justification for that and why the burden should be placed on a particular group of property owners, as opposed, for instance, to the taxpayer at large.

<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para34"></a>If we are not careful, rental fairness--and there is no definition beyond the normal dictionary version--becomes an entirely movable feast. I think that a balance has to be struck here.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para35"></a>In opposition, the Labour Party said that it would not legislate to interfere with the private rented sector. The consultation paper at paragraph 4.1 uses the term, "changing the legislative framework". It is an interesting shift of language, but this will not impress investors; it just switches people off. What is happening here is that the understandings upon which investment in the regulated tenancy sector has started to get going again, after years of neglect, may be frustrated once again. Investors may feel that this is a prelude to the Government interfering in other ways, on the claim that they are not interfering at all but just using regulatory corrections. Property owners are asking themselves "What next?", and this doubt as to whether a return can be made will affect willingness to invest.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para36"></a>Most of Europe seems to have a regulated but fair renting arrangement which operates well in both the short and the long term. Other Europeans cannot understand our predilection for the baggage of a mortgage. It puts lending institutions in a monopoly situation, and a few years ago they seemed just as keen on repossession as some rogue landlords were on dispossession beforehand.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para37"></a>If we are to build 4.5 million houses by 2016, as is proposed, and as I perceive that there is a rising interest in renting as an alternative to ownership, it is in the public interest that there should be a good-quality private rented sector to provide mobility in the workforce and to provide a direct competitor to the mortgage lenders. It is therefore a grave mistake to send out the signal to the market-place that the limitation on fair rents now does, because the message is going beyond the sector to which it is said to apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para38"></a>In conclusion, there is a comment in the consultation paper on the subject of expectations: that tenants and landlords could never have expected these high increases in fair rent. I do not think anyone thought, however, that fair rents would trail the market to the tune of 45 per cent. In so far as there are legitimate expectations, they must include, first, that the rent is fixed by an independent officer; secondly, that it will be based on all factors, including the open market, adjusted to take out the scarcity factor--I have no difficulty with that; thirdly, that landlords will be able to charge that rent so fixed and that tenants should expect to pay it; and fourthly, that personal circumstances should be ignored.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para39"></a>I applaud much of the position on residential leasehold matters which the Labour Party took in opposition and which, in power, this Government have continued--much to their credit. There was a strong vein of the moral and practical imperative. I can see the force of the arguments. In this measure, however, the arguments have not been substantiated. I see an arguably unfair and partial proposal, and I feel duty bound to point that out, along with its potentially damaging consequences.

<A NAME="90309-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Gladwyn: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, for raising this subject but I am bound to say that I see the issue from the opposite end of the spectrum from him, living as I do in a flat in Westminster under a regulated tenancy. In my view, the order in question is the least that the Government could decently do under the circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para40"></a>I was not a Member of your Lordships' House when the Housing Act 1988 went through Parliament. At the time, however, it was widely reported in the media that this major reform of the rental system was of no concern to existing regulated tenants because they would continue to enjoy the full protection of the 1977 Rent Act. I remember being deeply impressed by the assurances given on television by William Waldegrave, the Minister in charge of housing, in that regard. It may be that some of the Conservative leadership were unhappy at that exception to their reforms, but they accepted it in the interests of social equity as well as political common sense. The noble Earl who raised this debate today, however, was one of those who disapproved. In the Committee stage he complained that the Bill would create a two-tier system--one for lettings before it comes into force and another thereafter. He said that he could imagine nothing more divisive. The then Minister--the noble Earl, Lord Caithness--said in respect of the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, that he wished to go very much further than the Government had done.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para41"></a>Introducing the Bill in another place, Nicholas Ridley himself emphasised the difference between market rents and so-called "fair" rents, which were not fair to the landlord in relation to giving him a return on his investment. It was on the interpretation of this word "fair" that the rent protection for regulated tenancies broke down. In July 1994 Mr. Justice Harrison delivered his judgment in the Spath Holme case, in which he ruled that a fair rent does not mean a reasonable rent but it merely denotes the market rent, adjusted for the scarcity element.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para42"></a>This is very different from what had generally been supposed before, even by Nicholas Ridley. It reminds me of another recent judgment about the interpretation of a single simple word that likewise had immense implications for many private individuals. This was the American ruling that the word "sudden", which qualified many of the Lloyd's insurances respecting chemical pollution, did not mean something that happened quickly but something that was unexpected, even if occurring very slowly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para43"></a>Had the parliamentary scrutiny of the Housing Act been sharper, this anomaly might have been recognised and the wording of the previous Rent Act could have been adjusted. It was altogether ignored on all sides, however, and the result has been an explosive effect on registered rents awarded by the rent officers and the rent assessment committees. That has been particularly marked in the case of private tenants in central London, where property and rental values have escalated so dramatically, boosted by the demand for so-called assured or short-hold tenancies by businesses for the use of their directors or employees, often foreign. The <P>


<a name="column_208"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 208</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>protection provided by the 1988 Act for the regulated tenants has largely evaporated in respect of rents; it remains solid only in respect of tenure.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para44"></a>The social equity which impelled that protection in the first place is all the more needful now, 11 years later. This is because many private tenants, being effectively misled about the implications of the 1988 Act, decided to stay on rather than move and perhaps buy freeholds or leases elsewhere. They are now all 11 years older and far less able to alter their arrangements. The explanatory text of this present order reveals that in 1996-97 over 60 per cent. of the regulated private tenants were retired, so I dare say that that will have risen to over two-thirds by now. All of them, whatever their private circumstances, will have been faced with rents which have upset their financial calculations, in many cases causing acute personal distress.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para45"></a>The main trouble with the order which the noble Earl would like to have annulled is not that it mitigates this plight but that it has been so slow in coming. During the course of last year particularly registered rents shot up still further, following the Curtis case of 1997. In many instances, therefore, it is shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. Those fortunate enough to be on rental timescales which involved no review last year will be more likely to derive greater benefit from this capping order. That in itself seems grossly unfair. If the Government had tackled the issue immediately on coming in to office in 1997 the order could have been in place at least six months earlier. I feel that they have dragged their feet. The issue had been aired for some years in another place, specifically in 1992 by Dudley Fishburn, the Member for Kensington; but in 1993 Sir George Young declined to act.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para46"></a>The regulated tenants are constantly declining in numbers as they leave or die. If their rents are lower than market rents, that was the price that landlords were obliged to pay under the terms of the deregulation of the rental market in 1988. It is a price that diminishes every year with the reducing number of protected tenants and the easing upwards of the capping. The press release announcing the order specifically states that the Government have no intention of imposing any such future restriction on assured or shorthold tenancies under the Housing Act 1988. I cannot see how landlord interests can complain about it, and I trust that the noble Earl will reconsider his Question.

<A NAME="90309-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, for giving the House this opportunity to debate housing matters once again. It is a matter that is very dear to my heart. The two speeches that we have heard so far come from opposite directions. That highlights the whole problem of the present issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para47"></a>This is a good opportunity to ask the Government to get to grips with how they view the private rented sector. There are two sides. Landlords need to be able to make their businesses a success but tenants also need good quality accommodation at a price that they can afford. To get the balance right between protecting those <P>


<a name="column_209"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who cannot afford large rent increases and assisting the private rented sector to flourish is not an easy task. As we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, if we add to it the history of rent regulation we see just how difficult is that task.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para48"></a>If we look at some of the views expressed, those who represent landlords tell us that intervention in market rents deters investment, that existing businesses may well be damaged, that there will be an ever-growing gap between market and regulated rents and that perhaps the recent confidence in the private rented sector will be reversed. It has also been said that during the consultation period the Government discounted all of the arguments put forward by the supply side. But if one considers the views of organisations concerned with tenants, particularly elderly people on low incomes, the response is rather different. I am aware that Shelter and Age Concern welcome these regulations because they believe they will help those people about whom they are concerned and stop very high rent increases. Shelter had asked for an even lower limit to be set. Nevertheless, it is pleased that the Government have reduced the original limit.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para49"></a>As we have heard this evening, the majority of tenants with fair rents are retired and on low fixed incomes. I understand that, before housing costs, the mean net income of pensioner households in this group living in regulated tenancies in the private sector is little more than &#163;120 per week. That gives us some idea of what we must deal with. If rent increases for that group are not restricted there is a view--I have sympathy with it--that there could be many more elderly tenants who will end up losing their homes and facing financial hardship. That is the dilemma facing both sides in this debate. That has been clearly set out this evening by the two earlier contributions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para50"></a>There are two particular statements that I believe emphasise the conflict between the two sides. The British Property Federation states that this will damage businesses that have set their investment strategies and business plans on the assumption of continued rental growth. On the other hand, Shelter uses a similar argument to suggest that elderly tenants on low incomes would have planned their affairs on the basis that they could remain in their homes and could not have foreseen that the levels of fair rent increases would be as high as some have been. One can see that there is a dreadful dilemma.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para51"></a>In mitigation--we have heard the argument put forward by the noble Earl--landlords say that because of previous rent regulation there were some large increases when landlords tried to catch up, but that it is unlikely to happen again. But we are where we are. We are talking about tenants who are particularly elderly, but also about landlords who are running businesses. I believe that tonight the Government should at least tell the House that they understand the importance of the private rented sector. Perhaps they should look at other ways to help that sector. I would very much have liked to see in the Budget today tax incentives to help landlords in the private rented sector business, <P>


<a name="column_210"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>particularly in relation to the repair and upkeep of properties and, in the area of energy efficiency--the insulation of properties.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para52"></a>Obviously, too much regulation will not help businesses. The housing sector business by its very nature is very different. Therefore, this is a matter that we should look at very carefully as part of the much wider picture. If we want a flexible housing market and flourishing rented sector we must take care to strike a balance between our desire to protect the community and our desire to help landlords. We need a variety of affordable housing. I believe that over recent years we have had a real problem because of the difficulty in moving in and out of sectors. It is difficult to provide affordable housing where people want it. With the ever-changing jobs market and the insecurity of income it is important to expand the private rented sector to enhance flexibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para53"></a>I believe that tonight we deserve from the Government a little explanation as to how they view the whole area, whether they want a thriving private rented sector and, if so, how they can assist it. I believe that the Government would gain a little more sympathy from private sector landlords if at the same time as they restricted rents in certain sectors they introduced fiscal measures to assist in raising standards in the private rented sector and the running of successful private rented sector businesses. In failing to do so the Government lay themselves open to the further charge referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Lytton; namely, the suspicion that this is much more to do with the worry about the housing benefit bill than looking at how to deal with the various housing sectors. I end on that note in the hope that the Government will give an indication of their stance on this important issue. This order has highlighted the dilemma that faces us in the provision of affordable housing and where it comes from, and achieving a flexible housing market.

<A NAME="90309-11_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, first I thank the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, for giving the House this opportunity to debate the consequences of the Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999 which will have a wide-ranging effect on the residential and letting sector. We heard one view from the noble Earl and another from the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn. The dilemma described by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, is quite correct. My experience in this industry is limited largely to the residential lettings sector in rural areas. From my past professional capacity I know that trying to make tenants accept rent increases that they are unable to pay is in nobody's interest. Bad relations between landlord and tenant are counterproductive. Increased costs and valuable time are always the consequence; and at the last resort litigation between parties, although sometimes inevitable, is never satisfactory.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para54"></a>The impact of the order on the industry has to be considered. It has been said that the court judgments which led to the introduction of the order corrected the system of fair rent increases that were intended by the original legislation and, to quote the Institute of Rent <P>


<a name="column_211"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 211</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Officers and Rental Valuers, to cap increases now appears to be shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, as the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, said.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para55"></a>I have also been informed that some tenants have been faced by earlier rent reviews to beat the deadline that allowed a period of three weeks between the introduction of this order and its coming into force. Why was this period agreed to, particularly after consultation had already taken place? With reference to the consultation period, how many responses were received and how many had concerns about the order?
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para56"></a>My contacts in the industry tell me that the capping of the rents under the new formula will deter future investment in the area, as the noble Baroness said. I have spoken to a property company with a large portfolio which tells me that confidence in the industry is being badly hit. I know that the Government have stated on a number of occasions that there is no intention to change the legislative framework of the Housing Act 1988; but those suspicions remain.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para57"></a>I understand that the order involves changing primary legislation by secondary legislation. From my brief experience of your Lordships' House, I think that this is a relatively rare occurrence. Should not this change have been carried out by primary legislation, which would have enabled debate in both Houses of Parliament? If nothing more, it would demonstrate open government in practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para58"></a>This is a crucial time for the private rented sector. There is increased demand for housing and there are problems over the development of greenfield sites. Surely the Government should see this occasion as an opportunity to seize.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para59"></a>The consultation paper states that the effect of the order would enable the Exchequer to benefit only from small short-term housing benefit savings. How long is short term; and how much would the benefit amount to? Have Her Majesty's Government any intention to review the effect of the order over the next year?
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para60"></a>I am of course aware that some people need help and protection. But, taking account of the ever-decreasing numbers of these tenancies, are there not other agencies available to help those who need it most? I look forward to hearing the responses of the Minister.

<A NAME="90309-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, for initiating the debate, for coming to talk to me and my officials about what lay behind his concern and for being co-operative in not moving the Prayer due to other business at an earlier stage when the order was before the House. It is important that the Government explain their position on the order. Clear concerns were expressed by noble Lords in the debate. However, I need to nail one myth immediately. The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, the noble Baroness and, by implication, the noble Earl, Lord Courtown, expressed fears that our measures under the order would be seen as a prelude to wider rent controls traversing the whole of the private rented market. That is not the case. Let me lay those fears to rest.
<P>


<a name="column_212"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para61"></a>Our measures are intended to address a transitional problem in a small and declining part of the rental market sector. They apply to the tenants within that sector who have different rights from other tenants by definition. It does not affect unregulated, unregistered tenants. The limits that we are introducing under the order will not apply in any circumstances to 90 per cent. of private lettings because the factors that led us to introduce them simply do not apply in the deregulated sector. Landlords and tenants were aware in other parts of the private rented market that when the Housing Act 1988 was introduced market rents would be charged for new lettings and that rent increases would follow market trends. The order in no sense alters that change. We have given repeated assurances that we have no plans to change the wider legal framework for deregulated private tenancies. I am able to repeat emphatically those assurances today.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para62"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, tempted me into discussing a range of housing policy issues; to some extent, the noble Earl, Lord Courtown, sought to do the same. It would be proper in the debate to concentrate on what the order provides rather than going into the wider areas. Therefore I move to the proposals under the order.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para63"></a>When the Housing Act 1988 introduced market rents for all new lettings, the right of existing regulated tenants to a fair rent was not changed by the government at that time. These tenants and their landlords may still apply to have a fair rent registered for the tenancy every two years by an independent rent officer. They can appeal against the rent officer's decision to a rent assessment committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para64"></a>When setting fair rents under these procedures, rent officers and committees are required by the Rent Act 1977 to take into account the age, character, locality and state of repair of the property but to disregard, as the noble Earl said, any premium resulting from a scarcity of similar accommodation in the locality. That principle was first established long before that--in 1965.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para65"></a>In the past, rent officers tended to decide rents by referring to fair rents previously determined for other comparable properties in the locality. Before 1989, when there was little evidence of market rents, this was the only practicable approach. As the noble Earl indicated, more recently a number of landmark court cases have held that rents officers and committees should give more weight to market rents for comparable properties now that there is a growing volume of open market evidence. The starting point should generally be the comparable market rent which is then adjusted to take account of scarcity.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para66"></a>However, changing to this method has caused fair rents to rise very steeply in recent years. Fair rent increases have been well above increases in the retail prices index over the same period. There are specific problems in particular areas; but, on average, there is a problem. In Merseyside, the average increase on re-registration has recently been around 45 per cent. In London, as the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, indicates, some tenants have faced substantial rent increases of 60 per cent. or more in two years. For example, a tenant in Hammersmith and Fulham faced an increase in rent <P>


<a name="column_213"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 213</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of 65 per cent. in 1998, taking the rent to &#163;7,750 per annum from &#163;4,700 per annum only two years previously.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para67"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, drew attention to the particular vulnerability in areas of scarcity in central London. Indeed, the noble Earl, Lord Courtown, acknowledged that. This evening I have been told of substantially higher increases in rent than had been mentioned in my original briefing.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para68"></a>When the previous government introduced market rents for new lettings in 1989 they deliberately left the fair rent provisions for existing tenants intact. We do not believe that at that time anyone could reasonably have expected rent increases of the magnitude to which I now refer under a fair rent system.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para69"></a>That is as true of landlords as it is of tenants. The existence of fair rent controls has not prevented a brisk trade from taking place in the freeholds of properties occupied by fair rent tenants. Investors have paid a price reflecting the expectation that there would be little or no real growth in rental income. For their profit, they have looked forward to the prospect of sales when the tenancies come to an end at a much higher price reflecting vacant possession value. For them, the recent explosion in fair rents has thus been an unlooked-for bonus.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para70"></a>The noble Earl made the reasonable point that many landlords did not acquire their tenanted properties as speculative investments or indeed in some cases for investment reasons at all. They may have inherited the property, built it or acquired it to house employees, or purchased it as part of a much wider property portfolio. That is all very true, but none of it alters the fact that the original acquisition, and the assumption when the 1988 Act was coming in, will have taken place against the background of the fair rent controls as they were understood by landlords and tenants and expected to work at the time. The idea that growth in rental income might massively exceed the rate of inflation will not have entered the heads of any of these landlords at the point of acquisition or at the point of those tenancies being confirmed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para71"></a>When we were faced with the increase in rents and the concern expressed by tenants and other operators in the property market, we considered that there was a strong case for the Government to intervene to moderate increases for the small and declining number of tenants with existing fair rents. I have to stress that the number of tenancies affected is small; some 120,000 private tenancies in the sector as a whole, not all of which will be affected, plus 235,000 secured tenancies of registered social landlords. Many of those tenants are elderly, as noble Lords have indicated. They have made assumptions about the rents that they will be paying for the rest of their lives.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para72"></a>That is not the central issue. The order does not change the way in which fair rents are determined under the 1977 Act; it simply limits the exceptionally high fair rent increases under the Act. By linking rent increases to the change in the retail prices index, they will follow the trend of market rents. But additionally, in <P>


<a name="column_214"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recognition of the fact that fair rent increases were artificially low in the early 1990s, we have allowed a further premium; that is, an uplift of 7.5 per cent. for the first application made after the order came into force and 5 per cent. for subsequent applications. Therefore, contrary to what the noble Earl suggests, that will ultimately, except in the most extreme cases, allow fair rents to reach the level they would have done if we had not introduced the premium--but at a slower rate and depending on the future pattern of market rents. The convergence will exist and, except in extremely unlikely circumstances, there will be a large and growing divergence between market rents and the rate of inflation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para73"></a>The limit will not apply to a substantial number of regulated tenancies where no fair rent is registered because the landlord and tenant have agreed a rent that has not been registered. We also felt that there should be an incentive for landlords to carry out major works to the property. The order therefore exempts landlords from the limit where a substantial rent increase of more than 15 per cent. is due because of an improvement in the condition of the property as a result of repairs or improvements by the landlord.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para74"></a>In formulating that exemption, we had on the one hand to provide an incentive to landlords to carry out major works, as described by the noble Earl, which would benefit tenants but, on the other hand, to ensure that the exemption would not allow landlords to circumvent the limit simply by carrying out running repairs and minor improvements. Minor works should be included in the annual management and maintenance plans.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para75"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, indicated, we must balance the objectives, providing incentives to landlords to make improvements and providing a fair return to the landlord, given the expectations on which such properties have been acquired or continued and a reasonable protection for the tenant. We believe that we have come up with a reasonable balance in both parties' interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para76"></a>The noble Earl objects in part to the tone of the consultation paper. Whatever his views on its tone, our proposals were clear. I cannot give precise figures, but we received a number of responses from landlords' and tenants' organisations, individual landlords and others. In the light of responses, we considered that there was some support for the approach. We decided that the case had been made for a small change to our original proposal. The initial uplift to the rent limit formula was reduced from our original proposal of 10 per cent. for the first term to 7.5 per cent. That was as a result of representations made from tenants' organisations that many landlords had already benefited from large increases.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para77"></a>I say to the noble Earl, Lord Courtown, that the provisions we are introducing do not alter primary legislation. We have the power, but it has not frequently been used, to provide limits. Modification already exists within the primary legislation and we are simply utilising that power. Clearly, some landlords have taken advantage of the timescale it has taken us to introduce <P>


<a name="column_215"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the order to increase their rents. Of course, they were entitled to do so under existing legislation. All legislation takes a little time. Most legislation, once introduced, has a timetable for its coming into effect. I understand that there are a few examples of people taking advantage of that. It is a natural consequence of the parliamentary process and we cannot do much about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para78"></a>I do not accept the noble Earl's point that we were overriding the principle of a fair rent. Most landlords and tenants could never have anticipated increases of the size which have been imposed in certain areas. The noble Earl suggested that we had introduced an element of affordability into the fair rent system. We have done no such thing. We have referred to the situation of tenants on the basis of something under which they and the landlords were operating when the previous legislation was passed. The fair rent will continue to be determined on exactly the same criteria as under the original Rent Act principles. It is only in cases where the increases in fair rent would have outstripped inflation by a very generous margin that the order will slow the increase to a level which is manageable for the tenants and is consistent with what would until recently have been the high point of the landlords' reasonable expectations.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para79"></a>The noble Baroness and others raised the ignoble theory that this is all in order to save housing benefit. I can assure your Lordships that there is no such motivation for the change. Compared to the bill for housing benefit, any such benefit would have been extremely small, unpredictable and short term. I cannot give noble Lords the precise figures, but we are talking <P>


<a name="column_216"></a>

<B>9 Mar 1999 : Column 216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>minuscule amounts compared with the problems of expenditure on the housing benefit front. I ask noble Lords to discount that as our motivation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para80"></a>I hope that what I have said will reassure the noble Earl and noble Lords that the order we have laid is designed simply to ensure that the protection which has long been afforded to regulated tenants works as it was intended to. This is a limited measure and has no implications for other parts of the housing market. It is to address a small and transitional problem; it is not the prelude to wider rent control. We seek to extend the area of housing choice and do not believe that the measure will in any sense restrict that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para81"></a>I suppose that, strictly speaking, the answer to the noble Earl's question could have been put shortly with a simple "No". Nevertheless, I believe that the House deserved a full explanation of the reasoning behind the order. It is to protect a group of tenants who have been protected from excessive increases by successive governments. The noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, referred to the late Nicholas Ridley, who was not normally seen as an opponent to the free market. Like successive governments, he clearly saw the need to continue the protection and expectations held by tenants in various circumstances of this type of tenure. I believe that the measure will be appreciated by those tenants. It is fair and it continues to provide a reasonable return for landlords and a reasonable incentive for them to improve their properties.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309-11_para82"></a>I hope that in view of that explanation the noble Earl will feel it appropriate not to press his Question further tonight. If he wishes to raise any other points, no doubt we can deal with them in writing.

<UL>What is the outcome of the competition to sell a second part of the student loan portfolio.[HL1426]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309w02_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment   (Baroness Blackstone): </B>  I am today announcing the conclusion of the second sale of a portfolio of student loans to the private sector for around &#163;1 billion. The sale has been achieved after a very vigorous competition and we have accepted the most competitive bid. A consortium of the Nationwide Building Society and Deutsche Bank AG was the successful bidder. As a result, the portfolio will be sold to HONOURS Trustee Limited, a company formed for the purpose of acquiring the assets.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309w02_para0"></a>The loans sold are those made under the original loan scheme. None of the new income contingent loans introduced at the beginning of the current academic year is involved. My right honourable friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury has confirmed the policy considerations which have determined the Government's approach to student loan debt sales in a Written Answer today to the honourable Jackie Lawrence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309w02_para1"></a>HONOURS Trustee Limited has appointed the Student Loans Company, the existing administrator, to administer the sold loans on its behalf. Borrowers who are currently repaying their loans or who have made deferment arrangements will consequently notice little change. We have legislated previously to ensure that the position of borrowers is protected. Borrowers will retain their existing rights of deferment, where their income in below 85 per cent. of average earnings, and interest rates will continue to be linked solely to inflation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309w02_para2"></a>These rights mean that original scheme student loans are provided at subsidised rates. Subsidies will therefore be paid to the purchaser to reflect this. During the 1999-2000 financial year a subsidy of about &#163;64 million will be paid.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309w02_para3"></a>Part of the gross subsidy payment will be repaid to the Government through the administration charges paid to the Student Loans Company and tax receipts on private sector profits. Given the value of loans sold, and that some of the loans will be outstanding for a considerable length of time, the estimated net present value of these subsidies is broadly in the region of &#163;395 million to &#163;405 million. This compares with estimated net present value costs of around &#163;310 million which we would have incurred had the <P>


<a name="column_WA21"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>loans remained publicly owned. The estimated cost to the Government of selling these loans will therefore be in the region of &#163;85 million to &#163;100 million or 25 to 30 per cent. above the cost of keeping loans in the public sector over the lifetime of the portfolio.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309w02_para4"></a>The agreement between the Government and HONOURS Trustee Limited, with commercially confidential information removed, will be placed in the Library of the House on completion of the sale.

<P>
<A NAME="90309w02_wqn4"></A><B> Earl Baldwin of Bewdley </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by the Baroness Hayman of 26 January (WA 144) which cited studies from the 1940s and 1950s in support of an "optimal" 1 part per million for fluoridating the water supply, whether the greatly increased exposure to fluorides from all sources in the intervening years, highlighted in the Findings and Conclusions section of Review of Fluoride: Benefits and Risks (Department of Health and Human Services, USA, 1991) referred to in the Written Answer by the Baroness Hayman of 8 February (WA 2), might give grounds for (a) close monitoring of current individual fluoride intakes; and (b) reconsideration of the figure of 1ppm.[HL1309]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90309w02_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  The cited review points to a significant expansion in the range of sources of fluoride exposure in the United States, and in particular in the availability of dental products and dietary supplements containing fluoride. It does not suggest that the intake of fluoride from food and from drinking-water has increased significantly in populations whose drinking water contains fluoride at 1 part per million. Systemic fluoride supplements may not be prescribed without reference to the fluoride content of the water supply, and are not advised when the water contains more than 0.7 parts per million. Correct use of fluoride toothpastes does not significantly increase systematic exposure to fluoride.
<P>

<A NAME = "90309w02_para5"></a>Recently estimates of dietary intakes of fluoride in the United Kingdom will be available shortly from the 1997 Total Diet Study. We are also planning for the National Diet and Nutrition Survey of 19 to 64 year-olds, which is to be conducted over the next two years, to include measurement of urinary fluoride. If these studies or any other research findings were to show a significant increase in fluoride intakes, we would consider whether people living in fluoridated areas should be advised that they did not need to use dental products like fluoride drops and tablets. We would also consider whether the designation of 1 ppm as the optimal level of water fluoridation should be reviewed.

<A NAME = "90309w03_para11"></a>The epidemiology section shows that the epidemic of BSE in the UK continues to decline.

A continued improvement is expected for the future. The section shows that 63 per cent. of UK herds with adult breeding cattle have never had a case of BSE. Furthermore, 84 per cent. of beef suckler herds have never had a case of BSE. Reported incidence also shows that herds with more than four cases of BSE account for almost three-quarters of all BSE cases, but represent less than one-eighth of all herds.
