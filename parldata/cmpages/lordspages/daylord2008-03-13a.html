<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="08031360000019"></a> My Lords, the Government have introduced statutory regulation to help to ensure that lenders lend responsibly and borrowers are able to make informed choices. The Government provide targeted support for those experiencing difficulties through the provision of debt advice and support for mortgage interest. The Government welcome the industry's recent statement setting out the steps that it is taking to help to support borrowers. The Civil Justice Council&#146;s Housing and Land Committee is currently consulting on a draft mortgage protocol.</p>

It looks like something may be being done. As he knows, there is growing evidence of a big increase in early foreclosures. Has the Treasury considered the Ministry of Justice&#146;s recent proposal to help borrowers who are in trouble with temporary financial difficulties by arranging a court order to prevent early foreclosure? Will my noble friend have a word with the Treasury about that?</p>

The important thing is that the mortgage lenders also have a real interest in using repossession only as a last resort. Therefore, they are eager to co-operate with strategies that ensure that, as far as possible, people are helped when they get into difficulties with their mortgages.</p>

The small print of the Budget shows that the Treasury forecasts that house prices will fall in real terms. Did the Budget have anything at all to reduce the increasing likelihood of a rising rate of mortgage default and therefore repossession?</p>

That is a reflection of the fact that interest rates are considerably lower than in those rather drastic times. The noble Baroness will appreciate that the Chancellor, in defending a robust economy, is able to emphasise that the rate of repossessions, although it may increase to a degree, will be nothing like what was experienced in the past. Both the Financial Services Authority and the Office of Fair Trading are involved in improving regulation and advice in order to help people holding mortgages when they get into difficulties.</p>

One can hope only that the Monetary Policy Committee does not do something stupid to offset that, but that is by the way.</p>

<a name="80313-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="08031360000025"></a>On the Question itself, should we assume that, on the whole, banks and building societies are rational, and therefore, with the housing market as it is, they would not rush into premature housing repossessions? Would I be right in understanding that the Treasury will act in a minimalist fashion on this and again rely on the free market&#151;in this case the banks and building societies&#151;to behave sensibly?</p>

There are areas in which government agencies are able to improve the position&#151;the quality of financial advice and the understanding that individuals have with regard to their mortgage commitments. All this can and should be improved. The Government can provide some pump priming in this area. But broadly my noble friend is absolutely right that we can rely on the mortgage lenders to act responsibly. More than 50 per cent have already given a lead by cutting their interest rates in line with the most recent Bank of England cut.</p>

Mortgage lenders have an interest in the ongoing relationship with the mortgagee and the point of last resort is repossession. They do adopt such strategies to help borrowers and, on the whole, have good relationships with them. That does not alter the fact that we all recognise that we are going through bumpy economic times and there will be difficulties for some individuals. That is why the Government are concerned that the Financial Services Authority should do additional work on its support in this field.</p>

What guidance has the Treasury given to Mr Sandler about this?</p>

The arm&#146;s-length relationship guarantees that that should not be so; the Treasury is not running Northern Rock. What we will do in due course, as has been promised to both Houses of Parliament, is publish the framework agreement between the Treasury and Northern Rock. The noble Lord will see from that&#151;I have no doubt that it will condition future questions&#151;that it would not be appropriate at the Dispatch Box for a Minister to comment on every single action by the chief executive.</p>

The mortgage company or bank has no interest in repossessing, except as a last resort. We are seeking to strengthen that. The whole point of the increased work of the Financial Services Authority and the Office of Fair Trading is to give greater support to families in difficulty in terms of information and knowledge on how to handle their negotiations with the building society or bank when the issue arises.</p>

On inquiry to the train operator, I am told that 29 per cent of that is off peak and 1 per cent is during the peak.

The report indicates that the economic benefits for the nation as a whole would be in the region of &#163;60 billion over a lengthy lifespan, so is this not the way forward and should not the Government be planning for it now?</p>

The network is doing a brilliant job in this country. It is expanding at a faster rate than at any time since 1947, when the father of the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, was Prime Minister. There are now more rail passengers. We have invested significantly and we continue to do so.

They do so because of the scheme, so we value it highly. However, it is necessary for us to think about the future of the scheme constructively, which is what the two bodies are doing. I regret that the noble Lord can point out to me that we have not made enormous progress in the past six weeks, but I assure him that we expect these discussions to conclude favourably in the near future.</p>

Is this not incumbent on the department, which in the Comprehensive Spending Review chose to allocate an additional &#163;50 million to the Arts Council, which was welcome, and even found &#163;50 million for a new building at Tate Modern, but imagined wrongly that it would be acceptable to cut funding by 25 per cent for a range of important but

Of course that is a cut because of inflation, but it is nothing like 25 per cent; we are talking about a marginal cut. However, I accept what my noble friend says. We want a resolution of these issues so that the future of the scheme is identified effectively. As I said to the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, we expect progress to be made on these matters. If the department needs to intervene more proactively, we will certainly do so.</p>

As all sides of the House have mentioned in previous debates, the great value of the Portable Antiquities Scheme is its national nature, so that every part of the country is covered. If it is cut even marginally, that national nature might be threatened. Would that not have damaging effects on the archaeological heritage of different regions?</p>

In fact, all three noble Lords who have questioned me about this matter today know a great deal more about it than I do myself. I want to emphasise that there is no intention of changing the structure of the Portable Antiquities Scheme&#151;quite the opposite. We highly value the scheme. It has great virtues and we intend to safeguard its future. However, there is discussion on where authority for the scheme should lie, and those discussions have not quite concluded yet.</p>

BACS and posted giro payments will continue as usual and 98 per cent of our customers receive automated payments. On the social fund, Jobcentre Plus managers have planned extensively, using the experience from previous strike days, to put in place robust crisis loan arrangements for next week.

There were very protracted discussions&#151;28 meetings, I think, since proposals were first advanced. It is within the context of needing to bear down on inflation generally, and public sector pay is clearly a component of that. But the way in which the offer has been structured and implemented seeks to address the issue of the lowest-paid people in the department. For those who are not on their scale maxima, the award will deliver a minimum pay increase of 3 per cent a year over a three-year period. Around one-third, those at the bottom end of the scale, will get more than 5 per cent a year. But we remain open to continuing discussion and dialogue with the trade unions and others on this.</p>

But they have already delivered in terms of staff productivity, which is up at least 8 per cent over the past three years. Again, because of significant investment of &#163;2.8 billion over the past two spending rounds, the department has been able to restructure and re-engineer its business processes. The latest head count for January 2008 is 104,000 full-time equivalents, which is 30,000 fewer than three years ago, so the staff have engaged and co-operated. As the noble Lord said, this is against a backdrop where major changes are yet to happen; for example, the introduction of the employment and support allowance, the introduction of PADA and all the issues around the recasting of the CSA.</p>

I think he said that there were special contact numbers in job centres for staff if they are there to contact, but the people who need these emergency loans cannot get through to the job centre in the first place, so that will not help. Given that there is a very poor record anyway of answering the phone in job centres, how will the Minister protect people, particularly young families and mothers in desperate need, from what, if they cannot get through, will be a really dismal Easter?</p>

The approach to handling this strike is obviously to prioritise payment of benefits, as I have said, and to switch resources, including managerial resources, to answering telephones to make sure that the capacity is there to deal with people who are in real need and to make sure that we continue to service them. People have been working hard to clear outstanding work so that the decks are as clear as they can be for facing the issues over the next couple of days.</p>

It concerns its availability. I preface my brief remarks by saying that I have no criticism of our staff, who are and have been, as usual, most helpful, as all noble Lords know and would expect. I must say a word about this Companies Act order, which I had great difficulty in finding yesterday evening, and even this morning as I came into the Chamber. It is a document of some importance because it has 72 pages of schedules, which provide amendments not only on Companies Acts and so on, but on statutes as diverse as the regulation of pig production, horse racing and chiropractors, who seem to enter into the same category through their Act of 1994. It takes a little time to read those 72 pages. Before we pass orders it ought to be possible to have them in time to do so. Could my noble friend kindly mention the matter to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform? I am sure that more contact from the department would be very helpful in having greater notice of this very weighty document.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08031360000084"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I have just been in a country where less than 2 per cent of those entitled to vote seem to decide which party forms a Government. As a result, this tiny elite has huge power, and special financial interests can exert disproportionate influence behind the scenes. Millions of voters, on the other hand, never have any impact at all on the outcome of parliamentary elections. Many of them, indeed, now recognise that and are frustrated by their lack of electoral influence. Naturally, the political parties, which are hardly national any more, concentrate all their campaign cash and effort on targeting this tiny group. As a result, fewer citizens, especially young ones, now bother to vote at any level of governance. The whole legitimacy of their democracy is called into question.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08031360000085"></a>Members of your Lordships&#146; House will immediately recognise that I have not been in Russia or Kenya; I have been in the United Kingdom. That is now the situation. Estimates vary, but the consensus is that perhaps 8,000 people in a maximum of 80 marginal constituencies now decide which party wins most seats in the House of Commons and forms a Government. That is about 1.8 per cent of the registered electorate, or about 3 per cent of those who actually vote.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08031360000086"></a>Worse still, this elite is totally unrepresentative of the country as a whole. It is likely that the Conservatives would have to gain 42 per cent of the total popular vote to obtain an overall majority in the other place, while Labour could probably do so on 35 per cent. Very few MPs can now claim to have the support of the majority of those voting in their constituencies. In 2005, only 34 per cent were elected with over half the vote, the lowest proportion in British history. And none, not a single Member of the other place, actually achieved a majority of the total electorate in their constituency. At both the national and local levels, therefore, the legitimacy of the outcome of a general election is bound to be challenged, and I believe it will be at the next election in particular.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08031360000087"></a>The contrast between 1955, which was the first election I was interested in&#151;as a schoolboy, of course&#151;and that of 2005 is very instructive. Fifty years ago, the turnout even with what were then relatively difficult postal votes was 76.8 per cent, and just under a half, 49.6 per cent, supported the government that resulted. Fifty years later, in 2005, the turnout even with much easier postal voting had dropped to 61.4 per cent,  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1580"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1580</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>while the Labour Government, with only a 35.2 per cent share of the poll&#151;much less than a quarter of those registered to vote&#151;gained a majority of 66 seats. There is an illusion, which may be shared by some noble Lords, that the Celts, the Scots, the Welsh or the Cornish caused the trouble, but that is not true. The distortion was most marked in England. In 2005, the Conservatives gained some 650,000 more English votes than Labour, but had 92 fewer English MPs. In short, first past the post worked in the bipolar situation of 1955, but is was no longer fit for purpose in 2005 and is not now, as the well-researched government report we are debating today explains so well.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08031360000088"></a>Why, then, did Ministers sit on its conclusions for a full month? Ministers here and in the other place told us that it would be completed and available before Christmas. It was ready on 17 December, but only published on 24 January. The only possible explanation is that the analysis was so uncomfortable for the Government that they had to spend a month spinning their way from that analysis. The report itself is remarkable for its freedom from partisan bias, but not so the ministerial spin. Mr Michael Wills, the Minister responsible, immediately rubbished reform by reinforcing the case for doing nothing. He then suggested that any attempt to make the Commons more democratic should await the parallel but very slow progress to reform your Lordships&#146; House. It is as though turkeys at either end of the building are curiously anxious to force those at the other end to face an early Christmas first.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08031360000089"></a>Clearly, Lords and Commons reform should not be allowed to delay each other. I know that my noble friend Lord Goodhart, who is in his place, will examine more specifically appropriate electoral systems for a reformed second Chamber, but perhaps I may concentrate on the democratic legitimacy of MPs and Governments. Others, I hope, will look at the democratic deficit in relation to other levels of governance in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08031360000090"></a>First, I shall give a little background history to the argument. In 1996, Mr Tony Blair published a book called, <I>New Britain: My Vision of a Young Country</I>, in which he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="08031360000512"></a>&#147;The party I lead will carry out in government the programme we provide in our manifesto beforehand. Nothing more, nothing less, that is my word&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000482"></a>In the same publication he committed any Government he led to,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000535"></a>&#147;an end to hereditary peers sitting in the House of Lords, as a first step to a proper directly elected second chamber, and the chance for the people to decide after the election the system by which they elect the Government of the future&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000483"></a>That was followed by the Cook-Maclennan agreement, led by Mr Robin Cook and my noble friend Lord Maclennan of Rogart, who unfortunately cannot be with us today. Again, a firm statement was made in an agreement between the two parties in preparation for the 1997 election as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08031360000513"></a>&#147;A commission on voting systems for the Westminster Parliament should be appointed early in the next Parliament to recommend the appropriate proportional alternative to the first past the post system ... legislation to hold the referendum would then be proposed and the choice placed before the people&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="08031360000484"></a>The manifesto commitment Labour then gave in that year was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08031360000514"></a>&#147;We are committed to a referendum on the voting system for the House of Commons&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000485"></a>Part of that commitment was fulfilled when Lord Jenkins produced his 1998 report, but 10 years on there is no legislation. A promise unfulfilled or a promise broken?</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08031360000091"></a>There was renewed emphasis and hope among reformers when on 3 July 2007, in his first major speech in the House of Commons on becoming Prime Minister, Mr Gordon Brown said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08031360000515"></a>&#147;The right of all the British people to have their voice heard is fundamental to our democracy&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 3/7/07; col. 818.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000486"></a>High hopes. Sadly, when we come to the report before us, many of the myths about PR have been dispelled but there is no sign of any government action to fulfil those promises.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08031360000092"></a>The first major myth is that somehow all PR systems destroy the connection between the constituent and the representative. Not so. The report says, at paragraph 6.113, that first past the post,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000536"></a>&#147;has the simplest direct relationship between representative and constituent. STV also allows for a direct relationship&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000487"></a>I illustrate that point with the example of my own county, Cornwall, which is now a Tory-free and Labour-free zone. It is entirely represented in the other place by Liberal Democrats. If you are a Labour or Conservative supporter in Cornwall, you have no direct representative who fulfils your requirement of representing your political views, because the system of first past the post simply does not provide them. STV, of course, would.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08031360000093"></a>The second myth is that somehow PR always leads to instability. As the report says at paragraph 6.168:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08031360000516"></a>&#147;We do not find a difference between PR systems and FPTP in terms of delivering stable and effective governments&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000488"></a>Indeed, the report goes on to say at paragraph 6.50 that it,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000537"></a>&#147;found no significant differences except on unemployment and, in this one respect, it is the PR countries that actually have the better records&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80313-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08031360000094"></a>Another myth is that PR does not give people any better choice. The report says, at paragraph 6.169:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08031360000517"></a>&#147;One of the main benefits of PR, and in particular STV, is that voters have a greater degree of choice in elections and a greater chance of their vote counting in terms of who gets elected&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80313-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08031360000095"></a>Then there is the allegation that somehow voters cannot cope with the system&#146;s simplicity. At report 6.170, the report says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08031360000518"></a>&#147;We do not find, on balance, any evidence to suggest that voters find one voting system easier or more confusing than another voting system&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000489"></a>Contrary to media belief, Scottish voters last year&#151;I am sure other noble Lords will refer to this&#151;had no real difficulty with STV. The problem lay with an oversimplified combined ballot paper for the Holyrood election. I hope my noble friend Lord Steel of Aikwood will make reference to his unique experience in Scotland.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08031360000096"></a>On diversity, the report says at paragraph 6.172 that,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000538"></a>&#147;the newly introduced voting systems have improved the situation of women&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1582"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1582</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08031360000490"></a>While it is important for all parties to improve the balance, especially among ethnic minorities, it is true that lists may not help&#151;but STV certainly would.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08031360000097"></a>The report says, at paragraph 7.92, that internationally the turnout under proportional systems is on average about 5 per cent higher than for majoritarian systems. That is logical; whenever your vote can be seen to count, there will be more interest, but where there is a foregone conclusion it is more likely that people simply will not bother. Let me take my own personal experience. When I was first elected in Cornwall in 1974, the electors there were very shrewd and knew it was going to be close. Indeed, I had a majority of just nine. They turned out in force: 83 per cent. In 2001, however, in the last election I stood in&#151;unfortunately for them, or perhaps for me&#151;it was seen to be more of a foregone conclusion as I had a majority of nearly 10,000, and only 63 per cent turned out. If you see that your vote is going to count, it is worth turning out.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08031360000098"></a>Few Labour Members in the other place have been looking seriously at this but fortunately one Member of the Cabinet has: John Denham. In a recent publication, he talked about,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000539"></a>&#147;the problem of simply focusing on a few key voters in the main marginal constituencies because it would at least be a system where votes, first or second preferences, counted&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000491"></a>He says that PR is the only system to break that unfortunate situation. Elsewhere in the same report, his co-author demands a change from what he describes as the postcode lottery that is the voting system. Therefore, we have to move from the present system, which is effectively a tiny minority sport, to national public engagement.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08031360000099"></a>That, of course, was the purpose and value of the Power inquiry, led by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws. Others have been dismissive of its conclusions, but it was, I believe, a very successful attempt to get beyond the Westminster bubble and to listen to what people out there believe&#151;the customers, if you like, of our democratic system. Not surprisingly, their response was that the current electoral swindle is explicit.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08031360000100"></a>This week, we have been told that there might be oaths of loyalty to demonstrate how we take value from our citizens. The only way for our citizens to demonstrate that they have value is if all votes are equal. At the moment, all voters are equal, but some are more equal than others.</p>

<a name="80313-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08031360000101"></a>I do not subscribe to the magic-wand approach to electoral reform. All problems of effective governance are not soluble just like that&#151;with one reform&#151;certainly not. All public disenchantment and disillusion with our political institutions will not suddenly disappear when all votes count. However, ending the perpetual distortion of the public will is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for constitutional renewal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08031360000102"></a>Professor Anthony King told some of us on Tuesday that democracy is institutionalised disappointment. To misquote Churchill: lack of real democracy might be even more disappointing. One thing is for sure: we cannot go on like this. Our political system must let the people in, rather than shut them out. At the moment, they are shut out from public debate and we are devoid of public respect as a result. It is corroded

The present electoral system badly serves our fellow citizens, as the report demonstrates so well. If the political class ignores the public, people can scarcely be blamed for turning their backs on the whole political system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08031360000103"></a>My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.</p>

This is a very important subject, which the House should consider. However, he will not be that surprised to know that I am not going to follow him down the route of supporting PR systems. I use the word &#147;systems&#148; deliberately, because PR covers a multitude of sins, not just one particular system. I think that the Liberal Democrats agree, but it depends where they are on what exactly the system should be. It is always worth pointing out that when the Liberal Party was last in power&#151;I accept that it was a long time ago, before the First World War&#151;it opposed PR, whereas the small, struggling Labour Party was in favour. I think that it is quite clear why. Before moving on, let me say that I am looking forward to the speech of my noble friend Lord Grocott, as I believe that it will be his maiden speech from the Back Benches of this Chamber.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08031360000105"></a>I support the first past the post system. It is not perfect by a long way but, as Churchill said about democracy, although it is a very poor system of government, it is better than any alternative. Of course, some PR systems may appear more democratic, but I do not believe that they always are. The first past the post system has served this country well and, although not perfect, it is better than anything else, as I said.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08031360000106"></a>I make it clear that events in Scotland under the devolution settlement have not influenced my support for first past the post. As some noble Lords present may know, I opposed the introduction of PR during the constitutional convention from 1991 onwards; I have not been a convert to first past the post. My noble friend Lord Elder&#151;if he were present&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, who served on the convention with me, will confirm that. At that time, we in the Labour Party reluctantly agreed to support PR because, to be honest, we thought that the 1997 election was going to be close and that we might require the support of the Liberal Democrats in order to achieve a Government. It is to the great honour of Donald Dewar and others in the party that, when we won a landslide victory, they stuck to that promise; it is to their honour but I think that it was not politically wise. It would have been much better simply to have said, &#147;Sorry, we are going back to the first past the post system&#148;.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08031360000107"></a>Events in Scotland since 1997 have confirmed and reinforced my view that first past the post is better than any other system. We now have four electoral systems in Scotland&#151;or five if you count two in the Scottish parliamentary elections. As a result, we now have a minority SNP Administration. We also have MEPs elected by the whole of Scotland&#151;to be honest, even I, a political figure, have some difficulty naming them and they have some difficulty representing the  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1584"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1584</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people. In local government, increasing numbers of local authorities are run by some form of coalition of parties, which often have little in common except one major aim, which is to prevent some other party from having power&#151;that is the whole purpose of it.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08031360000108"></a>I turn to the reasons why I think that we should stick to first past the post. There are basically five reasons. First, the first past the post system is known, it is easy to understand and it is easy to use. That is not to underestimate the intelligence of the electorate, as some people might think. I believe that the electorate in the main are very intelligent in the way in which they use the electoral system. It just so happens that they understand the first past the post system and they know what it is about.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08031360000109"></a>Secondly, there is the constituency link. I heard what the noble Lord said but I served 22 years as a Member of Parliament in the other place and I know how important that link between me and my constituency was. I was seen as someone who represented Cathcart in the House of Commons. It is interesting that the general public, who often condemn politicians&#151;they use the word as a generic term for people whom they do not like&#151;often give much respect to their own Member of Parliament. In Scotland, it is interesting how many Members who were elected to the Parliament on the list system are desperate to get a seat through the first past the post system. That includes the First Minister, who, although he put his name forward as a candidate for a constituency seat, made sure that he was on the list just in case somehow or other it all went wrong; he was determined that he would be in there.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08031360000110"></a>Thirdly, the first past the post system gives us stable government. In a democracy it is of course important that people are represented and that there is full scope for people to express their views, but let us remember that at the end of the day we are electing not just a Parliament, an Assembly, a local government or whatever it might be, but an Administration&#151;someone to govern a country. Despite what the noble Lord said, first past the post gives us more stable government and a greater ability for a Government to say, &#147;These are our policies, this is what we were elected on and this is what we will do. If we fail to do it, it is the right of the electorate to turn us down and throw us out at the next election&#148;.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08031360000111"></a>The last two points that I want to make are linked. Despite the claims of PR&#146;s supporters, its various systems can be&#151;they are not always&#151;profoundly undemocratic in two ways. In a lot cases it means, as it did until the last election in Scotland, that there has to be a coalition between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats. That meant that the views of the vast majority of Labour members, to be honest, tended to be ignored because the views of the Lib Dem members had to be taken more seriously. What is democratic about that? In system after system where there is PR, the minority rules. The governing or largest party might have only 35 or 40 per cent, but it is surely more democratic that its say holds power rather than that of the 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 per cent represented by the party on which it relies for power. We have seen that in local government in Scotland as well. There is nothing democratic about a system that says that small minorities will be more important than others in the Administration, but clearly that is often the case.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1585"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1585</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80313-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08031360000112"></a>The other undemocratic thing about PR is that, if I was standing in Scottish elections, I could not go to the electorate saying, &#147;These are my policies and this is what I am standing on. If elected, I will fulfil these promises or make every effort to do so&#148;. I have to say, &#147;These are the things that I am promising&#151;but, of course, once the election has been decided, I will have to decide with which party I am going into coalition&#148;. I would then have to go into what used to be smoke-filled rooms&#151;of course, we can no longer have those&#151;and say, &#147;Let us now decide what we are going to do in government&#148;. In that situation, the electorate have no say on what policies we will have.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08031360000113"></a>Ultimately, a democracy is not about choices between parties, or even individuals; it is about choices between policies and differences of opinion on what should be done to rule and govern the country. Surely we ought to be looking for that. As I said, first past the post is not perfect&#151;it is a long way from that&#151;but, in my view, it is considerably better than anything else.</p>

It may come as no surprise that I shall disagree with many points that have been made; indeed, it may appear that we have been reading completely different documents.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08031360000115"></a>The <I>Review of Voting Systems</I> provides, on the face of it, a balanced assessment of the different voting systems employed in the United Kingdom. I say &#147;on the face of it&#148; because the more one reads it, the more one appreciates the problems associated with the voting systems offered as alternatives to the first past the post method employed in elections to the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08031360000116"></a>The review is a valuable corrective on two levels. First, it moves the debate away from discussing proportional representation as if it were an electoral system in its own right, rather than a generic term for several electoral systems. All too often&#151;the noble Lord touched on this&#151;the debate on electoral reform has been based on a false dichotomy between PR and the first past the post system. First past the post is a specific electoral system; PR is not. Secondly, the review identifies the problems with the alternatives and does so by ensuring that none is seen to be problem-free.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08031360000117"></a>This review is not the only one to recognise problems with the additional member system; that point is well made in paragraph 6.135. Not only has AMS not got rid of adversarial politics, but it has managed to inject a new level of conflict between different types of members. The problems with the list system of election are clear, not least when a closed list is utilised. It vests power in the hands of parties and denies electors the opportunity to make a choice between candidates.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08031360000118"></a>The single transferable vote system perhaps comes out least badly from the review, but that is a consequence of the way in which other systems operate. According to the review, STV has tended to be the more proportional system in the UK, but that is because of the way in which AMS has been used. AMS can produce greatest  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1586"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1586</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proportionality, but the balance between constituency and top-up seats in Scotland and Wales has prevented it from achieving proportionality. STV can produce, and has produced, situations where one can gain a majority of seats on a minority of votes. What the review does not say in its coverage of Ireland is that it has tended to encourage excessive localism. The review does, however, draw attention to what happens in Australia, where more than 90 per cent of voters opt for a single party&#151;known as voting &#147;above the line&#148;&#151;rather than utilising the power to express a preference between candidates. This, as is noted in paragraph 7.66, constitutes an example whereby STV can be engineered to operate like a list system. The alternative vote system, or variations of it, is not a proportional system; indeed, as is clear from the review and earlier studies, it has the capacity to be even more disproportionate than the existing system.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08031360000119"></a>The strength of the review, then, is in identifying the limitations of systems that are variously held up as preferable to the first past the post method of election. They are not the glorious saviours that they are made out to be. There is little evidence that they will address the perceived malaise of contemporary politics, increase turnout significantly&#151;certainly not in the UK&#151;or engender a new attitude on the part of voters. The review thus serves a valuable purpose. The limitations of the various voting methods that the review identifies are even more apparent when one considers that it addresses only in part a particular problem with PR systems and does not address at all what arguably constitutes the principal benefit of the existing system.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08031360000120"></a>Supporters of the present electoral system tend to stress output legitimacy; that is, the consequences of the system. Opinion poll data suggest that the electorate sympathise with that view. Opponents of the system stress input legitimacy&#151;that is, the means by which the body is selected&#151;arguing the need for fairness in the relationship between votes and seats. Survey data, as shown in paragraphs 6.65 and 6.66, show that electors have sympathy with this approach as well. In other words, electors see the need for a fairer electoral system but wish to preserve the consequences of the existing system.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08031360000121"></a>Supporters of a move to a PR system have tended to enjoy a virtual monopoly in making the claim of fairness. I challenge the basis of that claim. The review touches on the basis for this challenge but does not develop it. As the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, outlined, the argument that the present electoral system is unfair rests on the fact that there is not a precise proportional relationship between seats and votes: 10 per cent of the votes won by a party do not necessarily translate into 10 per cent of the seats. That, however, misses out the last, fundamental part of the equation. One needs votes in order to gain seats, but what is the purpose of having seats in Parliament? It is to achieve a change in public policy. </p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08031360000122"></a>This brings us to the problem. The term &#147;proportional representation&#148; refers only to the relationship of votes to seats. Negotiating power in the House of Commons is excluded. Under a PR system, 10 per cent of the votes may translate more or less into 10 per cent of the

A third party may become what is known as a veto player and, in effect, exercise far more political weight than its electoral support justifies. That is not necessarily a fair system; it is certainly no fairer than the existing system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08031360000123"></a>The most important argument for the present electoral system is not developed in the review. It mentions it in opening as one of the arguments for the present system, but at paragraph 6.168 makes it clear that it is outside the scope of the study. The case for the existing system is that it delivers core accountability. As the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, mentioned, our system facilitates the return of a single party to government and, as a result, one body&#151;the party in government&#151;is answerable to electors at the next election. Election day, in Karl Popper&#146;s words, is judgment day. As the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, said, electors can sweep a Government from office. Critics point out that the Government may be elected on a minority of the votes cast, but that applies also&#151;and in many cases more so&#151;to coalitions formed under a system of PR. Parties usually fight elections as free-standing bodies and, when no one party wins a majority of seats, they form coalitions. However, post-election coalitions enjoy no definitive electoral legitimacy, because not one voter has voted for that particular combination of parties.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08031360000124"></a>The experience of other parts of the United Kingdom is instructive. In Wales, there is a coalition of Labour and Plaid Cymru. Not one voter had the opportunity to vote for that combination. If the parties stand as free-standing parties at the next election, there is no one body to hold to account. If there is a switch in coalition partners between now and the next election, that exacerbates the position. Furthermore, as the experience of Scotland demonstrates, when there is a minority Administration much depends on deals negotiated privately. There is no obvious transparency and no direct accountability.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08031360000125"></a>In short, our current system is not as bad as critics make out and the alternatives are not as wonderful as they claim. No system is perfect, but putting the defects of the present system alongside those of the alternatives leads to the conclusion that the case for change is not made&#151;indeed, the reverse is true. This review is extremely valuable in identifying many practical problems associated with the alternatives. It is most welcome.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08031360000126"></a>I conclude with a few questions to the Minister. I suspect that on the broad question of electoral systems the noble Lord will be non-committal, emphasising the pros and cons of what we have. However, it will be valuable to have his response on three matters for which the Government are responsible and which are touched on in the review. First, as is clear from the review, there is little to justify the use, in any list system, of a closed as opposed to an open list, as that system denies voter choice. Given the problems associated with closed lists, could the Minister justify their continued employment?</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08031360000127"></a>Secondly, as was apparent in the debates at the time, there is little to justify the ban on dual candidacy. As the review explains, the Government introduced it  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1588"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1588</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in 2006 for Wales but the Arbuthnott commission recommended against it for Scotland. The Electoral Commission noted that only Ukraine had tried to ban dual candidacy, prior to the country&#146;s 2002 elections. Other countries with AMS permit it. Could the Minister remind us why banning dual candidacy is correct for Wales but not correct for Scotland or the rest of the world?</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08031360000128"></a>Thirdly, paragraph 5.120 of the review records the Electoral Commission&#146;s observation that individual registration in Northern Ireland has resulted in a much more accurate and robust electoral register. This again is something that we have discussed. Is it not time that we moved to individual registration in the rest of the United Kingdom? There are clear concerns surrounding the integrity of the electoral register and we need to address these as expeditiously as possible.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08031360000129"></a>These are issues on which we should make progress. Let us focus on improving the systems that we now have and not on destroying the benefits of our existing system of electing the other place.</p>

However, before I do that, I would like to make a couple of brief comments on the previous two speeches.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08031360000131"></a>First, I have to say that I was rather startled by the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, that having a Government elected by 35 per cent of the voters was somehow more democratic than a coalition Government elected jointly by something over 50 per cent of the voters. This point was taken up in a slightly different way by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. He said that having a coalition Government was not democratic, because not one voter had voted for the particular combination of policies adopted by the coalition. In a sense, that is true, but it is illogical because that really is a serious argument only if one can assume that everyone who voted for one party was thereby consciously supporting its every proposal. Many people vote for a party whose policy they like on balance; hardly any of them would personally adopt every single proposal that is made. It may well be, therefore, that the policy of a coalition Government may more accurately represent the views of those who voted for one or other of those parties than the policy of the party for which they voted on its own.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08031360000132"></a>Let me address the question of what would be the best system for electing Members of your Lordships&#146; House, if and when it becomes wholly or mainly elected. I am not going to talk about whether we should become an elected House; we have debated that issue ad nauseam and no doubt we will continue to debate it on other occasions. There is a clear possibility that legislation may be passed in the next Parliament&#151;plainly not in this one&#151;to make your Lordships&#146; House a wholly or mainly elected House. It does not follow in any way that the system that is  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1589"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1589</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>appropriate for electing Members of the House of Commons should also be the system for electing Members of your Lordships&#146; House. I am well aware, as the noble Lord, Lord Norton, pointed out, that there is no such thing as an ideal electoral system.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08031360000133"></a>I start from what seems to me a pretty obvious proposition&#151;that the system for electing Members of your Lordships&#146; House should at least be different from the present system for electing Members of the House of Commons. That is because one of the main duties of your Lordships&#146; House is to act as a check on the abuse of power by the Government, which may have been elected, as the present Government were, by as little as 35 per cent of those who voted and, of course, by a much smaller proportion of those eligible to vote. Your Lordships&#146; House would be quite unable to exercise that duty of providing a check on the abuse of power effectively if a majority of elected Peers were members of the government party, as could well be the result if first past the post was chosen as the system for electing Members of your Lordships&#146; House. That would obviously be the case if your Lordships&#146; House was wholly elected, and it would be the consequence even if only, for example, 80 per cent were elected and a number of Cross-Benchers remained.</p>

<a name="80313-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08031360000134"></a>Therefore, it follows that if your Lordships&#146; House is to carry out its functions, at least so long as the House of Commons is elected by first past the post we cannot have the same system for election to your Lordships&#146; House. That applies also if the House of Commons was elected by the alternative vote, which can occasionally produce even more distorted results than first past the post, as happened in the French elections some years ago and as might well have happened in the United Kingdom in 2005, according to the table on page 130 of the report. Only if STV was accepted for election to the House of Commons would it be appropriate to have both Houses elected by the same system. I do not think that a list system would be appropriate for election to the House of Commons, because it is clear that there is strong popular support for having a local MP or MPs. Therefore, while STV does that in normally producing constituencies with between four and seven or eight Members, there would be very limited numbers. Of course, ordinary electors would have the advantage of having an MP who, although possibly a little less local than at present, would have the same political views as them, so they might feel happier about approaching them. We are getting a little closer if we have the first past the post plus a top-up system, as used for the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, or a similar system recommended by the Jenkins commission, but if that were adopted for the House of Commons, it would not be appropriate for your Lordships' House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08031360000135"></a>What is left on the list for your Lordships' House is either the list system or STV, both of which would be acceptable. We have experience of both systems in the United Kingdom. The list system has been used for European elections since 1999. STV has been used in Northern Ireland since 1921 and was recently extended to local government elections in Scotland. STV has many advantages: it gives voters a chance to vote for  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1590"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1590</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>individuals rather than parties if they wish to do so and to give successive preferences to people from different parties. Of course, it has drawbacks. Garret FitzGerald, the former Taoiseach of Ireland, once said in an article I read with interest that Members of the Dail tended to spend too little time in the Dail and too much in local pubs chatting up potential voters. With STV, to some extent, the real opponents of the candidates are not the other parties but the other candidates in their own party.</p>

Will the noble Lord address two subsequent points? What would that do in terms of the relative democratic legitimacy of the House of Commons and the House of Lords and what would be the implications for the supremacy of the House of Commons, which I understand the noble Lord supports?</p>

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="08031360000137"></a><b><a name="80313-0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08031360000657"></a>Lord Goodhart:</b> My Lords, of course I support the democratic legitimacy of the House of Commons. That is why I would welcome the House of Commons moving either to STV or to the Scottish and Welsh system of first past the post plus top-ups or alternative vote plus top-ups. That would wholly preserve or indeed improve the democratic legitimacy of the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08031360000138"></a>STV is ultimately a good system. It is likely to produce a membership of your Lordships' House that is proportional to the votes cast. The alternative to STV for your Lordships' House, although not for the House of Commons, would be the list system. One change to that, which is accepted by everyone as being needed, would be to change from a closed list to an open one, so that people could vote for the individual if they chose to do so, rather than voting simply for the party list in the order in which it appears on the ballot paper. That was the position taken by my party when the system was introduced, and that change would not be difficult to make.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08031360000139"></a>It is also true that an STV system would give greater diversity to the membership of your Lordships' House as shown by the fact that UKIP and the Greens have MEPs but no Members of either House of Parliament&#151;apart from two Members of UKIP and one of the Green Party in your Lordships' House, all of whom arrived here originally as members of other parties.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08031360000140"></a>To sum up, I am convinced that for an elected House of Lords to carry out its duties, in particular its scrutiny of the work of the Government, first, no one party should have a majority of the elected Members of your Lordships&#146; House; secondly, to minimise the risk of that occurring, the system of elections to this House must be different to that for elections to the House of Commons, unless that is STV; and, thirdly, on the assumption that elections to the House of Commons will continue to be by first past the post or broadly similar systems, elections to your Lordships&#146; House should be by either STV or an open list system.</p>

As many of your Lordships know, I chaired the Power commission for the Rowntree trusts in 2006. We undertook an extensive research programme in order to understand why people were feeling increasingly alienated and detached from formal politics&#151;not all politics, but formal politics. Crucially, we also undertook to arrive at a series of recommendations to help renew British democracy.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08031360000142"></a>I regret to say that few aspects of the political system we investigated received more hostile comment than the main political parties. The expert and practitioner evidence, the public submissions and all the research projects we undertook revealed a widespread sense that the main parties were at best failing in the basic function of connecting governed and governors, and were at worst a serious obstacle to democratic engagement. Such hostility towards the parties inevitably feeds into alienation from the election processes. It was shocking to find such strength of feeling on the subject among the general public.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08031360000143"></a>The attraction of voting is bound to be severely reduced if the main parties vying for the vote are widely regarded as not offering much choice generally in terms of what they stand for, or if they are regarded as unappealing. But that is how the situation was described to us. The noble Lord, Lord Norton, referred to Popper saying that voting day is judgment day, but in the last general election more people abstained than voted for my party, the party that won. We should be alarmed about that, and concerned about what it means.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08031360000144"></a>Immediately after the 2005 general election we conducted a survey among those who had not voted. We found that approximately 45 per cent of them had not voted because they did not like what the main parties had to offer. I listen with great care to someone with the experience of my noble friend Lord Maxton; I respect that experience. However, we have to be careful not to sound arrogant by saying that the first past the post system has served us well, therefore we should not change it. Perhaps it did serve us well in the past, but I think that we have to listen well to the public and their concerns. I know that my noble friend Lord Maxton would be anxious to hear what the public feel about this. Of course it is absolutely right that opposition or small parties are always the ones that ask for an examination of the voting system; our party, the Labour Party, did so back in the days when it still was a small party. However, the fact that the issue is raised by small parties does not invalidate the argument about the need to create spaces where voices can be heard. It is important that we do that.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08031360000145"></a>This alienation is compounded by the electoral system. In submissions we received from the public, the most common reason cited for their low turn-out was a belief that they had no chance of having an impact on the final outcome. They felt their votes did not count. They described the situation as follows: &#147;I live in a constituency where the Conservatives always win, so what&#146;s the point in my voting when I&#146;m not  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1592"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1592</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>going to vote for them?&#148;; or &#147;Why should I vote if the Liberals always win in my constituency?&#148;; or &#147;Labour always wins&#148;.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08031360000146"></a>People who vote for a party that has no chance of winning feel there is no point in going to the polls. Our survey of non-voters in the 2005 general election upheld that view. Nearly half of those not voting said they would be more likely to vote if they felt that their candidate had at least a chance of winning power or finding a place in governance. So not only are the main parties unappealing to many voters; the electoral system itself ensures that casting a vote for a preferred alternative is widely seen as a waste of energy. That should matter to us. The simple calculation made by millions of citizens is that the choice at election time is to vote either for a party that one dislikes or for one that stands no chance of parliamentary representation let alone a place in government.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08031360000147"></a>We as a nation have changed. The public have changed. The old allegiances and bonds are changing, and have been for many years. We are a citizenry in transition. The old political allegiances are changing; they are less tribal. The public&#146;s aspirations are changing, too. As active Labour Party members in the 1950s, my parents&#146; hope was that they would have decent housing, with bathrooms and hot water, a good education system for their children, and security in work. My parents had been through the depression and knew what it was like to be workless. In many ways, some of that has been secured. But the aspirations of our varied population are changing and shifting.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08031360000148"></a>We have also seen a real decline in the old social and economic conditions, but a new political formulation has yet to be developed to effectively represent and shape the new interests and values emerging in our post-industrial society. Our political parties are of course seeking to reform, but they tend to do so by huddling round a central ground, seeking votes only in the marginal constituencies that we hear so much about. As a result, many people&#151;even in the parties, and even in the Labour Party&#151;feel very disillusioned about the party which they thought was theirs. The same is happening now in the Conservative Party, and I am sure it will happen also in the Liberal Democrat Party. Once people huddle round the same set of issues, they start feeling that the things that they have cared about are no longer of importance to their leadership.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08031360000149"></a>It is very important that spaces are made for people&#146;s voices to be heard, not only within parties but within the system. We have to deal with this disengagement, and the electoral system is one of the things that we have to look at. That is why I welcome this debate. The main parties are still the only serious contenders for power on offer to the electorate. However, we also have to give space for other possibilities to emerge. That is how we can draw the young back into our formal politics. That is how we can create new passions about how our world and society can be changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08031360000150"></a>Let us consider this House, which, I regret to say, is increasingly more respected than the other place. One of the reasons is that, although it is unelected, none of the parties here has a majority; we have to struggle to  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1593"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1593</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>assemble one. That is healthy for democracy. We should recognise the things that are necessary to re-energise our democratic system.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08031360000151"></a>The electorate occasionally attempt to break the monopoly, when the rare opportunity presents itself. We have seen that in the sudden and often unexpected burst of support for an independent candidate, or for small parties that effectively engage sections of the public. It can be seen also in the rise of tactical voting, as sections of the electorate realise that, in some constituencies, they can at least vote meaningfully against something they do not like even if they cannot vote meaningfully for something they do like. But those are exceptional moments and they do little to bolster the health of electoral democracy. People will feel, &#147;I&#146;m voting tactically but I&#146;d like to be voting for something and someone I believe in&#148;. That is where the health of democracy lies.</p>

Is there any evidence that citizens would be revitalised, or that the alternative electoral systems would deliver what she is detailing?</p>

Many academics across the board, including Professor Patrick Dunleavy at the LSE and Professor Pippa Norris at Harvard, have found that fewer votes are wasted and turnout has declined less in countries that have proportional systems with a wider array of parties. This is not an answer to a maiden&#146;s prayer, let me assure you. The Power inquiry did not recommend a particular system. Like others, I have deep reservations about any kind of list system because of power being vested too much in political parties rather than in people. The single transferable vote may be the one to look at. The decision on what should be done was left open for this sort of debate. Fairer voting and making votes count is but one way of re-energising people so that they feel that if they vote for someone, their at vote will count in some way within the whole system.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08031360000154"></a>The Power commission concluded that one way of reconnecting people with their political parties and hence with elections is to introduce greater flexibility into the monopoly of the present party system. An electoral arrangement is needed that is sufficiently responsive to the much more fluid and diverse identities and values of our contemporary electorate. Such a change is necessary to ensure that large numbers of citizens feel that there is something on offer to them at election time. It is time that we offered voters the same choice in politics that the main parties constantly tell those same voters they desire in public service provision. If choice is the mantra of the day, then choice should be more available in this area, too. The need to change our electoral system is critical and should be regarded as urgent. We have now reached a point in our political history where democracy is at risk because people are voting less and less. The argument for change is now as much about what is expedient for the future of democracy in Britain as it is a matter of principle.</p>

I have to admit that that is true. I have only once in my life made a speech on electoral reform and that was in the safety of British Columbia during the referendum campaign, which was narrowly lost. It did not reach the 60 per cent threshold. One reason for hesitating was that when I was elected to the other place, I was the only Member in the House of Commons to represent three counties. I had a very large constituency and I always had doubts about the effect of multi-Member seats in creating even larger areas to be represented by the electorate.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08031360000157"></a>The other reason for my hesitation was that during the by-election which I won in 1965, we had 53 public meetings, three a night, again because of the very large area. That meant finding other people to hold the first two meetings while the candidate was getting to the third one. I distinctly remember that out of all the meetings that I held, most of which were extremely successful, the one disaster was in Melrose. Two of my local stalwarts were holding the meeting and I was detained by the enthusiasm of the two previous meetings so I was an hour late. When I got there I could tell there was something quite wrong in the atmosphere. The two stalwarts had each delivered a half-hour lecture on the virtues of the single transferable vote. They were assisted in this by one of these roller blackboards in the schoolroom covered with hieroglyphics of the d&#146;Hondt formula. The audience were stupefied by the time I arrived and I was never quite able to recover them. I was reminded of that when I read this quite mind-numbing document. I cannot honestly see the great British public rushing to the bookshops to spend &#163;33.45 to read the review of electoral systems, but I admire the enthusiasm of everybody else for this subject.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08031360000158"></a>I should like to pick up something the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, said when he talked about the constitutional convention in Scotland. It is quite true that the additional member system which we arrived at was a compromise between the two parties. But, with respect, I do not agree that the motivation for the compromise on the Labour side was out of deference to, or fear of, the Liberal Democrats. It was quite simply that we looked back to the failure of the referendum in the 1970s. This is an illustration of the fact that electoral systems  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1595"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1595</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can matter to the public. In 1970, one of the great fears that the electorate in Scotland had, which meant that the referendum did not carry, was that we were adding another tier of government. We had two tiers of local government at that point but by the 1990s it was reduced to one. Secondly, there was the anxiety that the first past the post system proposed in the 1970s would result in virtually permanent Labour majority rule in Scotland. That was a major factor, and when it was changed to offer the people of Scotland a proportional election system, there is no doubt in my mind that that was a significant factor in the enthusiasm with which the whole package was greeted in the referendum in 1997. It demonstrates that political systems can have an impact. Even if the public are not interested in the details which we are arguing here today, the principle of proportionality was, in my view, a major factor in the enthusiasm for the Scottish settlement.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08031360000159"></a>The system that was agreed as a compromise between the two parties was the additional member system. I know that confession is good for the soul but I must admit that I very much welcomed that, for the reasons I have explained. I had doubts about the single transferable vote. Whereas most of my party regarded this as a slightly unhappy compromise, I was delighted. I have now to admit that I think I was wrong. I do not believe that the additional member system has proved a success in Scotland. Both this report and the Arbuthnott commission referred to the tensions between list members and constituency members. As Presiding Officer in the Parliament, I became very aware of the fact that we had two classes of Member. That is why I say to my noble friend Lord Goodhart that if the day ever comes that we have a vote on an elected system for the House of Lords&#151;which I doubt&#151;I will be in the Lobby voting for a wholly elected system and not one which has two classes of Members.</p>

<a name="80313-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08031360000160"></a>It is more than just the atmosphere within the Chamber I am talking about. At a constituency level, the present system is extremely destructive. Let me give the example of the constituency where I live. The Member elected to the Scottish Parliament is a former assistant of mine&#151;as one would expect, a very talented, young man, well trained&#151;and he is elected as a Liberal Democrat Member. At the previous election, two of his opponents&#151;the Scottish Nationalist and the Conservative&#151;failed to get elected, of course, but were elected on the list system. So they sit in the same Chamber and take great delight in criticising the Member who has been duly elected and interfere in his constituency. Why? Because they intend to stand again at the next election. Indeed, the Scottish Nationalist, has stood four or five times, with a distinct lack of success. Although she is written off by journalists in Scotland as being part of the batty tendency of the SNP, batty or not, she can be a real nuisance in the democratic system where there is an elected Member in the constituency and a regional list member meddling in constituency affairs with a view to increasing their vote at the next election. So it is not a happy system and I believe that the single transferable vote would have been a better choice for the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08031360000161"></a>Indeed, although my noble friend Lord Roberts of Llandudno will tell us that the Welsh Assembly has to some extent overcome this problem by stopping people standing for both the list and in the constituency, that is a temporary compromise. The system itself is defective. I am more and more convinced of that by the experience of the introduction of the single transferable vote for local elections. Again, I am now represented in my area by several councillors of different political persuasions. The system has worked well and has been well received, and the atmosphere and co-operation between the councillors are good. There is a strong contrast on the ground between that and the additional member system as practised in Scotland. This will astonish my colleagues, but my support has come around to the single transferable vote. Even if&#151;God rest Enid Lakeman&#146;s soul&#151;I never again speak on the subject, I am in favour of it.</p>

I should say at the outset that my remarks are likely to be minority remarks on these Benches, with the noble and notable exception of my noble friend Lady Kennedy of The Shaws. I was slightly disappointed that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said that he felt that the first past the post system may have been appropriate in what he called the bipolar political atmosphere of the 1950s but that it is no longer appropriate. I agree with his conclusion but not with the means by which he gets there, because his argument seems to a great extent to pander to the accusations that the Liberal Democrats have self-interest at the heart of their arguments and that the fact that they are doing rather better than the Liberal Party in the mid-1950s is the reason for changing the electoral system. That in no way advances the noble Lord&#146;s case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08031360000163"></a>None the less, I, like the noble Lord, Lord Steel, have had experience of two elected Parliaments as well as your Lordships&#146; House, and I have come around to the view, particularly after experiencing the Scottish Parliament, that a proportional system&#151;or, rather, a more proportional system; there is no ideally proportional system, although the STV is probably the most proportional&#151;has, despite the Government of Scotland at the moment, served the people of Scotland well. I say that without any question of party advantage in mind. The Government of Scotland have served the people of Scotland well because they have enabled them to say, &#147;We want a change&#148;. This is what happened in May 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08031360000164"></a>Other noble Lords have argued that first past the post is the only means of calling a government to account on election day, and if people do not like them collectively, they can force them out and bring in a government of another hue. The question is whether it should be a government of just one hue or two, or perhaps even a rainbow coalition of parties, but that is the will of the people and if the people say, &#147;You&#146;re all minorities. We are not willing to give power to any one of you. You get together in any way that you see fit and come to a majority position where you can find a means of running the country&#148;, that is

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08031360000165"></a>Proportionality is not a new idea. The Jenkins commission in 1998 recommended changing from first past the post, although disappointingly only to AV+, which is a little like the French system, which is not proportional. The Power commission of my noble friend Lady Kennedy in 2004 said simply that we needed a more responsive electoral system. That was difficult, because it was not within the commission&#146;s remit to go further than that, but the message was fairly clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08031360000166"></a>I disagree fundamentally with my noble friend Lord Maxton&#151;and he is a friend&#151;who said that first past the post is better than any alternative. I do not agree&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Steel, referred to this&#151;that, following the Scottish Constitutional Convention, of which I was also a member, Donald Dewar, the then Secretary of State for Scotland, should have gone back on a commitment in the 1997 election manifesto for the Labour Party and resorted to a first past the post system for the Scottish Parliament. That would have been disastrous, and I must say to my noble friend that I do not think that that is something that Donald Dewar would have ever seriously considered, given the way in which he conducted politics. I understand why my noble friend said that, possibly in the light of events since then.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08031360000167"></a>We are now in the third Session of the Scottish Parliament. The first two were Labour/Liberal Democrat coalitions, and the third is an SNP minority. The situation has been similar in Wales, with coalitions and minority Administrations. Neither Scotland nor Wales has ground to a halt in the past eight and a half years, despite the fact no one party has been in power for that time. I know very little of Wales, but it seems that there has been a feeling that this is different from Westminster in that it is a different way of having a level of government. The question then is: if you accept that a more proportional system is appropriate at the local government level or the &#147;regional&#148; government level, is it appropriate at the national level as well? I would say that it is.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08031360000168"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Steel, referred to the not unimportant issue in proportional systems, particularly those that use the additional member system, of the friction between the constituency Members and the list members. I encountered that as well. The noble Lord may recall from his days as Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament that he established a committee, of which I was a member, to look at how best we could finesse the emerging problems in the early days of the Scottish Parliament, whereby, as he suggested, unsuccessful candidates could appear across the Chamber from directly elected Members who had seen them off at the ballot box.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08031360000169"></a>My view is clear; the Welsh have gone down the right road&#151;you should not be able to stand in two categories. You make your choice wherever you think you have the best chance of being elected and you are stuck with it one way or the other. That gets over that problem. However, I did not encounter list members trying to take over the duties of the elected Member to  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1598"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1598</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>any great extent. Nor did I find list members falling over themselves to take up constituency cases or campaigning particularly actively. One of the recommendations of the committee to which I referred and which the noble Lord, Lord Steel, chaired was that list members must demonstrate that they were active in more than one of the constituencies that formed the region which they represented. If that were to be followed through and firmed up, that would ensure that they represented a larger part than just one constituency, although that is very much for the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Assembly to tackle. How those issues are approached is very much a question of practice. They are certainly not insuperable problems. There is no evidence in countries such as Germany or Spain that those issues have sustained for a number of years.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08031360000170"></a>That leads to me a comment made by, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, that first past the post was uniquely effective in changing a government. If you were a voter in recent years in Spain, Germany or Sweden, you would feel that you had pretty effectively changed your government fairly dramatically in general elections under proportional systems. I understand the noble Lord&#146;s comments, but it is perfectly possible under proportional systems to have a fairly dramatic change of government, particularly in Sweden where the Social Democrats lost power after many years.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08031360000171"></a>I shall say a little about proportional representation and the way in which it impacts on voters. I notice that the review found no voting system to be inherently more confusing than another for the voter in terms of casting votes correctly. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, who said in his opening remarks that, despite a lot of reports in UK newspapers that the electoral system in Scotland confused voters to such an extent that there were many spoilt papers in Scotland in the May 2007 elections, that has been shown to be completely untrue. It was not the new system of the STV that confused people, as one might have thought it would the first time it ever applied in Scotland, but the system that Scotland had also used in 1999 and 2003. The problem was that the system had moved from two separate ballot papers to one ballot paper.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08031360000172"></a>The independent Gould report, which looked into those issues, reported that there were two major ways in which confusion could be avoided. One was to have a much longer lead-in time to explain the changes to people. The second was not to combine local elections with the Scottish Parliament election on the same day. It is interesting that the Scottish Parliament has since legislated for that, and there will be no recurrence of it. That is an important aspect.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08031360000173"></a>The link between a member and the constituency is important but can be overstated. Noble Lords have referred to the fact that often under first past the post a small number of voters decide the outcome for the whole UK election. Not only do a large number of people not have a say in the ultimate outcome of a general election in the UK under first past the post but also the three major political parties tailor their election manifestos to a small, narrow number of people&#151;a clearly unrepresentative part of the electorate. Parts of the electorate get a disproportionate amount of attention  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1599"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1599</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when it comes to drawing up those manifestos. These key people&#151;perhaps as few as 10,000, about 3 per cent of the electorate&#151;have to be catered for because they are believed to hold the outcome of an election in their hands.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08031360000174"></a>That is not particularly health for democracy. Better to be able to make a broader approach to different parts of the electorate in a more positive manner and hope that they will in turn vote positively because they can see that there is something in it for them. There is nothing wrong with the way the electorate votes being influenced to some extent by what will benefit them personally. They will also vote because it will actually influence the outcome of the election.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08031360000175"></a>It is clear that we are some way yet from a change to the method by which the other place is elected. As far as this House is concerned, I would not like to say how long it will be&#151;if at all&#151;before change comes about. I echo the position of the noble Lord, Lord Steel, in that I voted a year ago for a fully elected House of Lords. That is the way forward. Yet what is to be decided in the other place is of greater urgency. It should hold primacy but, if you have two elected Houses, ultimately there has to be some means found of reconciling them. That will have to be done before we move towards thinking about what method of election is utilised.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08031360000176"></a>It is often said that nothing stands still, which is not always true at all. Yet it is true much of the time in politics and political parties are constantly renewing themselves, their approach and polices. It seems illogical then that the way they are elected at UK level should not be capable of being renewed. It is instructive to note that while the other place has firmly maintained first past the post as the means of its election, electoral systems elsewhere in the world and other parts of the UK have moved on. They have done so significantly in the various parliaments and assemblies that noble Lords have referred to. It is hard to maintain why the two Houses here should not move on, too.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08031360000177"></a>The question of renewing and reenergising democracy that the noble Lord, Lord Norton, raised with my noble friend Lady Kennedy is important. If people feel more involved they are more likely to think that voting is important. That is particularly true in young people. We know the way in which the level of voting in young people is going at the moment. Though it is not my own view, it is clear that first past the post will continue for the foreseeable future. Yet the sands will shift sooner rather than later and when they do they will shift decisively.</p>

I remember a television clip of a polling station in Soweto. The polling lasted at least three days because there were so many people waiting to vote. There was one old lady who had been there for two days. On the second evening, when she was just  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1600"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1600</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about to enter the polling station, it closed&#151;it was the end of polling for the day. A television reporter asked her whether she did not feel sad that she had lost a chance to vote after two days in the queue. She said, &#147;No, I&#146;ve waited 60 years for the opportunity to vote. What is one more night? This lady represented so many people who had been disenfranchised over so many years. To her, having a vote was something to be treasured, something precious. Every vote deserves its recognition, to be given a value and the best opportunity possible to exercise some influence.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08031360000179"></a>We speak sometimes of &#147;strong government&#148;. I have spoken to the Minister about this before. That lady in Soweto had experienced strong government. She had experienced the government of apartheid. The people of Germany experienced Adolf Hitler&#146;s strong government. Mussolini, Franco, too, had strong governments. Is government just to be strong or is it to be representative? I suggest, particularly to those who have doubts about changing systems, that government must be representative of every person. Those ladies in Soweto, and the people who were disenfranchised for so many years in Russia and other places, now have the opportunity of making their views known.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08031360000180"></a>When governments are elected on the present voting system, we know that 38 per cent of those who vote can return a government. Some 62 per cent of votes are then not of the same value. Those votes are largely dismissed. Strong government is said to be more important than representative government. I strongly argue that that must not be the case. When we speak of coalitions and so on, we must learn that we are living in a different generation where people must live, work and discuss together. That is a mature approach. Any voting system must be fair and give fair representation. There, first past the post is a failure.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08031360000181"></a>When there were only two parties you could say that first past the post largely worked, though electorates in different constituencies meant that some people elected somebody with a larger number of votes than in another constituency. In the election of 1906, only two constituencies in Wales&#151;Gower and Monmouth&#151;had more than two candidates. It was a straight fight everywhere else. In the election of January 1910, there was only one three-cornered fight in Wales, in Swansea Town. In December 1910, there were only two three-cornered fights. Straight fights or unopposed returns were the norm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08031360000182"></a>Since then, of course, there has been the emergence of third and fourth parties. In 1910 there was one three-cornered fight. In 1918, with the emergence of the Labour Party in Wales, there were 11 three-cornered fights. Now you get elections in Wales with four candidates&#151;Plaid, Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat. Under first past the post, a Member can be elected with less than 30 per cent of the vote. That happened in Scotland, in Inverness about 30 years ago, with a Member elected with just 26 per cent of the vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08031360000183"></a>First past the post is the system of the dinosaur. It worked yesterday but does not work today. It is not representative today. This is true not only of individual consistencies but also of Wales as a whole. In 1997,  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1601"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1601</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Labour polled 43.2 per cent of the vote but elected 34 of the 40 Members of Parliament. That has been the same story since 1970&#151;less than 40 per cent of the vote gave a majority of the Members. First past the post does not produce a representative result.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08031360000184"></a>We have the top-up system for Wales, Scotland and the London Assembly. In Scotland, with 32 per cent of votes Labour won 37 constituency seats. The SNP, with one per cent more, 33 per cent, won 21 constituency seats. Is 37 to 21 a fair result? It was the introduction of the top-up system that changed that situation and the result was 47 seats for SNP and 46 for Labour. Otherwise the Government of Scotland under first past the post would have been very different from what we see today. At the most recent elections for the Welsh Assembly, the Labour Party had 32.2 per cent of the vote and won 24 out of the 40 seats. The system changed with top-up and now there is a different sort of government. The type of electoral system changes governments. In Scotland and Wales, it will be different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08031360000185"></a>Until now, we know that the Conservative Party and the Labour Party have supported the first past the post system. They merely say, &#147;Over my dead body&#148;. But the internal elections of those parties use a proportional system. If some sort of proportional system is not acceptable in the country at large, why is it used by the Labour Party and the Conservative Party for their internal elections? About two years ago, the Conservatives elected a new leader. The MPs had the first say on voting for a new leader. In the first round, David Davis got 62 votes and David Cameron got 56 votes. Under the first past the post system, David Davis would have been elected as leader of the Conservative Party. A few months ago, the Labour Party elected a deputy leader. In the first ballot, Jon Cruddas won 19.39 per cent of the vote and Harriet Harman got 18.9 per cent. So Jon Cruddas is the deputy leader: but, no, he is not, because what is right for the country is not accepted by the Labour Party itself. That is rank hypocrisy. Will the Minister explain why? I could go on, but I must not because I can get very passionate when I see injustices of this nature.</p>

I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Steel, that people will not flock to the bookstalls to buy a copy. In fact, I dare say that noble Lords taking part in this debate probably represent quite a significant proportion of those who have read the volume.

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08031360000188"></a>I speak as someone who has always supported the system of first past the post, and my support has grown. That perhaps is in denial of my own experience, because few people in this House have lost as many elections under the first past the post system as I have managed to do. I think that I could have been forgiven for embracing any other electoral system that might have put my name at the top of the results. But, no, I am a passionate supporter of the first past the post system and I shall spell out some of the reasons later.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08031360000189"></a>I am keen on this document because, despite supporting the first past the post system, I have always historically felt at a disadvantage in this kind of discussion. It has always taken the form of one group of people saying that proportional representation is wonderful for all sorts of reasons. People like me have had the job of saying, &#147;Well, the first past the post system&#151;with which everyone is very familiar and therefore familiar, as I certainly am, with its disadvantages&#151;is an aspiration against a reality&#148;. That is the form of the debate.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08031360000190"></a>The great joy of this document is that it gives us a wealth of evidence on the strengths and weaknesses of practical systems that have been adopted in this country for the past 11 years. We need no longer talk about the wonders of proportional representation; we can talk about the precise experience of how it is operated in a number of different systems. The noble Lord, Lord Steel, was frank, as usual, in acknowledging that other systems have their disadvantages as they have performed in practice in this country. As I expected, it is a joy to have this discussion now and not have to be on the defensive all the time; to be able to point out from this document, which I am sure we have all read, the failings as have been exhibited in a number of systems that have been tried. They were tried for good reasons, and I supported their introduction, as a supporter of the Government, but they now have serious weaknesses.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08031360000191"></a>What are my conclusions about the practical experience, as evidenced by this report? Obviously, it demonstrates beyond any argument that all systems have clear weaknesses. That is unarguable. It is logically inevitable that the only person who can represent me or anyone else is me or anyone else. Any system which tries to reduce an electorate of 60 million, as in Britain, to&#151;let us say for the sake of argument&#151;600, is bound to have distortions between the one and the other. At least we can start with the clear agreement that all systems have faults.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08031360000192"></a>We can also agree that far from solving or concluding the debate about the merits of different systems, the series of proportional systems that we have had in the past nine or 10 years has, if anything, extended the debate and created a greater uncertainty, assuming that there was an uncertainty before. The electoral systems I hear criticised most frequently&#151;indeed, in this debate&#151;are the system for electing the European Parliament&#151;people have a lot of criticisms of that proportional system&#151;and, as two or three noble Lords have mentioned, the dual system in Scotland and Wales. We hear endlessly about the discussions and debates between the people on the list and those who are elected directly. But I make a lateral comment about it: in Scotland and Wales you have the two sides  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1603"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1603</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the argument within one electoral system. There are those like me, who favour individual Members representing individual constituencies, and those like many other speakers in this debate who prefer lists.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08031360000193"></a>I put this question and I leave it in the air: is anyone suggesting that the people on the list in those systems are more legitimately representative than the people directly elected in the individual constituencies? I would say that the evidence is overwhelmingly the reverse. If we are talking about the legitimacy of elections and the legitimacy of people speaking on behalf of others, there is no doubt, in my view, that the people directly elected in an individual constituency are seen as the most legitimate and, I would guess, even by supporters of proportional representation. Obviously, there are better experts on Scotland and Wales than me here today, but, as I understand it, if there is any movement from an elected representative being chosen by one mechanism rather than the other, there is no movement whatever from people representing constituencies saying, &#147;No, I want to abandon the constituency. I want to be on a list because that is more legitimate&#148;. I have not heard that argument.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08031360000194"></a>The other thing that we can learn from this document goes to the heart of a lot of the discussion. There is no evidence here that will encourage people to think that there is a magic solution on turnout and on engaging the electorate as a result of the methods of proportional representation used in this country. On the contrary: the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, quoted from the same paragraph that I am about to quote from, although he inadvertently did not complete the sentence. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, quoted from paragraph 23, on page 12. He quoted:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08031360000519"></a>&#147;International evidence suggests that proportional systems have around five percent higher turn-out&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000492"></a>I shall complete the sentence which continues,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000540"></a>&#147;but this has not been the experience of the new systems introduced in the UK&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000493"></a>That is the evidence of the document.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08031360000195"></a>In past debates, I have had a kind of inferiority complex about how to handle the argument&#151;and it has been deployed in this debate&#151;that there are lots of people itching to vote in safe seats for the other party who will be liberated if there is a proportional system so that all votes count. I seem to remember from the past that there is a phrase in there somewhere. There is no evidence whatever that that has happened in the European, the Scottish or the Welsh elections.</p>

People vote for the Chamber&#151;if I can use that term&#151;that they feel is most important. Therefore local government is less so than a Parliament or Assembly, which in turn is less important than national Government. The comparison, if my noble friend wants to make it, should be with national Governments here and in other countries which perhaps use a proportional system.</p>

I am pretty wary of making comparisons internationally. Similar systems operate differently in different countries. The best comparisons are those  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1604"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1604</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that exist in our own country. To complete one or two statistics on this, in the first European elections&#151;and the first experiment under proportional representation&#151;24 per cent turned out to vote. For the London Assembly elections, 32 per cent and 36 per cent turned out. The figure was a bit higher in Wales and Scotland, but there is no evidence to support the contention that a proportional system will make more people come to the polls.</p>

<a name="80313-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08031360000198"></a>These papers also demonstrate that it does not improve the involvement of the electorate with their Member of Parliament, elected by whatever mechanism. We knew that&#151;or should have&#151;from the earlier report on electoral systems, published in 2003. It said about the European elections:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08031360000520"></a>&#147;Few MEPs felt that their constituency workload had increased, despite the move to larger multi-member regions. The vast bulk of MEPs admitted that their constituency workload had not increased (a mere 8% claimed that it had); if anything, the amount of constituency work has declined&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000494"></a>That is only one measure of the link between the elected representative and the electorate, but it is a pretty important one. It seems that first past the post is reflecting the truth accurately when it says that it provides a link with the electorate that other mechanisms do not.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80313-0006.htm"/>


<a name="80313-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08031360000199"></a>Finally, I move to my own thoughts on the first past the post system, though I could have said that it is all in the report: there is no great public support for a change in the electoral system. The link between the Member and his or her constituents is at the heart of our democracy. I find it slightly paradoxical when I look at the Liberal Benches because they are always, quite rightly, very proud of their constituencies. Although I disagree with them on many things, I acknowledge freely that the majority worked assiduously on behalf of their constituents. They get their sustenance from that. When I was doing constituency work, it was for my benefit as much as for the constituents. It is where you recharge your batteries and have your values reinforced. Breaking that link by having bigger constituencies, as the noble Lord, Lord Steel, has said, would remove something precious. We should be extremely careful about that.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08031360000200"></a>In conclusion, far from this report giving us evidence that might help us to make a decision to change the electoral system in the House of Commons, which was part of its remit, it has given an awful lot of evidence why we should not change the electoral system in the House of Commons. Although I would not recommend vast changes quickly, it raises serious questions about the claims made in the abstract for proportional representation in the various systems that have been tested and how they worked out in practice. They have almost completely, it seems to me, failed to live up to the dream. I hope that my noble friend can reassure me that no drastic changes down the other end will be proposed imminently.</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1605"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1605</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>losing the 1997 general election. The talks, which my noble friend Lord Tyler referred to, were jointly chaired by my noble friend Lord Maclennan of Rogart and the late Robin Cook. Participants included my noble friend Lord McNally and, on the Labour side, significant figures such as Jack Straw, now the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice. The joint secretary for those talks on the Labour side was Pat McFadden, then the constitutional affairs adviser to the then leader of the Opposition, Tony Blair. In that period, late 1996 to early 1997, we met with high hopes that there could soon be major progress in this country on a number of constitutional issues.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08031360000202"></a>We felt, collectively, that progress had been blocked during a long period of Conservative Government that had little interest in constitutional reform. Much in those talks was agreed between the two parties and published prior to that general election. Many of the measures in our joint agreement were enacted fairly quickly after the 1997 election. These included the establishment of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, using systems of proportional representation. They also included the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law and the establishment of freedom of information legislation; and the creation of a London Assembly on the basis of proportional representation, and the election of a London mayor using a system of supplementary vote that, again, showed movement away from first past the post.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08031360000203"></a>The system for electing Members of the European Parliament was changed to one of proportional representation, albeit one about which those on these Benches were exceedingly unhappy. Problems with that system have been referred to by the noble Lords, Lord Norton of Louth and Lord Grocott. On the whole, in this period we felt that much was achieved to devolve power, enhance the rights of citizens and make many levels of government more representative of those people voting for them. Throughout this period, the concept of first past the post was abandoned in these cases. Subsequently, things have gone further as the Scottish Parliament has legislated to abolish first past the post in Scottish local elections and to hold these elections in future by the single transferable vote.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08031360000204"></a>However, some important business that was agreed in this period remains unfinished, most notably the reform of this place and of the voting system in the other place. It has been suggested that consideration of reform of the voting system for MPs should await consideration of a voting system for reform of this place. There is no logical reason for this whatever. Reform of the Lords and reform of the electoral system were both under consideration at the time of the First World War. Surely 100 years should be long enough for consideration of all these issues.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08031360000205"></a>The debates in this House on the first Speaker&#146;s Conference, held in 1916, resulted in amendments being agreed in this House that would have resulted in general elections being conducted by a system of proportional representation, but the moment was lost at that point. We have continued since with a system fit for purpose only in a two-party system. We have  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1606"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1606</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>now reached a point where over 30 per cent of the votes in a general election are not for the two biggest parties, and less than half of those eligible to vote are voting for those two parties.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08031360000206"></a>Problems with the unfairness, the unrepresentative nature and the ineffectiveness of first past the post have been recognised by the Government since they were elected in 1997. New voting systems have been introduced at other levels in the UK. It must be appropriate now, in this report and our debate, to consider what we have learnt from these changes. We also know that there will not be a general election for more than a year and, in my view, probably not for more than two years. There is time now to consider what appropriate changes could be made in electing Members of the House of Commons. The Government review, published in January, could perhaps be the start of considering again the process of constitutional reform that was begun in 1997. It could, if the Government so wished, be a significant step towards improving the reputation of politics, giving more power to voters and making our political system more responsive to their desires.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08031360000207"></a>Let us look again at some the problems of the present system for election to the House of Commons. For the past 25 years or so, I have been employed to organise election campaigns. Most of them have been under the first past the post system, and I think that I can claim some credit for helping my party to learn how better to cope with it than perhaps was the case previously. But other parties have now copied the targeting and campaigning skills of the Liberal Democrats and the result is that almost all attention is now paid by political parties to perhaps no more than a quarter of the seats that are deemed to be potentially marginal. No wonder that turnout, membership and interest in party politics declines when the system encourages parties to ignore three-quarters of the constituencies.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08031360000208"></a>The situation is even worse than that. Increasingly, parties are simply targeting the swing voters in their target seats, at most a quarter of the voters within them. So much of the parties&#146; efforts are directed at a quarter of the voters in a quarter of the seats. The fact that parties are increasingly engaging with only 5 to 10 per cent of the electorate cannot be healthy for any democratic system. Moreover, as my noble friend Lord Tyler highlighted, the political parties are now becoming even more sophisticated, targeting perhaps no more than 80 constituencies and focusing on 8,000 voters within them&#151;a mere 2 per cent of the electorate. This is not healthy.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08031360000209"></a>A further unhealthy aspect of the system is that many voters are forced to vote tactically. Much of the effort aimed at the targeted voters is not about encouraging them to vote for what they believe in, but about persuading them to vote for their second choice party to keep out the party which they most dislike. So-called tactical voting has been one of my specialities in many elections. It is, for example, about persuading Labour voters in Eastbourne, Romsey or Winchester that they have to vote Liberal Democrat to make their vote count. I make no apology for advocating that they do this; it is simply a recognition that we have a voting  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1607"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1607</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>system for Westminster elections that often discourages sensible people from voting for what they really believe in.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08031360000210"></a>This problem could be addressed on its own relatively easily. We could simply change the system on existing boundaries and single-member constituencies so that electors could vote 1,2, 3. The Labour Party, as my noble friend Lord Roberts of Llandudno said, uses this system of alternative voting in its own elections. If first past the post had been used in the election for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, Jon Cruddas would now be deputy leader. But the alternative vote system meant that transfers between other candidates resulted in Harriet Harman&#146;s narrow victory over Alan Johnson. The transferred votes suggested that this was more representative of the wishes of Labour Members than the candidate who initially had the most votes. If that system is good enough for internal Labour Party elections, the question must be put as to why it might not be better to think about it for Westminster elections. It is the system used in Australia and its introduction was advocated two days ago by Kevin Maguire in the <I>Daily Mirror</I>.</p>

It is another system of first past the post, albeit slightly more sophisticated than the existing one. But that is all it is.</p>

<a name="08031360000212"></a><b><a name="80313-0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08031360000669"></a>Lord Rennard:</b> My Lords, I am not suggesting for a moment that it is a system of proportional representation, and that is why it is not advocated by my party. I am simply saying that introducing it would at least eliminate tactical voting problems and perhaps engage more people in the system. My view is that an election using the alternative vote might have fewer flaws than first past the post, but would still fall a long way short of the desired outcome, which should be to make the House of Commons properly representative of all voters.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08031360000213"></a>We now have PR systems in many of the devolved assemblies, and I think that they are more representative of the people who vote for them as a result of not having the elections under first past the post. The instability which many people predicted with systems of PR has simply not occurred in those elections. The noble Lord, Lord Maxton, was referring to the situation that arose at the end of the First World War and suggested that the Liberal Democrat and Labour parties turned around at the time. That may be true, but what changed fundamentally was the fact that we moved eventually beyond a two-party system and thus made the system of first past the post completely inappropriate. He asked how a coalition of two parties could be democratic by working together, but a coalition of two parties with more than 50 per cent of the vote must be more democratic than one party governing on its own with only 35 per cent of the vote.</p>

Let us look at Wales in the previous National Assembly elections. There was a 43.5 per cent turnout and not one voter had the chance to vote for a Labour plus Plaid Cymru coalition.</p>

<a name="08031360000215"></a><b><a name="80313-0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08031360000671"></a>Lord Rennard:</b> My Lords, I think we should look at what happened in Scotland after 1999. The Labour Party had 33 per cent of the vote, while the Liberal Democrats secured 17 per cent, making 50 per cent. The people of Scotland wanted something different from what was done in Westminster, such as scrapping student tuition fees. The people of Scotland got more of what they wanted because of proportional representation. I believe that that was representative and fair. It was right that powers were devolved in a way that the voters could decide that. It is an illustration of the system delivering for the people in a more democratic way than is the case under first past the post.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08031360000216"></a>So I hope that there will be further reform, although it could be in stages. I accept that the Government may want to see further progress before going all the way towards more proportional systems. If we had something like the alternative vote, it would address many of the concerns on the Labour Benches in the first place, but it would still be inadequate, and were we to have a general election under that system, the case would be made in the future that we need to move either to a top-up or, ideally, to the single transferable vote, which I think would be the best of all systems.</p>

I come at this question as one who thinks that we have messed around with our voting system too much already. I see nothing wrong with the well-tried and trusted system of going to a polling station, taking up that stubby pencil on a string and marking my cross. As the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, said, it makes voting tangible, physical and deeply meaningful. Voting should mean something. It should be special and it should be different.</p>

I find it difficult to accept that we should make contrived gestures to those who cannot be bothered to go and vote at most once a year. In the past such gestures have done little to raise participation or increase respect for the democratic process. They have often spread confusion. Many of us found it deeply depressing that the systems of voting have become so complex and contradictory that in London in 2004, one vote in every 14 was spoiled and lost&#151;that amounted to hundreds of thousands of votes. How shameful. Will the Minister say how the Government plan to tackle that problem?</p>

Whatever else may be said of this Government, their undermining of the old instinctive trust in the integrity of the ballot has been one of their bleakest legacies. It is shameful that it is now being seriously suggested that international observers should come to the United Kingdom to examine our elections. The creation of an Electoral Commission has been a mixed blessing. It bears the blame for some of the ill-considered events of recent years, and I wonder how satisfied Ministers really are with its performance.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08031360000220"></a>What we need now is simplification and a return to some of the clearly understood, harder to defraud methods we had in the past. So my answer to the question, &#147;Should we change the Westminster voting system?&#148; is simple and familiar: no. And my answer to, &#147;Do we want general election voting by text message and the internet?&#148; is the same: no.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08031360000221"></a>Since 1997, Her Majesty&#146;s Government have piloted too many voting systems at European, regional, local and devolved level government. The results have not caused the ecstatic electoral wave that Her Majesty&#146;s Government might have hoped for. Instead, the pilot schemes have highlighted the problems of different voting systems when applied to the British system, rather than any perceived benefits.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08031360000222"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, explained much better than I could, Scotland encapsulates the problem. The hotch-potch of new voting systems there has something bizarre about it: the additional member system for MSPs, first past the post for MPs, a party list for MEPs and a single transferable vote for the council&#151;a different system for each level of government. Let us not kid ourselves that legitimacy enters into all this. Why have Her Majesty&#146;s Government created all this confusion? If the answer was to stop the SNP, then a nice mess they made of that, and they still got stuck with the Liberal Democrats as well.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08031360000223"></a>The purpose of this debate is to call attention to the Ministry of Justice review of voting systems that was published in January. My noble friend Lord Norton of Louth well explained the ways in which different PR systems operate. Like the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, he helped us to understand the problems of each and drew our attention to the undue influence such systems bring to political parties that have not earned the votes that justify that influence. My noble friend rightly pointed out that the great advantage of first past the post is accountability to voters. First past the post realises three major objectives: direct accountability of representatives to voters, stable government and ease of use by all&#151;most importantly, the voter. Like the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, I say stick with it. Indeed, let us bring it back in some places where it has been lost. What really threatens our voting system is not the system itself but, as my noble friend Lord Norton said, those who abuse it. Again, that requires a bit of courage from the Government to stamp it out. I quote the words of the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, Sir Alistair Graham:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08031360000521"></a>&#147;We cannot continue to base our electoral process on trust alone when it appears that this trust is plainly abused and risks loss of public confidence in our democratic system&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08031360000495"></a>Why have Her Majesty&#146;s Government done so little to combat that threat?</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08031360000224"></a>The Government objected to my party&#146;s proposal to implement individual voter registration by national insurance number on the grounds that it would be too costly. But I wonder how many times the cost of testing and reviewing the many new voting systems, and of running farces such as the referendum in the north-east on a regional assembly that was wanted by no one except a single Minister, exceeded the cost of individual voter registration?</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08031360000225"></a>We all want to see a better turnout, and I am confident that we will see plenty of action at the polling stations when the day comes to turn out this Government. What matters in raising turnout is not the internet but meaningful, accountable, truthful politics. You can have a thousand Electoral Commission reports but, if parties like Labour and the Liberal Democrats make solemn promises to give the people of this country a referendum on something that profoundly affects their future and then break that promise, it is no wonder that cynicism about politics grows. I say to the Minister: stand up and tell us that the Government and their Liberal Democrat fellow backsliders will give us a referendum. Then he will have plenty of political enthusiasm. He might lose his job, mind you, but he would win more respect than the Prime Minister and Mr Clegg.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08031360000226"></a>We all know the obsession that the Liberal Democrats have with PR. For me&#151;I hope the Minister agrees with this&#151;the letters PR stand not for &#147;proportional representation&#148; but for &#147;permanent representation&#148;&#151;that is, permanent representation in office for the least popular major party. I understand why the least popular party wants that but, bitter though opposition is, I, like the noble Lords, Lord Grocott and Lord Maxton, and my noble friend Lord Norton, vastly prefer a good old first past the post system that delivers stable government, as here or in the United States, to the kind of PR that leaves politicians horsetrading behind closed doors, as in Italy.</p>

I thank the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, for allowing us to debate some fundamental questions about our democratic system.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08031360000231"></a>I particularly welcome my noble friend Lord Grocott. Remarkably, as has been said, we believe that that was his maiden speech from the Back Benches. Having served with him, I can say that he was a truly magnificent friend and a wonderful Chief Whip. It is good to have him with us today. He managed to make one brief reference to the reform of your Lordships&#146; House. I suspect, alas, that that will be the first of many comments that he comes to make on that issue. He will find that there is never much distance between us and another debate on Lords reform; indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Steel, who is in his place, knows that we are due to have yet another Second Reading tomorrow, this time of the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, on that subject, when perhaps we can continue to have this really rather marvellous conversation.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08031360000232"></a>While I welcome this debate&#151;I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, made some interesting comments&#151;I disagree fundamentally with his comments about the health of our democratic system as is. In doing so, I make it clear that I am not at all complacent. I take what my noble friend Lady Kennedy said about some of the challenges we face in a society that has changed so much from the old certainties over the past 50 years when, as we know, voter turnout has dropped steadily over those years. I do not underestimate the challenges that face all the established parties in terms of enthusiasm and engagement with members and the public, but nor do I think it is just a matter of voting systems. In fact I am doubtful whether voting systems in themselves have much of a part to play in developing the re-engagement of the public that we all wish to see.</p>

<a name="80313-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08031360000233"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, was critical of the Government&#146;s approach to constitutional change and to the development of new voting systems in different parts of the country. I am very proud of what we have achieved in the programme of major constitutional change. It was right to devolve power from Westminster to Scotland and Wales, with the introduction of new voting systems, and the Northern Ireland Assembly. It was right to enshrine fundamental rights in the Human Rights Act. These are all significant advances.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08031360000234"></a>Our constitutional arrangements have never been fixed; nor should they be. Surely a strength of the British approach to these matters is that we evolve to ensure that we continue to meet the needs of our democracy. That is why the first substantive paper issued by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister last summer was about the governance of Britain and about how we can renew and revitalise our democracy. These are critical matters. That is the context in which we ought to see the review of our voting systems.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08031360000235"></a>I very much did not recognise the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, about political spinning. The review is a dispassionate piece of work and in their approach to its publication Ministers brought with them that same dispassionate approach. All sides of  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1612"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1612</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the argument have welcomed the report. I pay tribute to officials in my department, who did such a good piece of work. The Electoral Reform Society described the review as a detailed and balanced piece of work. It is such a wonderful piece of work that, whatever view you take, ammunition and evidence can be found to support your case. That shows its value. While I cannot claim that it is well known among the residents of Kings Heath, it will influence political and academic thinking in the years ahead.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08031360000236"></a>What is the outcome of the review? I do not want to repeat what other noble Lords have said in their interesting contributions to the debate. Equally, I do not take the rather, if I may say, complacent view of the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley that everything is right and nothing should be changed. However, we have to look seriously at the advantages of first past the post before making such a fundamental change to our voting system. We should not ignore the critical importance of Members of Parliament representing a smallish defined geographical area. We cannot underestimate the importance of that relationship, which my noble friend Lord Grocott described so well.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08031360000237"></a>I am thinking about my own city of Birmingham. There is a difference between being part of a constituency of 70,000 voters and living in a city that might have 10 representatives&#151;we have 10 MPs&#151;but no direct relationship between my part of Birmingham and the person who represents me. One would have to think very carefully before moving towards that kind of system. Although there is a great deal of criticism about seats where the outcome is always the same, one should not ignore the advantage of a winner-takes-all system, which encourages major parties to maintain a broad appeal, or ignore the fact that the electorate can be decisive about who should be the party of Government.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08031360000238"></a>It is remarkable how often the pundits say that at the next election there is likely to be a balance of power&#151;everyone looks to the Liberal Democrats, as it may be their hour of glory&#151;and how few times over the past 50 years that has turned out to be the case. I submit that the British public know what to do. The system allows them to make a very clear choice and Governments to have a working majority in Parliament. I echo what the noble Lord, Lord Norton, said about core accountability. Whatever the defects of first past the post&#151;I acknowledge that there are defects&#151;one should not underestimate the importance of that core accountability.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08031360000239"></a>Of course, there are advantages to proportional systems. As we know, there are many different proportional systems, but as a general principle the outcomes are more proportionate at national level. Voters have more choice, as more parties inevitably have the chance of being elected. Government tends to be by coalition, which can mean that a wider range of interests are brought into and represented in the Government. My noble friend Lord Watson felt that the experience in Scotland had a proved the positive virtue of that.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08031360000240"></a>The disadvantages seem to be pretty fundamental as well. The prevalence of party list systems, in whole or in part, makes the candidate and representative  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1613"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1613</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remote from the voter, particularly with the abomination, if I may say so, of the closed list system. My experience in Birmingham when the European elections were first brought in was that having a representative in Birmingham South was an altogether more rigorous system than having five MEPs representing the whole of the West Midlands region. I believe&#151;it is a personal view&#151;that we lost something in terms of lacking the direct connection.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08031360000241"></a>We have heard about the problem of conflict between two types of representative in the UK in similar Parliaments&#151;Scotland comes to mind. I know that my noble friend Lord Watson felt that it was not a particular problem, but the noble Lord, Lord Steel, and many others I have talked to, reflect on the real problem that can happen between the two different types of elected people within a Parliament. The tendency towards coalition or minority governance can have a negative effect. It can take a long time to form a Government. Governments may be indecisive, they may have weaker policy agendas, and they may be more subject to pressure-group influence because of a lowest-common-denominator approach to decision-making.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08031360000242"></a>We should not ignore the problem of coalition being a weaker form of government. My noble friend Lord Maxton had good points to make about that. I pray in aid of Birmingham, where we are enjoying&#151;if that is the word&#151;nearly four years of coalition of the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. My goodness, I could not describe a more visible sign of lowest-common-denominator decision-making. Frankly, over those four years I have seen Birmingham lose out time and time again to other major cities because of the indecisive leadership being given.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08031360000243"></a>I recognise that proportionate systems have their merits. I am not going to ignore that at all. In putting forward the reasons for PR and for having a more proportionate system, noble Lords tend to ignore some of the outcomes for quality of governance and for direct accountability of a Government to the electorate.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08031360000244"></a>I understand the strength of feeling that my noble friend Lady Kennedy spoke about. The main parties may not always be providing the choice that individuals want and the emergence of single issue or smaller parties can enhance the democratic process. However, it is not always one way and the emergence of smaller parties can also have a very negative influence on the quality of decision making in Government. As I said earlier, Government can become more susceptible to pressure group politics. We all engage with pressure groups, and they are a part of the country&#146;s democratic health, but their influence needs to be kept in proportion and be balanced.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08031360000245"></a>To be fair to noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches who have spoken about the need for proportional systems, there are different systems. Some would clearly not be suitable for the House of Commons. There seems to be general agreement about the iniquities of the closed list system and it is encouraging that there is such widespread political agreement across this Chamber and, I suspect, in the other place about its problems. These matters will be considered in any review of any voting system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08031360000246"></a>On where the Government are going with the review, we made it clear that it was a contribution to the ongoing debate, that the Government are not minded to propose any change to the voting system for the House of Commons and that we believe that the current first past the post voting system works well. We also recognise that there is a range of views on the issue of voting systems. We published the paper as a contribution to that debate.</p>

I thought that if we started with it, we would never move on to any other issue. As noble Lords are aware, we need to look at voting systems for a reformed House of Lords. The noble Lords, Lord Tyler and Lord Rennard, feel that the process has been slow but I am impressed by the spirit of co-operation within the cross-party working group on Lords reform&#151;I say that tentatively, knowing that this excites great passion in your Lordships&#146; House. I hope that it will lead to as much consensus as possible among the political parties, to manifesto commitments and to legislation in the next Session of Parliament. I will not affirm in relation to the point of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, because it is very likely that there will be options on voting systems in the White Paper. It would be wrong for me to give a definitive view for the Government. I agree with him on the need for a different system from that of the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08031360000249"></a>I was interested by the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Sewel. He asked whether having a much more proportionate electoral base for this place would make this place feel more legitimate than the other place. My noble friend Lord Grocott answered that very clearly by referring to the power of first past the post and the direct relationship between the Member of Parliament and constituents. I also point out, in relation to that very important question, that primacy rests on the Parliament Acts, that the Government need to have the confidence of the Commons, that the Commons need to deal with supply and that the Prime Minister and other senior Ministers will sit in the Commons. It is perfectly possible for a mostly or wholly elected second Chamber to sit comfortably with a House of Commons whose primacy is, and will continue to be, established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08031360000250"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Norton and Lord De Mauley, raised a number of questions about what is probably best described as election administration and individual registration. We discussed that in an Oral Question a few weeks ago. We introduced a range of new integrity measures in the May 2007 elections and all the indications are that they are working well. We are looking at individual voter registration. We must understand that some of the changes made in relation to postal voting, for example, were designed to encourage more people

The signs are that that has paid off. We must be very careful not then to introduce measures that dissuade people from voting&#151;that is the very concern that most noble Lords have for debating this matter.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08031360000251"></a>This has been an excellent debate. I do not think any noble Lord who has spoken has ignored the challenges that our democracy faces at the moment, such as lower turnout, alienation and&#151;perhaps&#151;detachment of the public from formal parties. The review makes it clear that these matters cannot be solved overnight or by the wave of a magic wand to bring in a new voting system. The review makes it clear that this is not so much about one system being better than another; it depends what you want from a system. Some systems deliver some objectives better than others. The key is the legitimacy of the voting system, which must be believed widely by the public to produce a legitimate outcome.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08031360000252"></a>I am satisfied that the first past the post system, whatever its faults, is believed to produce a legitimate outcome. But we&#151;the parties&#151;have to do very much more between us to encourage public engagement, confidence and involvement and to bring young people into the democratic process. These are all critical matters for us. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, deserves great credit for allowing us to debate these important matters. There is no complacency. I hope that we will be able to return to these matters over the next few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08031360000256"></a>I thank all noble Lords who have contributed. I hope that I will be forgiven for especially thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, and the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Invergowrie, who broke from the otherwise rather conservative attitudes on the Labour Benches. At one point, I was wondering who would be more reactionary, but the Conservative Party&#146;s Front Bench came back very well at the end. I am also extremely grateful to my noble friends Lord Goodhart, Lord Steel, Lord Roberts and Lord Rennard. I hope that we have been able to present a geographical spread of evidence to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08031360000257"></a>I was very impressed by the extent to which the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, in his inimitable fashion, was able to give us yet another tutorial but I was depressed by the extent to which other people seemed to follow him. There are quite different academic interpretations of the so-called disproportionate power theory. It is significant that we had the issue of disproportionate power under first past the post; it is not only under proportional representation systems that minorities can exert more influence than they perhaps should have. I am a relic of the 1974 Parliament, which was elected under first past the post and in which there was no majority. Do not let us fool ourselves about the only circumstances in which you might have a problem of minorities being powerful&#151;it can happen under first past the post. As Professor Vernon Bogdanor of Oxford pointed out, the Ulster Unionists were thought to have disproportionate power between 1992 and 1997, when they had a fulcrum role in the House of Commons. However, because the Liberal Democrats were supporting the then Government over Europe&#151;irony of all ironies&#151;they could survive. Our Parliament is clearly not as incapable of dealing with those problems as we should imagine.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08031360000258"></a>I want to make it absolutely clear that I and my colleagues believe that the best system for the House of Commons&#151;and it may well also be for your Lordships&#146; House&#151;is the single transferable vote in multimember constituencies, because that gives power back to the citizen. That is what I have found slightly depressing about this debate; all too often, people address these issues as if the only thing that matters is the view of the parties in the Westminster bubble. As the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, said so clearly, people look at these issues quite differently outwith that bubble. We are all small parties now; that is the big change since the 1950s, as all parties have fewer members and less natural, automatic support. We must recognise that point of view.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08031360000259"></a>This issue will not go away. All parties and all politicians have to address the disenchantment of the electorate and the extent to which that is due to distortion from our system, which is not working. For those who do not believe that this will be on the agenda in the next few months, I warmly recommend reading <I>No Overall Control</I><I>?</I>, published by the Hansard Society just a couple of days ago. It points out, for example, that the betting odds&#151;and sometimes the bookmakers are more accurate than the opinion pollsters&#151;are showing that it is much more likely that there will be no overall control in the next Parliament than an overall Labour majority, and much more likely again than an overall Conservative majority. I suggest, then, that we all have to address these issues, as we are going to have a different Parliament in future.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08031360000260"></a>This has been a very interesting and timely debate. I welcome the extent to which the Government are, clearly, going to take advantage of the useful work done by the report; I, too, give credit to its Civil Service authors for being reasonably dispassionate and balanced. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08031360000263"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, policy changes often emerge from financial decisions. The immediate context for this debate, then, is to draw attention to the continuing squeeze on the FCO budget, which will fall in real terms over the next three years under the Comprehensive Spending Review&#151;while that of the Department for International Development, in contrast, is set to double between now and 2013. UK subscriptions to international organisations, which fall on the FCO budget and which are beyond the control of the British Government alone, operate to squeeze this already small budget&#151;one of the smallest in Whitehall&#151;further. There comes a point at which a succession of cutbacks becomes a step-change: in the character of an organisation, in its ability to deliver the tasks demanded of it, and in the objectives it is able to serve. I want to pose the question of whether we are now facing such a step-change in the position and capabilities of the FCO, both at home and abroad, and to ask how we should adjust aspirations and objectives to match the more modest resources that the Government have provided.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08031360000264"></a>I raise this not from a sharply partisan perspective, but as someone who has worked with British diplomats over nearly 40 years, and observed their struggle to deliver the objectives that their political leaders have set&#151;very often without anything like the resources needed to achieve them. Sir Hilary Synnott, in his just-published book on post-invasion Iraq, remarks that,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000541"></a>&#147;there seemed to be a great mismatch between what Tony Blair was saying and how Whitehall was operating&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000265"></a>That was not for the first time, and probably not for the last.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08031360000266"></a>The history of Britain&#146;s long retreat from empire, since Suez, has been of Governments struggling to maintain their aspirations to be a global power without being willing or able to pay for the means to do so, with the press insisting that we absolutely must maintain our pretensions and not admit our limitations. Harold Macmillan thus famously stressed our role in global summitry; Harold Wilson attempted to maintain our bases east of Suez. There was an outcry from the <I>Daily Mail</I> when in 1968 the Duncan report on the future of the Diplomatic Service suggested that the UK was then a</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000542"></a>&#147;major power of the second rank&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000497"></a>There was a further outcry, again led by the <I>Daily Mail</I>, when under Jim Callaghan&#146;s Labour Government the Berrill report proposed the closer integration of the Diplomatic Service with the rest of Whitehall.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08031360000267"></a>There has, of course, been a revolution in communications among Governments in the 30 years since then. Secure e-mail is now being introduced, enabling people in posts abroad to comment on and contribute to policy discussions within Whitehall. The number of member states of the UN has continued to  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1618"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1618</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rise inexorably: there are now more than 190, with resident British missions in some 145 of those&#151;leaving large numbers of African states, and several in Latin America, without a British presence. That includes one state, Burkina Faso, which is currently a member of the UN Security Council. International travel has become both easier and cheaper, making it often far more cost-effective to send officials out to foreign capitals for successive short visits than to post them and their families abroad. The British Diplomatic Service now has 40 per cent fewer home-based staff serving abroad than it had 30 years ago&#151;a substantial reduction as the number of posts and countries has sharply increased.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08031360000268"></a>The work of government as a whole has become more international, and much more multilateral. One official recently offered me the estimate that 60 to 70 per cent of the work of DEFRA and of BERR&#151;the Department of Business, Enterprise and something on regulation, I forget its exact title&#151;is internationally driven, either by the European Union or by other multilateral conferences and organisations. Expert officials deal with expert officials from other Governments within these multilateral organisations, and often also deal there with the transnational lobbies that work to shape policies both here and abroad. It is, therefore, much less clear where bilateral missions fit into this world, or where the FCO stands in the making of overall policy in London. I have been told that different ministries now find it useful to second their own staff, not to UK missions abroad, but directly to the ministries of other important Governments&#151;in Paris, Copenhagen, Tokyo and Brasilia&#151;as well as to the European Commission and to the secretariats of UN agencies.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08031360000269"></a>The Foreign Office, under its new Secretary of State, has done its best to try to fit resources to objectives; &#147;Strategy Refresh&#148; has agreed a reduction of some 25 per cent in home-based staff in European embassies to enable posts in Afghanistan, Pakistan and across the Middle East and Asia to be reinforced. The number of staff working within the FCO in London is also being cut back, as direct communications enable posts abroad to deal directly with other departments across Whitehall. There is a delicate question as to whether these cutbacks have undermined the future of the Diplomatic Service as such, since the FCO may now no longer be able to provide sufficient home-based posts at different levels for people serving abroad to spend sufficient time during their careers at home.</p>

<a name="80313-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08031360000270"></a>I therefore want to raise several questions about the future of the FCO and the management of British foreign policy. The first is about the co-ordination of British foreign policy and the relationship between the FCO and the other departments involved in international diplomacy, which now means most departments in Whitehall. The FCO, rightly, now defines itself as one of &#147;the three international departments&#148; with DfID and the Ministry of Defence. Since our new Foreign Secretary has defined tackling climate change as one of the FCO&#146;s four strategic priorities, and combating transnational terrorist movements and political and religious extremisms is also a major theme of his, the need for closer and closer co-operation with other ministries&#151;the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, DEFRA, BERR and so forth&#151;is evident.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08031360000271"></a>I am no longer confident that the slimmer and slimmer FCO, with its tiny budget, can manage to provide the political overview that our Foreign Secretary rightly sees as its special role, to give us the &#147;joined-up government&#148; that is needed across particular negotiations. The Cabinet Office already holds the ring on European policy and is shouldering an expanding role in national security policy&#151;not always in easy partnership with the FCO. However, people tell me that the Cabinet Office is currently in chaos, with far too high a turnover of staff and poor co-ordination between its different units; last year&#146;s Civil Service capabilities review was sharply critical of its capabilities and performance.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08031360000272"></a>I am very glad that our new Foreign Secretary has reinstituted the FCO planning staff to try to give a strategic role in foreign policy, but I am no longer sure that the Foreign Office can plan the strategy of foreign policy on its own. Furthermore, I suggest that the task has been made more difficult by our new Prime Minister. Gordon Brown was famously unenthusiastic about the Foreign Office and its posts abroad which, as Chancellor, he did his best to avoid when travelling to foreign capitals. Successive reductions in the FCO budget may partly reflect his lack of enthusiasm. He seems impatient with the complexities of multilateral diplomacy, particularly with the interventions of smaller countries, and is in danger of underestimating the importance of political relations with difficult Governments beyond the UN Security Council&#146;s permanent members and the G8.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08031360000273"></a>That raises difficult questions for some of us about the cutback in bilateral missions across the EU, and about the future of those missions. It is evident that we no longer need extensive staffs writing reports on technical subjects. That material is easily available on the internet and officials can come out from London when needed. However, we still need to cultivate good relations with the other 26 EU member states, smaller as well as larger, which means that we need politically skilled representatives well briefed in British domestic political constraints as well as in the politics of the countries to which they are accredited, to build and maintain relations of mutual confidence. As a succession of officials have told me over the years, departments across Whitehall still need good briefing on the domestic political context within which other EU Governments operate, not only in Berlin and Paris but also in Bucharest and Bratislava.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08031360000274"></a>I suggest that we need further reflection, perhaps even on a cross-party basis, about what sort of missions we now need across Europe after the present cutbacks, and what their priorities should be. It is unfortunate that so many bilateral British ambassadors in other EU countries are appointed to these posts as their second or even third successive posting abroad. We need representatives who are seen to represent London, and are up-to-date and closely in touch with thinking in London and across the UK. I am not sure that it is sensible to cut back military attaches in our European embassies when the UK is pressing other Governments so hard to increase their contributions to NATO, European and UN missions outside Europe. I note that many of these posts now house liaison officers from our police and law enforcement services, and  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1620"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1620</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wonder whether departments across Whitehall have dispassionately considered the trade-offs between resident liaison and the stream of visitors that air travel allows.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08031360000275"></a>Might I suggest that we should consider renaming our embassies across the EU&#151;or even across the OECD world&#151;as &#147;British Government Representations&#148;, to reflect the job that they now do and to underline how closely they relate, or should relate, to the whole of Whitehall? That would suggest less pomp and more encouragement of professional Government-to-Government interaction, parliament-to-parliament interaction, and wider than that. Further, I suggest that the heads of these representations should be drawn from a wider group within Whitehall than the FCO alone. I note, with approval, that our new ambassador in Ankara had previously served as head of the immigration and nationality service in the Home Office. That was, after all, what the Berrill committee recommended 30 years ago&#151;a closer integration of the home and diplomatic services, to fit the changing career patterns and expectations of the women and men in our Civil Service and to reduce the proportion of years served that are spent abroad. That, of course, necessarily implies that more attention needs to be paid in the domestic departments to the acquisition of language skills, including &#147;hard&#148; language skills, and to ensuring that service abroad is seen as a path to promotion; but these are, of course, desirable objectives in themselves.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08031360000276"></a>Outside the OECD world, British missions have more sensitive political roles to fulfil but also a growing mixture of officials to fulfil them. I note, for example, that now some 150 liaison officers from our law enforcement services are attached to overseas missions. Redefinition of Britain's national security and its management therefore also needs to address what sort of teams of officials, civilian and military, are needed to promote our interests in states of concern.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08031360000277"></a>There is a particular issue about the partnership between DfID and the FCO in the non-OECD world, which others in this debate may well wish to address. DfID has become a major department in foreign policy, with both our previous Prime Minister and our new one giving its goals their blessing. But, as we have seen in Kenya in the past two to three years, development goals and good governance can easily cut across each other, and relations between the understaffed but more generously paid&#151;so I am told&#151;DfID missions and British diplomats are not always easy. I note that last year's capabilities review of DfID in effect raised doubts as to whether that department will be able successfully to manage the continuing increases in funding it is due to receive over the next two to five years. There is room for much more careful integration of strategic planning and policy-making between these two departments to make sure that political and development objectives are successfully reconciled.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08031360000278"></a>The width of the gap between aspirations and resources should encourage the Government to take a much more open and positive attitude to the proposed EU external action service than they have so far displayed. Since we cannot afford resident representation in some 50 UN member states, we have an interest in  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1621"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1621</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>making the best of shared representation and common reporting where we can. I know that Her Majesty&#146;s Government have gone some way in sharing resources with friendly Governments in some foreign capitals&#151;with the Germans in Reykjavik and Dar es Salaam, for example, even with the European Commission in one case. We should embrace the chance now offered to do more and face down the predictable cries of horror from the <I>Daily Mail</I>.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08031360000279"></a>Above all, we need to be comfortable with our role within the European Union. I was extremely happy to read in David Miliband&#146;s speech of 4 March to the FCO forum for leadership his careful distinction between our most important bilateral relationship with the United States and our work within the multilateral framework of the European Union&#151;an institution, he said, of which we are a party. That is a very important distinction as regards the way in which we should now operate in different countries. We recognise that the Government are reluctant to state this obvious transformation of the context of British foreign policy too openly before the Lisbon amending treaty has been ratified. I am not even sure that the Prime Minister, as opposed to the Foreign Secretary, yet fully understands how much our 35-year membership of the European Union has transformed the management of British international policy alongside all the implications of globalisation which we have witnessed.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08031360000280"></a>These Benches hope that in the wake of the ratification of the amending treaty Britain will at last become a settled and positive actor within the developing frameworks of EU internal and external policies and will wish to make sure that we play a major role in the formation, development and staffing of the EU external action service. Perhaps even the Conservatives will come to recognise the evident advantages of embedding British diplomacy further within that framework. I hope that is not too partisan a note on which to introduce the debate. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

Many questions were posed, most of which remain unanswered by the Government. The noble Lord spoke of a step change in our relationships overseas. Certainly, the old distinction between domestic and foreign has fundamentally changed. The nature and role of our missions overseas have also changed. But I wonder whether, at one level, this is not a debate about resources but about ourselves and how we see our role in the world, and therefore about the resources which we are prepared to commit to that. Indeed, our national self-confidence is also in question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08031360000282"></a>It may be helpful if I try to put in perspective through a historical survey whether the adaptation which the Foreign Office has endured over recent years is justified. When I entered the foreign service almost 50 years ago, in 1960, it was a very different world. The challenges and priorities were different. The cold war still existed. We had passed the shock of Suez but we were before the main EU debate. We were

There was not even a Foreign and Commonwealth Office but a separate Commonwealth Relations Office. It was before the east of Suez withdrawal, which was one of the milestones on our way to reassessing what we could do and the conflict between our aspirations, our view of ourselves then and the resources we were prepared to devote to this issue.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08031360000283"></a>It was also a very different Foreign Office. It had hardly changed from the pre-war period. I remember with great affection the internal communication system. It was a shuttle, whistling around the Foreign Office like something in a Victorian department store. It was before the e-mail and before the intranet. On the personnel front, most of those in the senior levels of the Foreign Office had fought in the war, or had served either in the colonial service or abroad in other ways. Some had spent their war years in the US and were attached to the special relationship. The gifted amateur was very much the theme of the day. The only specialists that I recall were the legal department and&#151;some years afterwards, I think&#151;the first economic adviser. One book denoted it &#147;the apotheosis of the dilettante&#148;. The assumption was that the amateur could glide through any post&#151;personnel, communications, defence or whatever. Indeed they were, and remain, very gifted people.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08031360000284"></a>The public context was also very different. The public had looked at the red marks on the map, denoting our old empire. Many of the public had served in the war or the colonies and assumed that it was our responsibility to be involved overseas. There seemed to be a clear distinction at that time between domestic and foreign policy, and the great challenges now&#151;terrorism, climate change, migration and weapons of mass destruction, save the nuclear&#151;were not on the scene.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08031360000285"></a>There have been profound changes over 50 years. Communism is dead and there are new powers, which the noble Lord mentioned. Personnel are being transferred from European posts to India and China. I make one comment in passing&#151;that India is a member of the Commonwealth and we perhaps too readily forget the importance of the Commonwealth as an instrument. It is clear that the current Indian Prime Minister, and indeed Sonia Gandhi, place great weight on the Commonwealth. The incoming Commonwealth Secretary-General, who takes up his post on 1 April, is Indian. India is ready to devote more resources to the Commonwealth Secretariat and is giving more both to the CFTC and to the Commonwealth of Learning. Also in passing, I should mention the diversion, or illusion, on Conservative Benches that the Commonwealth can in some ways be deemed an alternative to the European Union. In my judgment, this is an illusion, a diversion which was wholly undermined by Don McKinnon, the outgoing Secretary-General, in a recent speech.</p>

Historically, we have tended to muddle through&#151;a little cut here, a little cut there&#151;and hardly looked at our broader strategic objectives. The new Foreign Secretary has endeavoured to grapple with those issues, beginning with his speech to Chatham House in July last year. There seems to be at least an intellectual awareness of the problems, although it has not yet resulted in many changes.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08031360000287"></a>It is useful to look at the continuing dialogue between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Foreign Affairs Committee in the other place, which in my judgment has been extremely helpful and to the benefit of both. Has the process of change led to an FCO that is fit for today&#146;s purposes? Is there recognition of the need for a new professionalism, not just for the gifted amateur, in estate management, finance, project management, personnel and communications? The FCO&#146;s reply to the last Foreign Affairs Committee report, dated January of this year, showed some awareness of that.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08031360000288"></a>One question posed was whether the need for traditional diplomacy has declined, and the noble Lord mentioned Kenya. In my judgment, there is a continuing need for sustained personal contact at all levels with key countries. Can the budget restraints be justified? There were financial constraints in the previous CSRs of 2000, 2002 and 2004, often masked by asset sales, but now we have real reductions. At the same time we now have not only new security demands but new posts made necessary by the dissolution of the Soviet and Yugoslav empires.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08031360000289"></a>One question posed was whether the balance is right between the FCO and DfID. It is true that the FCO leads in Whitehall on conflict prevention, but there is a certain jealousy at the comparative finances available, as if everything is now predicated on the move to the 0.7 target. There is a perception that DfID has more cash than it can spend.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08031360000290"></a>The final question posed by the noble Lord was whether we are taking the new Europe sufficiently seriously. Has the Foreign Office, and indeed have the Government as a whole, clearly recognised that our future lies in an ever closer relationship with our EU partners, where our interests largely coincide? The evidence hardly suggests that we have. We think of the 25 per cent reduction in posts in the European Union. There is also the UK problem of recruitment at all levels to the EU institutions. I refer in passing to the exchanges in this House on 20 February relating to Commission recruitment, where the Government accepted that we are falling far short. Why was that not tackled earlier? There is also the question of co-location of embassies. Looking at the response to these questions, one is bound to ask: have we the vision and drive to make a difference? There are some positive signs from the new Foreign Secretary but there must be a very qualified &#147;yes&#148; when we examine the evidence before us.</p>

I agree with every word that he said&#151;indeed, I agree with every word spoken by the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, as well. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, has been applying himself to this topic with tenacity, with speeches in Chatham House and articles in various publications. I played a modest part in a debate just over two years ago, on 8 December, and stand by everything I said then.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08031360000293"></a>One encouraging thing is the continuity of the campaign that the noble Lord has been running. It is getting increasing support and is increasingly important. One other moderately encouraging thing is that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office can be described as one of the great offices of state. We are living in a world where great offices of state are being knocked down like skittles in a bowling alley. The Treasury would just about acknowledge that the Foreign Office is a great office alongside it. The Treasury has an undue sense of its own importance. But look at what has happened to the other departments, such as the Lord Chancellor&#146;s Department, the Home Office, the short-lived Department for Constitutional Affairs&#151;all knocked around. We have a Lord Chancellor who turns up in all sorts of stray places, in stray uniforms, no longer representing a great department of state. The Department of Trade and Industry now has an abbreviation that the noble Lord cannot remember, and nor can I. The Department of Education is now Children, Schools and&#151;not nannies, but Families. I dread to think what is coming. We have stopped short of the time when Edward Heath was described as &#147;SOSFITARDAPOTBOT&#148;&#151;Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development, President of the Board of Trade. That is a serious point. The Foreign Office is a crucially important department and needs to be recognised as such.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08031360000294"></a>There has been one other change, which is not so important but is really rather curious. It is the scale of the huge document that is now produced as the annual report of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which is matched by an even larger volume from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the other place. In my day, no such documents existed. That does not mean that it was necessarily right, but they must take up a huge amount of energy and intellect. We got by with the occasional compact White Paper, with considerable help from the Foreign Affairs Committee, with the noble Lord playing his part in that in those days. That aspect at least is still there. The relationship between the Foreign Office and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the other place, as demonstrated from the reports that I have looked at this year, is of enormous importance. They understand each other, just as they did in my time, on strange issues ranging from diplomatic immunity to Grenada. It is of great importance that that recognition is there.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08031360000295"></a>In paragraph 63 of its latest report, the Foreign Affairs Committee states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08031360000522"></a>&#147;We welcome the fact that it was the FCO, rather than DfID or the MoD, that led on developing the new PSA on conflict.

</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000498"></a>It went on to say that Sir Ivor Roberts, in giving evidence, pointed out that,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000543"></a>&#147;we need to have a clear understanding of who runs foreign policy, and at the moment the lines are so blurred that it is very difficult to know&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000499"></a>He went on to say,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000544"></a>&#147;whether it is run by a Department called DFID or a Department called the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is not the point. The point is that there can only be one British Government foreign policy, and in every capital there can only be one voice that holds sway ... We cannot have&#151;and this happens too often&#151;two voices in the same capital&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000296"></a>The committee concluded quite clearly:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="08031360000523"></a>&#147;While we welcome greater joined-up working between the FCO and other Government Departments, we recommend that there should be a clear recognition across Whitehall, including from the Prime Minister&#146;s office, of the FCO's responsibilities for foreign policy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000500"></a>There is a clear affirmation of a crucial understanding that must be achieved across Whitehall, and not least in the Prime Minister&#146;s office. It is reflected by the arithmetic pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and by what he had to say. It is good to be able to say that there appear in the report of the Foreign Office other major improvements in the management style of the office, which is something on which Sir Peter Ricketts and the new Foreign Secretary are both entitled to be complimented.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08031360000297"></a>There is one other point that I thought the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, was going to touch on. He stressed the importance of the Commonwealth. The striking thing is that, in the three or four-page document summary of the Foreign Office book, there is no reference at all to the Commonwealth. If one looks through the large glossy magazine, there are three or four minimal references to the Commonwealth&#151;footnote references&#151;and yet it is still an important part of the title of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It may be a regrettable oversight. Still, even in my day as Chancellor, the Commonwealth was a very important organisation. It briefed me fully on the economic affairs of the world before I went to IMF meetings. It is an enormous asset to us, and to its members, to belong to that organisation. I also endorse absolutely what the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, said about the importance of India.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08031360000298"></a>As for the relationship between the FCO and DfID, as I have said before in this House, the growing disparity in resources allotted to those departments represents a huge error of judgment. It is an error of judgment that does not benefit from the fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was in a position, even as Chancellor, to take a much more liberal attitude towards the 0.7 per cent target than I ever did when I was in the Treasury. The trouble is that a 0.7 per cent target&#151;a spending target that has to be achieved&#151;is like a licence to print money. That is the sole framework within which DfID, and the old ODA, has functioned. The DfID allocation in the current year is three and a half times that of the Foreign Office, by contrast with two and a quarter times that figure 10 years ago. It is possible, though I would not go as far as advocating this, for DfID to prosper as the ODA

Without arguing that case, I am quite certain that the resources have to be reallocated.</p>

<a name="80313-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08031360000299"></a>The Foreign Office is so important because of the growing importance of diplomacy in today&#146;s world. It is not becoming less important, but more so. I know that some colleagues are aware of the initiative that was presented in this House only a week or two ago by George Schultz, the former Secretary of State for the United States, on the nuclear threat initiative, on which all the leading statesmen, ex-Secretaries of State and Secretaries of Defence and chairmen of the foreign affairs committee of the United States are agreed. Against that background, George Schultz gave a speech entitled &#147;The Age of Diplomacy&#148; in Oslo last week, in which he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08031360000524"></a>&#147;We must consider the immense diplomacy needed to take the steps that have been identified&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000501"></a>in tackling the nuclear threat&#151;</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="08031360000525"></a>&#147;Diplomatic leadership from the very top is essential. No doubt foreign ministries will be expected to organise the effort. Quite obviously, that effort must be taken side by side with ministries of defence. I would like to highlight another ingredient ... Almost all of the steps involved have a major scientific and technical component ... That is a diplomatic undertaking of immense difficulty and importance that can only be accomplished by teams that include scientific capability, private as well as public&#148;.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08031360000300"></a>I have one further quotation from George Schultz, from a book which I had the privilege to write the foreword to. It was published here last week and is entitled <I>The World Crisis: The Way Forward After Iraq</I>. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000545"></a>&#147;we in the United States, and in other countries as well, face a radically changed world with rising powers, ungoverned territories, radical Islamists and immensely powerful weapons spreading around. This situation requires a much larger and invigorated commitment to the tasks of diplomacy, conducted on a global scale. We in the United States could be worse off. Colin Powell, in his time as Secretary, saved the Department of State from a downward slide. He reinvigorated the recruitment process, improved the resource base and technological capability, and raised the spirits of the foreign service. But much more needs to be done. The size of the foreign service needs to match global needs&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000301"></a>Ours need not be that large, but the case for restoring its primacy in the conduct of foreign policy, as spelled out by everyone who has spoken so far, cannot be overstated or repeated too often.</p>

If I may, I shall take a different approach to the argument, although we have already had a remarkable level of consensus on what has been said in the first four speeches.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08031360000303"></a>The issue that I want to address is what appears to be the ambition of this Government and of the new Foreign Secretary to make some very radical changes, perhaps summed up in the phrase used by Mr Miliband in his first speech after becoming Foreign Secretary, when he referred to the crucial new distribution of power in the world. That speech was followed more recently by a remarkable speech by the Prime Minister in New Delhi, India, when he spoke about the need for a radical shift of power to the major developing countries from those that have traditionally been the  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1627"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1627</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>major power brokers in the world. At that point, he referred to the possibility of India becoming a member of the United Nations Security Council. He has referred more generally to other major developing countries becoming crucial governing members of international institutions such as the World Bank.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08031360000304"></a>If one has a major and radical shift in the structures of governance among international institutions in the world, including the United Nations, one first needs to understand those new and more powerful nations even better than one does today. One cannot possibly reduce the level of knowledge of them: one has to increase it and have greater understanding of internal, political and economic forces than is necessary for countries that are still on the margins of power in the world.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08031360000305"></a>Secondly, one can no longer make assumptions about what one might describe as the ruling bloc in those same international institutions. If, for example, one introduced India, Brazil, South Africa and one or two other nations to the United Nations Security Council, it is most unlikely that it would be easier to reach agreement in that council than in the days when it was largely dominated by the power of the United States and her allies. In short, one needs a more complex and nuanced diplomacy than is necessary in the world from which we have emerged. That was reflected in Mr Miliband&#146;s speech, but not in the resources that Mr Miliband has available to him. That is my first point about the need for much greater diplomacy than we have had in the past.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08031360000306"></a>My second point, as I have tried to indicate, is that the likelihood of reaching agreement easily becomes more difficult in an increasingly multilateral world than in one dominated by, first, two great powers and then one. That, too, means that there has to be a higher, more patient and knowledgeable level of diplomacy.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08031360000307"></a>Thirdly, there is the example that was usefully brought to the attention of the House by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, in the point that he made just now about the remarkable changes that are occurring in the attitude in the United States towards such things as nuclear proliferation, for example. That also requires a steady and active level of diplomacy. Anyone who has studied the history of the United States under the two Bush Administrations would have seen very clearly the extent to which the first of those Administrations dismissed diplomacy as synonymous with appeasement: that was frequently advanced by the Administration in their first term. But diplomacy is not synonymous with appeasement: diplomacy is synonymous with trying to deal with conflicts and build peace. One thing that we badly need to do&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Anderson as Swansea, along with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, made this absolutely clear&#151;is to recognise the paramountcy of diplomacy in a multilateral peace-seeking world. One simply cannot do without it.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08031360000308"></a>Although I strongly support the goals of DfID, having travelled quite a lot as many Members of this House have done, it is hard to believe that money is always as effectively used at the margins of DfID as it  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1628"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1628</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is today at the margins of the Foreign Office. DfID probably has rather more money to make difficult choices about because that money has so readily flowed to it over recent years.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08031360000309"></a>I turn now to the last half of what I have to say&#151;I hope that I can persuade the Whip that she need not worry about my nine minutes because I promise to keep my eye on the time. I want to look at the objectives that were set out by the Foreign Secretary in his speech last weekend to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office leadership conference&#151;an internal setting of priorities that he then made public. I will mention the four that he mentioned as his greatest single priorities.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08031360000310"></a>The first is tackling nuclear proliferation and dealing with the vision of a nuclear weapons-free world&#151;things that are certainly close to my heart. They imply to an extraordinary extent co-operation between civilian and overseas departments. In our own country, with the emergence of more and more civil nuclear power, the responsibility of BERR&#151;I will not attempt to call it by its full name&#151;is closely interrelated with the responsibilities of the Foreign Office in the international sphere. You simply cannot make advances in this field unless you recognise the crucial nature of this interlinking. We in Britain are still a long way away from what used to be called joined-up government, particularly where it is joined up between domestic and overseas departments.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08031360000311"></a>The Foreign Secretary&#146;s second priority was preventing and resolving conflicts. If you make the same assumption as I do that the previous Prime Minister's liberal intervention will make it more difficult in the next decade or so to get support for and seek legitimacy for action, the crucial fact about trying to prevent conflicts is to move as quickly as possible. You need to get in early, as in the end happened in Kenya, thank God. In other countries such as Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, late intervention allowed conflicts to seed and spread and become devastating in their consequences for the retention of the rule of law and of order in the world. His third priority was for a high-growth, low-carbon economy and his final one was to improve multilateralism.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08031360000312"></a>I return to what has already been said so effectively by my noble friend and by other noble Lords in this debate: we have hardly begun to explore the areas where we should work within the structures of the European Union, not outside them&#151;and the low-carbon economy is as good an example as one can find. I still find it quite extraordinary that we spent days in the House debating climate change and are about to spend days discussing the European Union's involvement in climate change, and actually the two could quite readily be incompatible in some areas. That seems a rather foolish form of management.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08031360000313"></a>I conclude by asking the Minister to tell us more about the extent to which Foreign Office plans have subsumed the idea of working more closely in Europe, precisely on issues such as a low-carbon economy, climate change and on joint representation where that is the appropriate way to go. On the whole, the Foreign Office does a remarkable job, but we need to look again at whether it has been squeezed to the point where, with the best will in the world, it can no longer be as effective as we need it to be.</p>

The Comprehensive Spending Review announced last year and the current and prospective year&#146;s budgetary provisions have left the Foreign and Commonwealth Office squeezed and starved of resources. The consequences in the form of post closures and the slow haemorrhage of downgrading and thinning out the remaining posts are already visible. The premature departure at a time when they could have given more years of valuable service of many talented and highly professional diplomats is taking place daily. Important scholarship programmes, prominent among them the Marshall scholarships, have been top-sliced and, as a result, fewer such scholarships are now available than in recent years.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08031360000315"></a>I asked a Question about these false and damaging economies in the scholarship schemes last October and was then given a vaguely reassuring reply. I gather that the right honourable gentleman the Foreign Secretary today made a Written Ministerial Statement in another place which does not in fact take matters much further. Meanwhile, the facts belie the reassurance. There are fewer Marshall scholarships. We are waiting to hear whether the Government plan to restore these cuts in future.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08031360000316"></a>All these signs of stress and damage to what our rivals and adversaries have always acknowledged to be one of Britain's outstanding national assets&#151;its world-class Diplomatic Service&#151;are ones that we cannot afford to ignore. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, should be congratulated on bringing this matter to the Floor of the House. As a former member of the Diplomatic Service, I will try to avoid any special pleading and look rather at a number of general issues relating to the national interest.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08031360000317"></a>First, does Britain of the 21st century need a world-class Diplomatic Service or should we accept a process of relative decline and settle for something skimpier and less effective? The answer that we do need a world-class Diplomatic Service and that settling for second best would be damaging to our national interest is not just a response of knee-jerk jingoism; it is surely a matter of rational analysis. Everyone beats a path to the door of a superpower. Just look at the way that countries staff their embassies in Washington or Beijing. But when you are a middle-ranking power with world-wide interests to further and defend, as Britain does, you need sharp eyes and sharp elbows. Some 30 years ago, the Callaghan Government commissioned a report that concluded that Britain could no longer afford a Rolls Royce of a Diplomatic Service. The Government rejected that advice. It is sobering to think of where we might be if they had accepted it. I hope that the Minister will reject it again at the conclusion of this debate and will ensure that his rejection is not just a verbal reflex, but a reality in terms of resources and manpower.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08031360000318"></a>It really is important to look at Britain&#146;s external policies in the round and to consider what is needed to manage them effectively, and not to look at them as a collection of disconnected stovepipes&#151;some development aid here, some diplomacy there, and some military action when all else fails. This Government can take

We are at last in sight of the UN target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to which successive Governments committed us and then did little or nothing to honour. But development aid cannot be a stand-alone policy. In many countries where civil strife or bad governance prevails, it is hard to deliver it at all; just look at Kenya today. In other countries which are successfully transiting towards developed status, aid will be of steadily diminishing significance. Look at India, for example. But we need active diplomacy in failed or failing states and we need it in rising powers. We should not be robbing diplomatic Peter while favouring development-aid Paul. We should be resourcing both as an integrated whole in our overseas policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08031360000319"></a>The same is even truer for our Armed Forces. If all that requires a bit more of the taxpayers&#146; money, government and opposition parties should be prepared to say so and defend that as being in the national interest. We will certainly not defend those overseas interests successfully by pretending that more and more can be done with less and less.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08031360000320"></a>It is sometimes suggested that in this era of rapid communication, of summit meetings and of increasingly specialised forms of multilateral diplomacy, we do not need diplomatic missions in the way we used to and that everything can be handled by experts from capitals and by political leaders themselves. In the real world, that is not the way things work. Ill-prepared meetings at political level seldom produce good results and often produce the opposite. Complex multilateral negotiations require a careful meshing of expertise from capitals, professional skills on the ground where the negotiation is taking place&#151;in New York, Geneva, Brussels or wherever&#151;and a world-wide diplomatic network lobbying for our objectives and warning where the obstacles to achieving them lie, and how best to get round them. Getting a good result from the post-Bali negotiations on climate change will require just that sort of multifaceted diplomacy; but we will not achieve it if we simply do not have diplomatic posts in some of the key places or if our posts are inadequately staffed. I remember a feeling of powerlessness and inadequate knowledge when successive crises occurred in three countries that were high on the Security Council&#146;s agenda&#151;Somalia, Rwanda and Haiti&#151;in which Britain had no diplomatic representation at all.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08031360000321"></a>Later this year, assuming that the Lisbon treaty is ratified by all 27 member states, the European Union will establish its external action service, drawing on, among other resources, the serving diplomats of its member states. Personally, I regard that as a great opportunity for Britain, not as a threat or as an issue of low priority. As one of the member states with a Diplomatic Service of the highest reputation, we have an opportunity to ensure the professionalism of the new service and thus further our interests along with those of the European Union as a whole. Are we ensuring that we make a serious contribution in ideas, structures and human resources to the work that is getting under way in Brussels? Are we going to provide some of the best and brightest of our diplomats to work in the new service and not just unload those whom we value least&#151;an old trick of any bureaucracy  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1631"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1631</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in circumstances such as these? Are we going to ensure that the development of that European Union dimension to our diplomacy is valued and rewarded, so that British diplomats regard a spell at a European Union mission as a step up the professional ladder, not a diversion or a distraction? I would welcome a response from the Minister on those points.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08031360000322"></a>My contribution to this welcome debate may have sounded a little bit critical. It is intended to be constructively so. We are dealing with an important national asset which will not retain its value if it is not properly resourced and led. The Diplomatic Service that I joined in 1959 has changed out of all recognition in the intervening half century. A series of rapid and fundamental transitions have taken place and the overall quality of the service has not declined. If anything, it has improved. That is surely a major national achievement of which we can be proud. But that process of unending transition and change will be successfully sustained only if we provide the necessary resources and political support. Let us just hope that today&#146;s debate will have made some modest contribution to that.</p>

Britain is a key player in the European context, but our interests are wider and the Government owe a duty to ensure that our national voice is heard across the global community. It is for this reason that this debate is so crucial, and I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, on securing this opportunity.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08031360000324"></a>Inevitably, in a changing world, it will be necessary to make changes to the structure and representation that we wish to have in different countries; but there needs to be an open and honest debate about whether the changes being made are the correct ones&#151;and, if not, what the appropriate level of representation should be. Further, there are economic considerations that need to be borne in mind, particularly considering the costs of maintaining posts in different countries. That is not an easy area of policy.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08031360000325"></a>We currently enjoy 261 posts overseas, of which 43 are staffed exclusively by locally recruited people; 218 are staffed by UK-based civil servants and locally recruited people. In response to a parliamentary Question in another place, the Secretary of State listed those countries which no longer have a resident British ambassador, consul general or high commissioner. There were 52 such countries, of which two were temporarily closed for security reasons.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08031360000326"></a>Since the Government came to power in 1997, we have seen more than 35 embassies, high commissions and sovereign posts closed. Of the 53 African countries, some 23 do not have any British diplomatic representation at all. Considering the increasing strength of the Chinese in that continent, we need to give very careful consideration to the strategic disadvantage in having such a minimal presence there. One approach to improve this situation might be to accredit civil servants from the Department for International Development where no Foreign Office staff are present in the country concerned, particularly  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1632"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1632</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in countries such as Lesotho and Swaziland. I hope that the Minister can give the House a commitment to consider such an alternative.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08031360000327"></a>There is continued suspicion in many quarters that the closures we have witnessed around the globe are rather more to do with financial constraints within the Foreign Office than with the reason provided by the Government that it is a consequence of a changing world. Is it reasonable that the closure of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office language school and the withdrawal of the Foreign Office's contribution to the cost of maintaining defence attach&#233;s are connected with shifts in global circumstances? I doubt it. The Foreign Affairs Committee in another place has warned that the Foreign Office budget is likely to be cut by 5 per cent each year, which could jeopardise this important work. Presumably on that basis we shall see a further reduction in British representation around the world. I hope that the Minister can provide clear assurances about that risk.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08031360000328"></a>We need to strengthen our traditional relationships and try to freshen and deepen other multilateral alliances. The extraordinarily rapid changes in the distribution of economic and political power in the world means that we will need to shift more of our weight to the relationships with the Asia Pacific region and other countries. We have a long way to go before we can claim to have been sufficiently successful at promoting trade with China and India, and we have lost out to other European nations as a consequence. The Government need to put that right. It can be argued that Britain has been slow, given its concentration on affairs in Washington and Brussels, to adapt to the rapid changes taking place in newly industrialised countries. As I alluded to earlier, we have seen the end of Chinese passivity in international affairs. Deepening our relationships with countries in Asia, the leading countries in Latin America, the Middle East&#151;including the Gulf States&#151;and Africa will be important to us. This cannot be achieved with a diminishing international presence for our country.</p>

<a name="80313-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08031360000329"></a>I agree with David Cameron when he speaks of a new emphasis on multilateralism. It is vital to widen the circle of British influence, making more of the underutilised Commonwealth to enhance our co-operation with countries with which we have a historical, cultural, political and economic tie. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, has included the question of European co-operation in this debate and this is important. I welcome the role that the United Kingdom plays in Europe, in particular the expansion that we have seen of the European Union towards the countries of eastern Europe. I would like to see that widening continue with potential growth into the Balkans, Turkey, and even perhaps Ukraine. European co-operation on that scale would prove to be a very powerful influence in the world. European countries working together, speaking with one voice should be an aspiration for us all to work towards but the recent experience of the European Union suggests that a single foreign policy is not easy to achieve. A Europe constructed on flexibility and concentrating on practical solutions to the challenges confronting the global community is likely to be more effective than internal squabbling about the creation of institutional structures.</p>

I have found the debate particularly interesting because it obliged me to look at the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee report on the Foreign Office&#146;s annual report, which indicates the extent to which House of Commons scrutiny of departmental activities has developed. Thirty years ago, I served on the predecessor committee of the Foreign Affairs Committee&#151;the Defence and External Affairs Sub-Committee of the Expenditure Committee. Our reports were about one-tenth the size of the reports of the Foreign Affairs Committee; they certainly did not go into anything like the depth that is gone into now. The committee&#146;s report, and the reply from the Foreign Office to it, shows the very helpful dialogue that now goes on. The activities of another place are not always recognised in this House, but I have found them to be of particular importance. This is the first debate that I have taken part in for which the Library has produced a specific briefing document. This is an important development, and I find it extremely helpful.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80313-0010.htm"/>


<a name="80313-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08031360000332"></a>We are devoting ourselves in this debate to a wide range of issues. We must start, presumably, with the share of public expenditure involved as a share of the gross national product. Although we cannot spend too much time on it, that is the ultimate constraint&#151;the share of total resources available for external activities and, within that, the share for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and external policy. I share the view expressed most recently by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, in that I am pleased to see the increases in DfID&#146;s budget, although that should in no way be a reason for restricting or even leaving at a flat level the expenditure of the Foreign Office. Indeed, the more DfID does, the more there is a need for the political development to be maintained.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08031360000333"></a>We then come to the way in which the Foreign Office uses its resources. In the discussions so far, the allocation and size of posts and the level of the heads of posts have been important. I can see the case for increasing staffing in south Asia and the Middle East. That is important, but on the whole the increase should have been found from additional resources rather than from the removal of posts from western Europe. There may be some case&#151;not much, but some&#151;for some reduction in countries that are members of the European Union, although my noble friend  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1634"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1634</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>suggested that the case might not be so clear. However, I am not at all convinced that that applies to other European countries. I was recently in south-eastern Europe and was very concerned to discover that every post there, with the exception of one, will lose some of its staff as a result of these moves. The countries of south-eastern Europe are not stable. We need to have substantial staff in those posts until their problems have been resolved. I hope that can be re-examined.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08031360000334"></a>Another example is Madagascar, which I visited on an Inter-Parliamentary Union visit and whose president is keen to reintroduce the relationship which the country had in the 19th century with Britain. It has introduced English as its third official language. Just over two years ago, the post was closed, and if the people of Madagascar want British visas they must either go to or communicate with Mauritius. We should look very carefully at this sort of post in Africa.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08031360000335"></a>We have discussed the relationship between DfID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The remarks made by the Foreign Secretary in his speech to the FCO leadership conference on 4 March were rather important. He said that there was a need for,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000546"></a>&#147;better integration, particularly between MoD, DfID and FCO. I can set the lead, with regular trilaterals with Des Browne and Douglas Alexander. But we need to think more radically about joining up at all levels: from co-located staff at post to single cross-departmental country plans&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000502"></a>That is absolutely right. I hope not merely that the Foreign Secretary does that in speeches but that we will see it happening on the ground. Too often, one finds situations in which it at least appears as though there are two different levels of activity in a country: one operated by the Foreign Office, and the other by DfID.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08031360000336"></a>On our relationship with Europe, I want to say something about the External Action Service and the way in which we and the Foreign Office have been able to provide significant and important contributors in the activities of the European Commission during our 35 years of membership. Many Members of this House have contributed at various levels within the Commission to making it effective. It is not insignificant that apparently every one of the current 27 Commissioners has a British member of his cabinet. It suggests the extent to which British officials are respected and found useful right across the European Union.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08031360000337"></a>I am, however, concerned about the reduction in the number of those applying for the concours&#151;the Commission entrance examinations. Although something like 28 scholarships are awarded each year for the College of Europe nears Bruges, which is one of form of preparation for entry to the concours, only 22 were taken up this year. There are considerable difficulties in encouraging people to go for them. It is partly a problem of language knowledge, a subject which is not infrequently discussed in this House. People do not have sufficient language knowledge and we must address it. It is a serious loss if we do not have people taking part. I should say that I come from a political party where both the leader and the president are alumni of the College of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08031360000338"></a>Finally, on the External Action Service, the European Union Committee has today produced our report on the treaty of Lisbon. I shall quote the paragraph that takes up the words used by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08031360000526"></a>&#147;We would welcome assurances from the Government that, where it is in line with UK policy, they will contribute to providing the Service with high quality personnel with the necessary language skills, including secondees, and adequate financial resources&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000503"></a>I would be glad to hear the Minister&#146;s initial response to that. We will undoubtedly return to the issue in our debates on the treaty.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08031360000339"></a>We have seen a great deal of cross-party cooperation and almost unanimity today, and from the Cross Benches as well. I hope that we can take this forward, working together to maintain the effectiveness of our Foreign Office.</p>

The work of our high commissioners, ambassadors and defence and service attaches overseas has a major part to play in informing the Government, through the FCO or Ministry of Defence, of exactly what of significance and potential threat is happening or could happen in their respective areas. They thus contribute to the advice given to the Government and chiefs of staff as to what can, and perhaps should, be done to contain or counter it, if that is what is required.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08031360000341"></a>Diplomatic effort unaided&#151;except, undoubtedly, for economic aid&#151;will sometimes produce by far the best results. Sometimes it may need military support and muscle to increase its effectiveness. But whatever military force it is decided to deploy and use, the use of that force&#151;even if it has temporarily become the major partner&#151;will be of much less value, and even become counterproductive, unless there is also diplomatic effort in the wings to get allies and other interested parties on side to produce a more benign stability, healing the wounds after the military action is over.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08031360000342"></a>It is of the utmost importance that our foreign policy and defence policy are properly joined up as one entity, sometimes with the latter, defence, in the lead and supported by the former. We hope more often than not that it will be vice versa, with diplomacy in the driving seat. I hope that is appreciated when settling the FCO&#146;s priorities and resources, particularly in vulnerable areas where conflict is never far distant. If our representatives abroad are starved of resources, reduced to a skeleton or sometimes removed all together because of financial stringency, diplomacy cannot make the contribution which I have mentioned and which is so important to the national effort.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08031360000343"></a>It is with that in mind that I am most distressed to hear that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has reduced, if not removed, its participation in the work

That seems absolutely crazy if we are serious about bringing our foreign and defence policy ever closer together, able to work in harmony one with the other. Perhaps the Minister can reassure your Lordships' House on the general principle I mentioned and on this particular, rather negative, manifestation of what happens in practice, albeit I hope only temporarily.</p>

Many noble Lords have talked about the mechanism of interdepartmental co-operation and staffing within the FCO. I had hoped to do the same, but in light of the fact that many noble Lords have already covered these issues with far greater experience than I have, I shall concentrate on issues that have got neglected, one or two of which were referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, in her elegant speech.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08031360000345"></a>It is important to bear in mind that resources are designed to achieve certain objectives. Therefore, we should ask ourselves: what are the major goals that our foreign policy should aim to achieve? The Foreign Secretary, whom I greatly admire, has set out those goals with great clarity, and in some respects they are new. They are new in that after the Second World War&#151;certainly, during the past 20 years&#151;our foreign policy has come to be haunted and influenced by three images. First, we want to be a bridge between Europe and the United States; secondly, we want to give leadership to Europe; and, thirdly, we are told that we must become a beacon to the world. Mercifully, the new Foreign Secretary&#146;s thinking is free from these hubristic ambitions.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08031360000346"></a>We cannot be a bridge because there is no chance that the United States will outsource its diplomacy to us. We cannot be a bridge between two institutions if we are already an integral part of one; namely, the European Union. We are not a semi-detached member of the EU. We are very much at its heart. We share its values and interests. Therefore, the first important lesson to bear in mind is that we must make the European Union a vital pillar of our foreign policy. This could take a number of forms, some of which would involve a reduction in expenditure. We should think, as we are rightly doing now, in terms of a common foreign and security policy in many areas. We cannot have embassies in all 191 countries. Therefore, a collective European Union representation in certain matters could be explored. Likewise, we could pool our consular services and ensure that there is greater co-operation between the European embassies in different parts of the world so that each one does not duplicate the efforts of others. As I say, that should release quite a large number of resources for other purposes.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08031360000347"></a>My second point is that happily, so far, we are a minor major power and have not yet become a major minor power. As a minor major power we cannot rely on hardware. We can rely only on our soft power. Soft power always results, as Robert Nye and others have  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1637"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1637</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pointed out in the American context, from the trust that we are able to secure in other parts of the world in the judgment and wisdom of the policies that we follow. If others begin to feel that our understanding of world problems is intellectually more coherent and morally more persuasive, it is very likely that in the battle for ideas we might be able to influence the way in which they think about the world, which is the greatest impact that any foreign country can hope to make, and therefore join us in pursuing certain common causes. The question is: how can we make sure that our foreign policy is wise and inspires trust and confidence in different parts of the world? I am afraid that this has not been the case in relation to either Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08031360000348"></a>We need to make sure that culture is at the centre of the formulation of foreign policy in an increasingly volatile and culturally diverse world. For example, in the context of Afghanistan, we need to understand its society and culture. We need to understand the economy of the drug market. We also need to understand how, in a society like this, institutions graft, and which ones have a hope of success and which ones do not. This means that our FCO would need to rely on anthropologists, historians, economists and a number of other specialists. It also means that our foreign policy has a greater chance of being wise if it is not merely left to the experts but also involves NGOs with considerable experience at grass-roots level. In the context of Afghanistan and Iraq, if NGOs with experience in those areas had been consulted, some of the mistakes that have been made would not have been made.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08031360000349"></a>The third point I want to make is this: the Foreign Secretary has talked about four priorities, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, rightly referred. In those four priorities I do not see any reference to two things which are absolutely crucial. The Foreign Secretary rightly talks about terrorism and preventing conflicts. At the root of all conflicts and terrorism lie poverty and a sense of humiliation in certain parts of the world. Therefore, global justice, understood both in economic and political terms, should be at the centre of our foreign policy. Economically, global justice would involve fighting poverty, and offering better terms of trade and well directed foreign aid. A just foreign policy would be an even-handed foreign policy, so that we do not end up doing things in other parts of the world that lead to disaster, or have a blowback domestically, so that we end up spending a lot of money dealing with the consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08031360000350"></a>The other important thing for a minor major power to bear in mind is that the world will listen to us and take us seriously if they think that we offer sensible advice. In this context, I am rather surprised that, in a multi-ethnic society like ours, very few of our diplomatic representatives seem to come from ethnic minorities. I do not have the figures and hope the Minister will provide them for high commissioners, ambassadors and senior officers in our foreign diplomatic missions, and, for that matter, the FCO itself. What kind of input is made by people from different backgrounds with, therefore, different kinds of expertise? This is where the United States scores a very important point. Although lots of countries find it hegemonic, they know that there would be no American delegation

That inspires confidence in the country. We ought to think about that.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08031360000351"></a>Briefly, my last point is that our foreign policy naturally operates in collaboration with, and is articulated through, the British Council and the BBC. I want quickly to say three things about the British Council, on the basis of my considerable experience of what it has done and is doing in India. There are three ways in which it might need to reconsider some things that it is doing. First, it should not confine its offices merely to major centres where they have been traditionally based but should try to identify and reach out to new areas that are becoming important in a particular country. For example, in India it would not be just Ahmedabad, Delhi, Calcutta or Chennai, while there are other places, such as Baroda and many others, which are becoming extremely important in terms of foreign policy and economic interests. We should be concentrating on them as well.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08031360000352"></a>It is also important that the British Council should be thinking not merely in terms of educational and cultural exchanges, but also of shaping the thinking of people within the country in the limits of neutrality. This can be done by organising workshops, conferences, debates, and bringing the intellectuals of the nation together so that they are able to arrive at a form of consensus. That will be seen as a contribution made by the British Council to the thinking in the country.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08031360000353"></a>At the international level, it would do us no harm at all if we were to take the initiative in encouraging a global dialogue between different parts of the world, especially with Muslims, by organising some kind of international conference. The United Kingdom could certainly take the lead in organising a conference to which leading Muslims and others could be invited. We could then start thinking about new principles of global order.</p>

The fact is that the constant erosion of the Foreign Office budget is nothing short of a national catastrophe, and I hope that the Minister is not only listening, but able to do something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08031360000355"></a>I am going to move the debate towards Latin America, mainly because it is the area in which I spent most of my working life. While I am in complete agreement that China and India are vitally important and fast-growing economies, that does not mean that Latin America, with its considerable economic potential, should be neglected or excluded. When the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, was Foreign Secretary&#151;I am sorry he is not in his place&#151;he made a famous speech about Latin America in which he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08031360000527"></a>&#147;The age of neglect is over&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000504"></a>Unfortunately it has returned with a vengeance and has even been extended. An examination of recent GDP figures shows that total Latin American GDP is  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1639"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1639</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>slightly larger than China with less than half the population. However, Brazil, which is the lead country in Latin America, and Mexico, which is the second, are only a few GDP points behind India with much smaller populations. This shows that Latin American purchasing power is valuable and we should be doing something about it.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08031360000356"></a>Of course, Latin America is a very diverse region, but the potential is there. In spite of that potential, we have chosen to cut four posts, downgrade others, cut staff and give the impression of a lack of interest in commercial relationships. Doing business in Latin America, like elsewhere, requires good contacts. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, I was responsible for building local Latin American subsidiaries of British companies. Embassy staff on the ground provided both political and economic advice, but above all vital personal contacts. In those days, embassies had both UK and locally engaged commercial officers, but these have now gone. They should be reinstated instead of relying on UKTI information from London. EU embassies have been mentioned, and indeed they exist in all Latin American countries, but they are concerned with trade and can do nothing in response to British business interests.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08031360000357"></a>Moreover, British companies are often in direct competition with our major European partners&#151;Spain, France, Germany and Italy&#151;so despite the fact that they may be useful in other ways, EU embassies are no help to us in that respect. I have made the case before that we should reinstate UKTI inside the Foreign Office, and indeed on the last occasion I said this, I received considerable support from the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, who is to follow me. I hope that she is still of a like mind. There is another organisation outside which used to be called the Committee of Invisible Exports and now has a new name. It is about to be headed up by a recently retired British ambassador, and I believe that it is of a like mind on this issue as well.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08031360000358"></a>The fact is that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is the smallest and was always by far the most efficient department in Whitehall. It should be re-empowered to do the job for which it was originally conceived and which it did so brilliantly. I like to think that this will happen, but I am not very optimistic about what is happening at the moment in budgetary terms. I hope that the Minister will have something useful to say on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08031360000360"></a>Speakers on all sides of the House have talked about the scale of change in recent years; indeed, going back over the past 50 years. Some of your Lordships have concentrated on the importance of international diplomacy in forestalling international  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1640"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1640</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>conflict, some on maintaining the importance of our great multilateral forums like the UN and the EU, and others on the relative perceived inequities in the funding of DfID.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08031360000361"></a>Your Lordships have also defined the purpose of our foreign policy in a variety of different ways. For my part, I believe in the straightforward position that British foreign policy should be focused on the security and prosperity of the United Kingdom. That includes active engagement in multilateral forums like the United Nations, NATO, the EU and the Commonwealth, and supporting the rule of law and human rights as essential prerequisites to the stable and constructive pursuit of international relationships.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08031360000362"></a>In all the 12 years that I have participated in these debates in the House of Lords, and indeed before that during my time as a trade union general secretary responsible for diplomats, there have been constant rows about FCO funding. There has never been a senior diplomat or an FCO Minister, including me, who would not have made a pretty compelling case for more funding, more diplomats and more capacity throughout the Foreign Office. All Secretaries of State have fought hard to secure and sustain their budgets while secretly believing that those budgets simply were not enough. They have pleaded damage to our foreign policy if their bids were undercut, while the Treasury has pleaded damage to the taxpayer&#146;s interest if the bids were met.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08031360000363"></a>The rules of that game have not changed, but the context has. I shall highlight four ways in which that has happened. When I first became an FCO Minister in 1997, consular work was a very poor relation. It stood apart from the serious business of foreign policy formulation, was dealt with as a second-order issue in a completely different part of the Foreign Office and, frankly, was staffed by those who the Foreign Office hierarchy thought could deal with soft diplomacy and sympathy rather than hard argument and intellectual rigour. That has changed out of all recognition in the past 11 years; the fate of Britons in trouble abroad has become one of the most time-consuming and intensive areas of FCO activity. People in trouble, injured, killed or kidnapped, the victims of forced marriage, of natural disaster or of terrorist attack&#151;they all have the right to expect support from their Government at home. Public opinion has demanded that and newspapers have focused upon it. That has been a deliberate and dramatic change in Foreign Office priorities.</p>

<a name="80313-0010.htm_para28"></a>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80313-0011.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08031360000364"></a>Secondly, there is the question of visas. Again, when I first went to the FCO this was another backwater of activity, a sidelined, difficult area of work that most of the FCO considered dull, routine and not what clever chaps did. However, it became an issue of huge priority for the tens of thousands of British Pakistanis and British Indians whose families wanted greater access, and for the increasing number of people who want to come to this country on business or for tourism. It became, in effect, a domestic issue and resources had to be put into it&#151;rightly so. Of course those services are paid for by those who benefit directly, but they absorb staff time and human resources. I came back from Saudi Arabia this morning&#151;I declare an interest as chair of the Saudi-British Business  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1641"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1641</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Council&#151;where my Saudi counterparts told me that our visa service is now second to none. That is of direct benefit to us in this country when we depend so heavily on trade and investment.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08031360000365"></a>The third area in which I see a marked change is trade, as the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, mentioned a moment ago. In 1977, ambassadors regarded involvement in trade issues as somewhat below their sightline, except perhaps when the serious business of defence equipment was involved. However, trade has become another area that requires our ambassadors to be fully engaged and to which they are required to commit time, intellectual application and staff resources. The FCO is our delivery mechanism for trade, not BERR or the UKTI exclusively&#151;as I remember it at the time of the DTI&#151;or indeed the Treasury. It is Foreign Office diplomats who do that on the ground throughout the world. I was the first Minister between the two departments, the DTI and FCO, and co-operation at working level was not always as wholehearted as it might have been in terms of Whitehall activity. Let us see what happens when those activities are added to by the addition of the Defence Export Services Organisation. I am interested to know what the Minister has to say on that when he responds.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08031360000366"></a>The fourth area, which has assumed increasing importance, is human rights. That is characterised in different ways; our friends over the Atlantic think of it as democracy and for others of us, with perhaps less simplistic views, it is about establishing the rule of law, human rights and the growth of civil society, without which a vote for a Government becomes the licensed tyranny of the majority over the minority. The Foreign Office&#146;s commitment to capacity building in civil society overseas is real and important, and it costs time, money and human resources. It is emphatically not a DfID issue; it is a Foreign Office issue and area of expertise. It needs real knowledge of the individual countries concerned. It is not a one-size-fits-all exercise.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08031360000367"></a>I have characterised those four areas, not because they are exclusively important but because they are the day-to-day bread-and-butter issues, which so often get shoved to one side. They are not headline issues about the huge and enormous importance of our diplomatic presence in countries such as Iraq or our recently strengthened presence in Afghanistan. They do not deal with the burgeoning economic influence of China or India, the flexing of Russian energy muscles or the Gulf&#146;s sovereign wealth funds. However, they are of huge importance to the security and the prosperity of this country.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08031360000368"></a>Those areas are matched by increasing commitment in other areas, such as in the United Nations, where we field a superb team of highly motivated and intellectually able individuals; in NATO, where our strategic positioning with the US, Europe and Turkey is arguably more crucial than ever; and in the EU, where the United Kingdom&#146;s down-to-earth attitude&#151;which is without the doctrinaire fervour of some of our close neighbours&#151;or the instinctive opposition to the winds of change of others usually put us in the right position.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08031360000369"></a>The truth is that we all know that foreign policy now has to comprehend overseas development, defence and trade, and that it increasingly involves transport,  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1642"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1642</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>health, education and justice and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, emphasised, environmental issues. However, it still has to cover foreign policy&#151;hard, tough and intellectually rigorous foreign policy. I fear that that hard-nosed foreign policy often becomes the victim of that panoply of issues, which I have described. If we are not able to pursue that sort of tough foreign policy, we will not be able to deliver on the security and prosperity that people in this country have a right to expect from their Foreign Office.</p>

I strongly support what the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, said about the consular work of the Foreign Office and its posts abroad. We tend to forget how the exponential take-off in travel has meant that more and more people need the help of posts abroad, and therefore that it is desirable to retain posts.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08031360000371"></a>I want to concentrate on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, about networks. There may be a systemic problem concerning the allocation of the slices of the FCO resource cake. Most people who have taken part in this debate would like a bigger cake. That is hardly going to be settled by what we say, but how the cake is sliced is an important issue. I strongly support the clearer prioritisation that has been introduced. The drafting of clear, short objectives for foreign policy is a good idea. The clear, short lists that have been produced, particularly by this Foreign Secretary, are very good; I strongly support that. However, there is a risk that they result in the favouring of programme expenditure as against network expenditure.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08031360000372"></a>For example, the FCO&#146;s work on climate change is of a very high calibre and is done by very good people. However, if you are the priority holder&#151;if you hold the climate change objective&#151;you will tend to have a bias in favour of initiatives, conferences and publications rather than conversation and contact-building in posts. You will not see an immediate interest for you in maintaining an embassy in Ruritania. Yet if we do not have embassies in the Ruritanias, the overall objective of trying to get the world to move the right way on climate change will be harder to achieve. If, as I believe, we are approaching a Bretton Woods moment, when we need to devise the new institutions to deal with climate change, there is no point in having just a British prescription; there needs to be an EU prescription, and a prescription that is pre-sold to a willing world that has heard about it previously, discussed it and seen its angles on it reflected in the final product. That is the risk if you go down the route of priorities: no one is directly responsible for maintaining the embassy in Ruritania, for the network: at least, I would like to hear from the Minister if someone is&#151;I cannot see, in the charts in Foreign Office publications these days, who is. That worries me.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08031360000373"></a>A number of points made in this debate were very relevant, such as that made by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, about language training. You have to have  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1643"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1643</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people on the ground; you have to have people talking to the Government in office in the country in question; you have to have people knowing the opposition&#151;the people who might be the next Government&#151;and correctly predicting who they will be. The Gorbachev prediction was very important at the time. It is no good saying that all of this can be done directly on the telephone from London. Yes, a lot of it can be done with the Government in office, if the approach is properly targeted and people have been briefed by the post on the ground&#151;if you have the right people on the line. But the Government in London cannot ring up the opposition&#151;the next Government&#151;out there because, first, they do not know who they are and, secondly, it is politically dangerous for a Government to talk to another country&#146;s opposition. You need someone on the ground; you need to have a network of people who speak the right languages in the right quarters.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08031360000374"></a>Inside the European Union, we have not yet reflected in our deployments&#151;in our network&#151;the fact that the new member states have votes and vote on what become our laws. We still have posts of a size that were quite good for keeping in touch with the countries of Eastern Europe before they joined the European Union. We do not have posts, in my judgment, that are fully equipped for the lobbying that should go on before there is a great debate in council, a great decision and a great vote. So I strongly support the point about Bucharest and Bratislava, which was elegantly made at the start of this debate by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire.</p>

If I may misuse the famous London slogan, I could say, &#147;Mind the gap and stand clear of the floors&#148;, using the verb &#147;mind&#148; in the old Anglo-Saxon sense of &#147;pay attention to&#148; and the phrase &#147;stand clear of the floors&#148; to refer to the Government&#146;s policy, which involves far too tight a budget for the Foreign Office, with all its future duties. That has been a consensus outcome of this debate from all parts of the House, although it was couched in very polite language. I hope that the Minister will not misunderstand the politeness, which is a traditional House of Lords phenomenon for concealing, as it were, the anxiety that many noble Lords have expressed today about the new budget plans.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08031360000376"></a>I, too, thank my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire for his initiative in launching this debate. It has been a very great occasion. He spoke with his traditional authority and knowledge, blending the best elements of Chatham House and the international relations department of the London School of Economics, as well as his knowledge of these matters as a politician in the House of Lords. How right he was to refer to the Cabinet Office role having been built up in recent times by slightly jealous Prime Ministers, so that it becomes a miniature Foreign Office of a kind on its own. Its difficulties at present partly reflect that, and partly the need to recast some of its roles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08031360000377"></a>I also agree with my noble friend Lord Wallace when he said that the now Prime Minister&#151;and then Chancellor&#151;did not appear at all keen on the Foreign Office and probably wanted it to be a small and more modest department in future; modest for the wrong reasons. I also agree very much with the suggestion of my noble friend that we call our embassies in the EU countries British Government Offices, British Government Representation Offices, or some such more modern title. That would convey that we are not too nervous about being reasonably integrated with our colleagues in the European Union.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08031360000378"></a>It was also a great pleasure to hear the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, refer to DfID. I think that he used a phrase along the lines of &#147;it has much more cash than it actually uses&#148;. It is manifestly unfair on the Foreign Office, as both departments ultimately need more resources. DfID, as has been said in this debate, is getting going in a really striking way now, and no one would want to detract from that. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, also referred to that unfair disparity between the two departments, which I hope will be dealt with in future years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08031360000379"></a>I am so glad that my noble friend Lady Williams of Crosby showed the strong support for the EU that we have come to expect from her. How right she was to say that that also means, by implication, an even more active role for our own embassies or missions in other EU countries, particularly the east European ones, where their modern nation-building needs help and advice from outside&#151;but not of an overweening kind, I hasten to add. I rather agree with the analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, when he said that it sounded as if the Treasury wanted a reduction and the Foreign Office Ministers then decided to build the modern strategy in that reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08031360000380"></a>While one would like to have time to refer to other speeches, time is inevitably short on these occasions, but it was also a pleasure to listen to the wise advice of the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, who spoke from her knowledge of the modern problems of the Foreign Office. To declare an interest, the noble Baroness recently became the appointed chairman of the European Atlantic Group, of which I am president. She will contribute much knowledge and authority to that group in future. The diplomats in that group, whether as guests, visitors or members&#151;for many foreign diplomats come to each of our occasions, whether we have dinners or other gatherings&#151;frequently pay tribute to the quality of the British Foreign Office and its work.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08031360000381"></a>The modernisation of the Foreign Office in recent years has been very considerable, with agreeable developments such as more women diplomats and more couples being located in missions, which are important for the modern development of the sociology of the Foreign Office. They are not just from Oxbridge, by the way; although that process is pretty slow, it is getting better&#151;and the sooner it gets rapidly better, the greater that achievement will be. Links to trade and economics also reinforce the modern role of the Foreign Office, rather than reducing it. A number of your Lordships referred to more effort within the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08031360000382"></a>The conclusions of the report from the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, however, were pretty radical, although couched in polite language. Conclusion 2 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="08031360000528"></a>&#147;We conclude that the Comprehensive Spending Review ... settlement for the FCO, one of the tightest in Whitehall, risks jeopardising the FCO&#146;s important work&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000505"></a>That is a strong conclusion, and the Government must now answer some of the points made in this debate about those anxieties. However, I will quickly pay tribute to David Miliband&#146;s leadership as Secretary of State, which has been quite remarkable&#151;not least in the recent European reform treaty proceedings&#151;as has that of Jim Murphy, his Europe Minister in the House of Commons. In future, under that treaty, the external action service of the EU will also be extremely important for British diplomats and their careers. I hope that that new mechanism will be successful in future.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08031360000383"></a>However, &#163;1.7 billion is really not enough to deal with the priorities that the Foreign Office will now face in this much larger and more demanding world, where there are more and more countries in total in the UN. The presence in African missions is totally inadequate, as has been said, and that applies to other parts of the world as well. My noble friend Lord Roper mentioned the helpful and beautifully laid out report from the House of Lords Library. The relevant figure in real terms is 5 per cent per annum. The &#163;1.7 billion for 2010-11 will be inadequate for the Foreign Office&#146;s tasks.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08031360000384"></a>The new targets come after five to seven years of demoralising cuts in services and activities here, there and everywhere in the Foreign Office, as you rapidly find out if you talk to younger diplomatic members of the Foreign Office when they are entitled to be indiscreet in the corner of a pub or restaurant. The reduction of posts in EU countries at a time when enlargement and the Lisbon treaty increase the need for Foreign Office activities is difficult for the Government to justify. The military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan was mentioned several times. It needs to be finite so that we do not get into the morass of an inexorable rise in hugely extravagant and expensive defence spending without achieving our necessary targets. Although some people in the Middle East may be incorrect in their analysis, a lot of people in that area do not share our support for NATO&#146;s role and regard it as a pretend assignment for an organisation that should have been disbanded shortly after the signing of the Warsaw Pact. Many Arabs and Afghans say that this is a pretend mechanism to keep NATO going and that it is not really an appropriate role. I do not agree with that but none the less one cannot go on saying that NATO&#146;s role in Afghanistan will last for years and years with all the huge expenditure that that will involve for Britain and other countries.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08031360000385"></a>The important matter of the arms trade treaty was referred to in the report. I very much endorse the need for that in the modern world. My noble friend Lady Williams also accepts that that is an important priority, and has campaigned for it recently. I do not have time to refer to the FCO services and executive agencies&#146; work mentioned at page 53 of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee&#146;s report. Therefore, I conclude by asking the Minister to respond seriously&#151;as I am

The figures are not adequate. At least &#163;2 billion is needed for the immediate target of 2010-11. That constitutes a very modest increase. In future the Foreign Office needs to expand rather than being crunched into a relatively low-morale institution given the pressures from the Treasury and other parts of the Government.</p>

I am, however, most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, for introducing it this afternoon. It is always a great privilege to respond on behalf of my colleagues on these Benches.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08031360000387"></a>As my noble and learned friend Lord Howe and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, clearly stated, this debate is about the importance of democracy. The noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, in her forceful speech referred to the importance of security and prosperity. Yet the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#146;s budget is due to rise by just &#163;0.1 billion over the next three years. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#146;s budget is supposed to,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000547"></a>&#147;effectively rise through efficiency savings by restructuring, cutting administrative costs and changing the emphasis of resources, by streamlining towards the Middle East&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000506"></a>Many of your Lordships mentioned that since May 1997 the Government have closed eight British embassies, eight British high commissions and 18 British consulates, making a total of 34 closures in 10 years. The &#147;diplomatic surge&#148; announced in January this year is supposed to account for the reassignment of these roles, with the number of staff in posts in the Middle East and south Asia to be increased by 30 per cent. However, over the past 10 years the closing of diplomatic posts has resulted in rock-bottom morale and a stampede for the exit door by disenchanted embassy staff. By 2005, diplomats on gardening leave were costing the taxpayer more than &#163;500,000 per month. An issue noted not only in this debate by the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, but also in other debates, is that of the diplomatic black hole in central America, where just three out of the seven countries have any diplomatic&#151;or even any DfID&#151;staff posted there. This reflects a wider change in the geographical utilisation of FCO resources&#151;part of the so-entitled &#147;diplomatic surge&#148;.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08031360000388"></a>President Bush&#146;s global war on terror&#151;GWOT&#151;has further strained the limited resources of the FCO by increasing security costs for diplomatic property and staff and by channelling money to the front line. Yet in 2004, the Kuwaiti embassy, undeniably a location of colossal strategic importance in the Middle East, was driven nearly to the brink of bankruptcy and was forced to close until urgent financial aid could be found. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, rightly bemoaned the Foreign Secretary&#146;s Written Statement today, cutting the FCO scholarship and fellowship funding, and also the lack of languages being taught.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08031360000389"></a>I turn to the European part of the debate, touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, where I have direct personal experience of the FCO budget cuts. I declare an interest&#151;I have been a member of the British  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1647"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1647</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Association for Central and Eastern Europe&#146;s council since 1994. Since 1991, more than 5,000 politicians, civil servants, judges, journalists and businessmen from countries in central Europe have participated in courses, seminars and conferences organised by BACEE. This association has contributed to improvements in civil society in countries that have revived democratic systems after years of authoritarian one-party rule. Through the transfer of expertise and know-how, it has helped Governments, the media and key institutions of states in transition, and thus the lives of people in central Europe. The popularity of BACEE&#146;s programmes in central European states is linked to its longstanding approach of responding to requests from states, rather than trying to impose something on them. BACEE closed, sadly, on 29 January, after 40 years. It had been run brilliantly in the past few years by the former ambassador, Nicholas Jarrold. Its closure is the direct result of the FCO&#146;s decision to withdraw its grant in aid. Does the Minister not think that the FCO has made a dreadful mistake? This is not a casual question. To close BACEE now, when developments in Serbia and Kosovo are of such concern, compounds the error, especially as the sum of money concerned is so relatively minor&#151;about &#163;260,000. It gives a lamentable impression of reduced British interest in the new member states of the EU, and particularly in the countries that aspire to join the EU.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08031360000390"></a>I return to where I started and quote again. The FCO&#146;s budget is supposed to,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000548"></a>&#147;effectively rise through efficiency savings by restructuring, cutting administrative costs and changing the emphasis of resources, by streamlining towards the Middle East&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000507"></a>This is exactly what happened this Tuesday with the BBC World Service. Ten language services were closed so that it was able to launch the new Arabic television service. The three-year grant in aid of 3 per cent was only released provided the BBC World Service met its efficiency targets. It had to find savings to meet the rising costs of wages and pensions.</p>

<a name="80313-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08031360000391"></a>On a personal point, it is ironic that the issue of cuts to the BBC World Service was the subject of my first forays in politics. I lobbied furiously against the then proposed cuts in 1979 of &#163;4 million on a &#163;40 million budget. We were at that time due to attend the World Administrative Radio Conference&#151;WARC&#151;in Geneva, where all radio frequencies were being renewed, reallocated and would be binding into the next century. For this reason, it was vital then not to make these cuts. It was a unique opportunity too, at the height of the Cold War, for the Russians to obtain at our cost what they felt was their fair share of the frequency pie. Luckily, the then Mrs Thatcher and her team listened and recognised the problem. They abandoned the cuts and allocated more money, thus saving the BBC World Service. Will the Minister consider augmenting rather than cutting funds both for the BBC World Service and for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office?</p>

One of the pleasures in preparing for this debate was reading the lecture of the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, which he made at Chatham House last December, and even more so perhaps the article that he wrote in <I>International Affairs</I> a few years ago&#151;I think it was April 1978&#151;when the younger noble Lord wrote a very compelling piece about the response to the Berrill report, whose reverberations we perhaps still feel to some extent today. I know that the noble Lord, having discussed it with him, feels so too.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08031360000393"></a>There has been a great deal of wisdom and experience among the speakers in today&#146;s debate. I am afraid that my credentials, since I am speaking in my first large Foreign and Commonwealth Office debate, are feebly pale in comparison. I have a half-brother who had a distinguished career first in the Commonwealth Relations Office and later in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. I am proud to have a nephew who is a serving diplomat abroad as a member of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and my father was a senior officer in the British Council, which was his career. More personally, as a Minister in the Ministry of Defence some years ago, I received invaluable support and assistance from embassies and high commissions around the world without exception. Perhaps noble Lords can see that I have some background in being a supporter of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office over a number of years.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08031360000394"></a>The issue that was raised is the promotion of Britain&#146;s global interests and the resources that are provided to the Foreign Office to pursue them. I argue that those questions should be viewed through the prism of the ever-closer link between domestic and international affairs that many noble Lords have referred to today. The days when the Foreign Office provided the sole channel of communication for British statesmen with their counterparts elsewhere in the world are long gone. Indeed, they were already a distant memory 30 years ago, when the article that I referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, was written. The role of foreign ministries has moved on as the world has changed, and frankly that will only continue in what is an increasingly interconnected world.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08031360000395"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, made the comment that this is a changing world, and everyone has said that implicitly. I am very grateful for the genuine compliments that have been paid to my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary during the debate from around the House. As he said in his speech on 4 March:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08031360000529"></a>&#147;Globalisation and interdependence already define our age&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80313-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08031360000396"></a>For that reason, if for no other, all Governments have a duty to keep the role and objectives of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office under regular review. The conclusions of the latest such review were announced by the Foreign Secretary in another place on 23 January. They identified the three main roles that the FCO plays: providing a flexible global network serving the Government as a whole; delivering essential services to the British public and business; and shaping and delivering Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s foreign policy.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1649"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1649</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80313-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08031360000397"></a>The new framework identifies four new policy goals; areas of the greatest importance to the UK where the FCO can make the most difference. We heard about them this afternoon. They are countering terrorism and proliferation; preventing and resolving conflict; promoting a low carbon/high growth global economy; and developing effective international institutions, especially the UN and EU. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, made some very pertinent points about that list.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08031360000398"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, who spoke in the gap, is concerned about the programme against our network. The strategy takes on an integrated approach to both, so that the climate change policy will raise the programme from &#163;4 million to &#163;21 million and create, critically, 35 new diplomatic staff posts, backed by 70 locally engaged staff to build the relationship and have what we hope will be a real influence on the climate change debate throughout the world.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08031360000399"></a>This new strategic framework is now being implemented with FCO resources being reallocated to these new priorities. I am certainly not going to get into a numbers game on resources&#151;that would be a mistake and would diminish this particular debate. However, I absolutely take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, that the politeness and good humour with which this debate was conducted does not mean that what was said on all sides of the House was not meant with the greatest seriousness. I listened carefully to the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, and her sharp criticism of the lack of spending that she says the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has had over the years. I was listening for a clue&#151;I ask this very gently&#151;about whether any future Conservative Government would promise to increase Foreign and Commonwealth Office spending. I do not expect her to answer that now because I think the answer is probably no. That adds to the problem rather than offering an easy solution to it.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08031360000400"></a>I will say no more about spending: the figures have been given. However, I will say what we will focus the resources on our four new policy goals. It means substantial increases in resources for counterterrorism, climate change and our work in Afghanistan. In addition, funding for counterproliferation, conflict prevention and international institutions is also set to increase, but by more modest amounts. The BBC World Service will launch a new Persian television channel and extend broadcasting, as we heard, of its Arabic language TV service to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The British Council will extend its efforts to build mutual understanding with Muslim societies, particularly among alienated younger populations. I hope that my noble friend Lord Parekh will take particular notice of that.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08031360000401"></a>To achieve these changes, all three bodies will benefit not just from new funding provided by the Treasury, but money recycled internally through ambitious efficiency programmes. These increases will in part be financed through reducing funding for other policy issues, including three areas where other Whitehall departments will be taking on more of the burden: sustainable development, science and innovation and the field of crime and drugs. At the same time, the Foreign Office, the BBC World Service and the British Council are jointly

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08031360000402"></a>Funding the essential public services that we provide to the British people will be sustained and our dedicated staff will continue to provide consular assistance around the world to Britons living, working and travelling abroad. My noble friend Lady Symons made particular reference to how this issue has gone up the agenda in a huge way in the past years and will continue to become more important. We will continue to help British business and the UK economy through UK Trade and Investment, and we will continue to support Britain&#146;s migration objectives through the FCO&#146;s work, as well as in co-operation with the new UK Border and Immigration Agency.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08031360000403"></a>In 2003, the FCO reviewed its global network to ensure that resources were deployed in line with priorities and that they were providing the best possible value for money. This resulted in the closure of a number of posts in Africa, the Americas, Europe and the Pacific. It goes without saying&#151;and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, will remember this from his days as Foreign Secretary&#151;that a decision to close a post in any country is never taken lightly. Our global network is an important asset for the country and one which we intend to maintain and enhance. But priorities change and we have to deploy our resources in a manner which best reflects this. The FCO&#146;s respect and reputation around the world remain second to none, but we cannot be everywhere, engaged on every problem. Choices have to be made and we have to look for new ways of working.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08031360000404"></a>As we have heard, the overall number of FCO posts around the world has actually increased, from 242 to a total of 261 today. There have been 32 closures and two temporary closures&#151;that was the figure of 34 that the noble Baroness mentioned&#151;but there have been 18 openings, which were not mentioned, and 35 others that were not principal offices but trade offices and offices with other important diplomatic functions. Posts have been closed and opened, but I would argue that it is not so much the pure numbers that make the difference as to whether such decisions are good or bad; what really matters is whether they fit in with what should be the priorities for the United Kingdom. Do they take care of United Kingdom interests?</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08031360000405"></a>A range of matters were raised around this issue. As far as DfID and the point about heads of offices perhaps representing the whole of government are concerned, the only countries where that is a live issue are Swaziland and Nicaragua. The position of principle, for which I would think that there is a degree of support around the House, is that double-hatting DfID officers would require them to take on a whole range of diplomatic functions&#151;consular, visas, trade and representational. That would contradict the statutory requirement to give primacy to reducing international poverty, which is DfID&#146;s prime role.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08031360000406"></a>Another issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Roper, on which I answered a Question a few weeks ago, was entry into the EU civil service. It is not just a question of languages, it is a question of the relatively low entry grade into the EU civil service under its  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1651"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1651</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rules, which means that UK civil servants with a few years&#146; experience would sometimes have to take a retrograde step in seniority and pay. Our job is to try to make joining that civil service appear a more positive career move for young diplomats. The noble Lord will know about the internal review that is taking place.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08031360000407"></a>My noble friend Lord Parekh was concerned about ethnic minority numbers in the FCO. I will write to him with a full answer. I have figures that suggest that there are 507 &#147;minority&#148;&#151;perhaps that is an unfortunate description&#151;members of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, or 8.4 per cent. That was the number of UK-based staff from ethnic minorities in 2007; but I will give him more details.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08031360000408"></a>I always have a lot of sympathy with the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery. I have a special affection for Latin America, as I think he knows. We now maintain 21 sovereign posts in the Caribbean and Latin American area. The remaining countries are covered by these posts and our staff make regular visits to them. Of course this is not a complete substitute for maintaining embassies in all countries, but it enables us to discuss important issues and protect British interests. I take a little exception to his comments on UK Trade and Investment. The UK Trade and Investment organisation is very much part of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and my noble friend Lord Jones of Birmingham is a Minister both in the FCO and in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. It is not that difficult. The Chief Executive of the UKTI, Andrew Cahn, is a member of the FCO board. As my noble friend Lady Symons said, ambassadors and UKTI staff in embassies, high commissions and consulates are part of a joint effort to promote Britain&#146;s trading interests across the globe.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08031360000409"></a>The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, in his robust way, posed some very important questions. I am sympathetic to the link between defence and foreign policy. As far as the Royal College of Defence Studies is concerned, he is correct. The FCO no longer funds the nominated overseas candidates as it used to but it still provides a lot of support to the RCDS. I have a list of things that it does&#151;it has a seat on the contact group, it helps to identify overseas tours, it supports the tours, it fills secondee posts, it attends the training courses and it identifies high-calibre candidates overseas to attend the RCDS courses in London. I know this answer will not satisfy him, but the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is still very involved with the Royal College of Defence Studies.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08031360000410"></a>I am running out of time so let me move on to the EU external action service that the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, mentioned in his opening remarks. Of course the new structures for EU external action established in the Lisbon treaty included the creation of this service, representing one potential driver of future change. The new structures offer a real opportunity to deliver more coherent and effective EU action on our globalisation agenda without weakening the intergovernmental nature of CFSP or the successful Commission-led policies on trade and enlargement.

The new high representative for the common foreign and security policy will need support, so the proposal is&#151;and I hope it will be supported around the House&#151;that we bring together in one body the machinery and staff that already exist in the Council Secretariat and Commission while increasing the influence of member states through secondments. This is not about creating some new institution; it is about increasing the effectiveness of what is already there, including the Commission&#146;s overseas delegations, at the same time making it more responsive&#151;and this should be popular with all sides of the House&#151;to the requirements of the member states themselves.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08031360000411"></a>We have no plans for any future post closures in Europe or in the rest of our network beyond those that have already been announced. However, as the demand for FCO services&#151;political, commercial, consular or visa&#151;changes, the FCO must be able to deploy its resources in response to that, opening and closing posts and relocating resources where they are most needed. Unless the Foreign and Commonwealth Office does that, it is not doing its job properly.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08031360000412"></a>My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary attaches a great deal of weight to broadening the skills and experience of staff. I am pleased to say that the Foreign Office today is very different from the institution that the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, joined in 1960 or that my half brother joined even earlier than that and which has been caricatured endlessly. It benefits from the skills and perspectives of significant numbers of staff from other parts of the public and private sectors. At the most recent count, the FCO was acting as host to 211 staff on inward secondment or interchange. Many of the staff have also previously worked in business, in other parts of the Civil Service, or in the third sector, which contributes to a good mix of skills and experience that increasingly reflects the makeup of British society as a whole.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08031360000413"></a>These new faces range from board members, such as: the FCO&#146;s director general of finance, who moved from the Metropolitan Police; its chief information officer, who was previously with the BOC Group; ambassadors and high commissioners, notably the high commissioner in Dhaka, Anwar Choudhury from the Ministry of Defence; and the ambassador designate to Cuba, Dianna Melrose, formerly of DfID and Oxfam. The traffic is far from one way, with 100 FCO staff on outward secondments&#151;a 60 per cent increase in the past year alone. Importantly, the FCO is showing the way to the rest of Whitehall by opening all appointments to senior Civil Service positions in London and overseas to interchange. Every vacancy is now advertised across the public service through the Civil Service recruitment gateway. The noble Lord, Lord Dykes, made the important point about women and particularly couples being able to work in embassies abroad. That is a step change of huge importance. Anyone who remembers the Foreign Office from years ago knew that such a thing was a complete impossibility then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08031360000414"></a>I have overrun my time. I am sorry that I have not dealt with all the points that have been made. This has been a significant and important debate. The FCO has demonstrated the flexibility, leadership and determination required to deliver on its international priorities, both now and in the years to come. We have had to take difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions, but I am confident that these have been the right ones. I am of the firm belief that the changes resulting from these decisions will ensure that the job of Foreign Secretary will still be considered that of a great officer of state in the future, and that the reputation of our Diplomatic Service as one of the best in the world will be maintained and enhanced, along with that of the UK as a whole. Once more, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, for raising this subject.</p>

We have stressed how much the context of diplomacy has changed. The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, remarked on registry trolleys. The first embassy I ever went into was in a small town in Germany. I remember being disappointed that the registry trolley there did not still squeak, as John Le Carr&#233; said in this book that it did. We have changed, and we on these Benches accept that we must continue the process of change. We do not think that we should spend more, but we do think that we must prioritise. I was interested, after saying in a Radio 4 discussion programme in December that we should cut consular services in Europe because people getting drunk in Tallinn and Prague and losing their wallets did not necessarily deserve the full weight of the British Government behind them, to be told that there were cheers in relevant departments in the Foreign Office as they listened.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08031360000416"></a>We do need to redirect our priorities. We know that the Government no longer like to have the sort of inquiries that they had in the 1960s and 1970s. I suggest, however, that we need to continue this discussion, that the Government should try actively to carry with them those outside and those in the other parties, and that the Foreign Office cannot do this on its own. Other departments are now enormously engaged in international business. The figures on exchanges that the noble Lord has just quoted are welcome. This needs to be a Whitehall approach as a whole.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08031360000417"></a>On the point of the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, I have been impressed in embassies I have visited in the last three or four years that one of the economic staff always seemed to be an extremely bright young Asian economics graduate. The FCO is changing, although one should also say that our last permanent representative at the UN was someone for whom English was only his second language&#151;Welsh being his first. We are beginning to cope with all these necessary social changes.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08031360000418"></a>I have just one last doubt. I read about headcount reductions in the Gershon review. In all the capability reviews of departments I have looked at, I wonder whether, in pursing the goal of cutting back on staff, &#147;efficiency&#148; reductions do not sometimes risk cutting

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08031360000421"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I start by thanking all the noble Lords taking part in today&#146;s debate. I also congratulate Sir John Tooke and his colleagues on a well thought-out report that will become the template for postgraduate medical training in years to come.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08031360000422"></a>Today, we debate one of the most damaging episodes for British medicine. It has left thousands of young doctors with their aspirations and ambitions dashed. Many have been left without career or job and with an uncertain future as a result of the implementation of <I>Modernising Medical C</I><I>areers</I> and MTAS, the online Medical Training and Application Service. Young doctors have been badly let down and are demoralised and disillusioned, their careers and lives wrecked. In many instances, families have been split up for many years to come. Two out of three trainees are still without training posts. In some surgical specialities, one in 10 trained, experienced trainees are not successful in getting on the career ladder. Some are choosing to emigrate; some are leaving medicine&#151;often our best&#151;because they have lost confidence in the system in England and in medical training. Many will not get on the training ladder again in the current round of applications. I have a letter from several oncology trainees who, after five years in training, have been unsuccessful and are asking for help. The letter is supported by 23 of the consultants they work for. The cry from trainees is,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000549"></a>&#147;For God&#146;s sake, someone sort it out&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000508"></a>I guess that the cry is addressed to this Minister, for the rest have failed them.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08031360000423"></a>The Tooke inquiry identified major flaws in the system of postgraduate medical training and a series of errors and fundamental problems in important areas such as the role of doctors at various stages of their career and faults in the delivery of training, the plethora of organisations involved being more concerned with protecting their self-interest, influence and in territorial battles than in young doctors, their training and the effect ultimately on patient care. MMC, the inquiry found, was an aspiration to mediocrity and not excellence. British medicine and training, once considered the best, is now damaged by a service that seeks doctors who are just competent and not excellent. We now need to work hard for a decade or more to reverse the damage.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08031360000424"></a>The Tooke report rightly found that no one involved in the process should feel exonerated. In an editorial, Richard Smith wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="08031360000530"></a>&#147;British medicine lacks coherent, high level, strategic leadership ... Instead we have a plethora of self-interested, ineffective, squabbling bodies&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1655"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1655</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08031360000509"></a>That is exactly what the Tooke inquiry has also found. Any new structure responsible for postgraduate medical education and training must guard against that. As the report states,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="08031360000531"></a>&#147;Whatever else this Inquiry achieves, the distress caused [so far] to the next generation of specialists and senior doctors must never be repeated&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80313-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08031360000425"></a>The Tooke report has identified deficiencies in current training at virtually every stage. Concerns are expressed about training objectives for foundation years 1 and 2. Not only was the process of selection deficient; the number of doctors applying was grossly miscalculated. The selection process failed to get experienced doctors on training courses. In the opinion of many, specialist training has failed to deliver competent doctors who are able to function independently.</p>

<a name="80313-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08031360000426"></a>The report&#146;s findings suggest a need for root and branch reform, and Tooke suggests a way forward. The fact that the report found deficiencies and a need to find resolution to problems in eight key areas&#151;policy objectives; the doctor&#146;s role; policy development, implementation and governance; work force planning; medical professional engagement; management of postgraduate medical education and training; regulation; and the structure of postgraduate medical education and training&#151;says it all and reinforces the need for wider, durable reform.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80313-0013.htm"/>


<a name="80313-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08031360000427"></a>The Tooke report makes 47 recommendations. Time does not allow me to comment on them all, so I shall concentrate on a few. Recommendation 6 relates to policy development, implementation and governance for the key areas of medical education, training and work force issues. The recommendation that the Chief Medical Officer should be the senior responsible officer for medical education seems logical, but it is important that the SRO should have a clear understanding of the role of doctors&#151;the key area that was missing&#151;and the authority, responsibility and time commitment to do the task effectively. We must not underestimate the scale of the task and the responsibility, which is for the whole of England. Understanding of and interest in medical education is also essential. The Government&#146;s response requires greater clarity. It is not surprising that the profession would have greater confidence if the SRO had an understanding of medical education and the role of doctors.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08031360000428"></a>Recommendations 24, 25 and 26 refer to the functions of postgraduate deans; that is, their relationship with strategic health authorities, and the postgraduate deans and the strategic health authorities&#146; relationship with universities. The recommendation relating to a review of postgraduate deaneries is key to the future of medical education in England. The need for greater involvement of universities in postgraduate medical training is crucial and long overdue. Universities already have responsibility for and experience of undergraduate and foundation year 1 training. Universities also work well with regulators.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08031360000429"></a>The performance of postgraduate deaneries in managing postgraduate education and training is variable. Their close link with SHAs is not only an anomaly but a possible hindrance. As evidenced, SHAs have neither been closely involved in nor demonstrated a responsibility  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1656"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1656</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for medical education and training. There is some evidence that some SHAs raided education budgets to meet financial problems in service delivery to the detriment of the training of all professions.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08031360000430"></a>Postgraduate deans should be a part of the university structure and be responsible on behalf of the universities for the delivery of postgraduate medical training. Universities would then have responsibility for the training of doctors from undergraduate level to the completion of specialist training. That would in no way diminish the role of professional organisations; it would enhance it. The proposal sits well with the recommendation in the Tooke report related to core and specialist training.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08031360000431"></a>The GMC and the education committee would, as now, be responsible for curricular development, for the monitoring of undergraduate training and for foundation year 1. PMETB, as part of the GMC, would be responsible for the curricular development of core training, working with colleges and specialist societies, which would also, as now, have a strong role in developing the curriculum and assessment of specialist training. The colleges would be rather like specialist boards in the USA and, with PMETB, would monitor delivery of training by universities. That would help to strengthen academic departments and help with academic recruitment. Importantly, it would reduce the plethora of bodies vying for roles in postgraduate training. It would also strengthen the relationship between strategic health authorities and universities. The initial responses of some of the organisations and individuals that I have spoken to have been positive. I hope that the Minister finds it so too.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08031360000432"></a>Assessment could also be made more uniform and structured. Why do we not have a national exam at, let us say, some stage in foundation year 1? The model of the PLAB exam for the GMC may well be developed to satisfy this and will replace the exam at the end of medical school. At the end of core training, all trainees, prior to entering specialist training, should undergo assessment at national assessment centres, as suggested by Tooke, and these will be monitored by the colleges.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08031360000433"></a>The last and new recommendation is about establishing a new body, NHS MEE, with a co-ordinating role and wide-ranging responsibilities. As proposed, it will only be for medical education and not for other health professionals. That might be a drawback. The Government, in their response, have reservations. For such a body to be effective, it has to be relatively small. It did not surprise me that, when I had this discussion, everyone who had supported the recommendation also expected to be on it, which would mean a body of between 25 and 30 people. In the past, we have had such large bodies that became ineffective. Some noble Lords may well remember that. The proposal in the Tooke report of an effective body with a co-ordinating role should not be lost, but we should have further discussions about it.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08031360000434"></a>It is clear that we should start sorting out the mess that MMC and MTAS have created, to regain the confidence of young doctors so that patient care does not suffer for years to come. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

It is always a pleasure to listen to him although, as usual, he has pre-empted much of what I was going to say. I too welcome the Tooke report, which is a very brave attempt to start again and put behind us much of the chaos which surrounded last year&#146;s arrangements for doctor training. I do not want to go back to see where the blame for the problems lay; let us say that no one comes up smelling of roses. As someone who has spent much of his life in medical education, as a dean of a medical school and as president of a medical Royal College, I spent many happy hours on education and manpower planning committees. I know how difficult it is to get it right.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08031360000436"></a>The Government&#146;s response to the report is very positive and helpful. Inevitably, there are a number of problems on which I would like to focus. First, there are the immediate and urgent difficulties facing young doctors this year. I will not go on about this, because the noble Lord, Lord Patel, dealt with much of it. The fact is that many young trainees feel very insecure and uncertain about their job prospects now. The Government are leaning over backwards to offer solutions, with increased numbers of posts. Do the Government have any idea of the numbers that will be needed and where? Will they ensure that the application process, which caused so much resentment last year, will be revised? There is much that needs to be not only done, but widely publicised if we are to regain the confidence of trainees.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08031360000437"></a>There is much in the Tooke report about the need to define the role of doctors in a modern health service, and much emphasis on the need to strive for excellence. It is suggested that we should wait until we have defined the roles of all other healthcare workers before we suggest what doctors should contribute. Noble Lords may not be surprised if I say that I do not see it that way at all. I see the doctor&#146;s role as central, because I believe that patients and the public expect nothing less. I am not trying to deny the role of nurses and other healthcare workers, pace the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton. Far from it&#151;they make enormous contributions. I am saying that we should already know what we want from doctors. Ask any patient.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08031360000438"></a>Medical students know, or are soon made aware of, what is required of them to be a good doctor. It is a combination of attributes, which include a full knowledge of the scientific and biological basis of health and disease; an ability to communicate, empathise and deal sympathetically with patients and relatives; and practising in the safest and most effective way. They are taught how to deal with uncertainty in an open and flexible way, and of the need to keep up with the latest developments as they occur. For all that, they need five or six years of undergraduate education and a further five years for general practice, or seven to eight for specialist practice, so it is not surprising that we need to continue to attract students who are bright and can stay the course, so that at the end of all this they can meet everything that patients ask of them.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1658"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1658</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80313-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08031360000439"></a>I hope that the Government, in talking about defining the role of doctors, do not spend a lot of time thinking about the many important contributions that other health workers make before they do so. I believe that we now know what doctors should be doing and we should be putting all our efforts into ensuring that our training programmes are designed in the best way possible to achieve those aims.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08031360000440"></a>One other matter which causes me a little concern is the Government&#146;s response to the proposal that a &#147;senior responsible officer&#148; should be appointed to oversee medical training. In England, unlike in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland where this responsibility will reside with the chief medical officer, it rests with the workforce planning division of the Department of Health in the form of the director-general of manpower planning. That does not give me a great deal of confidence that educational objectives will be paramount here, and the needs of the workforce might take precedence. Can my noble friend comment on this?</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08031360000441"></a>I turn now to the proposal that the Postgraduate Medical Education Training Board should merge with the General Medical Council. This sounds a reasonable idea as it would bring together undergraduate and postgraduate education and training under one body. But it may not be widely recognised that the educational role of the GMC is fulfilled by a separate education committee which has its own statutory responsibilities distinct from the GMC itself. A good case can be made for merging PMETB, which has had a rather unhappy few years of existence, with the education committee, which has a very good record of overseeing medical schools. It checks their curricula, makes sure they are fit for educating future doctors, conducts inspection visits and generally keeps a close eye on the medical schools. But the Government&#146;s intention seems to be to take away the statutory responsibility of the education committee and merge it into the GMC, which itself is not immune from criticism. It seems quite perverse to get rid of the one body that is working well and merge it with two bodies that have not yet commanded everyone&#146;s confidence. Furthermore, education is sufficiently different from regulation and judgments about failing doctors, the proper province of the GMC, to warrant their separation. I hope that in the ongoing consultation exercise the Government will think very carefully before going down that route.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08031360000442"></a>Finally, I want to say a few words about the relationships between the NHS and the academic community. Much is made in the report and the Government&#146;s response of the need to have good and robust interactions between universities and trusts, and between the Department of Health and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. After all, clinical academic departments are not only responsible for undergraduate and much of postgraduate education, they also deliver much of the NHS service in their disciplines. For example, my own department provided most of the gastrointestinal services for my hospital, with my academic colleagues in surgery. And of course academics provide a high proportion of the expertise at national level for the NHS, to say nothing of their research contributions.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1659"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1659</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80313-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08031360000443"></a>Yet the history of relationships between the Department of Health and DIUS or its predecessors is littered with desultory efforts at collaboration. Bodies rejoicing under such acronyms as SGUMDER and STLA seemed to achieve little or nothing and faded into oblivion. Joint planning and funding arrangements between NHS trusts and medical schools has worked in far too few places. I wanted to bring this up because while the Government recognise the importance of academic medicine and have put considerable funds into medical research, their response to the Tooke report fails to set out clearly how trusts and universities might work more closely together in, for example, the training of clinical academics as well as in designing patterns of service. I know that this topic is close to the heart of my noble friend on the Front Bench, and I hope he can say whether a few more teeth can be put into the Government&#146;s rather vague response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08031360000444"></a>I may have sounded somewhat critical, but I would hate to give the impression that I do not applaud the vast majority of the report and the response. I reiterate what I said at the beginning: this is a brave effort and should be welcomed.</p>

<a name="08031360000445"></a><b><a name="80313-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08031360000700"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Patel for securing this debate on Sir John Tooke&#146;s forensic and timely report, which analyses all the points of failure in Modernising Medical Careers and makes many sensible and important recommendations for how to bring the profession out of its current crisis. The report is unique in its analysis of the evidence of what did and did not happen last year, and for its far-reaching conclusions. It is also unique in that it has taken the whole profession with it. Never before have the juniors, the consultants, the deans of medical schools, the Royal Colleges and the BMA all stood firm in support of such recommendations on their own future.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08031360000446"></a>Why has Sir John&#146;s report commanded so much respect? I suggest that it is for several reasons. In so doing, I declare all my interests as a doctor, an attendee at the Medical Schools Council, a postgraduate trainer, president of the Royal Society of Medicine and parent of doctors in training. The Tooke report does what it espouses: it makes recommendations based on evidence and is not ashamed to recognise that doctors have a unique training that is complex and demanding and which ensures they are fit for purpose in managing the most complex of conditions that threaten life daily.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08031360000447"></a>Before turning to individual recommendations from the report, I want to stress why it must be acted on. There are two issues at stake here, both of which are important. The first is the future of the country&#146;s health service and the safety of patients. Patients expect to be treated by a doctor of the highest competence and they expect the doctor to carry the overall responsibility for their care, particularly when very ill, and they are right to expect that. The second issue we face is the large number of highly skilled individuals who will not be able to progress in their careers. These are doctors who have done everything that they have been asked to do; they have made it through their

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08031360000448"></a>I turn to the recommendations on the role of doctors and workforce planning, on the training programme and on NHS Medical Education England, or NHS:MEE, as it is known. First, the role of the doctor must be clearly understood in the modern healthcare team. The current Department of Health policy seems to envisage a blurring of boundaries between the professions but without defining safe boundaries and without defining the separate, complementary roles as good governance requires.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08031360000449"></a>Doctors are trained in scientific deduction. They have learnt skills from their seniors. Knowledge from structured teaching and appropriate positive compassionate attitudes to modern multiprofessional team working are required of every UK graduate. Medical training teaches deduction with good communication skills to be able to elicit a diagnosis based on solid scientific foundations, and to sort out the multiple problems that so many patients present with. The undifferentiated patient presents increasingly with multiple pathology. Each individual patient is unique; their needs are beyond any diagnostic protocol or algorithm. Good diagnosis is the foundation to ensuring that the appropriate tests are done to confirm what is suspected and to set the patient on the correct care plan journey. In that process, the other team members come into play to manage the patient on that journey to recovery or improvement within the boundaries of ongoing disease.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08031360000450"></a>The evidence from the latest national confidential inquiry into peri-operative deaths found that being seen initially by a consultant in trauma care improves survival and outcomes for trauma patients. When there is a major accident, it is the consultant who leads the triage because the complexity of the decisions needs that level of diagnostic skill to determine the optimal use of scarce resources. Evidence on the outcomes of head injury shows that being seen initially by a consultant improves outcomes&#151;but at night that often does not happen.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08031360000451"></a>Problems out of hours are not unique to the UK or to trauma care. Increased mortality out of hours has also been identified in patients with heart attacks and cardiac arrests, and those being discharged from intensive care, to name but some. It is vital, therefore, that there are sufficient consultants to ensure that all patients can achieve the best outcome. The answer is to get fully trained specialist doctors to the front line at all times. As the Tooke report recommends, the medical profession must be engaged in NHS management of trusts because that is how changes will be brought about at local level</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08031360000452"></a>In the <I>Health Service Journal</I> last week, Sir John Tooke stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="08031360000532"></a>&#147;in the Inquiry&#146;s view, medical education and training need to be closely integrated with workforce considerations, but absolutely critically, they need to be medically led&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80313-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08031360000453"></a>The Government seem to have accepted recommendation 6, which means that the CMO in each country is indeed the senior responsible officer  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1661"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1661</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for medical education. However, while I, in Wales, look to the CMO as the leader for medical education, my colleagues in England will have instead to turn to the director-general of workforce. That seems contradictory and illogical. Indeed, many colleagues have expressed extreme disquiet that a person with no direct experience of medical education could even contemplate taking the lead in this area, which is fundamental to the future of the health service. I would welcome an explanation from the Minister.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08031360000454"></a>In Wales, as in Scotland and Northern Ireland, the CMO works closely with the postgraduate dean and the universities, providing significant benefits. The proposed graduate schools will cement the interface between the service, the profession, academia and workforce planning.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08031360000455"></a>What about the structural changes proposed by the inquiry? Will those be taken up? There is much concern that deferring issues to the Minister&#146;s NHS Next Stage Review&#151;the Darzi review, as it is know&#151;will impede rather than facilitate change.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08031360000456"></a>All 30 medical schools in the UK supported uncoupling F1 and F2, with the proposal to incorporate F2 into core specialty training. Yet, those are on the &#147;wait and see&#148; list. Whether F1 and F2 are pre-registration or uncoupled probably matters little in the long run, but there must be guaranteed foundation posts for those who have qualified for them to stand a chance of being registered; if they are not potentially registerable they would have failed their final exams. Post-registration, the core broad-base training welcomed in the e-consultation, ensures that doctors enter different specialties with a solid foundation of consolidated skills assessed under supervision before they focus on specific training, whether for general practice or for a hospital specialty. No training in medicine is ever wasted.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08031360000457"></a>The failure to commit expeditiously to the five-year training programme for general practice is another missed opportunity. It has been strongly supported as vital to address the increasing co-morbidities experienced in ageing populations and the pressures of chronic disease management in the community. It could ensure that every doctor has training in end-of-life care to ensure that every patient has good symptom control and compassionate psycho-social care to enhance the quality of the days or hours until death comes.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08031360000458"></a>We are told that the recommendation that NHS Medical Education England be created will be considered in the NHS Next Stage Review. NHS:MEE is fundamental for success. That includes ring-fencing training budgets to help to ensure that training is not compromised. If training is compromised, the end product is also compromised&#151;in this case patient care. Training budgets must be used for precisely that: training. It is not a pot to raid to cover inefficient management and financial deficits from high staff sickness rates and so on. Oversight and scrutiny by NHS:MEE will prevent future raids.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08031360000459"></a>I hope that the Minister will not lose his nerve under pressure and will have the courage to do the right thing; listen to the whole profession and adopt the Tooke report recommendations in full as they stand.</p>

I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Patel, on his perseverance in getting this debate and on his clear and compelling introduction.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08031360000461"></a>Sir John Tooke and his panel have been likened to a team who arrive at the scene of a terrible air crash. There are bodies, blood and wreckage everywhere and the air is filled with rumour, speculation and blame. How did this awful thing happen and who is at fault? So wrote Richard Smith, former editor of the BMJ in November last year. It is tempting to launch a blistering attack on the Government and to lay the blame, especially from these opposition Benches; but, like the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, I resist. We have a different ministerial team and I take heart from the fact that in this House prior to becoming a Minister&#151;and a politician&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, in his professorial role has been living through the consequences of MTAS.</p>

<a name="80313-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08031360000462"></a>Through my company, Cumberlege Connections&#151;I declare that interest and that with the medical school at Sussex University&#151;I am in close contact with at least 80 specialist registrars once a month. I am so impressed by them&#151;their commitment, their intelligence and their dedication to the careers that they have chosen. In the first round of MTAS, they had to choose between geography and specialty. If they wanted to stay close to their partner and family, they had to sacrifice their chosen specialty. If they wanted to train in their chosen specialty they had to accept a post as potentially as far away as Scotland from Cornwall. In addition, when they applied for a job they were not allowed to submit a CV. Professors, when interviewing those who had been shortlisted, had no means of knowing who were the brilliant and who were the also-rans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08031360000463"></a>In the London Deanery alone, 18,500 candidates were interviewed over four months. It was a Herculean task. In Birmingham, the professors gave up and walked out. In round two, applicants encountered new, unforeseen rules. Having declined a job offer in round one, they were not allowed to apply in round two. An undertaking was given that those doctors who had completed their first year of specialist training&#151;ST1s and ST2s&#151;would qualify automatically for a &#147;run through&#148; training position. This meant that they were guaranteed training posts until they applied for a consultant position, known as the golden ticket. Those who had been forced into locum posts or who missed the earlier round and decided to improve their chances by changing their specialty were refused interviews. Is it any wonder that so many of these young doctors left the country to go to Australia and New Zealand?</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08031360000464"></a>The next round is just beginning. Jobs unfilled in February are being advertised nationally. Anyone can apply but what these young doctors want to know is whether preference is being given to the ST2s again. An application form is online but has not yet been released. When will it be available? How will the next round of applications be structured? What rules will apply? Will it all be changed again next year?</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1663"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1663</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80313-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08031360000465"></a>At the present time there is a two-tier system of injustice. The ST1s and ST2s are virtually guaranteed a job in their chosen field whereas those who, through no fault of their own, have missed out in earlier rounds are now unemployed. Others have taken temporary posts or have found themselves working in the wrong speciality for fear of being unemployed last year. There is another large group of doctors who are working miles away from their families because they chose specialty over geography. There are a total of around 23,000 junior doctors chasing 8,900 training posts. What does the future hold for the unsuccessful but highly and expensively trained young men and women? Perhaps the Minister could tell us. In the words of Dr Bryony Eccles, who wrote to me this week:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="08031360000533"></a>&#147;We are highly trained professionals. To manipulate our and our families' lives by endless changes and rules to our training does nothing but demoralise a vital workforce and drive the best out of the NHS. Ultimately this must impact on patient care&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031360000510"></a>How right she is. What a shambles.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08031360000466"></a>I now want to address the Tooke report's 47th recommendation and the Government's response to the setting up of Medical Education England. I have long believed in devolving decisions to the lowest sensible level. My report on community nursing was not called <I>Neighbourhood Nursing</I> for nothing. When I chaired social services, my county pioneered patch-based social work. I strongly believe that if services are to make sense to local people, local decision-making is an imperative. Many of the Government&#146;s mistakes have been made because they do not trust local people, and it has taken them 10 years to see the light. Devolving workforce education and training to SHAs has been a glimmer of their recent conversion.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08031360000467"></a>Some strategic health authorities are taking their responsibilities really seriously. In London, they are thinking ahead: what skills will doctors working in a polyclinic need? They are, I understand, colloquially called &#147;Darzi docs&#148;, and while that is a relevant initiative for London it is perhaps not so relevant to the Lake District, where polyclinics and Darzi docs may not be much in evidence. Others may say, &#147;But medicine is a national resource and doctors may work in any part of the country. Who knows whether a Darzi doc will be needed one day in Cumbria or Westmoreland?&#148;. They will also say, &#147;Of course, SHAs will want to keep their major budget, which they have found so useful to bail out trusts in financial deficit in the past&#148;, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, has just said. A central body will have ring-fenced money&#151;but I have a word of caution for your Lordships. It is a little nave to think that money held centrally would not be top-sliced. In central hands, it can be not so much top-sliced as available.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08031360000468"></a>For SHAs that are now in charge of planning the total workforce, it makes sense to see how the service can be provided using all the skills within the different professions. That, of course, raises another fear among doctors; of dumbing down. Are we to see nurses as mini-doctors, and what is the role of the doctor anyhow? Sir John is right: that needs to be clearly defined.  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1664"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1664</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Incidentally, I hope to help by chairing a Royal College of Physicians&#146; working party to look at the future of society and the doctor&#146;s role within it.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08031360000469"></a>In my mind, there is no question either that a central body for medical education is necessary to oversee, scrutinize and review, or that the SHAs and their deaneries have a part to play. The clever trick will be to ensure coherence between local demand, the characteristics of the local area and the national body. I have been impressed by the model of NHS Education South Central, or NESC, which was established as an integrated organisation. It manages and delivers both postgraduate medical education and non-medical education and training, and it holds budgets amounting to &#163;264 million. Its mission is to provide high-quality and relevant education and training, where and when it is needed. It must meet the changing needs of the NHS and the workforce, which in turn must lead to measurable improvements in patient care. It has the advantage of being an arm&#146;s length organisation, while at the same time being sensitive to local priorities.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08031360000470"></a>The Minister, in his report, <I>Our NHS, our future</I>, set out his emerging vision to develop a world-class NHS, focused on improving the quality of care based on patients having control and choice, and on there being local accountability. A regional body such as NESC is strategically placed to enable such a vision to happen. It is similar in size to NHS Education for Scotland; the arrangement works well in Scotland, and the development of NESC shows how such an organisation can be effective in England. I hope that the Minister will study that structure and use it as a pilot. It appears to me to provide the missing link between local and national. It is well led, it works and it has already made a difference. It is impressive&#151;and necessary.</p>

It is good to know that more than half of the recommendations in the Tooke report have already been accepted by the Government. I look forward to hearing from the Minister about how those recommendations are to be implemented and, above all, the speed with which they will be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08031360000472"></a>Many speakers mentioned the appalling situation that arose in 2007 when a mechanism which was designed with the best of intentions turned out to be totally unfit for purpose and resulted in grave injustices. I refer to the well publicised case of a highly qualified young lady doctor looking for training who applied for 79 posts and was unsuccessful in obtaining any. There were many other examples of the best qualified young doctors failing to obtain an interview. Are there mechanisms in place to improve the process this year because, as a result of last year&#146;s disaster, some of the doctors most needed by the National Health Service to maintain a high standard of practice in the future emigrated due to their failure to obtain an appropriate post?</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1665"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1665</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80313-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08031360000473"></a>I have four questions for the Minister with regard to the situation this year. First, does he have clear figures on the number of specialist registrar posts that will be available for those emerging from foundation years one and two? I say in passing that the one recommendation of the Tooke report of which I am not totally in favour is for these two years to be disaggregated. It is sensible to treat years one and two as a cohesive whole, and that has worked well on the whole.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="08031360000474"></a>Has the Minister any evidence about the number of individuals who will emerge from those foundation years and apply for specialist registrar appointments in all branches of medicine? Can he indicate the number of specialist training posts that will be available for such specialist registrars? Recent press reports suggest that the Government have funded an additional 300 posts. That may be a useful contribution but, according to the evidence of the profession, it will certainly come nowhere near meeting the need.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="08031360000475"></a>Secondly, there is a proud history in this country of collaboration between the universities on the one hand and the National Health Service on the other. For many years the training offered in the National Health Service has been funded by SIFT&#151;the Service Increment for Teaching. Funds have been specifically allocated under that heading to support education and training in NHS hospitals and, to a degree, in the community. Can the Minister confirm that, contrary to recent reports, the education and training funds that were raided when SIFT was no longer ring-fenced by certain cash-strapped health authorities to provide services as opposed to training will again be ring-fenced, because that is essential if education is to continue to be provided?</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="08031360000476"></a>My third question concerns the future of academic medicine. For many years there was a proud tradition that individuals holding clinical lectureships, clinical training posts and even clinical research posts were given honorary registrar or senior registrar status in the NHS. In order to maintain and enhance the future of clinical academic medicine, will the Minister assure us that individuals holding these appointments, including those who take time out to undertake research leading to a PhD or who undertake a period of training overseas, whether in an academic appointment or in a third-world country, will not be disadvantaged by that experience when they return and will continue as specialist registrars or honorary specialist registrars before applying for a senior post either in the universities or as consultants in the NHS?</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08031360000477"></a>Fourthly, as regards overseas doctors, it is absolutely right that we should give priority to UK-trained doctors when they apply for specialist training posts. Of course, one has to recognise that doctors from the European Union have the absolute right to compete for all those posts on an equal footing with UK-trained doctors. But in my former department of neurology in Newcastle upon Tyne, I regularly accepted for training young doctors from India, Australia, Canada, the USA and other parts of the old Commonwealth. They got a useful training experience and many subsequently became leaders of the profession on returning to the countries from which they came. Some were self-funding on travelling fellowships. Others, particularly from the

Is there a mechanism for that kind of sponsorship arrangement, whereby highly trained immigrants to this country, sponsored by host departments in the country from which they came, may still have the opportunity to train in the NHS? I believe that is crucial to the future.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="08031360000478"></a>I turn finally to the governance of medical education. As chairman of the education committee of the GMC, and subsequently as president of the GMC, I was much involved in that process. As the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, has made clear, the Medical Act 1983, following the report of the Merrison committee, imposed upon the education committee of the GMC&#151;not upon the General Medical Council itself&#151;the authority to oversee standards of medical education, to promote high standards of medical education and to co-ordinate all stages of medical education. There was some conflict with the royal colleges and specialist training societies, who took the view that they were responsible for postgraduate education and training, but in the end that was satisfactorily resolved. The education committee of the GMC contained within its membership, elected from the very large council at that time, many people who had academic posts in the universities and many people who were consultants in the NHS with wide experience in training young doctors in all specialties.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="08031360000479"></a>Admittedly, the mechanism so established of the joint committee on general professional training and the joint committee on higher medical training became, for a time, complex and somewhat cumbersome. The Government replaced it with the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board which, despite the best efforts of its members, has turned out to be ineffective. Many complaints have arisen about the way in which it has operated and about delays in accepting specialist registration. May I take it that, if Medical Education England is to be created, as the Tooke report suggests&#151;and that is a mechanism that I think is greatly to be commended&#151;the resulting mechanism will be with the education committee of the General Medical Council and not with the council itself? To my knowledge, that particular provision of the Medical Act 1983 has never been revoked.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="08031360000480"></a>For that reason, it is crucial that this education body should contain within its membership not only substantial numbers of medical educators, but also lay people who have an experience of education in the broad and also non-doctors who are interested in the education of other healthcare professionals. It must not be a small body limited by GMC membership, but must have a much wider remit. I would welcome that greatly because, provided that the committee has the appropriate range of expertise within its membership, we could be sure that the future control and governance of medical education would be satisfactory. I hope that the Government will support that recommendation.</p>

I congratulate Professor Tooke, not only on the recommendations, but on the speed with which he completed the work, against the background of so much unhappiness in the medical professions, so ably described by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, in his opening remarks, and by many others who followed.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="08031367000003"></a>Such a debate is also timely given the current review of the NHS under the direction of the noble Lord, Lord Darzi. The title of the report, <I>Aspiring to Excellence</I>, indicates a desire to deliver a service of excellence with high quality care. The noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, will not be surprised that I do not agree with him on the definition of the doctor being first and others later. The report&#146;s recommendation 5 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="08031367000057"></a>&#147;There needs to be a common shared understanding of the roles of all doctors ... Given the interdependency of professional constituents of the contemporary multiprofessional healthcare team we suggest a similar analysis extends to other healthcare professional groupings&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031367000053"></a>One hopes that that will be taken into account in the final report of the current review of the National Health Service, for if there is clarity of each healthcare professional&#146;s role with the parameters of that role identified, together with the authority and accountability, the multi-professional teams can truly work towards the aspiration of excellence in order that the highest quality of care to patients can be delivered.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="08031367000004"></a>The Chief Nursing Officer has produced a report on modernising careers for nursing, and the proposals for flexible career frameworks have been welcomed, but they will, like medicine, require post-registration education and training to support the frameworks. However, the all-important question will be the same as that of Professor Tooke; will there be sufficient funding and how will the funding be protected? This is an opportunity to tackle this vexing question in the context of the NHS review. Currently, there is no evidence of equality. There are 120,000 registered nurses undertaking part-time post-registration training, the budget for which is &#163;120 million, which equates to &#163;1,000 per student. The medical postgraduate budget is &#163;1.6 billion for 40,000 students, which equates to &#163;40,000 per student. Obviously, one would expect there to be a difference; but is a ratio of 1:40 fair?</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="08031367000005"></a>The organisation and mechanisms for allotting postgraduate and post-registration funding and study leave will, I hope, be addressed in the context of the review. Professor Tooke also raised the problems of clinical placements for doctors, and the same problems arise for the nursing profession and other allied care professions. There is no doubt that the correlation of theory to practice is vital for all the professions, and there needs to be an agreed system of allocation of clinical placements fairly between them, with adequate supervision from clinical tutors.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="08031367000006"></a>I declare an interest, in that for some years I led an experimental course funded by the Wolfson Foundation, where the training for state registration was two years, with a tutor teaching the curriculum correlating theory to practice throughout, with the third year being spent as an intern staff nurse. Many went on to take senior positions in the profession. The research demonstrated  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1668"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1668</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that it was an excellent way of teaching, but the cost for the numbers involved was too much. When I was chairman of the nurses regulating body, the UKCC, Project 2000 was developed, and it was always envisaged that a preceptor year would be introduced; that is an intern year. Again, because of cost, this was dropped. It is being discussed again, and I hope that the Minister will consider the inclusion of a preceptor year for all nurses, midwives, health visitors and professions allied to medicine.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="08031367000007"></a>Research evidence points to the delivery of high quality nursing care being dependent on the right number of qualified competent nurses being available at the right time. However, as mentioned in the debate introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Eccles, currently not all graduate nurses are emerging from their programme of education with even the basic competence required to deliver safe and high quality care. In that debate, I quoted that, in a recent visit, I found that 250 applicants had applied for a staff nurse post, who were all recently trained at postgraduate level, and only two out of 250 gained 100 per cent in a simple numeracy test, demonstrating that only two were safe to do a drug round. All healthcare professional education at pregraduate and postgraduate levels requires clear lines of accountability and authority for commissioning with the universities, to include the costs of supervision for clinical placements.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="08031367000008"></a>The delivery of safe and high quality care to patients by doctors, nurses, midwives and other allied healthcare professionals is dependent on a correlation of theory and practice. As the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, spelt out, there is a need for much stonger links between the service requirements and the education providers, at clearly defined levels, with clear, protected, funding arrangements, and built-in monitoring programmes through accountability reviews.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="08031367000009"></a>My closing comments relate to Recommendation 47. If the intent of multiprofessional teams is to succeed&#151;the need recognised by Professor Tooke&#151;there will be a requirement for the Department of Health to take a holistic multiprofessional approach to modernising careers rather than considering individual professions in isolation. Problems and issues in nursing and allied healthcare professional careers are every bit as serious as medicine. I therefore feel that this recommendation needs careful consideration, especially relating to the first function the committee suggests&#151;to ring-fence budgets. Surely, all education budgets should be ring-fenced.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="08031367000010"></a>The recommendations of Sir John's report, together with the Minister&#146;s review, pave the way to meet the aspiration of excellence for the public, for patients and all healthcare professions.</p>

Anyway, we have it now. I am delighted to be speaking from these Benches in this debate, as I have taken a keen interest in these issues since the disasters of last year. I declare an interest as a former lay member of the GMC, including briefly of its education committee.

I also declare an interest as not being the parent of any doctors in training. I tried my best to persuade them to become doctors, but they have become a social worker and a teacher. I do not know what one does about that. I am also extremely grateful to the Council of Medical Schools, the Council of Deans of Health, the GMC, the BMA, Universities UK and NHS Employers for their briefings, as I am to the many people who wrote to me individually about these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="08031367000012"></a>On 28 February, the Department of Health in England published its official response to Sir John Tooke&#146;s inquiry. It agreed to implement many of the recommendations, but has, worryingly, delayed making a decision on several others. The MTAS debacle last year was, in my view, the lightning rod that brought to earth the simmering concerns of the medical profession about what it saw as attempts to deprofessionalise it. Sir John Tooke&#146;s report, as we have heard many times this afternoon, struck a dramatic chord with the profession. Indeed, I understand that one doctor was moved to write to the panel members, congratulating them and telling them that one night, as he read it from cover to cover, he was moved to shout out all the time, &#147;Yes, yes!&#148; like that scene in &#147;When Harry Met Sally&#148;.</p>

<a name="80313-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="08031367000013"></a>So when 10,000 doctors took to the streets a year ago next week, we might have expected the Government to reverse their policy of &#147;constructive discomfort&#148; for the medical profession so well described in Simon Stevens's 2002 article on <I>R</I><I>eform </I><I>S</I><I>trategies for the English NHS</I> and done all that they could to re-engage the profession. After all, the medical establishment was in favour, as was the GMC, now overwhelmingly a lay members&#146; organisation. The GMC congratulated Sir John Tooke and his colleagues on the quality and insight of their report and welcomed the proposals on streamlining the regulation of medical education and training set out in Recommendation 30 of the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="08031367000014"></a>The Tooke report argued for better co-ordination by bringing all stages&#151;undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing practice&#151;under one roof. That was also identified in the 2007 White Paper <I>Trust, </I><I>A</I><I>ssurance and </I><I>S</I><I>afety</I>, where the Government recognised the gains to be secured from single oversight of education and training. The Tooke report recommended that the PMETB should be assimilated in a regulatory structure within the GMC that would oversee the continuum of undergraduate and postgraduate medical education and training, continuing professional development, quality assurance and enhancement and that this assimilation should occur as quickly as possible. More than 80 per cent of respondents to the consultation on the Tooke report were in favour of the assimilation of the PMETB into the GMC. The recommendation is supported also by the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson. In his recent evidence to the House of Commons Health Select Committee he indicated that he had changed his mind from his previous position, which was for the GMC&#146;s role in education to be taken over by PMETB. It is to be hoped that the Government might find time to bring forward the necessary legislation  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1670"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1670</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to merge the two organisations before 2010, which is what the Secretary of State for Health, Alan Johnson, has said thus far, lest the excellent staff in PMETB be lost. Could that not be an amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill, which is about to reach this House the week after next, so that the statutory changes could be made that would allow handover when the terms of office of PMETB members come to an end? Would that not be a tangible demonstration that the Government do indeed intend to take action urgently?</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="08031367000015"></a>The GMC believes that the assimilation of PMETB into the GMC should take place as soon as is practicable. It is beginning work with UK health departments, PMETB and other parties to achieve this smoothly and efficiently. I would very much like to hear the Minister comment on the pace of this particular change, particularly given the concern about employers&#146; involvement expressed by the NHS Employers.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="08031367000016"></a>Regulation is a key issue in postgraduate medical education and training. Regulation is a dynamic process; it should not stand still. It has to be scrutinised, challenged and improved to ensure that it takes account of our changing society and the changing healthcare environment. To be effective, regulation has to command the confidence and support of all those with an interest in ensuring the safety and quality of healthcare&#151;patients and the public, doctors, the NHS and other healthcare providers, and the medical schools and medical royal colleges.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="08031367000017"></a>The Government had the ideal opportunity to do that in their response to the inquiry's recommendations, but, worryingly, instead of following the advice of the medical profession and accepting all the recommendations that were made&#151;which were widely welcomed outside the medical profession, as well&#151;it seems that much that was welcomed by the profession and others has been sidelined by the department. This raises profound concerns that the key structural changes that were recommended may have been placed into the &#147;too difficult&#148; box in perpetuity.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="08031367000018"></a>There are no timelines on the proposed reforms to Foundation to integrate the first year more closely with the undergraduate programme. Nor is there any mention of the creation of core programmes which would provide the necessary broad-based beginnings, as well as providing the NHS with the flexibility for retraining it will require as technological advances, which emerge at amazing rapidity, change medical practice. Until the initial stages of reform to the structure are sorted out and implemented, it will not be possible to build on them to create the later stages of higher specialist training. Instead, some recommendations, the easiest, seem to have been accepted unconditionally, while the others appear to have been swept into the long grass. I hope that the Minister will be able to give this House some reassurance on this.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="08031367000019"></a>The Government&#146;s response was that,</p>
<ul><a name="08031367000059"></a>&#147;very careful consideration was required to ensure that decisions are informed by evidence and evaluation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031367000054"></a>Yet it might be worth asking how often consultations achieve a total of as many as 1,440 responses, of which only 4 per cent express any measure of disagreement with the recommendations. Universities UK emphasised

I know that the Minister was not involved at the time, but I would like to ask him now what further evidence it is reasonable to demand. Sir John Tooke has pointed out that decisiveness is often necessary in medicine. We have seen the Minister being extremely decisive and swift on the Floor of this House just a couple of months ago. It would be lovely to hear something about some speed in the implementation of the recommendations of the Tooke review.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="08031367000020"></a>I do not have much time left and I very much want to hear what the Minister can tell us. But it seems me that the Tooke report&#146;s proposal for the creation, in the first instance, of NHS Medical Education England, to oversee training, accepting that this would be extended to other professions in the near future, would effectively take oversight away from the workforce planning area of the Department of Health and put it back into the hands of the medical profession. We know that such a move would regain the faith of doctors and that doctors are very pleased with the recommendation to ring-fence the budget for medical education and training.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="08031367000021"></a>Of course doctors can be precious as a professional group&#151;as can all professions, rabbis included. But the situation with MTAS has been serious and we heard the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, make that very clear in one of her examples. Reassurance is what is needed now. All medical bodies believe that both of those changes are essential if we are to ensure high quality medical training in the future. For several years now trusts have been raiding funding set aside for professional education and training to meet the deficits, and others have made that point.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="08031367000022"></a>It is important that funding for training is ring-fenced at Trust level to ensure that doctors are trained to their full potential. The Government have indicated that a decision on this will be taken alongside the Minister&#146;s Next Stage Review, due to report in June this year. But like the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, I believe that there is no good reason why that decision could not be taken now. It is not something that fits particularly with the review the noble Lord is conducting, and indeed, it would be good to get one major issue off the agenda for that review at this time. This new body needs independence from the Department of Health's direct influence, although with accountability to the Chief Medical Officer, as is the case in the other three home countries. We support this suggestion as a means of ensuring equity of provision for patients across the UK, giving, as it does, a coherent, co-ordinated approach to medical education. Recent history has demonstrated that such oversight and scrutiny is vital. I hope the Minister will be able to confirm that he has listened to his professional colleagues and others and that it is his intention to set up in the very near future a national body charged with the oversight and scrutiny of medical education, to be extended to the other healthcare professions as soon as possible.</p>

However, if there has been one message above all others, it is surely the exhortation to Ministers to adopt an equal measure of speed in putting the recommendations into practice and in forming a settled view on those matters where they have thus far reserved judgement. I am the first to recognise that the difficulties engendered by Modernising Medical Careers stemmed in part from rushed implementation, so I fully accept that this time we need to get everything right. But I would like to hear from the Minister that he and his colleagues are treating Sir John's recommendations with an appropriate degree of urgency.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="08031367000024"></a>For example, it is a great pity that the Government do not regard it as possible to begin the process of merging PMETB with the GMC until 2010. Perhaps the Minister could tell us why this should be. I understand that the change could be effected by statutory instrument. Similarly, it is not clear why we should have to wait until 2011 before the recommendations for longer training times for GPs should be taken forward. That recommendation arose in large measure from the concerns relating to the impact of the European working time directive, about which I shall say more in a moment. But on a general level, without &#147;urgent action&#148; to reform postgraduate medical training, as Sir John himself has said, we cannot plan effectively for the future.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="08031367000025"></a>Nowhere is the need for action more pressing than on the one recommendation of Sir John's mentioned by all noble Lords&#151;the creation of NHS Medical Education England. Of course proper consultation on this is essential. I completely take the Government's point that we need to agree on precisely what the remit of this new body should be and to whom it should be accountable. Moving responsibility for a large amount of public money away from central government and into a quango is never something that should be done lightly. At the same time it is quite clear why the profession has spoken with a united voice on the matter. It wants to regain ownership of the principles underpinning postgraduate medical training; it wants the funding to be safeguarded; and it wants to make sure that this area of policy is properly co-ordinated&#151;something that the department has shown itself signally unable to do. Yet the Government have equivocated.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="08031367000026"></a>We are asked to be patient so that the noble Lord's Next Stage review of the NHS can add its own slant to the debate, supposedly so that Sir John's ideas can be considered in the context of the future needs of the service. That argument seems to me exceedingly weak. The proposed functions of MEE are not affected by future patterns of service delivery. Accountability for those functions does not need to lie with government. What Ministers need to remember is that the confidence of the profession has taken a terrible knock. If the Government were to come out and say that they agree in principle with the idea of NHS Medical Education England and will work with the profession urgently to put together a working plan for it, that would do more than anything else to restore confidence in the training system on the part of doctors. I am talking, of course, about long-term confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="08031367000027"></a>This year, we are likely to experience if anything even more serious problems in postgraduate training than we did last year. It is therefore extraordinary that, even after the publication of Sir John&#146;s report, accountability in the department for this area of policy should still be blurred. The very serious failings on the part of the department, which were exposed by Sir John, revolved around weak governance and ambiguous accountability structures. Yet we know from recent answers that responsibility for this area of policy is still currently shared between two people: the CMO and the head of human resources. That divided accountability does not, on the face of it, sound sensible.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="08031367000028"></a>I return to the subject of the European working time directive. In his report, Sir John says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="08031367000058"></a>&#147;The effect of the current interpretation in UK legislation impedes the acquisition of experience, of confidence and the ability to shoulder responsibility ... few other professions in the UK, nor medical career structures in Europe embrace the Directive in the same way that it has been embraced in the UK&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031367000055"></a>Sir John was concerned here with the need to see whether, in his words,</p>
<ul><a name="08031367000060"></a>&#147;a more flexible approach to EWTD could be legitimately embraced&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031367000056"></a>It would be helpful to hear from the Minister whether he believes this is feasible.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="08031367000029"></a>In 2004, Ministers gave a commitment that they would seek to amend the working time directive in the wake of the SiMAP and Jaeger judgments. Attempts were made in 2005-06 to do this, but nothing tangible appears to have happened since. The matter is of considerable importance, as an amendment could make a huge difference to the timing of rest breaks, and could mean that inactive times spent on call in the workplace would not be counted as working time. We know too that it is open to Ministers to negotiate to postpone the effect of the directive until 2012; yet apparently they do not now propose to do so. Why is that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="08031367000030"></a>The Minister will know of the grave and widely held anxieties about the adequacy of medical training hours, particularly in surgery. I hesitate to refer to surgery in his presence, but if he reads the Royal College of Surgeons&#146; bulletin, he will be aware of the catastrophic effect that the directive is already having on both the quantity and the quality of surgical training and the clear perception among the profession that patient care is suffering. Almost all surgeons believe that the old on-call system provided vastly superior training, and that the new shift system damages both the continuity of care and doctors&#146; quality of life, which ironically is the very opposite of what the directive was supposed to achieve. To gain skill in a craft specialty requires practice, practice and more practice. Surgeons of the Minister&#146;s generation could expect to have about 35,000 hours of career training. Surgeons currently have about 8,000. When the new regulations come in, they will have about 6,000. Does the Minister think that that sort of level is adequate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="08031367000031"></a>This year, trainees in some disciplines are facing competition ratios in excess of 10:1. The lives and the aspirations of many of our finest and most altruistic graduates look set to be devastated&#151;a huge loss to the

Ministers say that we cannot simply turn on the tap to create more specialist training posts because there will not be enough jobs at the end of the process, but what confidence can we have in those arguments, given the department&#146;s abysmal record in predicting the correct workforce numbers in the past? After all, the Minister himself has said that in London alone we will need a 30 per cent increase in the number of GPs. What are the Government prepared to do? On this immediate issue, Sir John provided no recommendations, but it is a question of such magnitude that the Minister really cannot leave it unanswered.</p>

<a name="08031367000032"></a><b><a name="80313-0015.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08031367000068"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Darzi of Denham):</b> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Patel, on his success in securing this important debate on the recommendations of the Tooke report on modernising medical careers. It has been a lively and informative debate, as I expected, and I thank all noble Lords for their very valuable contributions. I will not have time to answer most of the questions that have been asked but I will try my best, and I ask noble Lords to forgive me if I do not cover all of them. I will certainly deal with them in writing.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="08031367000033"></a>As Sir John&#146;s report makes clear, trainee doctors pre-MMC faced considerable uncertainties in a system that was neither particularly transparent nor fair. For doctors in senior house officer posts there was a variation in training content and standards. There were no clear career pathways and ill-defined educational goals. There was also no time limit to the SHO grade and a poor distinction between training and service posts. SHOs had in many ways become the lost tribe. Let us be clear about the effects of this old system referred to today: it was not good for patients or for the NHS and it was certainly not good for the junior doctors themselves.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="08031367000034"></a>Modernising medical careers was introduced to address those problems. For the first time, we introduced national standards for training&#151;consistent national standards. There is now a structured and approved curriculum to allow standardised, rigorous and competency-based assessments. Selections are now transparent and standardised. Certainly the principles of MMC were right and enjoyed wide-ranging professional support. Unfortunately, as I have alluded to in this House before, the translation of those principles was too rapid through a flawed national IT system. That caused a great deal of trauma for trainees, for their families, and, speaking from experience, for their trainers as well. The then Secretary of State apologised for this and we have been working over the past year to rectify the problems. This is absolutely a case where we should concentrate on getting it right rather than doing it quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="08031367000035"></a>Postgraduate medical education and training must reflect the needs of a service that aims to deliver the world-class care to which we aspire. It is crucial that training post numbers meet predicted future workforce requirements, but workforce planning has become a difficult science in an age of a flexible and responsive health service. The medical workforce is now a global  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1675"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1675</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>phenomenon and this brings challenges which we did not face 20, 30 or 40 years ago. We might be good at forecasting workforce based on the supply end ,but we need to move on into the more sophisticated demand end in an age when medicine changes with demography, disease prevalence and medical technological innovations.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="08031367000036"></a>Last year, around half of all applications for specialty training came from the international medical graduates&#151;a point alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord Walton. The department has recently launched a consultation on the guidance that would give preference to UK and European Economic Area applicants when recruiting to speciality training. I reassure the noble Lord that we are not talking about the NHS service posts for which international medical graduates are still free to apply. As the noble Lord said, doctors from abroad have made, and will continue to make, a valuable contribution to the NHS in this way.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="08031367000037"></a>The Government have now given their formal response to Sir John&#146;s final report and recommendations. I am pleased that our response has been broadly welcomed. Sir John&#146;s report marks a significant step forward in ensuring that excellence and high achievement remain at the heart of medical education and training in this country. While not all Sir John&#146;s recommendations are the direct responsibility of the department, we have accepted the overwhelming majority. Of 47 recommendations, there were perhaps three areas which gave rise to particular comment and discussion, as some noble Lords have alluded to today.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="08031367000038"></a>The first is the merger of the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board with the General Medical Council. The issue raised by Sir John was not about PMETB&#146;s contribution&#151;he acknowledges that it has brought about many key improvements&#151;but about the merger in the context of the continuity of training between undergraduate and postgraduate training. We agree with Sir John that the merger should take place as soon as possible. This requires a good deal of legal work, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, will agree. We will give it our best to get it through as quickly as we can.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="08031367000039"></a>Secondly, there was also a proposal to change the structure of the foundation programme. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, referred to the separation of F1 and F2. We have consensus advice on that. Sir John hinged his recommendation on legal advice which suggests that F1 and F2 need to be separated to provide a legal guarantee of employment to UK graduates, a noble cause that I agree with. However, our advice is that Sir John&#146;s legal advice is flawed. Separating F1 and F2 will not achieve Sir John&#146;s aims. Therefore, it is sensible that we revisit this recommendation and we hope to have a debate about this and the foundation programme in early summer.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="08031367000040"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, raised an interesting point about why universities do not play a larger role in postgraduate medical education and training. Of course, it is crucial that universities and postgraduate deaneries continue to work together within medical education. It is interesting to note that in some countries outside the UK, universities have a greater role in postgraduate education. The UK has a clear distinction  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1676"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1676</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>between undergraduate education and postgraduate training. As has already been touched on, a greater role for universities is certainly something that I will consider as part of the next stage review. Some work that I led in London certainly highlighted the importance of converging the service and university activity. Some noble Lords will be aware of the creation of the first academic health science centre, which brings the mission of excellence in service delivery and an excellence in training and development under one roof.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="08031367000041"></a>The third area of great interest and discussion is the creation of a single body to oversee doctors&#146; training; namely, the NHS Medical Education England. While this suggestion has been welcomed by some within the medical profession&#151;I can understand why, and noble Lords have referred to it today&#151;Sir John has pointed to the need for clear governance and accountability structures. Perhaps I may remind the House that this was not in Sir John&#146;s original discussion document published in October. It was in his final recommendation received in January. Given the importance of securing stability and the best possible solutions for future doctors, representatives have also reminded us of the need to proceed in a careful and evidence-based fashion, engaging with key stakeholders. That is particularly relevant when the budget under consideration for control of NHS Medical Education England would amount to about &#163;1.6 billion of public money.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="08031367000042"></a>The proposals for the future of post-graduate medical education cannot be seen in isolation from the future of the health service more widely. The overarching aim of postgraduate medical education must be to train doctors to deliver excellent quality care. This chimes exactly with the goals of the NHS Next Stage Review, which I am leading. I can reassure the House that within the next three months, every attempt will be made to engage the profession through the NHS review, with Sir John in the final recommendations in relation to this area. It is to be published in July as the enabling report for the NHS Next Stage Review.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="08031367000043"></a>On other issues raised in this debate, first, I turn to the European working time directive and some of the challenges of training&#151;certainly in areas of craft specialty, such as surgery. I agree that the number of hours have been reduced significantly. But what we did in the past may not necessarily be the best training. I certainly remember the days when I happened to be on call on a one-in-two basis and the nights when I slept in the operating theatre between cases. That is not the future of surgical training. We need to innovate the way in which we design our curriculum and the ways in which we can improve the quality of training. Yesterday, I attended a London deanery event where there was a significant discussion on the role of simulations, for example, in acquiring some of those skills. But the European working time directive is a law, which has been challenged in the past. However, I shall seek legal advice within the context of the NHS Next Stage Review.</p>

<a name="80313-0015.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="08031367000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, raised the issue of clinical academics not being disadvantaged&#151;again, an area close to my heart. I am sure the noble Lord will acknowledge the Government&#146;s investment in  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1677"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1677</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>academic medicine in this country, with the creation of academic clinical fellowships and lectureships. I reassure the noble Lord that the existing arrangements already take account of the fact that doctors take time out to do research and to do fellowships abroad. We are conscious that every opportunity is made available for them to return into a training post. The clinical academics on the MMC programme board are robust in ensuring that this is the case.</p>

<a name="80313-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="08031367000045"></a>We have also heard a tremendous amount about the funding budgets of medical education and training. Let me make it clear that the Government&#146;s view is that we should be as transparent as possible in ensuring that all money allocated for medical education and training is serving its purposes. Whether ring-fencing or other arrangements are the best way to ensure clarity and robustness in spending and funding is an issue that I will look into. Currently, we have service-level agreements with the strategic health authorities that ensure funding is available for training. I add that there has been an increase of at least 139 per cent in funding for medical education between 1997 and 2008.</p>

<a name="80313-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="08031367000046"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, raised the role of the doctor. It is absolutely crucial that we have a clear understanding of the part that healthcare professionals play if we are to meet the needs of the NHS in the future. This is why we have accepted Sir John&#146;s recommendations on this principle, and why consideration of how the roles of clinicians need to develop will be a key part of the workforce in education and training board that is being set up in the NHS Next Stage Review, where Sir John himself is an adviser.</p>

<a name="80313-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="08031367000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, raised the issue of the number and location of posts, and information for applicants. We have published, at a national level, much more detailed information about the number of different posts, their location and, crucially, the relevant competition ratios, which we hope will allow trainees to make a decision. The noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, also raised the issue of the CRO and the CMO&#146;s role as the accountable  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1678"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column 1678</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>officer. We have acknowledged the importance of the role of the CRO by ensuring that it is filled by a clinician who is dedicated wholly to the role. As a former dean, who has had direct experience of medical education, the noble Baroness will know that the CRO reports to the departmental board through the director-general of workforce and the CMO. The subgroup also reports to the departmental board, which comprises the CMO, the director-general of workforce and the recently appointed medical director.</p>

<a name="80313-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="08031367000048"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, referred to the creation of an exam at the end of medical education. This is an interesting idea and I know that the medical school committees have previously considered this. However, we also believe that it is a good thing that the curriculum varies across medical schools, and that variation should not have an impact on the exam or test that is being referred to. The noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, referred to nurse preceptorship. I understand the point of the noble Baroness about introducing preceptorship here. It is a debate that I have heard a great deal about and it is certainly part of the Next Stage Review debate.</p>

<a name="80313-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="08031367000049"></a>I have heard a very interesting debate about this. I have captured a lot in relation to the Next Stage Review and I reassure the House that we will see a lot of the recommendations currently in the Tooke report, and, more importantly, further creative recommendations to address some of the challenges we have faced in the past and set the scene for the future.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000011"></a>Clause 11 [<I>Offences: mode of trial and penalties</I>]:</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000012"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 11 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="08031366000013"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08031366000207"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> I would like to continue with my probing of this part of the Bill. Clause 11 markedly increases the penalties for offences under Section 31 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. Whereas before there was only a summary offence with a top level fine of &#163;5,000, now there is an additional possibility of an unlimited fine from a Crown Court.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000014"></a>The Government&#146;s consultation document on national minimum wage enforcement states that these new provisions will expect enforcement officers to issue penalties in almost all cases of underpayment. This will be a noticeable difference from the current regime, where I believe only two cases last year led to a penalty notice. Can the Minister explain what is preventing the compliance officers issuing more penalty notices now? Where in the Bill are the new provisions that will lead to such a drastic improvement in enforcement procedures?</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000015"></a>I would also like to probe the necessity for the criminal offence. The consultation document states that only 3 per cent of cases of non-compliance would have incurred a penalty above &#163;5,000 even on the new calculation of penalty arrears. Presumably it is to deter this 3 per cent in future that the Government have introduced the unlimited fine. How many times was the full &#163;5,000 fine that the magistrates&#146; courts could levy under current legislation actually levied? If they are going to argue the need for an increased deterrent, presumably they have explored the full extent of their current powers. If not, it would seem more reasonable to assume that the lack of deterrent is a result of compliance officers not issuing penalty notices which were well within their power to levy, rather than the ability of offenders to avoid the Crown Court.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000016"></a>I hope the Minister will provide some conclusive statistics showing that current penalties are stretched to the limit. If not, I fail to see what possible reason there can be for implementing this clause.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000017"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08031366000208"></a>Lord Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> I wish to resist the noble Baroness&#146;s opposition to the Question, particularly because research suggests that the current regime is far  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC258"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC258</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from satisfactory and that more needs to be done by way of enforcement of the minimum wage, particularly the enforcement of arrears and non-payment of arrears.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000018"></a>The research was carried out by Geoff White of the University of Greenwich and Richard Croucher of the Cranfield School of Management. I have given the Minister notice of their work and I am sure his advisers will have knowledge of it. That survey suggests that something more needs to be invented by way of an enforcement agency. The Revenue does not have sufficient resources to follow up non-payment of the minimum wage and, in particular, non-payment of arrears. I take the opportunity to put that on record and hope that the Minister will resist the noble Baroness&#146;s arguments.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000019"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08031366000209"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office &amp; Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Lord Jones of Birmingham):</b> Welcome back. I hope that the changes that we are introducing in the Bill show how seriously we consider non-compliance with the national minimum wage. As well as considering how we needed to strengthen the enforcement regime with penalties under the civil law, we also considered whether the sanctions for criminal offences under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 were sufficient, or whether they needed to be enhanced in line with the penalties imposed for non-compliance.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000020"></a>Clause 9 provides that the maximum financial penalty that can be imposed for non-compliance with the national minimum wage by way of a statutory notice of underpayment is &#163;5,000. Currently, criminal offences under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 can be tried only in the magistrates&#146; court, where the maximum fine that can be imposed is &#163;5,000. However, there is no such limit on the fine which can be imposed by the Crown Court. In those rare cases where the criminality involved makes it appropriate, it is important that the potential fine available to a criminal court when sentencing for an offence under the Act is greater than the maximum penalty which can be imposed by a notice of underpayment. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, that there is a distinction between the two&#151;non-compliance and greater criminality&#151;for underpayment.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000021"></a>Without the possibility of the Crown Court imposing an unlimited fine, there may be a perverse incentive for a criminally minded employer to prefer prosecution because the outcome is likely to be less serious from a purely financial point of view. We cannot have the criminality side being out of kilter with the penalty for a civil breach. We do not believe that the sentencing powers available to magistrates would be suitable in the most serious and exceptional cases where employers refuse or contrive not to pay the national minimum wage and do not co-operate with a compliance officer&#146;s investigations. That is where the distinction to which the noble Baroness referred is highlighted. For example, where an employer owes Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs &#163;50,000, say, in deliberately evaded tax, the maximum penalty available is seven years in prison or an unlimited fine. However, where an employer owes his workers &#163;50,000 by deliberately underpaying the national minimum wage, the maximum penalty currently  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC259"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC259</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>available is &#163;5,000. The courts should be able to deal with the deliberate exploitation of the low-paid more strongly than at present.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000022"></a>In addition, the strengthening of the investigative powers of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs proposed in Clause 12&#151;which we shall discuss shortly&#151;could not be used if the national minimum wage offences remained triable only as summary offences. The power to impose an unlimited fine for criminal offences under the National Minimum Wage Act means that rogue employers could be fined to the total extent of any profits gained from underpaying of the national minimum wage, and ensures that the balance of the enforcement spectrum is preserved.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000023"></a>At the moment, notices are issued only when an employer does not comply with a civil enforcement notice, not a criminal one. Clause 9 replaces that with a notice of underpayment that applies the penalty for non-compliance with the national minimum wage. The criminal prosecution regime is totally separate from the civil one and, as required in Clause 9, will apply only in the small minority of cases where there is criminal conduct. The specific answer to the noble Baroness&#146;s question is two.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000025"></a>This business of the minimum wage has become a kind of mantra&#151;a tiny one, not of great importance&#151;in the Bill. I wonder whether it should be there at all, particularly having listened to the speech about criminality. The Bill is not about putting people in prison, or keeping them out of it. I support my noble friend in opposing the clause.</p>

By the way, I was not in the Caribbean, but Saudi Arabia. I got back yesterday morning, and I am off to Thailand next week.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000027"></a>There have been two criminal prosecutions, both successful. The first prosecution was against Teresa Aguda, sole director of Rascals Day Nursery. Ms Aguda pleaded guilty before Walthamstow magistrates&#146; court in August last year to a single offence of obstruction, contrary to Section 31(5)(a) of the NMW Act. She was fined &#163;2,500 and ordered to pay costs of &#163;500&#151;this was for a criminal, not a civil, offence. The second case was against Torbay Council. The council pleaded guilty before Torquay magistrates&#146; court on 1 October 2007 to a single offence of neglecting to furnish information contrary to Section 31(5)(b) of the Act. The council was fined &#163;1,000 and ordered to pay costs of &#163;500. The Act is trying to bring into sync the civil side, where the financial aspect is taken more seriously, and the criminal side, which has fallen behind.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, threw me slightly, because I did not know whether he was answering for the Government or whether I should wait for the Minister. The Minister has not repeated what the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, said. I would like clarification from one or both of them. Was the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, saying that the Revenue does not have the resources to pursue the cases? If it does not, that must be the answer to the question about why so few penalties were imposed. It would not be a question then of the ability of the offenders to avoid the Crown Court, but one of not having the people to carry out their duties properly. If that is the case, why does one not just make sure that one has the right amount of people to do the right job and leave it as it is?</p>

My stress was not so much on the penalties for what is plainly a criminal offence as on the worker, who needs to have their arrears paid to them. I support the Bill&#151;of course, there must be heavier penalties and better enforcement through criminal procedures&#151;but I asked that the Minister tell us what more can be done to enforce payment of lost wages to the worker.</p>

As far as I am concerned, there is sufficient resource for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to enforce the new regime. BERR, HMRC and the RCPO are working through the details to ensure that the penalty regime will be a success. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has already recruited an additional 20 people this year, and we are working with it to establish the best process to allow it to work effectively operationally.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000034"></a>HMRC has been hampered by its inability to investigate some alleged national minimum wage offences to a criminal standard of proof&#151;that is why

The issue is not that it does not have the people or the resources, but that it does not have the power to take a case to a criminal court. It has therefore been difficult to prosecute an employer unless employees are willing to testify. That has been problematic because of the vulnerability of some of those employees, and HMRC has been forced to abandon some potential prosecutions as a result. The situation has led to the problem, not a lack of resource. I sincerely hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, is certain that I am speaking for the Government.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000037"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 12 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="08031366000038"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="08031366000218"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> Like my probing stand part debate on Clause 10, this debate is to explore whether it is necessary to endow HMRC compliance officers with such extensive powers. As noble Lords know, the recent changes that saw Her Majesty&#146;s Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue formed into one organisation have led to a complex array of different powers for HMRC officers investigating different areas of their remit. The Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 was right to ring-fence what powers HMRC inherited from its predecessors. However, it is noticeable that only three years later the Government are attempting to extend those powers into a new area. PACE powers, which are set out in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, are considerable. They were extended to HMRC&#146;s fiscal functions by the Finance Act 2007. This small Bill extends them beyond that. I believe that this is the first time that such extensive powers of investigation and enforcement have been awarded to HMRC outside fiscal areas. Can the Minister confirm that when he responds?</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000039"></a>Do the Government have any plans for adding to this regime any other matters that HMRC currently enforces with a lighter touch? I am aware that these provisions have been widely welcomed by outside lobby groups, but in this House we have the privilege of being more immune to the pressures of short-term expediency than might be the case elsewhere. Such large increases in powers should not be passed without scrutiny and should certainly not be welcomed without a real body of evidence to show that the new powers are both necessary and proportionate. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the Committee that there is a very real need for this massive extension of investigative power and that this is not the start of an inexorable expansion of HMRC&#146;s powers over more and more matters.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000176"></a>That legislation is the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, if I am not mistaken, which includes criminal proceedings.</p>

This clause has nothing to do with what the Bill is about. As I said before, the Bill has nothing to do with criminal offences&#151;it should have nothing to do with that at all&#151;and I object to it on those grounds.</p>

<ul><a name="08031366000197"></a>&#147;to make provision about the enforcement of minimum wages legislation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031366000177"></a>No one can deny that &#147;enforcement&#148; may include criminal offences and the detailed provisions of the Bill make it clear that they do. I fear that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, with all his experience, has missed a trick on that.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000044"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0001.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08031366000223"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> One often reads in newspapers about my purported or suggested, and highly erroneous, views on the national minimum wage. It is always said that I was against it when it came in. I was not actually at the CBI when it came in, as I often say. I was not asked for my opinion, and if I had been, I would have said that it is a very good thing, but only if set at the appropriate level.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000045"></a>The dignity of work is what is important, and the right to have a safety net. What damages the economy is if the minimum wage is set too high or if one vested interest gets its way in an unbalanced manner. I have never been against the minimum wage, but I have been against it being set at too high a level. Why do I repeat that? Because to be successful it needs, as with all legislation, to win the respect of those whom it affects. In that respect a successful implementation has to have, on the one side, the proper level and, on the other side, the ability to enforce it. Very few people flout the legislation, but when it is flouted the people who are hurt are the employees. The Committee will notice that I do not use the word &#147;workers&#148; as I do not understand why that word should be attached to one group of people who contribute to the economy and not to another. Not only do employees suffer from flouting of the legislation, but so do all the very good employers in the country who behave themselves, but who see others down the road in a competitive environment not behaving themselves. They deserve protection from equality enforcement, as do the employees who are also being ripped off. At the end of the day, a system of regulation or law cannot work if you cannot resort to the enforcement of criminality.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000046"></a>It is important that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs has the power to investigate effectively allegations that offences have been committed under

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000047"></a>During the early years of national minimum wage enforcement, non-compliance was dealt with by civil sanctions, such as enforcement notices, rather than by prosecution of the offences under the Act. That worked well but, over time, a tougher line was needed to deal with those&#151;I repeat, there are few&#151;who continue to flout the law. The then DTI agreed a policy on national minimum wage enforcement and prosecutions with HMRC and the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office in May 2006. Additional resources were then allocated so that appropriate cases could be investigated with a view to prosecution.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000048"></a>However, we are concerned that HMRC is being hampered in its ability to obtain evidence of any criminal offence&#151;</p>

As the Minister knows, the Revenue already has pretty extensive powers. I remember when with other colleagues I was taking the Child Support Act&#151;dare I mention it?&#151;through the House many years ago, and we tried to give similar powers to child support officers as the Revenue already had. It was pointed out that those powers were very excessive indeed, but historically that the Revenue and Customs had always had those powers. The noble Lord is trying to extend the powers that the Revenue has in terms of entering properties without magistrates&#146; consent, and all that. Would not existing powers that, for example, the Inland Revenue used to have, which were slightly less than those the Customs and Excise had, be more appropriate?</p>

<p><a name="08031366000050"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0001.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08031366000225"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, for using his crystal ball. If he had sat down for one more moment I would have got to precisely that point. Let me take the Committee to Leicester, to an employee who was threatened with excommunication from her own community if she continued to assist Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs with its inquiries. HMRC, with its current powers, could do nothing without her testimony. Somehow it had to get to the powers the Bill seeks. It had to be able to use those powers to get the evidence because, frankly, for very shameful but nevertheless real practical reasons on the ground, it was not going to get the help it needed from the employee in question. I repeat: if we are going to get good-quality employers to understand that this is important for them as much as it is for employees, HMRC needs those additional powers.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000051"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked whether the powers will be used often. I very much doubt it, but they have to be in the box of tools available.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000052"></a>Based on investigations conducted so far, securing employee testimony in these areas is problematic. Employees face intimidation, physical threats and loss of employment, and in some cases they simply cannot afford the risk. What is the point of having this type of legislation if, at the end of the day, the very people it is designed to protect are the very people who cannot avail themselves of that protection? That is

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000053"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, raised a valid point. I am grateful she raised it because I also feel that it is a worry. She asked whether this was the thin end of the wedge&#151;the slippery slope&#151;and something where we will give the taxman the right to get a foot into the door and then end up seeing the whole body go through the door for other stuff. I assure her and the Committee that we have no plans whatever to increase the powers of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs in respect of any other non-fiscal function.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000054"></a>Each case for additional powers must be taken on its own individual merits. Coercive powers in PACE can be used only in respect of indictable offences. Therefore, if the relevant legislation provides for summary-only offences, it will not be possible to apply these powers. For example, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs could not use PACE powers in respect of its enforcement of the statutory adoption, maternity&#151;again, I can cover the ground mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Henley&#151;paternity or sick-pay provisions excluded from the Finance Act, because those provisions do not include an indictable offence.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000055"></a>Enforcement of the national minimum wage would be improved if Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs had the additional powers in Clause 12. As I said in an earlier answer, HMRC has often been forced to abandon potential prosecutions because it has been reliant on evidence that it just cannot get. I stand here as someone who believes that the provisions should be set at a level that can be used as a tool in a modernised economy; therefore, we must have the ability to enforce that so that respect is obtained in the employer community as well.</p>

</ul>(a) are incurred in order to enable the worker to perform his duties, (b) are reasonably so incurred, and(c) are not accommodation expenses,are to be regarded as actually incurred in the performance of his duties.&#148;&#148;
<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000061"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 24AA amends Section 44 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 to broaden the type of expenses that can be reimbursed to voluntary workers without triggering eligibility for the minimum wage. I am very proud that I can stand here and move this amendment, because in my former life I was involved in the hospice movement in various ways, and I saw this happen on the ground often in my home city of Birmingham. To have the chance to make a difference today is a privilege.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000062"></a>The amendment will mean that, as well as being able to reimburse expenses incurred in the performance of duties, voluntary organisations will be able, should they wish, to reimburse expenses necessary to enable the voluntary worker to perform the duties. That does not normally apply in employee situations, although, in the eyes of the Revenue, for years it has applied in self-employed situations.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000063"></a>Voluntary workers are a special class of employee. They are exempt from the minimum wage. They can be employed only by charities, voluntary organisations, associated fund-raising bodies or statutory bodies. For brevity, therefore, although the amendment applies to that broad nature of voluntary worker, I shall refer to them as voluntary organisations to cover all of them.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000064"></a>During the development of the national minimum wage legislation, it was recognised that an exemption was necessary for voluntary workers to ensure the successful continued operation of the voluntary sector. The exemption in Section 44 of the 1998 Act means that voluntary workers can continue to work for free without being eligible for the minimum wage, and that voluntary organisations in turn can continue to benefit from that dedication.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000065"></a>Section 44 specifies that no monetary payments can be made to a voluntary worker apart from the reimbursement of expenses actually incurred in the performance of the worker&#146;s duties. That was to ensure that voluntary workers would not be out of pocket in doing the job that they had volunteered for, and that only relevant expenses could be repaid. In that way jobs could not emerge in the voluntary sector which, through the reimbursement of spurious expenses paid at sub-minimum wage levels, could exploit the most vulnerable, for obvious reasons.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000066"></a>However, following the Government&#146;s consultation on the national minimum wage and voluntary workers last year, we heard compelling arguments from voluntary organisations that there were expenses which voluntary workers necessarily incurred in order to perform their duties but which were not actually incurred in the performance of those duties. The Government feel that those should similarly be reimbursable without bringing minimum wage entitlement. We recognise  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC266"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC266</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that voluntary workers should not suffer financially and end up in a negative position simply as a result of the good work that they do. We agree that voluntary organisations should have the ability to reimburse those expenses&#151;to render the voluntary worker in a neutral position without such reimbursement meaning that they fall into the national minimum wage basket. Those expenses could be, for instance, for childcare or care for a dependent relative such as the elderly while voluntary workers are at their place of voluntary work; for travel between home and the place of voluntary work; for meals taken during breaks in the voluntary day; and for any specialist clothing and equipment that they may need, such as protective gloves or boots.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000067"></a>To fall within the scope of the exemption, such an expense would have to meet three tests. First, the expense must actually&#151;not &#147;may&#148;&#151;be incurred or reasonably estimated to have been incurred. That is already the position for the expenses currently permissible under Section 44, and means that the voluntary worker will have to have made the outlay already and should not be reimbursed more than that specific outlay. The reimbursement of any expense will never bring a voluntary worker into any sort of profit. Secondly, the expense must be necessary to enable the worker to perform their duties. For example, if a voluntary worker claims for the cost of work boots&#151;protective boots&#151;but in fact only undertakes office duties, that would not be allowed to fall into the exemption. Thirdly, the expense must be reasonably incurred. It would not be reasonable for a voluntary worker to incur the expense of a new car merely to travel to the place of work, and to have that expense totally reimbursed. A car would of course provide a significant benefit which could be used beyond the voluntary work. I hope that that is obvious. However, it would be reasonable for the voluntary worker to incur the cost of public transport to travel to the place of work and have that fall within the protective net.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000068"></a>Members of the Committee may also have noticed that accommodation expenses are not permitted by the new clause. That maintains the current position that voluntary organisations cannot reimburse rent to voluntary workers. Instead, Section 44 permits voluntary organisations to provide accommodation directly to the voluntary worker in such cases as needed.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000069"></a>Amendment No. 28A enables the provision to commence two months after Royal Assent. Voluntary organisations such as the Association of Volunteer Managers have urged us to make the change as swiftly as possible, as it is having real effect in various areas of the voluntary sector. We are working with voluntary organisations to produce guidance which will include these changes, should they become part of the legislation.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000070"></a>Amendment No. 30 changes the Long Title, which I am sure will be welcomed as great news in every part of the Committee, to indicate that the Bill now covers voluntary workers.</p>

This, in turn, should allow more people to gain from the benefits that voluntary work brings to the individual and the community. So often in my former life I saw cases where voluntary organisations could not employ certain people because they were going to be caught by national minimum wage legislation, for which the 1998 Act was never intended. The community suffered, which is surely not the intention of anyone in the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

We all remember the Mallalieu case of the black clothing, and how it was ruled that she could not claim for it.

When I was trying to get my mind around it the other day, I went all the way back to my tax law at university to think about it. The distinction between expenses allowable for self-employment and those for employment is the word &#147;necessarily&#148;. I tried to transpose that into the application here. This is not about tax law, but about what is or is not caught under an employer&#146;s obligation under the National Minimum Wage Act. So if something was transposed into the national minimum wage that, in the minds of the noble Baroness and myself, would not have been incurred necessarily and was therefore not allowable under Schedule E taxation, it would be deemed remuneration for the purposes of the calculation of the national minimum wage. It would have nothing to do with the Revenue. It would be caught under that method of calculation. The employer would therefore be caught by the National Minimum Wage Act 1998.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000074"></a>Now that word is being moved so that, although this type of expenditure would not be necessarily incurred&#151;so it would be caught under Schedule E taxation and not allowable&#151;here, and only in NMW terms, not Revenue terms, it will be deemed not to be remuneration. Therefore the employer does not get caught, is more minded to take on the voluntary worker and, in certain situations such as childcare, the voluntary worker can now do it. We leave them outside the NMW. If that was inside the HMRC but not the NMW environment, it would still fall foul of Schedule E and not be allowable because it was not incurred necessarily. What is important is not the taxation application, but the &#147;necessarily&#148; principle of taxation.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000076"></a>My only question for the Minister is why accommodation expenses which are incurred in order to enable the worker to perform his duties, and are reasonably so incurred, are not covered as well. It might be in the practicalities that accommodation expenses of even the most modest kind would inevitably be considerable compared with mere travel on the bus or the cost of lunch. Can the Minister explain why in no circumstances could expenses for accommodation necessary to do the voluntary job be covered by the amendment?</p>

However, society moves as fast even as House of Lords Grand Committees. What may need increasingly to be provided is not accommodation but accommodation expenses. This will apply often to young voluntary workers. We all know how difficult it is for young people to find anywhere to live in London, and the same is true of some other cities. Will the Government keep under active review the paragraph that excludes accommodation expenses?</p>

<p><a name="08031366000078"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08031366000233"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> Perhaps I may allay the fears of my noble friends Lord Wedderburn and Lord Borrie by making the following distinction. As noble Lords know, Section 44(1)(b) of the NMWA states that a voluntary organisation can provide accommodation directly for the voluntary worker. That means not only that the young persons to whom my noble friend rightly referred&#151;it would help society if many more younger people got into the world of voluntary work&#151;have a roof over their head which would not fall foul of the new clause, which is excellent, but that they would not have to make the up-front payment and find the dosh to pay an advance on rent, which is no bad thing. If that voluntary worker was not in directly provided accommodation and had to attend a conference, for instance, or had to go away from their locality of normal work, obviously any attendant hotel costs or other accommodation expenses would be reimbursed. Although they might not necessarily be caught for the purposes of other legislation, they would be caught by this clause.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000079"></a>We do not consider the reimbursement of enabling expenses to extend to the cost of rent per se because jobs should not emerge in the voluntary sector which could attract the vulnerable by offering significant remuneration or what is seen as a benefit and leave them in a position that is more than neutral. If their situation is enhanced, other sectors in society will ask why they are getting something different from anybody else. The clause is not trying to inhibit the young especially from getting into the world of voluntary work&#151;quite the opposite: it is trying to ensure that we achieve a neutral position for those people vis- -vis their employer and not bring even more legislation down on their heads.</p>

No doubt that is due to me more than it is to the Minister. He mentioned the relevant section of the National Minimum Wage Act. If it states what he said it does on accommodation, it seems to be at odds with the amendment. I do not understand how the two are compatible. I was concerned as to how accommodation, such as hotel accommodation, would be covered in the case of a trade show or conference that a voluntary worker was attending. The Minister has cleared that up: that would not fall foul of the new clause. But if accommodation expenses are excluded, how does that sit with what he said was in the National Minimum Wage Act?</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>

That would provide the clarity that noble Lords seek. It would be better than my carrying on telling them what I believe is the distinction and some noble Lords saying that they do not understand it. We could then move on. I will undertake to do that now.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000083"></a>I am at pains to point out that we are trying to get people into a neutral position so that the voluntary organisations and those who work for them are no worse off because of the implementation of the national minimum wage legislation.

<p><a name="08031366000087"></a>I am glad that the Government are taking steps to clear up any confusion about what expenses are allowable and that they are expanding them to reflect more accurately the difficulties and costs that a voluntary worker can incur. There are many expenses that might deter a potential volunteer worker from participating fully, as the Minister mentioned, such as childcare and travel expenses.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000088"></a>The advantages that charities and other eligible organisations bring to those whom they help and to the communities in which they work are of course of enormous importance and, I hope, widely appreciated. The benefits that a voluntary worker will enjoy, especially if he is otherwise unemployed or unable to partake in paid employment, are only starting to be appreciated by many but are also remarkable. Voluntary work should be encouraged if at all possible and I hope that the amendments will allow more people to participate fully.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000089"></a>However, I draw the noble Lord&#146;s attention to an adjustment that the Department for Work and Pensions made two years ago when attention was drawn to the effect that volunteering expenses had on state benefits. It was pointed out that many beneficiaries of jobseeker&#146;s allowance and incapacity benefit should be actively encouraged to seek voluntary work. As I mentioned, such work has a proven effect on a person&#146;s self-confidence and health, and can give them valuable experience and training before they become immersed in the world of paid employment.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000090"></a>On 9 October 2006, therefore, the Department for Work and Pensions announced that meal expenses and so on would not affect benefits, and so recipients could work towards re-entering the job market without fear of being penalised. Today, the Minister has repeated what the Department for Work and Pensions said two years ago. Therefore, the question is: why on earth has it taken two years for a lesson that one department learnt to be taught to another? The situations are practically identical. However, we are delighted to support the amendments.</p>

I move it on his behalf and as a former trade union official. The amendment was drafted by legal advisers at the RMT, the union to which the employees referred to belong.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000094"></a>Until I was asked to move the amendment by my noble friend and the RMT, I knew little about seafarers&#146; terms and conditions. Like most people who use ferries and travel by sea from time to time, I had assumed that the employees looking after us were all in receipt of at least the national minimum wage, and the idea that some would be in receipt of what amounts to penury wages would not have occurred to me. It now appears that that is the case due to complexities and anomalies, which the amendment is intended to correct.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000095"></a>Section 40 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, dealing with seafarers, reads as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031366000191"></a>&#147;For the purposes of this Act, an individual employed to work on board a ship registered in the United Kingdom ... shall be treated as an individual who under his contract ordinarily works in the United Kingdom unless&#151;</p>
</ul> (a) the employment is wholly outside the United Kingdom; or(b) the person is not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom&#148;.
<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000096"></a>DTI guidance interprets Section 40 in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031366000192"></a>&#147;Seafarers are covered by the minimum wage legislation whilst employed to work on a United Kingdom registered ship working in the United Kingdom or its internal waters (i.e. estuaries and, also, the sea between the United Kingdom mainland and many islands). In addition, when working on board a ship registered in the United Kingdom, a seafarer must be paid at least the minimum wage (wherever in the world that ship may be) unless: all his work takes place outside the United Kingdom (and its internal waters); or he is not normally resident in the United Kingdom and the ship is outside the United Kingdom (and its internal waters)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80313-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000097"></a>On the DTI&#146;s construction, working within the UK would not include all work performed within the UK&#146;s territorial waters, but only that performed within its internal waters. Employment beyond internal waters is regarded as being wholly outside the United Kingdom. UK internal waters include the Solent, the sea between Scotland and the Inner and Outer Hebrides, the Firth of Forth, the Wash and the Thames Estuary. They do not include waters between Scotland and the Shetlands or between the mainland and the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. Territorial waters are defined as 12 nautical miles from the baseline.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80313-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000098"></a>That interpretation allows employers to avoid the national minimum wage requirements, even where other employment protection is provided in UK territorial waters and beyond. That seems anomalous. There seems to be no reason why a seafarer who would otherwise be covered by Section 40 of the National Minimum Wage Act should be denied entitlement to the national minimum wage purely on the basis that he or she is employed, for example, on a ferry travelling between the mainland and the Shetlands rather than one travelling between Scotland and the Hebrides.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000099"></a>However, even on an interpretation of Section 40 of the Act which would see minimum wage entitlement extend to UK-registered ships, the protection would still be limited. That means that those working on board a non-UK registered ship within UK waters currently have no statutory entitlement to the minimum wage. Again, the position seems anomalous.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000100"></a>Entitlement to statutory employment rights is not defined by the registered home of the employing entity in other contexts. Within the context of those employed at sea, the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007, which we discussed in much detail last year, provides, as regards extent and territorial application, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031366000193"></a>&#147;Section 1 applies if the harm resulting in death is sustained in the United Kingdom or&#151;</p>
</ul> (a) within the seaward limits of the territorial sea adjacent to the United Kingdom;(b) on a ship registered under Part 2 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995&#148;.
<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000101"></a>Another concern is that those who do not meet the residence requirement but who work on UK-registered ships are not afforded the right to the national minimum wage. Such workers may do the same work alongside UK-resident workers on the same UK-registered ships, but be paid at different, non-minimum wage rates. That is plainly inequitable. It is hard to see the justification for permitting UK-registered ships to pay less than the national minimum wage.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000102"></a>The Low Pay Commission, as long ago as 2000, drew attention to those anomalies. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031366000194"></a>&#147;Most seamen working on board a ship registered in the UK are eligible, even if they work for long periods outside the UK. But the minimum wage does not apply if all the work is carried out outside the UK or if the seaman is not normally resident in the UK, even if working on a UK-registered ship. We suggest that the Government should consider the coverage of seafarers in any future review of marine policy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000103"></a>The RMT union, in support of its case for the amendment, has examples of seafarers not normally resident in the UK who are currently receiving wages very substantially below the national minimum wage on UK-registered ships. They have examples of a Portuguese steward employed by P&amp;O on a rate of &#163;1.50 an hour, which is very much below the minimum wage. Filipino seamen are also employed by P&amp;O on substantially less than the minimum wage. That is regarded by the union as quite inequitable.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000104"></a>The amendment deals with these anomalies. It stipulates that the national minimum wage must be paid to seafarers employed to work on board a ship registered in the UK under Part II of the Merchant Shipping Act or any other ship at any time it is within territorial waters. I understand that there have been many discussions between the RMT and government Ministers, but although the Government accept that there are anomalies, I think, it has not been possible to reach agreement. The amendment, which was drafted as a result of legal advice obtained by the RMT, represents a way forward and is intended to be helpful.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>

I understand that the Government have introduced a number of measures that benefit the industry, notably the introduction of the tonnage tax concession. As a result, the number of vessels on the UK register has grown considerably in the past seven years. There may well be a threat that, if forced to pay the national minimum wage, the companies will transfer the registration of their ships&#151;that is known as flagging out. I understand that that threat is made whenever improvements in employment rights or equality legislation are proposed. The Government should not give in to such threats, particularly in the light of the substantial tax concessions that have been made.</p>

Can it really be argued that such an important industry should not be subject to minimum standards? Of course it cannot. I therefore hope that the Government will not advance the arguments likely to be made by shipping industry employers and will accept that this amendment is a genuine attempt to sort out what are widely acknowledged to be anomalies that produce a totally unsatisfactory position. I have this morning received a copy of a letter from the TUC indicating that it fully supports the amendment. It has already pressed for further discussions with the Minister. I hope that he will be inclined to receive this amendment favourably. I beg to move.</p>

We are talking about thousands of seafarers and their employers. Many of them are very good employers, but we are talking about the floor below which the bad employers should not be allowed to fall. My noble friend has read Section 40 of the National Minimum Wage Act which states that on a ship registered in UK the seafarer must be paid the national minimum wage unless the employer is wholly outside the UK or the seafarer is not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. At first glance I found myself unable to support this amendment, even though I knew that the union, the TUC and various honourable friends in another place support it. However, having read the ingenious opinion of learned counsel and taken account of the slave wages that are paid to Filipinos and other foreigners on ships, I have concluded that we should press this upon the Government.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000108"></a>Since the object of Committee stage is to expound the reasons that the Government should consider, I shall put to the Committee the reasons that persuaded me that I should support the amendment. First, British seafarers on a British ship who work wholly outside United Kingdom waters can legally be paid slave wages. That is wrong. Secondly, foreign seafarers on a British ship with no place of residence in the UK can work cheek by jowl with British seafarers and be paid even worse slave wages, far below the national minimum wage; that happens. Unfortunately, I have been on such a ship. I learnt the details of the Filipino crew. My wife and I were astonished and appalled.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000109"></a>Your Lordships will note that I have used the words &#147;British territorial waters&#148; not &#147;internal waters&#148; which, as my noble friend said, is in the guide issued by the DTI, which I imagine is now part of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. The guide issued by the Government through that ministry is completely fabricated. It says that workers, to get the minimum wage, have to work within the &#147;internal waters&#148;. Where do they get &#147;internal waters&#148; from? It is a fantasy&#151;a nightmare concocted by the DTI.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000110"></a>The words &#147;internal waters&#148; are used when Parliament means to limit the application of its law, as in the Territorial Sea Act 1987. The national minimum wage does not refer to either territorial or internal waters. The normal principles of international law and the sea would suggest that the test is territorial waters, not internal waters. Just because someone happens to work on a ferry going to the Isle of Wight, and no further than that, that is used. It is a fabrication. The DTI has no authority, and no source to cite to say why they use the internal waters test. So the amendment uses territorial waters, which, as my noble friend said, is 12 nautical miles from the coast.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000111"></a>The national minimum wage should apply on British ships in British territorial waters. That is the first objective of the amendment. It is in line with the Disability Discrimination Act and other anti-discrimination Acts, which protect workers in their area of occupation within territorial waters, if not beyond in some cases.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000112"></a>The amendment faces a problem. It will be raised no doubt by lawyers and advisers to the Minister. It is a real problem, which is what worried me at first. We must understand that British law cannot be made applicable worldwide. You cannot do that; you are making law within your own jurisdiction. That was made clear by the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords in 2006 in the case of Lawson v Serco, usually referred to as the Serco case, especially by the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hoffmann, who in paragraphs 34 to 40 in the Industrial Relations Law Reports makes clear that the application of our law must be restricted to the area either within Britain or within British territorial waters or otherwise sufficiently strongly rooted in their relationship with the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000113"></a>I make a point here that the Employment Relations Act 1999 repealed what was a clear statutory provision in Section 196 of the Employment Rights Act, which limited the application of British law in that way. Most commentators have agreed that after that repeal, for reasons which totally eluded me then and are mysterious to me now, United Kingdom judges were left, as authors have agreed, in what might be called a void, to set their own limits to United Kingdom laws and prevent its application worldwide outside the United Kingdom. Lawson v Serco makes it clear that the connection with the United Kingdom must be very strong. But, if noble Lords read the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hoffmann, they will see at paragraph 38 that he says that a foreign correspondent permanently on the staff of a British newspaper, who is posted to

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000114"></a>The spirit of their Lordships&#146; judgment in the Serco case must mean that British seafarers on board British ships must be paid the national minimum wage. The same logic must surely mean that any seafarer on a ship flagged&#151;that is, registered&#151;in the UK must be paid the national minimum wage whilst working in British territorial waters.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000115"></a>This is where the new issue arises. A seafarer working on a British registered ship cannot be given worldwide rights but rights within British territorial waters. That is precisely the point raised by paragraph (b) of the amendment. Learned counsel&#146;s opinion faced up to the problem and made it clear that the national minimum wage should be calculated as a proportion of the time an individual is employed to work on board any ship at any time it is within United Kingdom territorial waters. The amendment proposes what logic suggested to learned counsel&#151;namely, that the national minimum wage should be applied proportionately to what is done on a British ship within British territorial waters and what is done outside.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000116"></a>That would be a new form of jurisprudence applicable in the national minimum wage area, but I ask the Committee to notice that the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, by being silent on its applicability&#151;unlike various other statutes&#151;invites the courts to make some sensible law which is in accord with the rules suggested in Lawson and Serco by your Lordships&#146; judicial committee in 2006.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000117"></a>As my noble friend has said, it has been reported that the Chamber of Shipping, the employers, threatens that any such amendment to slave wages for foreign seafarers will be met by industrial action by the owners and a massive flagging out&#151;the removal of the British flag from their ships&#151;so that they can put up some other convenient flag instead. Paying the national minimum wage in this way, they say&#151;and we must take account of this argument&#151;would remove their competitiveness. I do not believe that this threat of industrial action by the owners should be taken seriously. First, as my noble friend has said, they would lose their tax concessions, which are now quite substantial. I wonder whether they would take action in the face of that. Secondly, as a matter of principle, industrial action of that kind would infringe the balance of social justice and the flexibility of competitiveness to which our Government are already committed. They are also committed to the Commission&#146;s notion of &#147;flexicurity&#148;, which means flexibility for management in the competitiveness of the labour market and security for workers, as a balance in a modern social society.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000118"></a>Flexicurity is now the buzz word of European law and of employment lawyers in comparative work. I refer the Committee to the recent Green Paper from  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC276"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC276</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Commission on the modernisation of labour law and subsequent documents to that Green Paper. To avoid our domestic legislation having worldwide effect&#151;it will not have it anyway, but to avoid appearing to give it worldwide effect&#151;the amendment ingeniously drafts a line which would confine the national minimum wage to applications within British territorial waters, where the Royal Navy and the Inland Revenue can rule, but excludes hours worked in foreign parts by foreign seafarers while giving them, quite properly, the national minimum wage within our waters. This is a compromise&#151;one could have gone much further&#151;fully in keeping with your Lordships&#146; Judicial Committee in the Serco case. Indeed, it is arguably less favourable to seafarers, especially foreign seafarers, in certain respects.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000119"></a>I am not criticising the amendment but adding my voice for the Government to use this debate to consider carefully for Report whether they will not give us something like this to achieve greater justice for seafarers, both in our waters and on British ships, in relation to the national minimum wage.</p>

Rather like the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, when I first read this I found some difficulty with the concept of how it would operate. However, a good case has been made in one respect: if employers register their ships in the United Kingdom, with all the advantages that come from that, I find it difficult to argue why they should not have to observe the obligations that come with it.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000121"></a>I have difficulty with the second aspect of the amendment. I have listened carefully to the tour de force of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, through the opinions of the members of the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, but I find it difficult to understand the practicalities. When a ship registered in Belize, let us say, takes on employees, mariners, and negotiations take place in regard to their salary for the year, month, two months or for however long they are taken on, is it suggested that when that ship arrives at Liverpool to take on or deposit containers and spends two days in port, inspectors from the appropriate government body will come on board and say, &#147;What are you paying your staff? You are here for two days; therefore two-365ths of the income of your staff has to move up to the minimum wage&#148;. Is that what is suggested? If so, have the proponents of the amendment carried out an estimate of the cost of enforcement?</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000122"></a>I take the point that we should not give in to threats from the owners of ships registered in Belize&#151;I do not know why I picked Belize&#151;of strike action or withdrawing their services from UK ports, but I worry about the practicalities. When the Government consider this between the Committee stage and Report&#151;clearly a number of the Minister&#146;s noble friends are not going to leave this alone and will come back to it on Report&#151;the practicalities of that second aspect need to be looked at.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000124"></a>The amendment would extend the application of the national minimum wage dramatically and entirely inappropriately. Proposed new paragraph (a) would extend its application to all sailors employed on a UK-registered ship. Such a measure is the equivalent of insisting that every UK company with a factory or office abroad must employ local workers at above the minimum wage regardless of the differences in local wage rates or costs of living. Perhaps I may ask the noble Baroness why the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, has decided that only UK shipping cannot take advantage of the widely differing labour costs around the world. It cannot be the close proximity of workers on different wages. There are many corporate offices where expatriates are paid on a different scale to those hired locally despite doing jobs of a similar nature or status. Does he then intend to table amendments on Report including, for example, UK manufacturing firms as well?</p>

Perhaps I may intervene. Does she think that in the eyes of our law there should be any floor to what foreign seafarers in our waters can be paid? Does she think that they can be paid slave wages?

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000127"></a>Foreign seafarers working on UK-registered ships are, as noble Lords know, already protected by the Race Relations Act. This ensures that they are paid a fair wage related to the cost of living in their home country. Under this Act, foreign sailors frequently earn wages which, although below the national minimum wage in the UK, are on a par with highly trained professionals at home. Of course, while on board ship, they enjoy exactly the same standards as UK sailors, subject to all the protections of UK employment law.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000128"></a>Proposed new paragraph (a) in the amendment would not only provide much meaningful benefit for foreign sailors but would inflict a terrible cost on the UK shipping industry. The Chamber of Shipping estimates that as many as 300 UK-registered ships would be put at risk by having to pay these above-market wages.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000129"></a>Proposed new paragraph (b) goes even further. Every ship, no matter where it is registered or what crew it is manned with, is to recalculate its wages for the time spent within UK territorial waters. Such a provision is simply not lawful. Each ship is subject to the employment law of its flag state. How could it be otherwise? How does the noble Lord suggest the UK would ensure that foreign companies pay their foreign sailors what he thinks they should?</p>

<p><a name="08031366000130"></a>Debate on the development of maritime policy is of course ongoing and is being participated in at many levels, both nationally and in Europe. All are agreed that any future steps need to be both considered and responsible, weighing any benefits against the possible impact on UK employment and competitiveness; and of course they must be feasible. I am afraid that the amendment is none of these.</p>

This is an empty threat because the Chamber of Shipping would have to take into account the substantial advantages that it has and whether it would be worth while losing those tax privileges. I do not think it would take such action. I will not give in to threats such as this.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000132"></a>The noble Baroness may object to the words &#147;slave labour&#148; but that is what it is. How can one justify people doing the same job on the same ship but being paid different rates of pay?</p>

<a name="80313-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000133"></a>I am very pleased that when my noble friend outlined the amendment she said that it should apply to territorial and not inland waters because it would not apply at all if that were the case. This is an anomaly that we should put right. I am sure that my noble friend who is to reply&#151;we are good friends&#151;will see that we are seeking justice in what we are putting forward.</p>

But I will not accept that people who are paid a wage twice or three times that which they would receive in their own countries because they happen to be under a British flag in territorial waters are slave labour.

On the basis of the brief she was given, the noble Baroness said that the Race Relations Act would apply to employment and terms and conditions on foreign ships outside the territorial waters of this country. I remember that there was an exemption excluding the Race Relations Act from foreign ships and from employment outside our territorial waters but I cannot remember, for which I apologise, whether or not that exclusion was in turn removed.</p>

I, too, hope that a clear document can be put in the Library by the Minister&#146;s advisers settling the issue of the extent of the anti-discrimination law.

A seafarer on a UK-registered ship anywhere in the world is entitled to the minimum wage unless his employment is wholly outside the United Kingdom or he is not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. The amendment would extend the scope of the minimum wage in a number of ways. It would make all workers on UK-registered ships eligible for the national minimum wage. That would include those who are not presently eligible became they work wholly outside the United Kingdom at all times as long as they are not ordinarily resident in the UK. An important point is that it would also catch all ships from wherever in the world travelling through UK territorial waters, regardless of their flag or origin.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000149"></a>If that was the intention of my noble friends in their amendment, I have two things to say in answer. First, the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, knocked the nail straight on the head by saying that that may be laudable for a traditional seafaring nation with fabulous values such as this country. But how we go about policing it, even if we were to spend a fortune of taxpayers&#146; money, is beyond me&#151;that might be for another debate. Secondly, it was never the intention of minimum wage legislation to extend the rights to employees who have no link with the United Kingdom, or never stay

Extending this legislation to all those working on UK-registered ships or foreign-flagged ships in UK territorial waters may mean that we capture employees who have nothing whatever to do with this country.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000150"></a>If the amendment was accepted, it would have damaging consequences for the UK&#146;s own merchant fleet. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, may well have been reading material from one lobbying organisation; I am quite prepared to listen to that in the same way as I, rightly, listen to that type of submission from the TUC or anybody else. Surely that is what this debate is about, and neither side should be criticised for it. When I was at the CBI, people often asked why our merchant fleet had diminished so much. The basic answer was the applicable taxation regime. Various tax concessions were then granted so that we could build up our merchant fleet one more time, which, for a nation of the maritime reputation that we have enjoyed in the world&#151;maritime activity is one way of extending our values around the world&#151;is excellent. The noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, was right that if companies wish to enjoy a more favourable tax regime from a country with these values, they have to accept the other side as well. In that respect, I can see where noble Lords are going.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000151"></a>I ask noble Lords to stop using the word &#147;slave&#148;. The wages that some companies under other flags pay are derisory and disgraceful but, just as I no longer like to hear words such as &#147;bosses&#148;, &#147;workers&#148; in industry, and all that stuff that comes from another age, so I no longer like to hear &#147;slave&#148;, which is an emotional word which does nothing to resolve this difficult situation.</p>

When he says &#147;in the United Kingdom&#148;, does he include ships within territorial waters? Why should a ship that is all the time in our territorial waters and simply goes to Cherbourg for new provisions because they are cheaper there not be part of &#147;in the United Kingdom&#148;? Let the Minister define &#147;in the United Kingdom&#148;. Humpty Dumpty said: &#147;The meaning of the word is what I choose it to mean&#151;no more and no less&#148;. My meaning is &#147;in the UK or in its territorial waters&#148;. Is that the Minister&#146;s?</p>

One of the risks of going straight down the path of telling every UK-flagged ship is that we will have flagging out, because they operate outside the United Kingdom. I accept that that is in one way similarly alarmist and we must not submit to that. But there would be an element of it, and we must understand what that would do. For instance, on a UK ship which currently pays more than the flags of others&#151;albeit perhaps not the minimum wage&#151;we would be consigning some of the workers to even lower wages and more disgraceful conditions. That would happen, be the people referred to earlier Portuguese or Filipino.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000154"></a>We must ensure that, in trying to deal with a difficult problem and enhance the promulgation of our employment values on ships, we do not end up consigning some people to an even worse employed existence. I am not saying for a moment that we should turn around and say that we should do nothing because they might flag out. I am merely saying that I would like a little work done on seeing where the risk lies and what we are talking about in terms of values, numbers and geographical operations. That would be worthy of a little work. That is probably bad news for the people behind me, but probably a good thing to do.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000155"></a>Before concluding, I shall deal with two or three specific points on one or two of the excellent issues raised. I found this debate extremely useful because I have learnt more about it from listening to Members of the Committee. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn asked, and asked again in his intervention, what I call the United Kingdom, what &#147;territorial waters&#148; are and what this amazing phrase &#147;internal waters&#148; is, which he rightly says seemed to arrive out of the ether at some point in drafting. The legislation was drawn in an attempt to capture those working in the United Kingdom. &#147;Internal waters&#148; are covered by the national minimum wage rules. They are all the waters and waterways on the landward side of a baseline from which territorial seas are measured. &#147;Internal waters&#148; means everything on the inside of the baseline of a territorial sea. It includes waterways such as rivers, canals and, sometimes, the waters within small bays.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000156"></a>There is,</p>
<ul><a name="08031366000198"></a>&#147;the right of innocent passage&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08031366000178"></a>through the territorial sea under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, or UNCLOS. All foreign vessels have no right of innocent passage within internal waters. The lack of a right to innocent passage is the key difference between internal waters and the territorial sea. UNCLOS sets the limits of the territorial sea. Article 3 says that every state has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles. Article 5 states that the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low water-line along the coast. So the baseline is on the other side of the gap between the low water-line on the coast and perhaps 12 miles out.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000157"></a>Internal waters as defined include, for the United Kingdom, the sea between the Scottish mainland and the Inner and Outer Hebrides, the Firth of Forth, the Humber, the Wash, the Thames Estuary, the Solent and the Bristol Channel. They do not include the waters between the mainland and the Scillies, Lundy, the Smalls, the Pentland Firth, the sea&#151;as my noble friend mentioned&#151;between the Shetlands and Scotland, or the sea between England and the Farne Islands. With slightly greater comprehensibility, nor do they include the sea between the mainland and the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, because they are not part of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000158"></a>Speaking personally, if I was employed on a ferry going between the United Kingdom mainland and the Outer Hebrides, I would find it difficult to

If there is one thing about the national minimum wage, as I said on a debate on another amendment, it is that it must be respected in all respects if it is going to work. There is some work to be done there.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000159"></a>To address the very important point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, about the Race Relations Act, I should say that I understand that the Department for Transport has consulted on proposed amendments to Section 9 of the Race Relations Act as amended, so it is considering the way forward. The Government are committed to amending Section 9 to bring it into line with European Community law on the freedom of movement of workers. The amendment to the Race Relations Act is different in that it comes within European requirements but it does not deal directly with the function of the minimum levels of pay because the National Minimum Wage Act is not a European issue. It is under consideration but we are not sure whether it affects the NMWA. That is a work in progress. I undertake to get back to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, with a more detailed answer. Perhaps we could meet to discuss it, which would be useful.</p>

Without prolonging matters now, it would be excellent if we could sit down with officials and the Minister to see where we are.</p>

<p><a name="08031366000165"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08031366000264"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> I assure the noble Lord and my noble friend that I will get back to them both with details of exactly which provision we are talking about. The more difficult issue is that at the moment we considering amending domestic legislation to achieve compatibility with European legislation and, at the same time, confusingly&#151;this might be my ignorant interpretation&#151;we are trying to deal with domestic legislation in the Race Relations Act applying to another piece of domestic legislation, the National Minimum Wage Act, under the umbrella of European law. That is how I see it, but I might be wrong. That consultation is taking place as we speak, and if my noble friend Lord Wedderburn joins in as well, perhaps I shall learn more about it and that can be shared.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000166"></a>Perhaps I can close by bringing the matter together. We have three competing issues. One is that the Government have worked so hard to get this great maritime nation flagged up again&#151;to get a critical mass of UK-flagged shipping&#151;achieved mainly by a more benevolent fiscal environment. It is absolutely right and proper that the values that have pertained in this country for so long now apply so that those benefits can also be shared to ensure fairness for those who work under those flags. That is right and I say to my noble friends who have raised that point on this amendment that there is work to be done to satisfy that wish.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000167"></a>Secondly, we have the issue where the National Minimum Wage Act was never designed to deal with someone who is not and has no intention of being operational in the United Kingdom or in territorial or inland waters, as defined. Within that it is very important to deal with this clear conflict between someone working on a ferry to Orkney and someone working on a ferry to Shetland. I undertake to do some work on that and return to your Lordships.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000168"></a>Thirdly, if this amendment goes through, how on earth will we actually apply this legislation to a foreign-flag ship, employing a completely foreign-flag crew and spending two days in Felixstowe five times a year? Whether that is fair is one issue; whether that is enforceable is debatable; and whether we can actually then get the owner up before the beak to ensure that he pays correctly, frankly, is probably impossible.</p>

I think that a meeting, or at least some correspondence between us, to try to get to the bottom of that would be very worth while. If that means that we have to start again from the beginning and start tearing up an understanding of territorial, internal and inland, so be it. I hope we do not have to. I hope that we can achieve some common sense in that. Let us work on that outside this Chamber. That does not mean I am suddenly saying that somebody who spends his entire life on a British-flag ship operating between Auckland and Sydney, and who frankly has no connection with this country at all, should shelter under a piece of legislation for which that was never intended.</p>

In some ways I found it very helpful; in other ways I was a bit disappointed. I am prepared to accept that this is a very complex situation. Indeed, I bring to the attention of Members of the Committee what the counsel said when drafting the amendment:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031366000195"></a>&#147;Plainly the suggested amendments contained within this document are intended to provide an indication of what might be done to address the concerns that arise ... and it may be that some form of standard method of calculation of entitlement would be necessary for non-UK ... ships who go in and out of UK waters&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031366000179"></a>However, she says in her opinion that this is &#147;not an insurmountable obstacle&#148;. She just thought it was possible to come to terms with that difficulty, which has been mentioned by a number of noble Lords who have spoken in the debate.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000172"></a>I am gratified to learn that the position of an individual employed on a ferry travelling between the mainland and the Shetlands, and the difference if he is travelling between Scotland and the Hebrides, is accepted as anomalous and needing some attention. I would be very happy to co-operate in further discussions if that is deemed necessary. I am sure that the RMT would be very happy to enter into discussions over these concerns&#151;I think most people who have spoken in the debate have accepted that there are legitimate concerns&#151;about the anomalies in the payment of the national minimum wage.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08031366000173"></a>I am sorry that the word &#147;slave&#148; gave rise to some objections, but to me and my noble friends some of the rates paid to individuals working on UK-registered ships when they were not resident seemed incredibly low. Even if they come from countries where they are not paid very much normally, their rates seem desperately low when compared with the people receiving the minimum wage for doing exactly the same job. The union has legitimate concerns about that. That is why it wanted the kind of text that we put before the Committee.</p>

I am gratified to learn that it is receiving consideration from the Government at the moment. I will look with interest at the text of the

I am grateful to all noble Lords who participated. I think it is accepted that the union has a case here. It may not be dealt with adequately in the wording we put forward, but there is an anomalous situation that the union has been trying to deal with for a number of years. It has the support of the TUC in attempting to get a more reasonable text. I hope that later on, perhaps in further discussion of the Bill, we shall arrive at a text that is suitable for everybody.

<p><a name="08031370000004"></a>Amendment No. 25 deals exclusively with what for many years have been referred to as outplacement agencies. Although these agencies may fall within the jurisdiction of the 1973 Act, they are in fact illegally offering services that are a reversal of the usual process by which employment agencies work to find candidates on behalf of employers seeking introductions. Instead, an outplacement agency sets out to act on behalf of a jobseeker, who will usually be at least in the middle management group or even a quite senior executive, and who, probably unexpectedly, has found himself either redundant or subject to job loss during his mid-career years. Not unnaturally, any such manager or executive finding himself jobless is faced with very serious challenges potentially affecting the continuity of the whole way of life, not only of himself but also of other members of his family. Can he continue his

Can he pay the mortgage? Can he afford health insurance and so on? To this group of individuals an outplacement operation can seem very attractive as a potential shortcut to finding good new employment opportunities, and individuals may welcome the support of an agency seeking on their behalf to provide an introduction.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80313-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000005"></a>There is nothing new about outplacement agencies. They appear to have been operating on these lines for more than 30 years, so the department is quite correct, as the Minister&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Bach&#151;asserted in an earlier debate, that they already fall under the terms of the 1973 Act. The practical records and experience, however, are that agencies have either been unaware of the workings of the Act or have wilfully chosen to ignore its jurisdiction and take fees directly from jobseekers in direct contravention of the law. My noble friend Lord James is unaware of any prosecutions for this ever being brought.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000006"></a>In days gone by, the leading agencies&#151;of which my noble friend has provided a list of names and addresses to the noble Lord, Lord Bach&#151;have been in the practice of charging very high fees for the straightforward functions of helping jobseekers and coaching them in good personal representation and so on. My noble friend has personal first-hand knowledge of instances where they have charged fees as high as &#163;2,000 per month to an individual, a fee which was justified in those cases by the agencies as covering a combination of services. These included the professional preparation and printing of a CV; coaching in physical presentation and grooming for an interview; coaching in body language control; access to a database purporting to cover a constantly updated register of all job vacancies available in the relevant sector; endless coffee and sympathy and the daily company of other jobseekers for mutual support; a permanent office base from which to plan job-seeking activity; and direct job opportunity identifications and introductions.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000007"></a>As a result of the huge pressures and distress caused to those experiencing redundancy, there is a constant risk that the services my noble friend has noted amount to a serious temptation to indulge in a lack of objective reality and open discussion with the members of the redundant person&#146;s family, who may have most to offer in supporting the quest for a solution. There is an old expression which we seem to hear less often these days but which seems appropriate here: that is to liken outplacement agencies to snake oil salesmen, the famous individuals who toured the mid-west of the USA a hundred or more years ago claiming they had a potion capable of curing any ailment.</p>

<p><a name="08031370000008"></a>My noble friend says he has personal, direct and very painful experience of a former colleague, aged 44, who fell into this trap. In one case, an individual received a package of &#163;20,000 when made redundant from the job that he thought secure for life. He then signed up with an outplacement operation at a cost of &#163;2,000 per month. He was able to keep going the  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC288"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>charade that he had a job simply by attending the agency&#146;s office, before his wife found out in month 8. At that point she left him on realising that he had already spent &#163;16,000 of the &#163;20,000 and was committed to spending the remaining &#163;4,000. When his remains were found in his garden shed&#151;he had been dead for three weeks&#151;he still had no job and all his family had gone.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000009"></a>Recent investigations have shown that outplacement agencies have significantly altered the methodology and structure of the services they now offer. They now concentrate on the provision of the elements listed above such as grooming, database access and interview technique coaching, for which my noble friend understands a normal package today would cost a one-off fee of about &#163;5,600. There is apparently substantial improvement on past practice but it still leaves a number of unresolved anxieties that the amendment is intended to address. First, the packages now generally exclude job-seeking opportunities for their clients, although there is good reason to believe that the practice continues in some cases. Secondly, the amendment states specifically that no charge can be made for the introduction of job opportunities, although the fees may concentrate on other useful elements to improve job hunting success. Thirdly, addressing a particular problem of past experience, a written contract should be provided from the beginning that will specifically state what services are to be provided and, particularly, the cost of any renewal or termination. Fourthly, recognising that the current Bill makes provision for breaches to be tried in High Court, thus effectively removing the cap on a penalty, the amendment provides that a penalty may be imposed for each separate breach made by an agency and not just for a generic breach of the Act as a whole.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000010"></a>The amendment will, in conjunction with the new Bill, ensure the removal of opportunities for abuse that may have become a matter of custom and practice by years of misunderstanding of the 1973 Act. It will not stop agencies offering the useful services that they can provide, but it will ensure that jobseekers in distress cannot be abused or misled about what precisely they are getting into.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000011"></a>My noble friend goes on to put the other side of the case. In one respect, he has nothing but admiration for the services provided by outplacement operators and nothing in the Bill or the amendment should be seen to interfere with that excellent work. He is referring to the valuable action when the outplacement agency works directly at the instigation of the company or body initiating the redundancy, where a positive effort is being made by a sympathetic former employer to help redundant staff in relocating themselves. Generally all the services he has noted are provided and there are notable examples of very high success being achieved.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000012"></a>My noble friend has had personal experience of three such successes. First, when the British Shoe Corporation, owned by the then Sears Group, was liquidated, it left behind a head office of 500 people who were mostly specialists in shoe design, international shoe purchasing, retailing, shop facia design and merchandising. It was not necessarily a promising  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC289"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC289</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prospect for 500 such specialist people to be relocated. The British Shoe Corporation engaged the services of one female consultant who, within three months, managed to place 492 of around 500 staff in perfectly good alternatives. My noble friend recalls that only those with severe medical problems or who needed to stay at home in a carer role for a relative were unsuccessful.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000013"></a>Secondly, when the Robinson Group was sold from its Northampton base to a Bradford firm, an outplacement exercise found jobs for 280 of 290 staff in the Northampton area, principally in manufacturing and shop floor activity.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000014"></a>Thirdly, my noble friend faced the prospect of 2,000 young people, all of whom had had the first employment of their lives at the Dome, becoming redundant on the same day, 31 December 2000, and succeeded in finding jobs for some 1,700 of them, again using the very skilled young woman who had distinguished herself in the British Shoe Corporation project. In that case, the critical factor was that the outplacement operation persuaded the key sponsors of the Dome to prioritise all job vacancies for redundant Dome employees, which led to a very big take-up of jobs in the travel and entertainment sectors and to retail opportunities with Boots and WHSmith. Although it is probably an overgeneralisation, my noble friend recalls that there were enough job opportunities to employ the whole 2,000. Noble Lords may wonder what happened to the 300 who did not take up available places. It seems that 150 of them were intent on marrying the other 150, so we hope they have lived happily ever after when everything else had gone.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000015"></a>It is to be hoped that every encouragement will be given to continuity of outplacement operations where the service is sold for an appropriate fee to employers. The Government would do well to take a positive initiative in encouraging any firm declaring a large number of redundancies to appoint appropriate consultants and to pay for that service before the problem is put entirely on the departing employees.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000016"></a>My noble friend asked the noble Lord, Lord Bach, for clarification of the tax and fiscal treatment of any fees so paid and it was passed on that HMRC will treat every case on its individual merits. My noble friend can only say that in all the cases he has handled the cost of outplacement purchase by the company has been tax deductible. A statement to that effect could add significant value to a push by the Government for a wider use amongst companies declaring redundancies.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000017"></a>That is what my noble friend Lord James wanted to say. I wish to comment on only one point. My noble friend mentioned agencies taking fees illegally. I recently heard a radio programme about what were called talent agencies, which all expected the so-called young future stars to come up with a fee before they would accept them on their register. As they were classified as talent agencies, no one was enforcing the employment law that states that people cannot be charged for registering to find a job. My noble friend has raised many issues here. I beg to move.</p>

I do not think anyone can doubt that it is right for her to call to the Minister&#146;s attention the vulnerability of those who unexpectedly find themselves unemployed. I am sure he will be sympathetic to that concern, given that much of the Bill seeks to increase the penalties on those who exploit vulnerable workers. I hope the Minister will make sure that if outplacement operations are indeed covered by the 1973 Act, the relevant provisions are implemented effectively and enforced vigorously.</p>

<p><a name="08031370000019"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08031370000070"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, for so eloquently reading out the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord James of Blackheath. It took me back a while when he listed the three successful outplacement exercises in which he was intimately involved. In the first&#151;the closure of the British Shoe Corporation, which was owned by Sears&#151;I was a lawyer on the other side. That was many years ago but my mind went back to that time.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord James, has submitted a list of a number of outplacement agencies where the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate is involved. Will the noble Baroness assure him that those agencies are being investigated? We will keep him informed of how that goes on.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000021"></a>I assure the noble Baronesses, Lady Wilcox and Lady Gardner, that any agency that takes fees for work-finding services from jobseekers commits a criminal offence. Training or advice on CVs, for instance, can be provided for a fee as long as they are not related to the work-finding service. The work-seeking services cannot be made conditional on the individual paying the fee; they have to be additional and transparent. Perhaps the noble Baroness would like to give me details of the talent agencies to which she referred. They merit investigation, and I shall do my best to ensure that it takes place.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000022"></a>The Government support the intention behind the amendments. It is essential that there are penalties strong enough to ensure that an effective deterrent is in place for those agencies which charge illegal fees for finding work. It is equally important that, where agencies are permitted to charge for other services, the charges are transparent to users, and that the agency workers who use those services should have clear information about the terms on which they can withdraw from such services and exactly that for which they are charged.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000023"></a>The amendment would increase the penalty for the offence of seeking or receiving fees for work-finding to a minimum fine of &#163;10,000 for each and every separate offence. It would also require contracts with agencies to provide particular services such as interview or curriculum vitae training to specify what is provided and the level of fee for terminations. We need to understand that two distinct things are being covered by one suggested amendment.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000024"></a>We acknowledge the keen interest that the noble Lord, Lord James, has taken in the operations of outplacement agencies in particular, but do not  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC291"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC291</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consider that the amendment is the best way to address those issues. That does not mean that we do not support the case for the latter part of the amendment; that is, the transparency and understanding of what is charged for and the terms on which people can withdraw.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000025"></a>The Government share the view implicit in the amendment that the current maximum penalty of &#163;5,000 is in some cases inadequate, especially where the agency in question is highly profitable. That is why Clause 14 makes provision for certain offences against the Employment Agencies Act 1973 to be triable either on indictment in the Crown Court or summarily by the magistrates&#146; court, as at present. These offences include that of seeking or receiving fees for work-finding services. They do not apply in the entertainment and modelling sectors, where agencies are allowed to charge in certain circumstances. That is the crux of the matter surrounding talent agencies, to which the noble Baroness referred. We will have to look at that again. Sometimes, agency fees there are important; sometimes, they will flout the law. The maximum penalty for cases tried in the Crown Court is an unlimited fine. It goes past the &#163;5,000 maximum. A minimum of &#163;10,000 would be irrelevant if it reached the Crown Court. It should be at the discretion of the court to determine the level of the fine; it should not be set in statute, with a base minimum. That is where we have problems with the amendment.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000026"></a>The Government consider that the most appropriate way of addressing serious offences of this nature is to ensure that they are tried in the Crown Court, where the penalties available are commensurate with the seriousness or frequency of the offence. There would then be no need for stating a fine in legislation. That is surely preferable to fettering the discretion of the magistrates&#146; court.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000027"></a>Once the Bill has become law, the most serious offences under the Employment Agencies Act will be tried on indictment in the Crown Court. It therefore follows that those offences tried in the magistrates&#146; court, while still serious, are not as extreme in terms of level of non-compliance or abuse of agency workers. To set a minimum fine of &#163;10,000 for any offence, as the amendment proposes, would be a most unusual step under English law. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord James, has never come across that in his former life; nor have I in mine.</p>
<h5><a name="08031370000067"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000028"></a>Most employment agencies are small businesses with only a handful of staff, and there are significant numbers of one-person businesses. There is a risk that imposing by statute a minimum fine of &#163;10,000 for each offence would drive many of those agencies straight out of business, even if they were guilty of one offence on one occasion. That is surely not the intention behind the amendment.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000029"></a>The Government&#146;s intention is not to put employment agencies out of business but, rather, to take steps to ensure that they are compliant with the law and create more employment. That has to be the underlying need for their existence. The Government therefore believe  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC292"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that it is more effective to ensure that the courts can decide on the most appropriate penalty on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the size of the agency, the frequency of offending and the scale of the misdemeanour. It is worth making the point that the minimum penalty under the amendment is precisely double the maximum penalty that magistrates&#146; courts in England and Wales can currently impose.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000030"></a>The amendment also proposes that any fee charged to a jobseeker by a person carrying on an employment agency, for the services specified in the amendment, should be subject to a contract specifying the services to be provided and the continuation fees or termination conditions. We do not believe that such a provision is necessary, as existing regulation already covers the charging of fees and sets out what they are for.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000031"></a>The amendment proposes that, where a jobseeker is to be charged fees, the agency and the jobseeker should agree a contract specifying any charge for access to a vacancy database, personal grooming, mock interviews, advice, preparation or circulation of a CV. But some of these services&#151;specifically access to a vacancy database and the circulation of a CV&#151;would almost certainly be work-finding services and charging for them is already a criminal offence. I do not think that we need the amendment merely to effect duplication. The other services listed in the amendment are also subject to regulation that currently endures to ensure that fees and conditions for charging those fees are transparent.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000032"></a>Regulation 13 of the conduct regulations already requires that on the first occasion that an employment agency offers to,</p>
<ul><a name="08031370000065"></a>&#147;arrange the provision of a service to a work-seeker&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08031370000050"></a>the agency or employment business must give notice in writing to the work-seeker, including a description of the service, the amount of the fee and the circumstances of any refund. Therefore, that provision already exists.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000033"></a>In addition, Regulation 3 of the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses (Amendment) Regulations 2007 provides that the work-seeker should be able to withdraw from the services provided by the agency at any time without incurring any detriment or penalty, subject to the notice periods specified in the regulations. Regulation 5 already makes it an offence for an agency to make the provision of work-finding services conditional on the worker using other services provided by the agency, so it is not allowed to do that either.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000034"></a>Both those provisions cover all other services provided by agencies, rather than, if I may respectfully say so, the somewhat narrow list covered by the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord James.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000035"></a>Although the proposal in the amendment that contracts for services for which fees are charged should specify the duration of the contract is not specifically covered in existing employment agency legislation, I do not believe that such a provision is necessary. As I have already mentioned, existing employment agency legislation already provides that the work-seeker must be able to withdraw from the

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08031370000036"></a>I thank the noble Baroness for raising this issue. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord James, for setting it out so eloquently. The spirit behind the second part of the amendment is something with which the Government concur, although that is not the case with regard to the first part and the minimum fine. However, I hope that the noble Baroness will be prepared to withdraw the amendment in the light of this response, because we submit that virtually everything that has been covered by it is already covered by current legislation.</p>

<p><a name="08031373000002"></a>The noble Baroness said: I must warn the Committee that there is another text here, which again I shall read. Amendment No. 26 is wholly concerned with the welfare and well-being of young people of both sexes who are engaged in short-term contracts at conference and sporting venues. In contrast to Amendment No. 25, which dealt with a severely troubled but relatively mature age group, Amendment No. 26 is concerned almost entirely with young people in the age range from 16 to their early 20s, where multiple recruitments are made, usually for short-term assignments, for a block booking of young people to work in conjunction with a one-off short-term requirement. Those requirements may be, and quite often are, for waitresses and table staff for restaurants and hospitality suites at major sporting events; sometimes kitchen staff, including porters for the movement of wine and drink supplies; car park attendants; and security staff. It is quite common for an agency to be asked to recruit 20 or multiples thereof in each of those categories. The jobs that they are offering are generally popular with young people, being in attractive locations, providing useful levels of pay and fitting in reasonably with college vacation times and so on. The need for closer scrutiny and tighter regulation here arises from changing social customs and circumstances, including, most particularly, the following.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08031373000003"></a>First, the colleges providing the substantial source of candidates for jobs will be those covering catering and other services, but with a particular concentration on young people in the 16-to-18 age category, given current school leaving-age rules. Secondly, the increased demands for security staff, kitchen porters and so on have tilted the market away from its long-time concentration on young women to a closer match between matching groups of young men and young women, all in this same age category.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08031373000004"></a>It is probably not a coincidence that, at least anecdotally, the worst stories of difficulties experienced by young women at sports events occur at golf tournaments, which generally engage a far higher proportion of young men compared to the mostly female catering staff at, for example, race meetings. The increasing use of alcohol and easier access to drugs have now introduced a greater hazard to the mixing of these groups in the relative freedom of the separate and self-contained accommodation facilities generally provided when a sports event is based, as is usually the case, far from the sources of recruitment at the colleges in and around the Home Counties and southern Midlands.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08031373000005"></a>The amendment recognises that certain controls on this area of recruitment were introduced by the regulations which received the consent of your Lordships&#146; House on 17 December 2007. While those new controls were welcome and well intentioned, my noble friend suggests that they would not have been approved in that particular form had your Lordships had access on 17 December to any detailed knowledge of certain events that were about to take place in the context of certain Christmas celebrations, and which have led to criminal allegations that remain under investigation and are therefore sub judice. That fact, however, does not mean that we should allow the Bill to proceed without shoring up a

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08031373000006"></a>In that context, without in any way seeking to touch upon the case currently under investigation, my noble friend suggests that the instrument of 17 December was seriously defective in the following major respects, which this second amendment now seeks to address. First, a duty of care must be imposed on the recruitment agency for the welfare of all staff subject to a block booking. Secondly, all staff so booked must, if under the age of 18, have the consent of a parent or guardian. Thirdly, a recruitment agency must provide a written statement of the terms of the engagement setting out remuneration, conditions of termination, arrangements for return transportation from the place where the employee was collected, and reciprocal expectation of reasonable and sober behaviour by the employee. Fourthly, staff must be able to terminate an engagement and obtain transport home if circumstances turn out to be uncongenial or represent a moral hazard. All that relates&#151;this is my own comment&#151;to the incident where young people were seriously at risk. That is the criminal case to which my noble friend refers, and which we have all read about in the press. I shall return to his text.</p>

<p><a name="08031373000007"></a>It must also be quite clear that no employee should be required to remain in any location to which he or she is sent in the event that they find the circumstances of the engagement uncongenial, as would be the case, say, in the event that he or she found themselves subjected to unreasonable peer-group pressure to participate in drinking, sexual or drug activity that was unwelcome. To that purpose, the amendment specifically seeks clarification about the terms on which an individual may terminate the engagement forthwith and be transported back to the point of origin, as well as an undertaking that full-time overseeing responsibility will be provided on site for the moral welfare of all young people so engaged.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08031373000008"></a>The regulations of 17 December and elements within the Bill identify specifically the special circumstances relating to young people in the theatrical and modelling industries. The special areas of sensitivity here are that this may substantially include the difficult area of auditioning or, as we have seen in a recent well publicised event, the block booking of large numbers of attractive young women to participate in a party function for which, while they would have a natural attraction to attend, they would also be receiving a fee.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08031373000009"></a>There are particular hazards here. The candidates may be so eager to attend where pop stars or other similar personalities are involved that they are actually prepared to pay for their ticket to attend, which may open the prospect that the individual member of the recruiting agency doing the selection may offer them the job in return for, say, half their fee of perhaps &#163;100. Individuals, particularly young females, need to have it made quite clear what their role at the party will be. The old clich&#233; of the casting couch may no longer be as dangerous as in days gone by, but there are similar hazards in the thank-you party, meant to be for financial backers of a production where the producers wish to express their thanks for the financial

Willingness to provide sexual services at such gatherings may be seen as the modem equivalent of a casting couch and be feared as a possible precondition for exclusion at future audition lists.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08031373000010"></a>Amendment No. 25 was clearly concerned with middle management and junior executives who should at least be in their mature, mid-career years. In contrast, the thrust of Amendment No. 26 is aimed at very much younger people from 16 to their early 20s. It may therefore be thought that the thrust of Amendment No. 26 is concerned exclusively with young women, but my noble friend assures the Committee that there is equal concern for the moral welfare and protection of young men, due to the exceptional pressures and temptations that can be placed on them, particularly since there has been a marked increase during recent years in the number of young men being recruited for short-term assignments at sporting events to act variously as kitchen porters, car park attendants, safety stewards and field marshals, mostly at golf events. These young people are also predominantly in the age category of 16 to 18, and can be subject to very unpleasant and inappropriate pressures. In much the same way as the young women, they need the presence of an official supervisor for all young people on site at sporting events.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08031373000011"></a>Had that reasonable requirement been in place in recent years, it is most unlikely that the body of a kitchen porter would have surfaced during autumn rains from its burial place in car park 2 at Royal Ascot, where he had been buried by two other young porters whom he had refused to help in the significant robbery of liquor stores. Had he had an identifiable responsible person to whom he could turn, he might still be alive and the other two porters might not now be facing the best years of their life in jail. Consequently, my noble friend urges on the Committee that each category of employees that he has reflected for these amendments requires that that duty of care be firmly and clearly written into the law to ensure that employers and agencies recognise and conduct all necessary action to ensure the safety and moral welfare of all personnel concerned. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000002"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08031378000160"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I offer a brief word of support for my noble friend in moving the amendment on behalf of our mutual noble friend Lord James. We have a great deal of sympathy for their concern about young people employed in this sort of work. Obviously, for a great many young people of this sort, whether they are at university or whatever, short-term flexible employment is a godsend. It is a marvellous way of earning money in the holidays. However, there obviously has to be a degree of protection for them, particularly in the sorts of cases that my noble friend cites. We therefore very much look forward to hearing from the Minister what the Government feel about the ideas behind the amendment. My noble friend might then want to take it further at a later stage.</p>

My mind turned to the history of British employment protection legislation, beginning with the chimney sweeps in 1803 and going on to the Factories Acts of the 1830s and later, which especially provided protection for young women whose hair got entangled in the new machinery into which industrial society had moved. In a sense, her examples are a historical postscript to that era in our own times, when workers, especially young workers, have the benefit of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act and volumes of regulations which exist but do not cover many of the situations which the noble Baroness described.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000004"></a>However, I should be grateful if the noble Baroness could deal with one question in her response to the debate. In speaking about certain aspects, she said that no employee can be allowed to remain in a certain place. I looked again at proposed new subsection (4)(d) in the amendment, which speaks of,</p>
<ul><a name="08031378000143"></a>&#147;adequate and secure transport back to the place from which the employee was collected&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031378000124"></a>The noble Baroness will remember that when, in a previous Grand Committee sitting, we moved amendments from this side of the Committee concerning agency workers, we proposed that the notion of an agency worker becoming an employee of the user should become a standard presumption, certainly in any fixed employment agency relations. In her response, can she say who is the employer when she talks of the employee? Is she saying that the agency becomes an employer? That would normally be rejected in the contract that the agency makes with the worker. Does she accept in these amendments the still rather general notion that the presumption should be that the worker becomes an employee, in legal terms, of the end user who becomes, in legal terms, the employer? In that sense, the amendment would support the approach that we suggested in earlier sittings should be general in our law.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000005"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08031378000162"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> Without doubt, the Government support the intention behind the amendment. It is essential that there is appropriate protection for vulnerable agency workers. However, existing employment agency legislation already covers most&#151;not all&#151;of the proposals in the amendment. It seeks to provide a proper balance between the interests of agency workers, the companies that hire them and the agencies themselves. Regulation 20(b) of the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003&#151;otherwise known as the conduct regulations&#151;already requires the employment agency to make all reasonable practical inquiries prior to the placement to ensure that it would not be detrimental to the interests of the work-seeker to work in the position offered by the hirer. Indeed, that is the case for all placements, not just where a number of staff will work on a single contract.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000006"></a>I assure noble Lords that the Employment Agencies Act already prohibits employment agencies requesting or receiving fees for work-finding services&#151;with a few exceptions, as we discussed earlier. The provision is therefore unnecessary. Regulation 14 of the conduct regulations already requires agencies and employment  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC298"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>businesses to agree terms with the work-seeker, including terms of remuneration and conditions of termination.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000007"></a>The amendment proposes that the employment agency should provide the agency worker with terms setting out arrangements for transportation back to the place from which the employee was collected, and that it should provide adequate and secure transport back to the place from which the worker was collected. However, Regulation 24(4) of the conduct regulations already provides that the employment agency must arrange free travel or pay for the return journey at the end of the work assignment where the agency or employment business has arranged free travel or payment of fares for the worker to the place of work.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000008"></a>The proposal that the employment agency should provide arrangements to ensure that illicit substances are excluded from the place of work and from any staff accommodation duplicates existing legislation on illicit substances and is therefore unnecessary. Comprehensive legislation prohibiting certain substances is already in place. It would not be appropriate to replicate it in employment legislation or impose such a duty on an agency.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000009"></a>I turn now to the aspects of the amendment which are not covered by existing employment agency legislation. There is no specific provision regarding expectations of sober and reasonable behaviour of the employee. The term &#147;reasonable behaviour&#148; is not defined in the amendment, perhaps because the noble Lord, Lord Jones, understands how difficult it would be to do so. In any event, agency workers&#146; assignments can be ended for any reason at any time, and they do not have access to unfair dismissal procedures. It is therefore unnecessary to add such provision to the Bill.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000010"></a>The amendment also proposes 24-hour supervision of every place where agency staff are accommodated and where a number of temporary workers are engaged on the same assignment. Agencies are already required to make all reasonable practical inquiries to ensure that it would not be detrimental to the interests of the work-seeker to work in the position offered by the hirer. Any extension of that would be impractical, excessively burdensome and probably unenforceable. In considering any new legislative burden, the Government must take carefully into consideration its impact on those affected, particularly small businesses. Most employment agencies are small businesses. The cost burden on agencies of 24-hour supervision would mean that this kind of bulk assignment would be uneconomic to most and would therefore force up the cost of supplying agency workers. It would not be in anyone&#146;s best interests.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000011"></a>In practical terms, the provision would mean the agency supervising the accommodation premises during periods when it was empty&#151;that is, during work hours. The costs would be considerable, especially where the accommodation was located some way from where the agency was based. I have seen no evidence to suggest that the scale of the issue, balanced against the excessive burdens that such a measure would impose, justifies such a measure. In fact, the burden of enforcing such legislation could

That is where resources should go.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000012"></a>I turn to the proposal for parental consent. Under Regulations 24(7) and (8) of the conduct regulations, parental consent is required for individuals under the age of 18 where an assignment requires them to live away from home. The intention behind this legislative measure is clear. However, the amendment goes further by requiring parental consent for all assignments employing individuals under the age of 18 where a number of temporary workers are engaged on the same assignment. Where young people cannot get such consent from their parents, I presume that they would be precluded from taking up work. If that is what the amendment means, perhaps I may ask what one does with people under the age of 18 who are married. Do they still have to go and ask Mum and Dad? What about those for whom access to parents is impossible? We have to get young people into work and use the agency worker&#146;s environment to introduce them to the world of work, not preclude them from taking up work because they do not want to ask their parents. The Government do not agree that there is a need for this extension. It would only add to the cost of employing young people and reduce opportunities&#151;and it would act against the people whom we are trying to help.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000013"></a>It is interesting that the noble Lord, Lord James&#151;the author of the Conservative Party&#146;s opus on getting rid of red tape&#151;is submitting an amendment that would add to the mountain of red tape in this area. I thank the noble Baroness for raising the issue. I hope that, having listened to this response, she will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I am not sure exactly what my noble friend Lord James intended &#147;employee&#148; to mean. I accept the noble Lord&#146;s view that the employer is the person, not the agency. The agency is just the middleman. The relationship is between the employee and the person who is the &#147;end user&#148;, as he expressed it. I will accept that, and I imagine that my noble friend will also.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000015"></a>We hear all the time about young people who have problems, although some young people love a wild occasion and nothing worries them. I think that my noble friend was concerned about a young person who, as part of a group, goes to a place that he believes will be perfectly harmless but finds himself miles from where he started, is stuck and is unable to get out of the situation. In other words, he is faced with a situation that he never imagined he would have to face. I am sure that that was my noble friend&#146;s motivation. His real concern is about the duty of  care.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000016"></a>I thought that the Minister made very practical points about how to get parental consent. Everyone now worries that parents have no control over their children. That really is worrying. I understand the difficulties that people have with the practicalities, but

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000017"></a>I thought that the Minister&#146;s concerns about the statutory instrument passed in December were very interesting. This matter should certainly be looked at and, if it is found that there are deficiencies in it, as he believes there are, then they should be looked at. The Bill would provide an opportunity to remedy any defect in that instrument.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000018"></a>I am very grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments, which my noble friend Lord James will be able to read in great detail.

</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031378000138"></a>On expulsion from membership of a trade union a proper balance shall be struck between rights of association of the trade union granted under the European Convention on Human Rights and those of the member on the facts and circumstances of the case.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000022"></a>The noble Lord said: I am afraid that I do not have a prepared speech for your Lordships; I have only some notes. The basic position is that the amendment safeguards the interests of the rank and file trades union membership as concerns expulsion and exclusion by reflecting in our domestic law the procedure as ordained by the Strasbourg court in the case of ASLEF on implementation of Article 11 of the convention. The amendment ensures compatibility with our domestic law.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000023"></a>ASLEF was a judge-made decision on procedure, which was, and is, opposed by the trade union movement. As will become apparent, the trade union movement wishes to retain procedures other than those laid down in ASLEF. Therefore, the question of compatibility with this aspect&#151;it is now an established aspect of administrative law&#151;is crucial.</p>
<h5><a name="08031378000155"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000024"></a>Apart from reflecting in our domestic law, in simple English, the essence of the court&#146;s reasoning in ASLEF to afford this compatibility with Article 11, this matter is relevant to the questions of why Clause 17 was drafted under option A; why it was redrafted under option B; and whether in due course&#151;but not to be referred to at any length in this speech&#151;Clause 17 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000025"></a>The amendment ordains a simple, straightforward, flexible approach to the proportionate balance that has to be struck. This lies at the root of the decision in ASLEF. It is the balance between the freedoms of the trade union and those of the individual member in relation to expulsion and exclusion, which must  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC301"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC301</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>always be decided on the facts and circumstances of each case. Therefore it is a wholly flexible disposition that was ordained by the court at Strasbourg.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000026"></a>The court also decided that Section 174 of the 1992 Act and related provisions&#151; the details of which I shall not go into&#151;were not compatible with the convention. The object of this amendment is to ensure compatibility and, by affording compatibility, to enable our tribunals and domestic courts to take account of the decision in ASLEF in the context of expulsion and exclusion. This would put a stop on the need to make another application to the Strasbourg court. The previous application was necessary only because our own domestic law was not in accordance with its views. Therefore, when we have compatibility, and if the amendment is accepted, the tribunals and the courts will be able to apply the law, which is now part of our law, without any need to make an application to the court at Strasbourg.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000027"></a>It is not known exactly why the trade union movement opposed the application of ASLEF, which is a small, independent, craft union. It made an application to the court to set aside the decision of an employment tribunal to expel a member on the primary ground that his membership of the British National Party, a political party, was unlawful and that his conduct as a member, which I need not go into&#151;he dressed up as a priest and made some anti-Islamic remarks&#151;brought the union into disrepute.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000028"></a>An impression could be gathered on the question of why the trade union movement opposed the application of a small, independent, craft union. We come back to where I started. This is in the interests of the rank and file membership of the unions, so why did the trade union movement oppose it? The impression is gained from the Library Notes, and reflected in Amendment No. 27, which we will look at later on, that it could have been to seek judicial approval for collective domination of authority to expel, under extant trade union procedures, for breach of the rulebook and to protect values, ideals and objectives so that they remain compatible with trade union policy.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000029"></a>I cannot think of any other reason why the trade union movement would ask the Government to do this. You only have to look at the parties to the proceedings: ASLEF, a small craft union, applies and is opposed by the Government and a series of the big unions. I cannot think of a reason other than the one hinted at in the Library Notes and the one that I have given. If there is another reason, I should be interested to hear what it was or is now.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000030"></a>This is a terribly important point. I will not go into the details but, as some Members of the Committee know, for many years I have been involved in these matters and in the rights of the rank and file trade union movement. In a way, this returns again in a wholly different context, but it is there. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000032"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, agrees that we must bring our law into conformity with the judgment of the court at Strasbourg, especially in regard to paragraphs 37 to 44, that is surely the point before us as legislators. I hasten to add that the Government would be wise to relax their stern approach to that implementation, but that is another issue which I suspect does not arise from the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

On this issue it looks as though the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, and I, who have opposed each other over the years in all courts up to the Appellate Committee, are not so far apart on where the interests of the rank and file of the trade union movement lie. The Committee will be glad that there is not much more to hear because this is a matter of fundamental principle that will have to be resolved by the House on Report. One has to accept that the Strasbourg court granted the application on the grounds of the facts and circumstances of the case: that there was no hint of error in the expulsion procedures of the Union. It decided, in terms, that the employment tribunal was in violation of Article 11&#151;why?&#151;because no proper balance had been struck between the freedoms of the trade unions and those of the members.</p>

That will still retain a distorted, loaded balance in favour of the trade union movement against the individual rights of the membership. In those circumstances, if this amendment were to commend itself to the Committee, or in due course to the House, clearly Clause 17 would be otiose because the essence of the freedom of the balance that has to be struck is put in simple English in the form of this amendment.

<p><a name="08031378000036"></a>Everyone would agree that there is an obligation on the United Kingdom to comply with the judgment of the Strasbourg court in the ASLEF case. Article 46 of the convention says that we have an obligation to abide by the judgments of the court. Therefore, the question is simply: how do we do that? To comply with the judgment there has to be amending legislation. The Government are perfectly right to

The Human Rights Act already obliges every tribunal and court in interpreting legislation to act in a way that is in accordance with the right to freedom of association in Article 11 of the convention. It already obliges every court and tribunal to strike a fair balance in the way that this amendment suggests.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000037"></a>The problems about this amendment are as follows. First, it does not deal with exclusion but with expulsion only. Whereas the noble Lord referred to both, quite rightly, the amendment does not deal with exclusion. Secondly, it does not satisfy the Strasbourg principle of legal certainty; it does not begin to answer the question but simply leaves it open. Thirdly, it would lead to unnecessary litigation, by the BNP in particular, both in our courts and in Strasbourg. <I>Harvey</I><I></I><I>on Industrial Relations and Employment Law</I> summarises the mischievous way in which the BNP exploits every loophole that it can.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000038"></a>Therefore, although I have sympathy with the objective of the amendment, I say with regret that it does not begin to fulfil its aims. That is why I will be suggesting other approaches when we come to the amendment I have tabled and to clause stand part.</p>

I shall not weary your Lordships by replying to every point that was made because I shall be dealing with them in due course. The noble Lord said that I leave the question open, but it is an open question. That is the whole essence of it. It has to be dealt with on a balance of the facts in each case. That is the fundamental question. I shall come back to the details later. I apologise again for having intervened.</p>

When the European Court of Human Rights considered the matter it took into account the balance between the individual and the union when reaching its judgment. That is important. It found that our legislation does not meet what was required and needs to be amended. That is the real issue. I am grateful to the noble Lord for bringing this to our attention.</p>

There is also option C, which was put forward by my noble friend Lord Campbell, to strike out the clause on the basis that there is no obligation to follow the decision of the European Court of Human Rights because the judgment is not binding.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000042"></a>We want to hear the Minister&#146;s response to my noble friend&#146;s amendment. We will then want to listen to what the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has to say about his amendment in which he puts forward what is, in effect, option B. Obviously at a later stage the House will have to make a decision about the correct approach.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000043"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08031378000171"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, has tabled this amendment in order to stimulate the general debate about Clause 17 and the European judgment that underpins it, to which the noble Lord, Lord Henley, has just referred. I shall therefore start the proceedings on behalf of the Government by discussing the rationale and the principles behind the whole of Clause 17.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000044"></a>I remind noble Lords that we considered these issues recently during the passage of the Employment Relations Bill in 2004. As a result, the House agreed significant amendments to Sections 174 and 176 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. Those changes made it clear that it was lawful for trades unions to exclude or expel individuals on the grounds of their political party activities. At that time, we thought we had struck the right balance between the relevant rights within the European Convention on Human Rights. We were wrong in that assessment, as the judgment by the European Court of Human Rights in the ASLEF v UK case has since shown. In essence, the court believes that British unions should be freer than now to exclude and expel on the grounds not of political party activity, which we thought we had covered, but of political party membership alone.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000045"></a>The amendment refers to the need to balance conflicting rights. That, of course, is exactly what the European Court of Human Rights was asked to determine. It unequivocally stated that our law currently struck the wrong balance between the rights of a union and those of a member expelled on grounds of membership of the BNP. The court held that greater weight should be accorded to the rights of the union and its members to determine their own admission rules.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000046"></a>As we know, this judgment arose from the decision by ASLEF to expel Mr Lee, a BNP member. In examining the human rights issues in this case, the European Court paid due consideration to,</p>
<ul><a name="08031378000144"></a>&#147;the importance of safeguarding ... individual rights&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031378000125"></a>However, in paragraph 50 of the judgment, the court stated that it was,</p>
<ul><a name="08031378000145"></a>&#147;not persuaded ... that the measure of expulsion impinged in any significant way on Mr Lee&#146;s exercise of freedom of expression or his lawful political activities. Nor is it apparent that Mr Lee suffered any particular detriment, save loss of membership itself in the union&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000047"></a>In this country, employment is not contingent on union membership. Also, collective agreements cover both union and non-union members alike, so the possession of a union card does not affect pay or other terms and conditions of employment in the UK. The European judgment is clear: there are no ifs or buts. We are therefore obliged to make the consequential changes to our law, and that is what Clause 17 seeks to do.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC305"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC305</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000048"></a>Further, the amendment would create legal uncertainty. It is not clear who should strike the balance to which it refers. Is it the union or the courts or is it both? The amendment is not linked to any other provision in trade union law, so it is far from clear what the enforcement mechanism or the sanctions are. The amendment refers to &#147;expulsion&#148; alone; it therefore does not deal with the issue of &#147;exclusion&#148;.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000049"></a>In addition, the amendment would change the way that our law interacts with the European Convention on Human Rights. At the moment, the Human Rights Act 1998 provides for the incorporation of the European convention into our legal framework. It would represent a major departure to introduce this additional reference to the European convention&#151;and just one of the rights under that convention&#151;within employment law. I see no case for doing so.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000050"></a>Before I close, perhaps I may deal with two specific points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. First, he asked why the trade union movement opposed ASLEF&#146;s application to the European Court of Human Rights. Factually, it did not oppose it. In fact, some unions gave financial support to ASLEF in making the complaint to the European court.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000051"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord asked what the other option was on which we consulted and why we rejected it. The other option was to permit exclusion or expulsion for membership of a political party, provided that such membership was incompatible with the union rules or an objective of the union and the union&#146;s decision to expel or exclude was taken in accordance with the proper procedure of the union&#146;s rules.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000052"></a>The Government rejected that option because it would needlessly complicate the law and would lead to greater uncertainty. Also the option contained a redundant element because the acts of a trade union are always open to challenge if they conflict with the union&#146;s own rules. Given the absolute lack of evidence for this threat of abuse, this would be a clear instance of unnecessary over-regulation. The option may also produce some unfortunate side-effects, including the opportunity for vexatious litigation by politically motivated extremists.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000053"></a>I am perfectly aware that this is just the beginning of a detailed debate on the whole of Clause 17, with its many aspects. At this point I ask the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, to withdraw his amendment. I respect where he is taking us and I know that this matter will be discussed for some time to come.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000054"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08031378000172"></a>Lord Campbell of Alloway:</b> I am obliged to all noble Lords who have spoken, including the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. I am afraid I am not able to withdraw the amendment. Without going into a form of argument with the Minister, I cannot accept his explanation about why this application by ASLEF was opposed. That is not a crucial matter but it may be a very important matter when one has to consider why the Government went for option A, then for option B, and now they are still at it. Why? The two

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000061"></a>The noble Lord said: At Second Reading, I made a very full speech and I do not intend to repeat it all because all Members of the Committee are as capable as I am of reading. I thank Ministers and officials of the TUC. I have met Ministers and TUC officials to discuss the issue. I am extremely grateful to them. Being an optimist by nature, I also very much hope that by the time we reach Report it may be possible to secure an agreement on all sides of the House on a sensible way forward.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000062"></a>I now have the perfectly ghastly task of trying to explain&#151;so that I understand because if I understand maybe others will&#151;the situation we are in as regards the context of Clause 17. When the Conservative Government were in power, an amendment was moved to amend the trade union legislation, and it was supported by both main parties. At the time, it was supported by the right honourable Frank Dobson, not because of anything to do with the BNP, but because of communists. During the debates Frank Dobson said that there had been a bleak period in trade union history&#151;post-war and pre-war&#151;when communists were debarred from membership of trade unions or from holding office in trade unions and, therefore, there was a bi-party agreement about the necessity to give protection. That was part and parcel of the wider protection connected with the closed shop. As a result, protective provisions were put in, not only dealing with the closed shop and its abuse, but also giving rights to individuals not to be excluded or expelled from a trade union unless the exclusion or expulsion was permitted by Section 174 of the 1993 Act. As the Minister said, a distinction was drawn

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000063"></a>The Government put forward an admirable consultation document, which I dealt with in detail at Second Reading when I explained why it seemed to me that some safeguards are needed that are compatible with the convention and in the best tradition of the trades union movement. At the time, I was glad that the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Handsworth, that most experienced senior trade union official who also has reasons for understanding the need to protect people against oppression, supported me and even went so far as to describe Clause 17 as it stands as barking mad. I could never find that language, but I understood what he was saying.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000064"></a>In my amendment I have sought to do the minimum, not the maximum, that can be done to strike a fair balance between the conflicting rights and interests of trades unions on the one hand and individual members on the other. I could have gone wider, and in one formulation, I did go wider. However, I have cut it down as far as I can to try to get a clear dividing line. Having read and reread the judgment of the European court&#151;which I shall certainly not read now because it was read at Second Reading&#151;I have said that the way in which a union can lawfully exclude or expel is by making sure that its rules and objectives, say in relation to the BNP, are incompatible with being a member of that party. The Minister was kind enough to indicate in his speech, I think at Second Reading, that most unions have already amended their rule books, or will do so in order to ensure that. The first thing is to get the rule book in order so that it is clear that Nazi party activity and membership are incompatible with the ideals of the trade union.</p>

If it is to be a serious contribution, will the noble Lord provide us on Report with information about how the books were changed, when they were changed and what they state? I accept what the noble Lord says, but I have to know the details.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000066"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0007.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08031378000178"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> I do not think that the noble Lord understands what I am trying to say. It is my fault, I am sure. What I am saying is that unions are autonomous organisations. They have very important autonomy and independence. It is very important that that is respected. What they do with their rule book is a matter for them and their members. It is not the business of government to intervene and tell them what to put in their rule books. If they want the privilege of excluding people on the basis of mere membership of a political party, that obviously is a serious matter.</p>

The Government talk about mainstream parties. I hope they regard my party as mainstream, but I am not sure whether they regard the Green Party or some new party as mainstream, so one has to be a bit careful about dealing only with what is called mainstream.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000068"></a>Let me take the easy position of the BNP because no one here would have much sympathy for it. Suppose the trade union movement considers that the BNP is so obnoxious in its practices, such as those that were indulged in in relation to Lee, for example, that it wished to have protection and to exclude or expel solely on the ground of membership of that party. My amendment would require it&#151;Members of the Committee may not think this is sufficient but I think it is just about sufficient&#151;first, to have a rule book in order, with which it will comply in deciding to exclude or expel. If it does not want to do that it does not have to, but if it does not, it will not have the protection of the law. Secondly, the exclusion or expulsion should not prejudice the individual&#146;s livelihood or conditions of employment.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000069"></a>The Minister has pointed out that we no longer have the closed shop. That is absolutely true, and thank goodness it is. However, the Minister as a former employer&#151;organisation representative&#151;will know that it is possible for unions to put pressure on employers to act in a particular way that will adversely affect the livelihood of the individual. The other safeguard that I have written in is that that abuse should not be capable of happening. Provided a union keeps its own house in order with its own rule book, applies the rule book properly, and does not go to an employer through the back door, saying, &#147;This chap is a fascist so sack him&#148;, it would be acting lawfully under my amendment. If we do not have my amendment&#151;</p>

I will then certainly sit down. If one does not have my amendment and just leaves it to the government position, what then would be the position? Or suppose one takes the position that is being advocated when we say that Clause 17 should not stand part? Let us just inspect those alternatives. If one said that Clause 17 should not stand part, the inevitable consequence would be that we would be in breach of the judgment in the ASLEF case. That is why we must have Clause 17 in some form.</p>

In fairness, I have to try to explain this first, and then I can be shot down. If on the other hand, we have Clause 17 as it stands, with no safeguards, the only safeguard would be the safeguards at common law. I promise everybody here that the BNP, which specialises in milking for damages in claims of this kind, would go before the courts here and in Strasbourg. My object is to minimise the risk of litigation and maximise the certainty of the law.</p>

He proceeded on to another point. First, I want to say to him that my spirit is with the beginning of his amendment. Let us look at the amendment and ask him a question. Paragraph (a) of proposed new subsection (4C) is precisely in terms of paragraph 39 and subsequent paragraphs of the judgment. Proposed new paragraph (b), however, might provoke the question: which parts of the judgment does it support? We are agreed that the Act is not simply satisfying our spirit but is satisfying implementing the judgment. It may not be convenient for the noble Lord to tell me now, but at any time he is able, I would like to know what general principles of human rights law are at stake. I understand that they could be argued very strongly. Is there anywhere in the judgment something which supports proposed new paragraph (b)? I think I know what he is going to rely on, but we ought to have it on the record.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000077"></a>In the form in which I first tried to draft this, I had some language at the end about the union not acting arbitrarily or capriciously. That was very broad and a bit vague. I therefore tried to narrow it to the only form of abuse of a dominant position&#151;or trade union muscle power&#151;that really matters to the individual. I am not suggesting that the way I have tried to do it is the only way. However, to answer the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, I say that in the court&#146;s judgment the question is decided on the  basis of facts. The court says that Mr Lee did not suffer,</p>
<ul><a name="08031378000146"></a>&#147;any particular detriment, save loss of membership itself in the union&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031378000126"></a>That is true. It says in paragraph 50 that he lost nothing,</p>
<ul><a name="08031378000147"></a>&#147;in terms of his livelihood or in his conditions of employment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031378000127"></a>It is clearly saying that it might have had to come to a different conclusion if real detriment had been suffered by Mr Lee. That is the first point.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031378000140"></a>&#147;The Court has taken account of the fact that membership of a trade union is often regarded, in particular due to the trade union movement&#146;s historical background, as a fundamental safeguard for workers against employers&#146; abuse and it has some sympathy with the notion that any worker should be able to join a trade union&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031378000128"></a>It then deals with that in a way favourable to the Government&#146;s position:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031378000141"></a>&#147;However ... ASLEF represents all workers in the collective bargaining context and there is nothing to suggest in the present case that Mr Lee is at any individual risk of, or is unprotected from, any arbitrary or unlawful action by his employer&#148;.</p>

I am trying to explain that ASLEF, in this case, succeeded because of the over-reach in the legislation, but the court was careful to say that the individual would suffer no detriment other than loss of membership. My amendment is intended to&#151;and there may be other ways of doing this&#151;deal with that class of detriment.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000083"></a>There is one thing wrong with my amendment&#151;</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000084"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, keeps making faces at me. If he will please just wait for a moment.</p>

A trade union is not the Garrick Club or any normal private association. I remember the noble Lord, Lord Bach, referring to various private bodies, but a trade union is not like a normal private body. That is why it is so important, why we all support trade unions and why there must be a balance with some remedies and safeguards. I think that the Government will be sympathetic to the need for some safeguards. The question is: what safeguards? The Government are saying that the safeguards are in the common law and the courts and that the individual can always go to court, but that is not a very happy outcome for trade unions. We go back to the old days when I was young and when Lord Denning was the only safeguard in the Court of Appeal in cases involving alleged abuses of trade union power. I should like to keep this as far as possible away from the courts&#151;whether it is the European court or the English courts&#151;and the way to do that is to write in proportionate and limited safeguards. We should not reject the whole of Clause 17, which would put us in further breach of the convention&#151;we cannot, and should not, do that&#151;but equally we should not have option A with no safeguards.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000087"></a>Therefore, my search, as one would expect of a Liberal Democrat, is for a compromise&#151;a moderate, sensible, commonsense compromise. I want to avoid a lot of union bashing in the Chamber and in the other place. Surely we can find a sensible way to go forward or reach agreement on this. It may well be that how I have tried to do it is not good enough&#151;I am perfectly open to other ideas&#151;but that is what I am trying to do and I have tried to explain it without legal gobbledegook. However, I have plenty of legal gobbledegook if anyone wants to have it. I beg to move.</p>

We are talking about law and therefore we should talk as lawyers. The first principle that one teaches a law student, and which one was taught oneself, is that a case is authority for its principle and ratio decidendi, not for its facts. The facts of this case are not part of its ratio. Therefore, surely the noble Lord agrees that, much though I too should like to see sensible wording which limits this judgment, the judges have not given him any wording. He has therefore put in his own words, which are rather good because they are almost as narrow as you can get. However, I plead with the noble Lord to consider that they could be even narrower. He has included,</p>
<ul><a name="08031378000148"></a>&#147;in accordance with the union&#146;s rules&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031378000130"></a>That is agreed, because the court makes a precise equation between religious bodies, a voluntary political party and a trade union as voluntary bodies. We agree on that and it is sensible to put it in the rules, but it is beyond that that we must agree on a word or two. I plead with the noble Lord to reconsider his further paragraph and perhaps to engage in discussions with the Government so that the wording is in accordance with the ratio, and not merely the facts, of the case.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000089"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08031378000192"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> Perhaps I may answer the question, especially as it comes from a noble Lord who tried to teach me the law of contract and uses words such as &#147;ratio&#148; in relation to the Strasbourg court. The one thing that I do a lot of is argue in front of that court and read its judgments. I assure the noble Lord that we are not engaged in looking for the ratio in the way that he is doing and as one would do for traditional English judgments. If one looks at the whole reasoning process, one will find what I have just said, which is that the court, as its ratio&#151;if one wants to put it in that narrow way&#151;decided that, as the individual did not suffer any detriment other than loss of membership and there was no evidence of arbitrary or capricious conduct of a wider kind,  on the facts of that case the legislation was too  broad.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000090"></a>In answer to the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, about my choosing words, the Government have correctly interpreted the judgments&#151;it is not just me who has done so. In option B, which is what my amendment tries to do, they say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031378000142"></a>&#147;The special category of conduct relating to political party membership and activities ... should be retained but the rights not to be excluded or expelled for such conduct should be significantly amended.

</ul>
<p><a name="08031378000091"></a>as mine does&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08031378000149"></a>&#147;to the limited conditions under which it would remain  unlawful for the trade union to exclude or expel an individual on the grounds of their political party membership or activities. Those conditions would specify that the union&#146;s decision would be unlawful unless the political party membership or activity concerned was incompatible with a rule or objective of the union, and the decision to expel or exclude was taken in accordance with union rules or established procedures&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08031378000131"></a>That is the first limb of what I have done in the amendment. However, the Government have not dealt with oppression and detriment, which is what I have sought to do narrowly.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000092"></a>The weakness of the amendment is that it does not prohibit the employer acting arbitrarily as well, for which it could be criticised. However, it deals with the vice of putting pressure on the employer behind the scenes. That is what I have sought to do. What I do not want to do is to leave the clause open to oppositionist, aggressive, anti-union interpretation, which is not the object; the object is to deal with this matter and avoid litigation. I am convinced that if one leaves the clause as the Government have done, the BNP will exploit it. It will say, &#147;This does not go far enough&#148;; it will take another case; it will go through the English courts; it will go back to Strasbourg. That is something that I wish to stop, in the interests of trade unions.</p>

In particular, it is opposed to proposed new subsection (4C)(b), which states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08031378000150"></a>&#147;exclusion or expulsion does not prejudice the individual&#146;s livelihood&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031378000132"></a>It points out that we no longer have closed-shop agreements in this country&#151;we did once; we do not now. This is not a matter for unions. Unions have no power to alter or prejudice an individual&#146;s livelihood any more, although they might once have had. The TUC is totally opposed to the wording in the amendment on that basis. A number of views have been expressed about the text of the legislation. I have said that I would prefer people to be excluded on the basis of activity rather than membership of a political party, which has its problems. On the other hand, if faced with a choice between the amendment and the proposed legislation, I would have to support the legislation as it stands.</p>

When I said that I had seen the TUC and the Government, I did not say that either of them had agreed with me, which of course they had not. As the noble Baroness should know, the TUC position has been to oppose any safeguards, which it said in the consultation. With that, I do not agree. We had a spirited disagreement. I could answer the points in due course.</p>

It does not enhance his argument, and his argument is not acceptable to the TUC. I gather that, in any event, the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, has made the point that this has got to be kept open and cannot be drafted in a very specific way. The Strasbourg court could have found the other way if the proceedings had been unfair or there had been some tremendous disadvantage to the worker. It could have found the other way for 101 other reasons on the facts of that case. That is why the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, is in on the essence of what I am trying to do. You cannot draft tight; you have to set out a principle that, of itself, allows a totally fair decision on the balance of the facts of the case. I am very comforted&#151;and I need a bit of comfort at times&#151;to know that the TUC does not think that what I am proposing is totally dotty.</p>

He has told me that he has represented trade unions in many cases, so he is speaking from experience. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, is trying to achieve a balance. We all want to achieve a balance that is fair on both sides. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that a trade union could not have anything to do with the terms and conditions of employment&#151;he said it could go behind the scenes and get rid of them. However, if a judgment was based on that, the other side could not guarantee that that had not happened. Is the noble Lord taking the right approach? I ask him, with all his legal experience, whether there is any way that the union could influence the terms and conditions of employment, which are a matter for the employer rather than the union?</p>

<p><a name="08031378000098"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0008.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08031378000198"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I intervene to say how grateful the Committee is for the brevity with which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, introduced his amendment. He described himself as an optimist by nature, but I think the optimists on this occasion are the Government in trying to get the Bill through its Committee stage in two days. It looks as though we are approaching a fourth day to finish it off. I think the noble Lord would agree that we are not going to finish it tonight if we want to finish by six, which seems to be the rule. </p>

<p><a name="08031378000099"></a>In my submission, the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights is not binding. We do not have to legislate on this. Therefore, our preferred position would be that Clause 17 does not stand part of the Bill. That is something that we would wish to pursue at a later stage. I accept that, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, put it, there are different, conflicting rights under the convention; in particular, the conflict between Articles 10 and 11: the freedom of expression and the freedom of association. In our view, and certainly in the proud history of this country, freedom of speech is possibly the most important one at this stage. Therefore, in due course, we would want to support, as I made

Failing that, going back to the options put before us by the Government in their consultation document, we think that option B, proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, is preferable. If we cannot strike out Clause 17, we would consider very strongly supporting the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, rather than what is proposed by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000100"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0008.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="08031378000199"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> I welcome the involvement of the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, in the debate. He is not only an authority on human rights law, but he is also an authority whom I have followed for many years. He is motivated by a desire to ensure that our law complies with the European Convention on Human Rights and by a desire to ensure that the rights of individuals are properly protected. I can assure him that Her Majesty&#146;s Government share those desires completely. The noble Lord believes that extra statutory safeguards are needed. Later I shall turn to the way in which he has constructed those safeguards. I shall also say something about the overall argument for new safeguards. I hope he agrees with me that the important safeguards that currently exist are unaffected by Clause 17.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000101"></a>The noble Lord mentioned the 1970s when the only safeguard was running down to the Strand when you knew that Lord Denning was sitting in the Court of Appeal. I&#151;being a tad younger&#151;sat at the feet of all three noble Lords present who specialise in law. At that time, I was at University College, London. We would be sitting at the top of Southampton Row and, if we heard that Tom Denning was about to sit in the Strand, we would all leave the lecture room, no matter what was on, run down Southampton Row, pile into the public gallery and listen to what some saw as the only safeguard of an individual&#146;s rights at that time. The noble Lord brought back memories of a very informative time of my life.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000102"></a>Existing or former union members today are still able to go to the courts or the certification officer to challenge whether the union's decision in any case is in accordance with its rules, be they procedural or substantive. Arbitrary acts can therefore be effectively challenged. Previous cases have mainly involved a union's decision to expel a person, so the safeguards deal with the main types of case which could possibly arise. I guess the current safeguards apply to virtually all cases, but, of course, not all. I am grateful and happy that we are not in those dark days of 1970 again.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000103"></a>The case for extra statutory safeguards rests on the belief that abuse will occur. But where is the evidence that such abuse is an actual practical issue? In those few cases where trade unions have acted against individuals on the grounds of their party membership, it has generally involved political extremists, either of the left or, more recently, of the far right. Does the noble Lord have any examples where arbitrary acts have been taken by trade unions to expel or exclude individuals for belonging to any mainstream political party? I think not.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000104"></a>In addition, it is essential to study closely the court's decision in deciding whether further safeguards, which  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC315"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>must inevitably limit union autonomy, are needed. The court unequivocally stated that the collective rights of the trade union must take precedence in the UK&#146;s conditions. In our circumstances, the loss of union membership does not affect the right to work because the closed shop is unlawful. In our system of employment relations, where bargaining units cover both union and non-union members alike, a person's terms and conditions of employment are not affected by the loss of union membership.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000105"></a>The noble Lord argues that the safeguards are needed in order to comply with the convention, but, on a close reading of the judgment, we believe there is a stronger case to suggest that his amendment would actually have the opposite effect. His approach would expose the UK to the real risk of further adverse judgments by the court. There are therefore good reasons why extra safeguards should not be introduced. Why complicate the law if there is no problem to address? Why create new statutory safeguards when safeguards already exist? I believe that there is a real danger that the approach favoured by the noble Lord might result in excessive regulation and a breach of the European convention, which would indeed be again exploited by the extremists. Indeed, it could be justly criticised as gold-plating.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000106"></a><b><a name="80313-gc0008.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08031378000200"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> Oh!</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000108"></a>The amendment would undoubtedly complicate the law. It would retain the existing wording of Sections 174 and 176, both of which are already complicated in their construction. Moreover, the noble Lord&#146;s amendment would actually add new wording to Section 174. Its effect would be to set additional statutory conditions regulating the ability of trade unions to expel or exclude a person for &#147;protected conduct&#148; and, indeed, for any form of conduct.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000109"></a>The European court&#146;s judgment was about the need to give greater autonomy to trade unions. I fear that this amendment may limit that autonomy further. For example, proposed new subsection (4C) sets new conditions on a trade union when it excludes or expels a person for any form of conduct, be it &#147;protected conduct&#148; or non-protected conduct. The union&#146;s actions must be in accordance with its &#147;rules or established procedures&#148;, and the exclusion or expulsion must not,</p>
<ul><a name="08031378000151"></a>&#147;prejudice the individual's livelihood or conditions of employment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031378000133"></a>There are several problems with that wording. First, what does it precisely mean? At the very least it will give rise to debate and legal wrangling, more delay and costly legal intervention. What does &#147;established procedures&#148; mean? What would,</p>
<ul><a name="08031378000152"></a>&#147;prejudice a person's livelihood or conditions of employment&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="08031378000134"></a>Indeed, could any form of detriment, however minor, constitute &#147;prejudice&#148;? Where &#147;prejudice&#148; would occur, an expulsion or exclusion is always unlawful, whatever the conduct in question. For example, where a union  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC316"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column GC316</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>member assaults a union official, the union could not lawfully expel that person if some &#147;prejudice&#148;&#151;which could have a wide meaning&#151;occurs as a result. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment therefore introduces an extra limitation on current union freedoms.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000110"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s amendment also changes the definition of &#147;protected conduct&#148;. It would make it unlawful for a trade union to expel or exclude a person based on membership of a political party unless the individual concerned was a member of a party whose &#147;values and ideals&#148; were incompatible with the &#147;rules or objectives&#148; of the union. Again, what does &#147;values and ideals&#148; actually mean? Is this extra wording sufficiently clear to avoid unnecessary, but presumably predictable, legal challenge, dispute, delay and cost?</p>

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000111"></a>In adding these extra restrictions on trade unions&#146; freedom to determine their membership, the amendment would produce some uncomfortable consequences, including&#151;the noble Lord referred to this&#151;the opportunity for vexatious litigation. It would enable the BNP, in particular, to challenge trade union decisions.</p>

I guess it has raised concerns in people who do not know the whole picture; it certainly has raised concerns on all sides of the Committee. I will address those concerns in more detail during the stand part debate that follows. I accept, however, that the noble Lord has raised some important points about the convention and the case for some form of extra statutory safeguard. The Government will reflect on those arguments and those of other noble Lords. I make it clear that we understand the spirit behind the amendment. While we now invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment, we do not diminish it in any way and we hope that further consideration can take place. We would listen to more counter-arguments. Hopefully, we can achieve a satisfactory resolution before Report.</p>

Of course, I am greatly heartened by the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Henley, because it seems that that will concentrate minds as much as anything. The fact that it is likely that both opposition parties will be taking a common position

<a name="80313-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000116"></a>Secondly, I met the trade union officials and we appreciated our dialogue. None of the points made was that of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, about the certification officer. The certification officer has no power to deal with employees who are excluded from trade unions. That was one reason why that would not work, as we explained to the TUC. The TUC also argued that the common law and the contract of membership provide effective safeguards for individuals. However, that is exactly the position I wish to avoid. Although I revere the late Lord Denning, I must say some of his judgments were deeply reactionary and, on one or two occasions, even sexist. Therefore, although I loved the man and many things about him, I would not like to have to rely upon him, or his children or grandchildren in the courts, for safeguards. I speak as somebody who has acted both for and against trade unions, including a great case against the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, that he may remember. The judge in question went to Ascot during the long vacation instead of focusing on what we were dealing with. There are serious limitations in using the common law as the safeguard, as the TUC quaintly now seems to want to do. I want to do away with that.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000117"></a>So far as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, is concerned, it is important to understand, as Conservative Governments have well understood, that Article 46 of the European convention obliges the United Kingdom to give effect to a binding judgment. It is therefore no use saying, &#147;We do not like the judgment, so we are not bound by it&#148;. We are bound by it under international law, and would be in real trouble in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe if, for the first time in our history with the convention, we did not comply. That is why the stand part debate is a waste of time. We must have legislation to comply with the judgment. The question is what it should say.</p>

<p><a name="08031378000118"></a>The Minister, who is very kind, was a bit unkind in criticising the wording of my amendment, the first part of which came from his own option B. The words are: &#147;Those conditions would specify&#148;&#151;blah, blah, blah&#151;that it was,</p>
<ul><a name="08031378000153"></a>&#147;incompatible with a rule or objective of the union, and the decision to exclude or expel was taken in accordance with union rules or established procedures&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031378000135"></a>I just took the Government&#146;s words and put them into my amendment. However, parliamentary counsel can no doubt do better than that. All I am asking is for parliamentary counsel to be instructed between now and Report to come up with a wording which satisfies him or her and the Government, and can be put to and discussed by us so that we can all reach agreement.</p>

<a name="80313-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08031378000119"></a>I am an optimist. This is not gold-plating; it is ridiculous to suggest that it is. The Government are taking away safeguards agreed by a Conservative Government and Labour Opposition that were regarded as necessary and are now to be watered down. If the Bill stands as it is, the Government are leaving it to the BNP to litigate on whether the abolition of all safeguards is compatible with the convention. That is why it is dotty to leave it as it is, and why the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Handsworth, was right to describe it as &#147;barking&#148;&#151;with respect to the inhabitants of Barking.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_head0"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="08031369000002"></a>Foreign and Commonwealth Office: Scholarships and Fellowships</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08031369000010"></a><b><a name="80313-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08031369000069"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08031369000011"></a>In parallel with the work on the new Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) strategic framework, which I announced to the House on 23 January, I should like to inform the House of our plans for the future of scholarships and fellowships funding.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08031369000012"></a>We have found a transformed situation in higher education, and an FCO scholarship programme that has not always been well aligned to foreign policy goals. So we propose a smaller, better organised programme, focused on the leaders of tomorrow, from a wide range of backgrounds. The savings we make from this reform will support new priority programmes, principally on climate change.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08031369000013"></a>Twelve years ago 30,000 post-graduate students came to the UK from outside the EU. Since then, that number has gone up by 160 per cent. British universities actively market themselves, and many offer their own scholarships. So we need to focus on the value-added from the FCO's scholarship schemes. This value-added is the creation of relationships between the United Kingdom and the international leaders of the future.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08031369000014"></a>We currently support three scholarship schemes (Chevening, Marshall and Commonwealth) in addition to our Chevening fellowship programme. Our scholarship schemes bring young post-graduates to the UK, normally for masters degree courses. Our fellowship scheme brings mid-career professionals for 12-week custom-designed specialist courses.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08031369000015"></a>As we reviewed our schemes, we found a number of weaknesses. The purpose of the scholarship schemes has not always been clear. We have not always sought out students we thought could become international leaders. We have pursued high numbers of scholars, which has sometimes reduced focus on quality. We have not consistently done enough to build the personal relationships with the scholars which we need to get the most out of the schemes, including during selection, which we have sometimes left to others, during their time in the UK and after they have finished their studies. We have not always worked closely enough with our partner government departments with an international focus, or with British business, to ensure the scholarship schemes work for them. And the Chevening scholarship brand has been stronger in some countries than in others.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08031369000016"></a>The schemes have had real strengths. But we need to refocus them to ensure that these strengths are consistent. We will maintain a global scheme, but we will focus scholarships particularly on those countries such as China and India which are going to be most  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS142"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column WS142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>important to our foreign policy success over coming years. We will select more carefully to ensure our scholars really are potential future leaders, with our heads of mission having personal responsibility for ensuring their posts are getting this right. We will work to ensure that we are drawing from the widest possible pool of potential scholars.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08031369000017"></a>We will maintain a much closer relationship with those scholars who do come, making sure that right from the start of the selection process we begin to build links with them, increasing our contact with them while they are here, and staying in closer touch with them after they leave, including through the introduction of a new web-based alumni networking system.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08031369000018"></a>We want to increase the engagement that British business and government departments with an international focus have with the scholars, and we are starting a consultation process to ensure this happens. We will work in the future through two scholarship schemes only, the Marshall scheme in the USA and the Chevening scheme in the rest of the world, and will develop the strength of these brands. This means an end to the FCO contribution to the Commonwealth scholarship and fellowship plan. We will maintain the highly successful Chevening fellowship scheme at its current level.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08031369000019"></a>These changes will free up some &#163;10 million a year for new activity on our new policy goals. The majority of this will be spent on programmes to support the development and implementation of a low-carbon, high-growth economy, in particular:</p>
with other UK government departments, developing sound scientific and economic evidence in key countries which demonstrates the benefits of taking strong, early action on climate change;mobilising support for such action through engagement with key decision-makers, including political, business and civil society leaders in key countries such as the US, China and India; andwith other UK government departments, developing and helping to implement regulation in key countries which facilitates investments in low carbon technologies and energy efficiency.
<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08031369000020"></a>Under the new strategic framework, we are also increasing our resources for staff working on these issues in London and overseas.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="08031369000021"></a><b><a name="80313-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08031369000070"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Iain Wright) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08031369000022"></a>I have today laid before the House an amendment to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 1995 (the GPDO) which will apply from 6 April 2008. The amendment provides permitted development rights  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS143"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column WS143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the installation of specified types of microgeneration equipment on or within the curtilage of dwellinghouses. The equipment includes solar photovoltaics (PV), solar thermal, ground and water source heat pumps, biomass heating and combined heat and power systems. Where permitted development rights are granted, no application for planning permission is needed.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08031369000023"></a>The Government consulted in April 2007 on the proposed extension of householder permitted development rights for microgeneration. There were two main policy objectives; first to provide extra freedom for permitted development so long as it had little or no impact beyond the host property. Secondly, the Government wanted to make it easier for householders to combat climate change by producing their own energy from renewable sources.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08031369000024"></a>In November 2007, the Government issued their response to the consultation. The Government announced that they intended to provide permitted development for the following types of microgeneration: solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps, biomass and combined heat and power, subject to specific limits and conditions that would ensure that any adverse impact on others was not significant. The response said that standards would need to be set on noise and vibration for wind turbines and air source heat pumps to ensure that neighbours were not disturbed by the development. For that reason, permitted development rights for wind turbines and air source heat pumps would be implemented as soon as these standards and safeguards had been drawn up and put in place. These would be dealt with principally through further work being led by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform working with key stakeholders, including industry, to develop a certification scheme for microgeneration that covers both standards for products and their installation.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08031369000025"></a>The amendment to the GPDO allows for the installation of solar PV or solar thermal equipment on the wall or roof of a dwellinghouse or a building within its curtilage so long as the equipment does not protrude more than 200 millimetres. Stand alone solar PV or solar thermal will be permitted if its height does not exceed four metres above ground level and it is more than five metres from the boundary. There are restrictions that apply to solar in conservation areas, in World Heritage Sites and to listed buildings.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08031369000026"></a>Good progress has been made on the associated test standards that will apply to wind turbines and air source heat pumps, as part of the microgeneration certification scheme. The scheme and standards have been developed in consultation with stakeholders and industry. In due course, the GPDO will incorporate standards to ensure that habitable rooms of any neighbouring residential property are not exposed to an outside noise level exceeding 45 decibels. The noise limit will apply to free-standing wind turbines and those mounted on detached dwellings. Similar provisions will apply to air source heat pumps. The decibel level will be reviewed after two years in the light of conditions prevailing at the time.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08031369000027"></a>The microgeneration certification scheme has been notified to the European Commission and cleared. However, reference within the GPDO has to be notified  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS144"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column WS144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the Commission under the EC Technical Standards Directive 98/34/EC as a new regulation. This process is likely to be concluded within a few months. The Government will amend the GPDO to grant permitted development rights for wind turbines and air source heat pumps which comply with the certification scheme and standards upon satisfactory completion of this legal process. This amendment will apply to free-standing wind turbines, those mounted on detached dwellings, and to air source heat pumps. These rights will not extend to wind turbines on attached dwellings such as semi-detached and terraced houses until further work has been carried out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and industry on potential nuisance to neighbours from structure-borne noise and vibration.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08031369000028"></a>I wish to make it clear to the House that it is only the need to provide a satisfactory standard that addresses noise and vibration issues, which then has to go through the legal process mentioned above, that prevents the inclusion of wind turbines and air source heat pumps in the statutory instrument laid before Parliament today.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="08031369000029"></a><b><a name="80313-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="08031369000071"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State (David Hanson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08031369000030"></a>The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) takes the misuse of drugs in prisons very seriously. Since 1996-97, the overall random MDT positive rate has decreased from 24.4 per cent to 8.8 per cent in 2006-07.  This represents a decrease of 64 per cent for that period.  Ministers are now urgently considering what further measures we need to take over controlling the supply of drugs into prisons.  NOMS has been pro-active in monitoring changing patterns of misuse and in ensuring that the best available supply reduction measures are in place.  By this Statement, I am announcing that mandatory drug testing (MDT) for buprenorphine will be introduced in all prisons from 1 April. </p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08031369000031"></a>Buprenorphine (Subutex) is being prescribed increasingly in the community in the treatment of opioid dependence and is gaining equal clinical status to methadone in some areas.  This has been accompanied by increased illegal use.  Buprenorphine testing has been in place since 1999, restricted to those prisons with an identified problem.  Growing operational concern at the potential for wider buprenorphine misuse in prisons led NOMS to commission a survey in 2007 to assess the scale of the problem.  The results show that misuse of this drug has grown to be a significant problem and that its use is now more widespread geographically.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08031369000032"></a>Buprenorphine misuse presents a new challenge for prisons.  In response, testing will now be introduced in all prisons to act as a deterrent.  Prisoners will also be warned of the dangers involved in misusing this drug and reminded of the drug treatment options available in prisons. </p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08031369000033"></a>The increased misuse of buprenorphine does not detract from the considerable achievement of prisons over the past 10 years in reducing the supply of drugs. </p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08031369000034"></a>The introduction of buprenorphine testing in all prisons will, however, inevitably lead to an increase in reported levels of drug misuse.  Key performance targets have already been set for 2008-09, but these do not take into account the impact of buprenorphine.  Therefore, this year two sets of performance data will be recorded, the headline measure excluding buprenorphine and a separate measure including buprenorphine.  This will demonstrate clearly the impact of buprenorphine testing and enable the comparison of prison performance to continue on a consistent basis.  New targets that take into account buprenorphine misuse will then be set for 2009-10. Though we may continue to run two data sets in parallel to provide longer term comparisons of trends.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08031369000037"></a>In October 2007, the House of Commons Education and Skills Committee published <I>Special Educational Needs: Assessment and Funding</I>. The report identified parental confidence in the special educational needs (SEN) assessment system as a key issue in making provision for children with SEN. We share the committee&#146;s desire to improve parental confidence and in the Children&#146;s Plan we set out an ambitions package of measures supported by &#163;18 million of additional investment over 2008-11. This package will improve the skills of the workforce in meeting children&#146;s special educational needs and focus on the outcomes being achieved.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08031369000038"></a>This year we will roll out new, specially developed SEN and disability units for primary undergraduate teacher training courses to be followed by units for secondary and PGCE courses next year. We are developing the skills of the early years and schools workforce through the inclusion development programme and promoting specialist training through the work of the three trusts we have supported in communication, autism and dyslexia. In addition, we are learning about the progress of children with SEN through the Making Good Progress pilots and will be improving data to support progression.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08031369000039"></a>Building on this, in our response to the committee&#146;s report (HC 298, published 4 February 2008) we committed to setting up a group of expert advisers, under the chairmanship of Brian Lamb, the chair of the Special Educational Consortium, to advise on the most effective

In formulating their advice, we have asked the inquiry to:</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08031369000047"></a>We want to make Britain the best country in the world to run an innovative business or public service.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08031369000053"></a>Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires the Home Secretary to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on the exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08031369000056"></a>As stated in previous quarterly statements on control orders, control-order obligations are tailored to the individual concerned and are based on the terrorism-related risk that individual poses. Each control order  


<notus-date day="13" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS148"></a><b>13 Mar 2008 : Column WS148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is kept under regular review to ensure that obligations remain necessary and proportionate. The Home Office continues to hold control order review groups (CORGs) every quarter, with representation from law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to keep the obligations in every control order under regular and formal review and to facilitate a review of appropriate exit strategies. During this reporting period, three CORGs were held in relation to the orders currently in force. In addition, further meetings were held on an ad hoc basis as specific issues arose.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08031369000057"></a>During the period 11 December 2007 to 10 March 2008, two non-derogating control orders were made. One of these was quashed following a review hearing. Three control orders were renewed in accordance with Section 2(6) of the 2005 Act. One was subsequently revoked after the subject received a prison sentence for criminal offences unrelated to his control order. Three control orders against individuals who had absconded have expired.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08031369000058"></a>In total, 11 control orders are currently in force, four of which are in respect of British citizens. Three of the individuals live in the Metropolitan Police Service area; the rest live within other police force areas. All of these control orders are non-derogating.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="08031369000059"></a>During this reporting period, 35 modifications of control order obligations were made. Twelve requests to modify a control order obligation were refused. A right of appeal exists in Sections 10(1) and 10(3) of the 2005 Act against decisions by the Secretary of State to modify an obligation imposed by a non-derogating control order, without consent, and to refuse a request by a controlled person to modify any such obligation. Three such appeals have been lodged in this reporting period. Two modification appeals have been heard and judgment has been given in one of these cases (the judge did not find it necessary to give an explicit ruling on the other appeal). A further modification appeal lodged in the previous reporting period was part-heard during this reporting period. Section 10(1) of the 2005 Act also contains a provision to appeal against the renewal of a non-derogating control order. One appeal has been lodged against the renewal of an order in this reporting period and one such appeal has been heard with judgment reserved.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="08031369000060"></a>During this reporting period, six judgments relating to control orders were handed down by the High Court and one was handed down by the Court of Appeal. Two of these related to the case of Secretary of State for the Home Department v Cerie Bullivant, which was heard during this reporting period. The first set out the approach that the court would take to Article 6 in the case. The second judgment related to the substantive review of Cerie Bullivant's first and second control orders. The second control order was quashed on the basis that at the time of the review hearing grounds for reasonable suspicion of Cerie Bullivant's involvement in terrorism-related activity did not exist. No final judgment was necessary on the first order as it had already expired prior to the hearing.</p>

<a name="80313-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="08031369000061"></a>In the case of Secretary of State for the Home Department v AE, a judgment was handed down which found that, at that stage in the proceedings,

In the case of the Secretary of State for the Home Department v AN, the High Court held that the Secretary of State would have to disclose further material to AN or withdraw reliance upon it in order to ensure that the hearing would be compatible with Article 6. In the case of Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF, the High Court ruled that without further disclosure to AF, Article 6 has not been complied with, unless AF could have no conceivable answer to the case against him even if further disclosure was made.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="08031369000062"></a>The Court of Appeal handed down a judgment in the case of Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF on procedural matters and a High Court judgment was handed down in the case of Secretary of State for the Home Department v AM in closed only.</p>

The number of profiles held on the database is not indicative of the number of individuals. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded.</p>

<a name="80313w0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_19"></a><a name="08031371000089"></a>At present, the replication rate is 13.3 per cent, that is, the number of people whose details are loaded is 13.3 per cent fewer than the number of profiles. Therefore, the estimated number of individuals under 18 as at 31 January 2008 is 315,638. Individuals who were under 18 at the time that a DNA sample was taken from them, but were over 18 on this date, are not included in the figures.</p>

The number of these deleted between the establishment of the National DNA Database (NDNAD) in 1995 and 5 March 2008 is estimated to be 386,205.</p>

<a name="80313w0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_20"></a><a name="08031371000092"></a>The types of record deleted have varied over time and between different parts of the United Kingdom. In England and Wales before 2001, the police could take DNA from anyone charged, but the samples and the profiles derived from them had to be destroyed if charges were dropped or the person was found not guilty.</p>

<a name="80313w0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_21"></a><a name="08031371000093"></a>The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 changed this so that DNA could be kept from those who had been charged even if they were acquitted; the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (which came into force in 2004) extended the power further, so that DNA could be kept from anyone arrested for a recordable offence and held in a police station. In Scotland, DNA samples and profiles can be retained permanently from anyone convicted; if a prosecution is started for a sexual or violent offence, the DNA can be retained for three years with a possible extension, regardless of whether the person is brought to trial or convicted; otherwise the DNA samples and profiles have to be destroyed after the investigation. Therefore, since 2004 most of the profiles deleted from the NDNAD have been Scottish ones.</p>
