the Data Protection Act 1998 requires data controllers to notify the
Information Commissioner where they process personal data, subject to
some limited exemptions. The notification focuses upon the purpose for
which personal data are processed rather than the particular equipment

received a letter from a Minister advising me that the idea that
information should be passed to the Information Commissioner was
incorrect. Could I therefore ask her how many peeping Toms or peeping
paparazzi, legal or illegal, are there in the United Kingdom and who
owns the intellectual property that they assemble and

copy of which is in the Library of the House, making a statement about
something that she said to him regarding CCTV. The information that I
have now given him is correct. Inevitably, I do not have figures for
those who are doing things illegally, but I can tell him that 47,000
data controllers are registered for the purposes of crime prevention
and the prosecution of offenders. In the experience of the Information
Commissioner&#146;s Office, those are usually the purposes for which
most CCTV systems are notified. The data are processed under the
principles of Schedule 1 to the Data Protection

surveillance without proper impact assessments, such as the &#163;224
million scheme in respect of 12 million children that the Government
are promoting and about which the Information Commissioner&#146;s
Office warned, is extremely risky, undermines parental authority and,
through a plethora of information, risks blinding the onlooker to the
real risks that individual children may
run?</p>

the purpose of <I>Every Child Matters</I> was to move away from trying
to deal with children in crisis to trying to identify children and
support them more effectively. The noble Lord may remember that I took
the Children Act through the House and it was the famous Clause 9 that
dealt with data sharing. Proposals are before your Lordships&#146;
House, as a consequence of that legislation, to enable professionals to
work more effectively together. It is a kind of address book, because
we know that the time it takes for one professional working with a
family to identify another is, on average, two days. Our purpose will
be to enable professionals to work more collaboratively and not, as the
noble Lord fears, to identify children
wrongly.</p><p><a name="06112884000053"></a><b><a name="61128-0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="06112884000302"></a>Lord

1999 and 2003 looking at how we could best use CCTV in crime reduction

Ashton of Upholland:</b> My Lords,
I was pleased to open the Information Commissioner&#146;s conference
on this subject. I am keen that we identify data sharing appropriately.
There are three issues. The first is the choice of a consumer&#151;a
citizen&#151;to enable the data to be shared because our time is not
free and there are lots of examples where we fill in the same
information time and again. We should choose if we wish to share that.
The second is transparency, so that people know how their information
is used, and that when government departments share it appropriately
citizens are informed and know what is happening. The third issue is to
make sure that the role of government as a protector of the vulnerable
is well understood and

helping the vulnerable either through better public services or through
making sure that they do not suffer abuse or in other
ways.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06112884000007"></a>Middle

Middle East strategy with Israel-Palestine at its core. Part of that is
about giving Iran and Syria a strategic choice on how to engage with us

President Bush under James Baker to consider policy for the future for
the Middle East is likely to report soon and will no doubt be followed

that the Iraq war so far has been a disaster; and since we are the
closest ally of the United States and can claim a good knowledge of
Middle East problems, when the Prime Minister next meets President Bush
on these matters will he put our point of view to the President more
vigorously, confidently and persuasively than he seems to have done in

US President to have listened a little more carefully to the Prime
Minister, particularly on disbanding the police and army, will the
Minister give me her view on this point? This is the first time that a
US Administration have recognised the right of a Palestinian state.
That is in no small part due to the Prime Minister&#146;s pressure on
that matter, and the continuing engagement that is at last showing some
signs of movement may also be due to his continuing involvement. Let us
not lose sight of the good things that are happening as well as

Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply. I entirely agree that it is
an outstanding report and provides a very sound political and moral
framework for military intervention in the 21st century. However, I
want to probe the Minister on Recommendation 60, which
says:</p><ul><a name="06112884000255"></a>&#147;States with
advanced military capacities should establish standby high readiness,
self-efficient battalions at up to brigade level that can reinforce

the UK Government would consider each request on a case-by-case basis.
However, the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations is currently
considering three options to provide timely additional support to UN
missions at times of crisis: the provision of a rapid deployment
capability to regional organisations; the provision of a short-term
capability by one or more individual countries; and providing
co-operation arrangements between UN missions in the same region. We
fully support its efforts in this arena.</p><p><a name="06112884000073"></a><b><a name="61128-0001.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="06112884000322"></a>Lord
Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon:</b> My Lords, the
establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission is a very welcome
innovation, but does the Minister agree that it presents us with both a
danger and an opportunity? The danger is that the Peacebuilding
Commission gets involved in direct executive action and duplicates the
capability of other multinational and, indeed, individual nation
activity in the area of peacemaking and post-conflict reconstruction;
the opportunity is that it acts as a co-ordinator to create more
cohesive action. Do the Government agree that the latter is a more
appropriate role for the Peacebuilding Commission than the
former?</p><p><a name="06112884000074"></a><b><a name="61128-0001.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="06112884000323"></a>Baroness

what is the Government&#146;s attitude to the high-level panel's

the problems that have arisen over the African Union&#146;s mission
in Darfur could have been avoided? What are Her Majesty's Government
now doing to pursue that

other day. He indicated that we support the idea of an independent
nuclear fuel bank. We are doing everything we can to progress that idea
because we see it as a solution to many of the problems being
discussed.</p><p><a name="06112884000087"></a><b><a name="61128-0001.htm_spnew39"></a><a name="06112884000336"></a>Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</b> My Lords, further to the
supplementary question of the noble Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth,
about ready forces, does the Minister accept that one of the great
achievements of the progress in closer defence co-operation among
European Union member states is that the provision of ready forces is
one of the main aims of the SDP? Indeed, was not Operation Concordia in
summer 2004, in which European Governments managed to put 1,500 troops
into eastern Congo within 14 days of a request from the UN
Secretary-General, a useful step in that direction?</p><p><a name="06112884000088"></a>Does the Minister also accept that, as
the demand for peacekeeping forces rises, we need to bring more
countries into their provision? In that respect, is not the arrival of
1,000 Chinese troops as part of the extended UN force in Lebanon a
quite healthy development?</p><p><a name="06112884000089"></a><b><a name="61128-0001.htm_spnew40"></a><a name="06112884000337"></a>Baroness
Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, the situation as
outlined by the noble Lord was a useful step forward. We welcome the
Chinese contribution to the forces in Lebanon. In the area of regional
rapid reaction, it is important that the EU and UN continue to discuss
how the EU battle groups could be used in appropriate circumstances in
support of UN missions. We look forward to building on

asks</p><ul><a name="06112884000258"></a>&#147;whether the raid

here regarding the OFT and Ofcom. First,the DTI remains in
contact with the OFT about the transaction and will keep under review
whether the Secretary of State could or should intervene on public
interest grounds. Ofcom is looking at the other issue. It has announced
that it is inviting comments from BSkyB and ITV on whether the
transaction has resulted in a change of control in one or more of the
licences held by ITV. If Ofcom were to conclude that such a change had
occurred, it would review its effects on the content of programming.
Those are two separate issues and both are being
investigated.</p><p><a name="06112884000097"></a><b><a name="61128-0002.htm_spnew46"></a><a name="06112884000344"></a>Lord

even a stake in ITV of less than 20 per cent adds undesirably to the
abundance and concentration of power already in Mr Murdoch&#146;s
hands? Does he recall that in the debates on the Communications Act in
this House and, no doubt, in the other place, we were concerned above
all to seek the objective of a plurality of news and views? That is
endangered by this latest move.</p>

straight bat, as I imagined he would. However, as the noble Lord, Lord
Borrie, indicated, the public interest part of the Act was put in, much
against the will of the Government and on the insistence of this House,
for just this circumstance. The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, described

how other Governments would act but this Government abide by the law as
it is set out. Let me explain to the noble Lord, Lord McNally, how it
works. An intervention by the Secretary of State is available only if a
relevant merger situation for the purposes of the Enterprise Act 2002
has arisen that is relevant to a public interest consideration
specified under Section 58 of that Act. It would not be appropriate to
comment further on whether those circumstances have been met in this

Minister of State, Department of Health (Lord
Warner):</b> My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill
be now read a second time. There has always been, and will continue to
be, much debate about the purpose and balance of mental health law.
This area is controversial, and understandably so, as it involves
issues of personal liberty and intrusion into people&#146;s lives.
However, the Bill is a relatively small part of the Government&#146;s
agenda for mental health. Perhaps more important is our progress on
improving the range and quality of mental health services available
across the country. Nevertheless, we need to ensure that our legal
powers are as clear and up to date as
possible.</p><p><a name="06112884000133"></a>The Bill primarily
amends the Mental HealthAct 1983 to help protect patients and
the public from harm and to modernise the legislation to reflect
current mental health service provision. It introduces 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_655"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 655</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>new safeguards into the Mental Capacity Act 2005 for people who lack
capacity and are deprived of their liberty in their own best interests.
We also need to bring our legislation fully into line with the European
Convention on Human
Rights.</p><p><a name="06112884000134"></a>Although one in six of
us suffers from a common mental health problem at any point in our
lives, most of us will never need treatment under statutory powers. For
instance, while over 900,000 people are seen by specialist mental
health services at any one time, only about 15,000 of those are
detained under the Mental Health Act. We do not need new legislation to
go on improving services&#151;we will continue to do so under general
NHS legislation.</p><p><a name="06112884000135"></a>Let me be
clear about the improvements we have put in place on mental health
services, because this provides the context within which this
legislation will be implemented. We are spending &#163;1.25 billion
more on mental health services than in 1999. That is an increase of
more than a quarter in real terms. Mental health, at &#163;7.2
billion, represents the largest single element of programmed budget
spend in the NHS. There are now record numbers of staff working in
mental health. Since we came to office, there are 9,400 more
psychiatric nurses, 1,240 more psychiatric consultants and 3,080 more
clinical psychologists.</p><p><a name="06112884000136"></a>We are improving access
to mental health services through new outreach teams and crisis
resolution teams to provide care in patients' homes, through new early
intervention services for young people and by providing more secure
places for people with personality disorders. During 2005-06, crisis
resolution teams provided 84,000 episodes of home treatment for people
who would otherwise have been admitted to hospital. By the end of March
2006, about 19,000 people were receiving care from assertive outreach
teams.</p><p><a name="06112884000137"></a>I recognise that a small
minority of people at risk of harming themselves or others are in
circumstances that justify treating them under compulsion. In those
circumstances, a measure of compulsion may be the most compassionate
thing to do. I accept that a high threshold needs to be reached before
a clinical decision is made to detain and treat a patient under
compulsion. The thresholds created by such criteria are fundamental to
the balance set up by the Act. They establish when it is right that a
clinician step in because the risk of harm to a patient or others
outweighs a patient's individual
rights.</p><p><a name="06112884000138"></a>In any such legislative
framework, we need to ensure that patients' rights are safeguarded and
that clinicians are clear about the process that must be followed under
those circumstances. It is essential that detention and treatment under
compulsion is only ever for a proper clinical purpose. The current
legislation provides a framework of the kind that I described, but the
Bill amends that framework with a number of key changes. The
legislation needs modernising, because society and mental health
services have changed since the previous Mental Health Act came into
force more than 20 years ago.</p><p><a name="06112884000139"></a>I
freely acknowledge that we had intended to replace current legislation
with the previous Mental Health Bill published in September 2004.
However, many stakeholders cited the positive aspects of the 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_656"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 656</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Mental Health Act 1983 in their evidence to the Joint Committee in the
pre-legislative process. We have listened carefully to those views and
to those expressed by mental health organisations, patients, clinicians
and the general public. That has resulted in a shorter, more focused
Bill covering essential measures. We now have a Bill that will help to
ensure that people who need to be treated for the prevention of harm
get the treatment that they need when they need it. Secondly, the Bill
will bring the legislative framework up to date with current
developmentsin mental health services, and strengthen patient
safeguards.</p><p><a name="06112884000140"></a>Supervised
community treatment is probably the key change in the Bill and is an
area of some controversy. It is important not just from a patient and
public safety angle but because clinical practice itself has changed.
At present, most patients treated under the Mental Health Act are
detained in hospital. That reflects the fact that, in 1983, most acute
mental health services were provided in hospital. However the world has
moved on and we now have a wide range of community-based mental health
services, some of which I mentioned earlier. We also know that some
form of compulsory community treatment is established in jurisdictions
in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Israel, Sweden, Belgium, Portugal
and Scotland.</p><p><a name="06112884000141"></a>It is clear that
there is now scope for some patients to be treated under compulsory
powers but to live in the community, not in hospital. For suitable
patients, supervised community treatment meets the need for a framework
for their treatment and safe management in the community, instead of
detention in hospital. That modern approach strikes a balance between
individual autonomy and protection of the patient and the
public.</p><p><a name="06112884000142"></a>I hope
that we will not hear arguments in this House that we should go back to
the future and reserve compulsion for detention in hospital. We have
made it clear that, to be eligible for supervised community treatment,
patients must have had an initial period of detention and treatment in
hospital. This means that their medical condition and treatment needs
will be well established before they go into the community. Criteria
are set out in the Bill on whether a patient is suitable for supervised
community treatment. It will be for clinicians, working with approved
mental health professionals, to determine against those criteria
whether a patient should be put on a community treatment order. There
is no question of supervised community treatment being imposed on
people who have not been detained in hospital
first.</p><p><a name="06112884000143"></a>We know that some
patients stop taking their medication or treatment once they leave
hospital, and so relapse and end up being readmitted. This detrimental
cycle is often referred to as the revolving door. Patients on
supervised community treatment will benefit from a structure designed
to promote safe community living. This will reduce the risk of relapse
and re-detention. They will be asked to comply with conditions to help
prevent relapse, such as living in a certain place, attending an
out-patient clinic and agreeing to take medication under the direction
of their responsible clinician.</p>

mental health does deteriorate again, there will be scope to take
actionto prevent crisis. Under supervised community treatment,
patients can be recalled to hospital, if they need to be, for
treatment. This is important because the power of recall provides the
means to tackle relapse, and to avoid its potentially adverse
consequences for the patient or someone else. Recall to hospital allows
patients to be treated quickly and to return to the community
straightaway if it is clinically safe to do
so.</p><p><a name="06112884000145"></a>I recognise that there were
some concerns about our proposals for supervised community treatment,
but we have tried to deal with them. I assure the House that it is not
about forcing people to have treatment in the community. If a patient
refuses consent to treatment, it can be given only on recall to
hospital. Forcible treatment against a patient&#146;s will cannot be
given in the community where the patient lacks the capacity to consent
unless the treatment is immediately necessary&#151;for example, to
save the patient&#146;s
life.</p><p><a name="06112884000146"></a>Supervised community
treatment is a new, modern and effective way to manage the treatment of
patients with serious mental health problems. It will allow patients,
so far as possible, to live normal lives in the community. This will
reduce the risk of social exclusion and stigma associated with
detention in hospital for long periods of time or with repeated
hospital admissions.</p><p><a name="06112884000147"></a>We have
published a draft code of practice that provides guidance in more
detail, and we are happy to have comments on how to improve it.
Supervised community treatment will be suitable for a minority of
patients who have already been detained in hospital. There will be
clear criteria for eligibility, safeguards for patients, and strict
provisions for review and appeal, exactly as they apply to detained
patients.</p><p><a name="06112884000148"></a>Let me turn briefly to
measures that simplify and clarify the current legislation. At present,
a patient being treated under the Act often needs to be assigned to one
of four separate categories of mental disorder. We wish to replace
these with a simpler single definition of mental disorder under which a
patient&#146;s needs and risks, not the label that happens to be
applied to a person&#146;s mental disorder, determine when action is
taken. This simpler single definition will also make the Act easier for
clinicians to use and for others to understand. This will not alter the
way in which the Act deals with learning disability. Similarly, alcohol
and drug dependence will remain excluded from the definition of mental
disorder, as they are now, but two other exclusions in the Act will be
removed. The first relates to promiscuity or other immoral conduct,
which is redundant. No one could now regard such behaviour as mental
disorder. By contrast, the present exclusion for sexual deviancy is
simply wrong. If a person has a clinically recognised mental disorder,
the fact that the disorder manifests itself, for example, as voyeurism
or paedophilia should not be an obstacle to using the Act where it is
justified to protect the patient or other people.</p>

a new requirement that appropriate treatment must be available for
patients subject to detention in hospital for treatment or on
supervised community treatment. This will reinforce the fundamental
principle that detention and supervised community treatment must always
be for a clinical purpose. The test replaces the more selective
&#147;treatability test&#148;, whose many drawbacks include
contributing to a culture in which certain groups of patients are
labelled untreatable and thereby are denied services. That may have
been convenient for service providers, but it was not very useful to
patients and was sometimes dangerous to the
public.</p><p><a name="06112884000150"></a>The appropriate
treatment test is designed to ensure that no one will be brought or
kept under compulsion unless suitable treatment is available for them.
It will not be enough for treatment to exist in theory, which in itself
is a considerable patient safeguard. The treatment must be not only
available and appropriate to the medical condition but appropriate to
the circumstances. For instance, factors such as how far the services
are from the patient&#146;s home or whether those services are
culturally appropriate will need to be considered. That is very much in
line with the move across the NHS towards more tailored, individual
patient-focused services. It is a change that links mental health very
much to the mainstream of NHS reform and
improvement.</p><p><a name="06112884000151"></a>Another
shift across the NHS has been the modernising of medical careers,
making sure that the right person is doing the right job to the benefit
of patients. In line with this, we intend to broaden the range of
professionals who can take on the key roles of responsible medical
officer and approved social worker. The responsible medical officer
role is being replaced with the role of responsible clinician. A
patient&#146;s responsible clinician will have overall responsibility
for their case and make key decisions, such as whether a patient should
be discharged or go on supervised community treatment. Allowing the
responsible clinician role to be taken on by a broader range of
appropriately skilled and trained professionals will give hospitals the
flexibility to select someone whose skills best meet the
patient&#146;s treatment needs. Where a patient mainly needs
treatment from a doctor, such as medication, a doctor will be the
responsible clinician. But, for example, if a patient has a personality
disorder and the treatment mostly involves psychological interventions,
such as cognitive behavioural therapy, a psychologist may have the
skills most appropriate to the role of responsible clinician for that
patient.</p><p><a name="06112884000152"></a>The current approved
social worker role is being replaced by the role of approved mental
health professional. The functions of the role will remain largely
unchanged, but the role will be opened up to a broader range of
professionals, often working in the same integrated community mental
health teams as approved social workers.</p><p><a name="06112884000153"></a>We are committed to improving patient
safeguards and will do this by taking a power to allow the time to be
reduced before a patient&#146;s case is referred to the mental health
review tribunal. Of course, a patient can always apply for a tribunal
hearing and this will 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_659"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 659</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not change their current rights, but it will improve the safety net for
those who do not apply. Currently, patients who do not apply wait for
six months before their case is referred to the tribunal. We want to
reduce that, but we will not use this power until hospitals and
tribunals have capacity to meet the reduced time limits. This responds
to evidence provided to the Joint
Committee.</p><p><a name="06112884000154"></a>Two other important
patient safeguards are being introduced. The first will give patients
the ability to apply to the county court to displace the nearest
relative if they believe they are unsuitable; for example, if the
relationship with the patient is abusive. This is important as the
nearest relative has various powers under the Mental Health Act such as
being able to apply for or to block detention, to request a review of
detention and to receive certain information about the patient. The
court will be allowed to displace the nearest relative indefinitely,
making this difficult time less arduous and complicated for all those
involved.</p><p><a name="06112884000155"></a>We will also make some
amendments to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 in response to the 2004
judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. The court found that a
man had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty in Bournewood Hospital
because he had not been admitted under a legal process which included
safeguards against arbitrary detention, and he was not able to benefit
from speedy access to a court to consider his case. The Bournewood
safeguards will protect the human rights of people who are not able to
decide about their care and who, for their own protection, need to be
cared for in a hospital or care home in a way that deprives them of
their liberty. This could apply, for example, to some people with
severe learning disabilities or dementia. These safeguards will set up
a legal process of independent assessment of each case for depriving
the person of liberty. Each person will have a representative who is
given the right to initiate a further review of their case or to apply
to the Court of Protection on their behalf.</p><p><a name="06112884000156"></a>We have recognised that
clinicians have confidence in the 1983 Act and are familiar with it. We
have listened carefully to the wide variety of strong views expressed.
We have considered all the arguments and now have a balanced and
focused group of measures that improve patient safeguards, modernise
terminology and produce proportionate changes in the area of supervised
community treatment that will benefit patients and the wider public in
the small minority of circumstances where they are appropriate. We will
of course listen carefully in Committee to any improvements that can be
made and, as I said earlier, we are also willing to listen to any
suggestions for improving the draft code of practice. We must recognise
that changes in our mental health legislation are needed. They have
admittedly been a long time coming but, the longer we delay, the more
our mental health legislation falls behind the advances made in
services and in human rights legislation. The time for change is now. I
commend the Bill to the
House.</p><p><a name="06112884000157"></a>Moved, That the Bill be

Carnegy of Lour:</b> My Lords, I am sure that the
whole House has listened with enormous interest to the
Minister&#146;s very clear explanation of the somewhat complicated
contents of this important Bill. As I listened, I found myself
reflecting that occasionally, though mercifully not often, legislation
is clearly needed but it is difficult to know precisely what changes to
the law should be made or even what the alternatives are. This Bill is
an example of that. It has a long history: seven years of careful and
skilled consideration, including two previous draft Bills, two reports
and much consultation. Yet there is still considerable anxiety and
disagreement about whether what the Government are now proposing is
right.</p><p><a name="06112884000159"></a>Unlike a number of noble
Lords due to speak later in the debate, who know a great deal about the
subject matter of the Bill&#151;I have a former Secretary of State
for Health sitting beside me, which is somewhat unnerving&#151;I am a
complete layman in these matters. I have not been formally involved in
the previous consideration of the Bill, but I have a particular
interest for three reasons. When, many years ago, I served as the
chairman of a medical research ethics committee, we had within our area
of responsibility a large hospital for people with severe mental health
problems. Inevitably, some research proposals that came before us, such
as trials of certain drugs, could be carried out only by involving
patients in that hospital&#151;patients unable themselves to give
their assent to participate. The committee gave each proposal careful
consideration, centring on the potential benefits for such patients of
the drug, the safeguards and issues of assent. Difficult decisions had
to be made, but I believe that they were not entirely dissimilar from
those that have to be made on this Bill.</p><p><a name="06112884000160"></a>I have a personal interest in the Bill
because of contact with mental disorder problems through cases among my
own friends and family. I am sure that I share that experience with
many other noble Lords. I do not believe that that contact is at all
irrelevant to our discussions.</p><p><a name="06112884000161"></a>I
am interested in the Scottish dimension to the Bill. It applies mainly
to England and Wales, but there are cross-border arrangements in
Schedule 5, under Clause 32. In addition, the Minister touched on the
fact that the Scots Parliament has recently legislated on these matters
and useful comparisons may be
possible.</p><p><a name="06112884000162"></a>Quite a lot of the
Bill is completely incomprehensible without the Explanatory Notes, due
to how it is drafted in terms of amending other legislation. Having
read the Explanatory Notes, I should like to make one general point on
what lies at the heart of the main provisions of the Bill. I refer to
rights&#151;those of patients, children, their families and the rest
of the community. The briefing I have seen&#151;some of which I
received only an hour or two ago&#151;and the problems met by
predecessor Bills centre mainly on deep anxiety about the rights of
patients and of those suffering from a mental disorder, and what the
Government propose for them. That is not surprising. This is, after
all, a health Bill; it 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_661"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 661</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is about patients and of course Parliament must take those rights very
seriously. It is always when the most vulnerable appear threatened that
Parliament must be at its most vigilant.</p><p><a name="06112884000163"></a>We must be very
careful in our considerations. Other people have rights, too, not just
the most vulnerable. Parliament exists to protect the rights of all
people and to balance them when they conflict. It is so easy, in our
concern to protect those who cannot protect themselves, to forget the
major threat those self-same people can be to others in certain
circumstances, as well as to themselves. The court cases which have
been discussed often in relation to the Bill illustrate this
graphically and disturbingly, as did a moving article which some of
your Lordships may have read in the <I>Observer</I> two Sundays ago.
The father of a 17 year-old with schizophrenia described in simple,
factual, unemotional detail how the system as it exists, operating with
the best will in the world, handled the young man and his family, to
the young man&#146;s great danger and suffering, and who knows what
fate.</p><p><a name="06112884000164"></a>The
status quo will not do&#151;the Minister has said that. It must be
wrong in extreme cases, in the name of rights and freedom, to allow
someone to fail to take his medication if that means he becomes
dangerous to other people or to himself. It must be wrong, too, in the
name of rights and freedom, to allow someone with a caring family to
become homeless, unprotected and out of that family&#146;s reach. It
must be wrong, in the name of rights and freedom, to forget that
sometimes, for some people, compulsory detention is salvation.
Subsequent treatment in the community, if it can be made to work, may
be able to be designed so as to be a salvation,
too.</p><p><a name="06112884000165"></a>My simple
point&#151;your Lordships may think it is too naïve but I
believe it is important&#151;is that, as we work our way through
these proposals, it must be possible to maintain a proper balance of
consideration. This may be a health Bill about patients but it is also
about families, friends, communities and public safety. The problems
confronted by the Government in the Bill are difficult but they are
real problems; they affect the freedoms and rights not only of the
weakest but of us all. At the same time, let us remember that the
system as it is cannot
continue.</p><h5><a name="06112884000285"></a>3.36

Rix:</b> My Lords, the journey towards a new Mental
Health Act over the past eight years or so has been a long one. I
cannot help feeling that, although there have been some interesting
steps along the way, the journey has taken us back where we started,
with a rather disappointing Bill. It fails to take into account the
concerns of most people who work in mental health services and of most
people who use mental health services.</p><p><a name="06112884000167"></a>I had the privilege of serving with MPs
and Peers of all parties on the Joint Committee on the draft Mental
Health Bill under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile. We
heard evidence from a wide variety of experts before making a long
series of 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_662"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 662</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recommendations which we believed would have substantially improved the
legislation and created a legal framework for compulsory mental health
treatment which would have enjoyed the support of most of those who
required it. Reading the new streamlined Bill, it feels that the only
point we made that the Government have accepted is that the 2004 draft
Bill was too long and too difficult to follow. Indeed it was&#151;but
that does not mean that a shorter Bill is necessarily better,
especially as the shorter Bill retains most of the provisions we were
most concerned about and omits some of the better ones such as those
relating to advocacy and improved patient representation. It may be
that our report was too long and too difficult for the Government to
understand too.</p><p><a name="06112884000168"></a>My role on the
Joint Committee was to keep plugging away on the question of learning
disability. I welcome the fact that the Bill&#146;s single definition
of mental disorder now excludes learning disability in most cases. But
it retains the caveat that people whose only mental disorder is a
learning disability may be subjected to compulsion where that
disability,</p><ul><a name="06112884000261"></a>&#147;is
associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible
conduct&#148;.</ul><a name="06112884000169"></a>These
words are very familiar to me because they arrived in the 1983 Act
after a long three-way process of negotiation on the telephone between
the then Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Elton, myself, then in my
capacity as secretary general of Mencap, anda copy of
<I>Roget&#146;s Thesaurus</I>. It was the best compromise we could
then reach between the Government&#146;s position that people with a
learning disability should come under the scope of the Act, and my
position that people with a learning disability are not ill and should
not be treated as if they are. It appears that the Department of
Health&#146;s position,23 years and a change of Government
later, has not changed&#151;but neither has
mine.<p><a name="06112884000170"></a>Learning disability was
not then, and is not now, a mental illness. In many cases, of course,
where a person with a learning disability is aggressive or
irresponsible, that can be a sign that he or she has a mental illness
that would benefit from medical treatment&#151;in which case they can
be treated under compulsion if necessary anyway&#151;but that is not
always the case. It may, for example, be a sign that he or she is in
pain or is otherwise distressed but has difficulty communicating this
or explaining it to others, and is frustrated. Responding to a
person&#146;s pain or distress with detention and forced medication
is unlikely to improve things.</p><p><a name="06112884000171"></a>I would much prefer to see a complete
exclusion from the scope of the Bill of people whose only mental
disorder is a learning disability. After all, if people with a learning
disability lack capacity, and if treatment is in their best interests,
they can in any case be treated under the Mental Capacity Act. That is
an Act in which I also have an interest as I was part of the Joint
Committee scrutinising it, when it was the Mental Incapacity Bill,
under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord
Carter.</p>



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_663"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 663</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06112884000172"></a>A recommendation both
committees made regarding the Bills we were scrutinising was that
principles should be on the face of those Bills, rather than being
relegated to a code of practice. Such principles make legislation much
easier for practitioners to understand, and form an important
safeguard. However, while principles are now on the face of the Mental
Capacity Act, the Government have so far refused to accept that they
should be part of the Mental Health Bill. I hope that they will be able
to change their mind on that, or, if not, that they can explain why
such principles as best interests, non-discrimination, least
restrictive alternative and child welfare are not compatible with the
legislation as proposed.</p><p><a name="06112884000173"></a>The
Mental Capacity Act is crucial to the Bill, as much of the Bill is
concerned with amending that Act in respect of Bournewood patients;
that is, patients who lack capacity and are deprived of their liberty.
If, in redrafting the Mental Health Bill, the Government were motivated
by the desire to avoid inordinate length and complexity, that concern
appears to have disappeared in relation to Bournewood patients. The
relevant sections of the Bill&#151;Clauses 38 and 39, and Schedules
6, 7 and 8&#151;amount to more than 50 pages.
</p><p><a name="06112884000174"></a>The Bournewood provisions have
received far less publicity than the other sections, but they were
mentioned by the Minister, Rosie Winterton, on the
&#147;Today&#148; programme on the day the Bill was published. She
rightly noted that perhaps thousands of people who lack capacity may be
being deprived of liberty, and that they currently do not have the same
access to a mental health tribunal. Listeners might have been forgiven
for assuming that the Government wanted to give them the same access to
such a tribunal, but that is not the case. No, they have access instead
to the Court of Protection, which lacks the expertise of the tribunal
in making judgments about care plans and detention.</p><p><a name="06112884000175"></a>In fact, the Government&#146;s
proposals for Bournewood patients leave them lacking several of the
safeguards enjoyed&#151;if &#147;enjoyed&#148; is the
word&#151;by Mental Health Act patients. They may be deprived of
liberty in an emergency for up to seven days, as against 72 hours for
Mental Health Act patients. They may have the detention authorised for
up to12 months, as against six months for Mental Health Act
patients. They have no statutory second medical opinion procedure for
medication beyond three months or for electro-convulsive therapy. They
have no entitlement to free aftercare for care and treatment consequent
on the care and treatment they received on detention. While the
safeguards for Mental Health Act patients and Bournewood patients need
not be identical, those for Bournewood patients should not be second
rate. I hope that the Government will think again about the unequal
two-tier system they are proposing to set up and give better safeguards
to patients who are, by virtue of their lack of mental capacity,
perhaps the most vulnerable in the whole health and social care
system.</p><p><a name="06112884000176"></a>The
vulnerability of people with learning disabilities in residential care
was shockingly highlighted earlier this year by the report of the
Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection on
the 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_664"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 664</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>abuse of patients in learning disability services in the Cornwall
Partnership NHS Trust. The report was prompted not by the managers of
those services, many of whom were culpably unaware of the abuse that
was taking place, but by patients&#146; families and by the hard work
of East Cornwall Mencap Society. Families and friends are often the
first people to become aware of abuse or poor practice within hospitals
and care homes, and yet the Bill proposes that the only person with any
right to call for an assessment and authorisation of possible
deprivation of liberty in a hospital or care home is the manager of the
hospital or care home in question. I hope that the Government will
consider amending the Bill to ensure that third parties will have the
right to request an authorisation of the deprivation of liberty to make
sure that the responsibility for identifying deprivation of liberty is
not exclusively placed upon the very people responsible for depriving
them of liberty in the first
place.</p><p><a name="06112884000177"></a>Given the importance of
ensuring that hospital and care home managers follow best practice in
relation to the care of vulnerable people, I am very concerned that the
focus on authorising deprivation of liberty may obscure the fact that,
in almost all cases, deprivation of liberty is unnecessary and should
not be authorised.</p><p><a name="06112884000178"></a>The
Bournewood provisions should be about preventing deprivation of
liberty, not rubber-stamping it. Depriving a person of liberty rarely,
if ever, reflects best practice. Whatever else one might want to say
about the detention in Bournewood Hospital of the autistic man known as
HL, which led to the Bournewood judgment, it certainly did not
represent the least restrictive possible care regime. It would be
helpful if the Governments could give more examples of when a person
who lacks capacity in a hospital or care home should be kept in
circumstances which amount to a deprivation of liberty under Article 5
of the European Convention of Human Rights. I am not sure that this is
very often, if ever, best practice and I am not sure that we should be
writing new laws to allow it to
happen.</p><p><a name="06112884000179"></a>I regret that this still
seems a deeply flawed Bill. Those of us who have played a part in this
eight-year process know that this is not for want of effort, evidence
and argument. It is still not too late to undo most of those flaws. I
know that noble Lords from all sides of the House and individuals and
organisations involved in every aspect of the care and treatment of
people with mental health problems will be working hard together to
make improvements across the board. I urge the Government to listen to
them.</p><h5><a name="06112884000286"></a>3.46

strike a balance between the rights and autonomy of patients and the
safety of both patients and the public. Certainly, Christian teaching
in its concern to protect vulnerable people requires due weight to be
given to both aspects. Autonomy is a vital safeguard for mentally ill
people in giving priority to their opinions, feelings and interests
concerning care and treatment over and against the interests of others,
including the relatively powerful professionals and institutions
treating them. However, autonomy may need to be limited or indeed
overridden, either because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said,
someone poses a danger to themselves or, less commonly, to other
people, or because their ability to make decisions has been
significantly impaired by their illness. Regrettably, the latter
criterion is absent from the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06112884000182"></a>Six issues are of
particular concern to these Benches. First, as the noble Lord, Lord
Rix, said, is the absence from the Bill of a set of general principles
for the care and treatment of people with mental health problems. That
is very disappointing. Such principles expressed in statute rather than
in codes of practice would be helpful to practitioners and reassuring
to service users not only when facing questions about compulsory powers
but as a broad guide to good
practice.</p><p><a name="06112884000183"></a>Secondly, if the
definition of &#147;mental disorder&#148; is to be simplified, as
proposed in Clause 1, it is important that the specific exclusions from
coverage of the Act should be maintained and, preferably, extended.
Compulsory detention and treatment should be based strictly on mental
disorder and should certainly not be used for the purpose of social
control. I welcome the continued restriction on the circumstances in
which people with learning disabilities can be subjected to compulsion,
and the exclusion of substance abuse. I note what the Minister has said
and what has been written in background material on sexual deviance. In
Committee, it may be useful to debate all these matters and possibly
certain cultural and political beliefs when considering grounds for
exclusion. Problems in applying the categories should be tackled by
training and not by the adoption of an excessively broad
definition.</p><p><a name="06112884000184"></a>Thirdly, the
potential danger posed by a relatively small number of people with
severe personality disorders that are judged to be untreatable must not
be allowed to blur the distinction between compulsory treatment and
preventive detention. The criterion of &#147;appropriate medical
treatment&#148; employed in Clauses 4 to 6 without the requirement of
therapeutic benefit to the patient is unacceptably vague. It threatens
to turn mental health professionals into guardians of public safety
rather than what they are meant to be, which is agents of care and
healing. If, as the Government argue, there is no desire to detain
people without a clinical purpose, why not say so explicitly? Those who
are untreatable but are 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_666"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 666</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>believed to pose a serious risk to other people should be dealt with
under criminal justice rather than mental health
legislation.</p><p><a name="06112884000185"></a>Fourthly, there is
perhaps the most controversial part of the Bill, the proposals in
Clauses 25 to 29 for supervised community treatment. They arise from
real shortcomings at present in dealing with patients who have been
discharged from hospital and then suffer relapse in the community.
However, those failings, which as we know sometimes have tragic
results, are not solely the result of the absence of compulsory
treatment. Too often, they reflect the inadequacy of aftercare and
support services and failure to work effectively with patients and
carers within the existing law. That said, I accept that there is a
case for community treatment orders to be applied to what the Joint
Committee described as
a,</p><ul><a name="06112884000262"></a>&#147;clearly defined
and clinically identifiable group of patients&#148;.</ul>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61128-0004.htm"/>


<a name="06112884000251"></a>That would entail
raising the threshold of eligibility to include previous relapse,
requiring consultation with carers, narrowing the conditions of the
order to residence and availability for treatment, and setting a time
limit. The requirement that a patient should abstain from particular
conduct is, as the Mental Health Alliance has commented, tantamount to
creating a &#147;psychiatric ASBO&#148;. We must think carefully
about designing community treatment orders so that they will be
effective for their intended
purpose.<p><a name="06112884000186"></a>Fifthly,
it is welcome that in Clause 38 the Government have moved to remedy the
so-called Bournewood gap, which was referred to both by the Minister
and the noble Lord, Lord Rix, by amending the Mental Capacity Act.
While logical in its way, this has the effect of creating a complicated
set of procedures with safeguards that are inferior to those of the
Mental Health Act. Patients who lack the capacity to consent to
detention and treatment will be disadvantaged in terms of their rights
to a second medical opinion, to a hearing and to aftercare. They will
be disadvantaged in the maximum length of a detention order and lack of
access to a mental health review tribunal. In addition, their relatives
will not be able to request an assessment of detention or an ordering
of their discharge. This smacks of minimal compliance with human rights
legislation and I hope that in subsequent debate in Committee your
Lordships will be able to suggest suitable
improvements.</p><p><a name="06112884000187"></a>Finally, I regret
that the limited scope of the Bill has diverted attention from the
primary need to improve mental health services. If we were to take
seriously the right of patients to timely assessment of mental health
needs, to independent advocacy and to non-discriminatory treatment, we
would be less preoccupied with crisis intervention and a great deal of
avoidable suffering and distress would have been prevented. The
Scottish mental health Act of 2003 offers a good starting point in that
respect. We will need to return to these urgent questions which,
together with families and carers, directly affect one quarter of the
population of this country.</p>

2007-08</h3><h5><a name="06112884000287"></a>3.56

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My Lords,
with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made
earlier in another place by my right honourable friend the Minister for
Local Government about local authority revenue finance for England in
2007-08. The Statement is as
follows:</p>&#147;Sensible
planning for service delivery needs a stable and predictable funding
environment. The quality of councils&#146; forward budget plans,
their relations with stakeholders whose budgets they support, and their
ability to set low and sustainable council taxes, will all be promoted
by predictable
funding.&#147;As I told the
House last January, we were then setting out firm proposals for forward
financial allocations on a two-year basis, including the use of
projected data for population and council tax base. As 2007-08 is the
second year of a multi-year settlement, my policy is not to change the
settlement, including the data used in the grant calculations, from
that previously announced, other than in exceptional
circumstances.&#147;This
year&#146;s announcement therefore contains no surprises for local
authorities. I make a virtue of that, because I am convinced of the
advantages of multi-year financial planning and most of what I hear
from councils and their delivery partners, such as those in the third
sector, supports that view. Today&#146;s announcement launches a
period of statutory consultation and I will fully consider any
representations made during the consultation period in the light of my
policy in relation to multi-year settlements.
&#147;Within the framework of
stability, I am able to provide adjustments to grant allocations for
the voluntary merger of the fire services of Devon and Somerset under a
new single combined authority, should that go ahead for
2007-08.&#147;I am also
updating today details of individual specific grant allocations to
local authorities for 2007-08.
&#147;With the next spending review
period we will move to give three years of grant allocations to local
government; that is, for 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11. The stability
provided by multi-year settlements will allow local government to
publish three-year council tax figures and we would expect it to take
up this
opportunity.&#147;More
widely, this security on funding will enable councils to move forward
on providing the more flexible, efficient and responsive services to
their communities as set out in our October 2006 White Paper, <I>Strong
and prosperous communities</I>. It will facilitate the move towards
new, more inclusive local area agreements, tailored to meet the needs
of 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_668"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 668</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the individual area and drawing together different stakeholders to
provide better, more cost-effective services that seamlessly meet the
needs of
clients.&#147;Total revenue
grants to English authorities will be &#163;65.7 billion in 2007-08,
an increase over 2006-07 of &#163;3.1 billion or 4.9 per cent. Part
of that increase is in specific grants and it includes dedicated
funding for schools and a further&#163;525 million in
Neighbourhood Renewal Fund, allocating extra help to the 86 most
deprived local authority areas in England. Within that total, formula
grant will total &#163;25.6 billion in 2007-08, an increase of 3.7
per cent.&#147;This means
that, by 2007-08, the increase in government grant for local services
since taking office will be 39 per cent in real terms. The provisional
standard multiplier for national non-domestic rates in 2007-08 will be
44.4 pence in the pound; and the small business non-domestic rating
multiplier will be 44.1 pence. This means that once again business and
other non-domestic users can look forward to predictable and stable
rates. &#147;Grant floors,
the minimum guaranteed increase from one year to the next, are a
permanent part of the system. I need to strike a balance between
funding stability and the cost of the floor. I am able this year to
improve floor protection for fire and rescue authorities, while easing
the impact of floors on upper tier and shire district authorities. I
can therefore today confirm my proposal that, for 2007-08, the floors
will be: for authorities with education and social services
responsibilities, 2.7 per cent; for police authorities, 3.6 per cent;
for fire and rescue authorities, 2.7 per cent; and for shire district
authorities, 2.7 per cent. Within each group of authorities, those
above the floor will have their grant increase scaled back to pay for
the floor. &#147;We have
provided a stable and predictable funding basis for local services. We
expect local government to respond positively as far as council tax is
concerned. Therefore we expect to see an average council tax increase
in England in 2007-08 of less than 5 per cent.  We will not
allow excessive council tax increases. We have used our reserve capping
powers in previous years to deal with excessive increases and will not
hesitate to do so again if that proves necessary.
&#147;I am also announcing
consultation on alternative notional amounts for Devon and
Somerset Fire and Rescue Authority and Somerset County Council. That
will help enable like-for-like comparisons between 2006-07 and 2007-08
budget requirements for capping purposes. This is being issued today
for consultation to ensure that, should the proposed merger go
ahead for 2007-08, the relevant authorities will know, in advance of
setting their budgets, the budget requirement figure for
2006-07 that the Government will use when
considering using their capping powers.
&#147;I would now like to turn to the
Supporting People programme. Supporting People has proved to be a
highly successful programme providing support to more than 1 million
vulnerable people 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_669"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 669</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>each year. In July I announced almost &#163;1.7 billion investment in
supporting people and am pleased to now confirm these grant allocations
for 2007-08. Additionally, I can announce a further &#163;40 million
of administration grant for authorities in 2007-08 to help them manage
this important programme. I am also pleased to announce that where
authorities have generated savings in the programme through their
careful management they will be able to roll forward these savings from
2006-07 to 2007-08 in order to re-invest in the programme.
&#147;The Government
have provided another significant boost to local authorities with a
financial package that is stable, predictable, and adequate to meet the
pressures local authorities face while keeping council tax increases
down to acceptable levels. I have placed copies of tables giving grant
allocations and supporting documentation in the Vote Office and the
Library and full details are being made available for local authorities
on our website. I look forward to receiving consultation responses and
commend these proposals to the House&#148;.
<a name="06112884000252"></a>My Lords, that concludes the
Statement.<h5><a name="06112884000288"></a>4.03

Hanham:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
repeating the Statement made in the other place earlier today. In
replying to the Statement, I declare my interest as an elected member
of a local authority.
</p><p><a name="06112884000190"></a>I agree that
sensible planning for service delivery needs predictable funding. The
possibility of being able to plan ahead over a three-year period would
be welcome if there was a stable framework in which to do so. Sadly,
there never is, and something always comes out of the woodwork that is
underfunded or unfunded. The last time a Statement on local government
revenue was made before the Chancellor&#146;s autumn Financial
Statement to the House, it ended in chaos, with the Chancellor being
forced to provide some extra money. So is this Statement a prequel to
the real Financial Statement next month or is it part 1 of the
settlement? What representations will the Minister be making to the
Chancellor on the many new burdens facing local
government?</p><p><a name="06112884000191"></a>There is a worrying
element of wilful blindness about this Statement, which ignores the
reality on the ground. One of the key drivers for soaring council tax
is the failure of the Government to finance fully the burdens that they
impose on local government from Whitehall. This year, we have seen the
additional burdens of the Licensing Act, the electrical waste directive
and the landfill allowance scheme, as well as new measures on children
in care, concessionary bus travel and school meal standards. Next year,
on top of those, we will see the implementation of the Gambling Act,
the Electoral Administration Act, the information-sharing index and the
public smoking ban.</p><p><a name="06112884000192"></a>The
Government should either finance those transparently and admit the
implications for national spending or allow discretion on local
priorities with regard to what is implemented&#151;and at what
stage&#151;and what is not, and allow local government to have a 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_670"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 670</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>say in that. None of these regulatory impositions, many of which are
worthy, has so far been backed up with proper funds, and it is not
clear from the Statement or the papers that we have before us where
they are now.</p><p><a name="06112884000193"></a>Each year, the
financial settlement fails to address the challenges faced by local
authorities, and so, to the Government&#146;s amazement, council tax
rises by above the rate of inflation. Since 1997, council tax bills
have rocketed by 84 per cent, taking the average bill in 2006-07 to
&#163;1,268 for band D properties. The Government say that they
expect rises this year to be limited to5 per cent. That would
mean an extra &#163;63 on a band D bill. It does not sound much, but
that is the mean average and the increase will be considerably higher
in many authorities. In many cases, it will hit very hard those who can
least afford it.</p><p><a name="06112884000194"></a>In addition to
the council tax rises, have the Government calculated the effects of
rising water bills, gas bills and electricity bills on those struggling
to make ends meet? What is the estimate of theextra burden on
the vulnerable&#151;particularly elderly people, who sometimes live
in a home which they do not want to leave and which is larger than they
may require but whose bills rise remorselessly and well in excess of
their increases in pension? If council tax bills rise yearly by 5 per
cent, by the end of this Parliament the average council tax bill will
be almost &#163;1,500 for a band D bill.</p><p><a name="06112884000195"></a>Year on year, a greater burden of tax has
been shifted on to local tax payers. There has been no amelioration in
their tax elsewhere, and it is as plain as a pikestaff that there will
be no help in the future. Further tax rises are part of the
Chancellor&#146;s plans, whether through higher council tax bands, an
oppressive revaluation based on the amenities in or improvements to a
property, or a Northern Ireland-style house price tax.</p><p><a name="06112884000196"></a>Will not residents in London expect even
higher bills, thanks to the possibility of a new parish council
tax&#151;yet another tier of administration&#151;and especially
given the blank cheque for the Olympics, as well as the ever-increasing
levy imposed by the Mayor of London? Will the Minister confirm to the
House that, under the Memorandum of Understanding between the
Government and the Mayor of London, London council tax payers are
expected to foot one-third of the bill of any shortfall between Olympic
costs and revenues? How does that square with the assurance given by
the Mayor of London that he will not allow the burden on Londoners to
increase? What assurance is the Minister prepared to give today that
his view will prevail? Londoners are delighted that the Olympics are to
be in this city, but they will become jaundiced about that if the
remorseless rise in costs, which is already becoming apparent, falls on
them and is well in excess of the levy that they are already
facing.</p><p><a name="06112884000197"></a>We have been waiting
and waiting for Sir Michael Lyons&#146;s report, which we were all
assured would form the basis for any review of council tax and which
was delayed because the Government wanted him to take into account
councils&#146; powers and responsibilities. The report now seems to
be going further and further 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_671"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 671</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>into the long grass. It is reported in this week&#146;s
<I>MJ</I>&#151;the Minister may like to comment on this&#151;that
the Government have never made a commitment to publish the report at
all. So what are the Government doing? Why are they wasting the time of
a man ofSir Michael&#146;s calibre if the work that he is
doing is not going to play into the improvement of local government? Or
is it just that the Government have been so involved in what he is
doing that his recommendations will not require legislation? Are the
Government afraid of the impact of what he is putting forward? Will the
Minister give a clear undertaking that the Government will publish Sir
Michael&#146;s recommendations well in advance of the debate on this
year&#146;s settlement and well in advance of its
completion?</p><p><a name="06112884000198"></a>In
the area of the environment, many burdens are increasing. For example,
the Chancellor has set in place a landfill tax escalator, making
municipal waste collection ever more expensive. Rather than funding the
costs, however, the Government are putting them on to local tax payers.
What is the landfill tax escalator this year and how much more of the
burden is meant to fall on council tax payers?</p><p><a name="06112884000199"></a>The Local Government Association and the
National Health Service Confederation have published new research
revealing that seven out of10 local authorities have been hit
by cost-cutting pressures from NHS trusts, including the withdrawal of
funding from jointly funded projects and a sharp increase in the
referral of patients, who would normally be cared for by the NHS, to
local communities. We shall debate those costs later this month, but I
cannot finish without drawing attention to the fact that it is
beginning to look as though there is a shift in burden from the NHS to
local tax payers. </p><p><a name="06112884000200"></a>Soothing
words about forward allocations and three-year settlements are useless
if the burden of taxation increases remorselessly. This is the end of a
two-year settlement. In view of the Government&#146;s proposals in
the new Local Government Bill and whether they pay any attention to Sir
Michael Lyons, a lot of water has to pass under the bridge before we
get to a three-year settlement. I look forward to future debates on
this subject.</p><h5><a name="06112884000289"></a>4.12

Scott of Needham Market:</b> My Lords, I thank the
Minister for repeating the Statement. I note that the contents of the
Statement prompt the start of a period of consultation. Not many days
ago, the Local Government Association produced a document outlining its
view of the future; the response from the Minister in another place was
to tell the LGA to stop whingeing and to go away and take another look.
If that is the level of the dialogue between central government and the
Local Government Association, frankly, I despair. I would like an
assurance from the noble Baroness that the Government will consider
very carefully and seriously the issues that the Local Government
Association has raised on behalf of its local authority members. If the
dialogue between central and local government descends into Punch and
Judy, the losers will be the citizens in our local areas.</p>

repeat over and over again that local authorities have been given a 39
per cent increase in funding in the past 10 years. The fact is that
most of that cash has gone straight into schools. Although that
investment is welcome, it is disingenuous to suggest that it has gone
to local councils for local services. When we take into account other
ring-fenced funds, such as this year&#146;s investment in
neighbourhood renewal, which applies only to certain areas, the actual
increase in funds available for councils to spend in the past 10 years
has been 14 per cent, which is a much more modest figure than the 90
per cent increasefor the National Health Service. This has
primarily been achieved though a largely hidden transfer of taxation
from central government to the local council tax
payer.</p><p><a name="06112884000203"></a>The Statement referred to
the capping regime. Will the Government reconsider the crude
application of a 5 per cent capping limit? That is a particular problem
for small local authorities that have traditionally set a low council
tax, because they have much less scope in real terms than those
councils that have a high
base.</p><p><a name="06112884000204"></a>As we have heard, there
are some serious pressures on local authorities. Changing demography
means that, this year, an additional 390,000 people aged over 65 will
potentially come under the auspices of social services departments. In
addition, the financial collapse of some primary care and hospital
trusts, alongside hospital closures in some areas, is putting a huge
strain on councils&#146; social services departments. These have not
come out of the blue sky&#151;the warnings have been there for about
the past two years.</p><p><a name="06112884000205"></a>For a
variety reasons, cost inflation is far outstripping the base rate in
some sectors. The cost of social care contracts is increasing by about
7 per cent a year and the cost of tendered bus contracts is increasing
by 4.5 per cent. I make special mention of the landfill tax, declaring
an interest as a board member of Entrust, the regulator. Landfill tax
is increasing by about 15 per cent per year, which is a huge burden on
waste disposal authorities. Last year, &#163;780 million pounds were
collected in landfill tax;&#163;53 million went to approved
environmental schemes, while the rest&#151;&#163;733
million&#151;went straight to the Exchequer. Councils are having to
increase council tax in order to pay this. Appropriately, since we are
talking about waste, the money is recycled straight back into Gordon
Brown&#146;s coffers.</p><p><a name="06112884000206"></a>Local
government has undertaken all the improvement challenges set by central
government. It has absorbed the costs of the targets regime. Its
contribution to the Gershon efficiency programme has saved &#163;3
billion a year before the savings were due, and has far outstripped the
performance of government departments. We, too, look forward to hearing
the results of Sir Michael Lyons&#146;s report and fervently hope
that an end to the practice of funding national burdens through local
taxation&#151;the hard-pressed council tax payer&#151;comes out of
it.</p><h5><a name="06112884000290"></a>4.17

said at the beginning of the Statement: we are committed to stable and
predictable funding. A 39 per cent increase in real terms over the past
10 years is a serious undertaking, which has had to drive the many
improvements that the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, mentioned. I pay
tribute to the hard work of local authorities. We have seen that they
have achieved efficiencies and improved the quality of
services.</p><p><a name="06112884000209"></a>I start with the
issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. The Government are
fully committed to meeting the net additional costs of new burdens. For
example, over the past two years we have put in an extra &#163;250
million for concessionary fares. We have said that licensing fees will
be set at a level to recover the justifiable costs of local authority
functions under the Licensing Act 2003. We have established an
independent fees panel to consider the legitimate costs; the panel will
report to the Secretary of State shortly, and we would not want to
pre-empt that. The DTI is fully committed to funding the additional
costs of the WEEE directive and has already transferred an additional
&#163;12.3 million into the 2006-07 RSG settlement. We are working
with the LGA to agree what further costs are being incurred and whether
funding beyond this period is required before full producer
responsibility is implemented.</p><p><a name="06112884000210"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned smoke-free
places. Health Ministers have made clear their commitment to ensuring
that authorities are funded for their enforcement role. The Department
of Health is discussing costs with the LGA and reasserting those
commitments. We will be making an announcement on that shortly. The
noble Baroness talked about increases of 5 per cent in council tax. One
of the virtues of a two-year settlement is that one can look back.
Indeed, not every local authority raised their council tax by 5 per
cent last year and we do not expect that to happen this year.</p><p><a name="06112884000211"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned the
possibility that Northern Ireland will be used as a precedent for
whatever changes Sir Michael Lyons proposes in his report. I have said
in this House at least twice that Northern Ireland does not offer us a
precedent, because it is starting from a different base and has a
different system.</p><p><a name="06112884000212"></a>The noble
Baroness then asked about pensioners. I take her point about vulnerable
people and council tax. One of the things that she and I agree on is
that we must try to make sure that the 40 per cent of pensioners who do
not claim their council tax benefit do so. That is why we are putting
great emphasis on automaticity of benefit, which is where we would like
to be. In the mean time, the Pension Service is doing a great deal of
work to make sure that people are picked up, but it has some way to go.
In that context, although I cannot answer her question about individual
bills, I can say that the Government are spending &#163;10.5 billion
more on pensioners in 2006-07 than we would have done if we had stuck
with the 1997 policies.</p><p><a name="06112884000213"></a>The
noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, raised the question of the Olympics and
the role of the London council tax payer. As she will know, the
Government 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_674"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 674</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the mayor have agreed that what the London council tax payer will
contribute to the games can be changed only with the agreement of the
mayor and the London Assembly. That is where we stand on that.
Discussions to determine how additional costs are to be funded are
ongoing, and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will
report to Parliament when a resolution has been reached.</p><p><a name="06112884000214"></a>The noble Baroness
asked about the publication of the Lyons report. Lyons is and always
has been central to our ambition for the improvement of local authority
services. There is no question but that what Sir Michael comes up with
will be fed into CSR07. The review is a report to Ministers; Sir
Michael will report by the end of the year and, at that point,
Ministers will take the decision about publication.</p><p><a name="06112884000215"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about the
landfill tax. I am afraid that I do not have that figure in my enormous
briefing, but I shall write to her about it.</p><p><a name="06112884000216"></a>The noble Baroness concluded by talking
about the shift into social care. There is no question but that this is
an area where we are fully aware of the pressures of demography. In
partnership with the Local Government Association, we have set up three
area working parties to look into the demands and pressures on the
system and into how, in the context of CSR07, we can prepare to develop
our polices in respect of them. As she said, we will have an
opportunity next week to discuss that at some
length.</p><p><a name="06112884000217"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady
Scott of Needham Market, started by talking about the LGA document
<I>Meeting the Challenge Ahead. </I>We are very pleased that the LGA is
engaged in the process of making its case for CSR07. There is no doubt
that we are having a serious dialogue with the Local Government
Association; we have done so with local authorities through the Central
and Local Government Information Partnership for many years. Three
areas of work are being developed at the moment: social care, waste and
pay. That is how we want to take the process forward. There is no
question but that it is a serious dialogue and that the 39 per cent
cash figure that we often discuss in this House is real. I know that we
reiterate it, but that does not make it any less real.
</p><p><a name="06112884000218"></a>We are a bit puzzled by the 14
per cent figure, because it is difficult to compare the situation in
1996 with now&#151;in 1996, we did not have a hypothecated education
tax or a dedicated schools budget, for example. But the noble Baroness
is wrong to say that there is no extra money going into different
services. For example, we made specific grants
totalling&#163;1.6 billion for adult social care. Huge
amounts of money are going in through specific grants, and the Local
Government Association has not mentioned that in its paper. There are
some other peculiarities about the way in which some of the assessments
have been made.</p><p><a name="06112884000219"></a>I can tell the
noble Baroness that no decisions have been taken on capping principles
yet. A crude universal capping is certainly not our policy. But, as I
say, no decisions on principles have been
taken.</p>

referred to the pressures on social services. Social care grants have
increased by 2.7 per cent this year. In our discussions with local
authorities, this is a serious area. It is extremely important that we
are sensible and straight about what we understand are the pressures in
the system and how they can best be met. The local government White
Paper, with the new local area agreements, represents a way forward in
effective joint working, which can bring all sorts of energies and
synergies between health and social services. That is our ambition on
that.</p><p><a name="06112884000221"></a>On landfill, the Local
Government Association made a strong case on waste, in that it is
clearly a pressure in the system. The amount of household waste over
the past couple of years has decreased. Enormous strides have been made
in recycling by local authorities. We are conscious that this is a
challenge, and we want to work with local authorities to help to meet
that challenge in the future.</p><p><a name="06112884000222"></a>I
was glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, referred to improvement
targets. It is important to put on record the extraordinary things that
local authorities have achieved over the past few years. We commend
them and support them in
that.</p><h5><a name="06112884000291"></a>4.26

Smith of Leigh:</b> My Lords, I
declare an interest as the leader of a local council. I thank my noble
friend for the Statement she repeated. As she said, there are no
surprises in it; it is based verymuch on the Statement given
last year. Is she aware that stability of funding has both advantages
and disadvantages? The advantage is in predictability. I suppose that
in some ways we had predictability under the previous
Government&#146;s financial settlements&#151;we could always
predict we would have less money year on year and would have to make
significant cuts in
spending.</p><p><a name="06112884000224"></a>The disadvantages are
that the provisions cannot take account of the pressures that noble
Lords have already stated. Many of these pressures are demand-led. They
are not based on simply wanting to grow services. For example, in my
own authority I am looking at the budget monetary statement for a
meeting this week. Since the beginning of term we have placed two
additional children in looked-after care, which will cost my authority
&#163;130,000 just in the current year, and costs of over
&#163;100,000 per pupil per year&#151;significant amounts of money.
We require this mature debate. It should be the beginning of a debate
between local authorities and government on how we are going to cope
with the pressures on us so that we can provide the services that
people need.</p><p><a name="06112884000225"></a>On the
consultation, I am sure that my noble friend is aware that we also need
to be consulted about the damping mechanism. Last year we assessed the
needs of local authorities and then proceeded to damp that down because
we did not want significant movements of money. I hope that we can also
get that into the
debate.</p><p><a name="06112884000226"></a><b><a name="61128-0005.htm_spnew69"></a><a name="06112884000371"></a>Baroness

children or three extra adults with learning disabilities, or whatever
it is. It is a great credit to the medical profession that such young
people are living longer and so on, but we have to base our estimates
on the best information we have. That is why we have used the 2003
projections, underpinned by notions of trends based on the 2004
figures. In the next settlement we will have an opportunity to bring
those figures up to date and to look at the formula. On that basis the
response to stable funding is more positive and the benefits outweigh
the difficulties that it may seem to create
sometimes.</p><p><a name="06112884000227"></a><b><a name="61128-0005.htm_spnew70"></a><a name="06112884000372"></a>Lord

question of social care in her response. According to the Local
Government Association, 80 per cent of local authorities have tightened
their eligibility criteria, and 70 per cent will now provide services
only for those who are judged to have either critical or substantial
need. Therefore, people with a learning disability with
parents&#151;many of whom are over70 years of age&#151;and
those with a moderate learning disability will miss out. Mencap has had
letters from all over the country from parents expressing their grave
concern. Can the Minister hazard an educated guess on how much extra in
percentage terms will go into social care to meet the extra demand
resulting from demographic
changes?</p><p><a name="06112884000228"></a><b><a name="61128-0005.htm_spnew71"></a><a name="06112884000373"></a>Baroness
Andrews:</b> My Lords, as I said, all local
authorities with social care responsibilities will get an increase this
year of 2.7 per cent. Within that, we have programmes such as
Supporting People, which heavily target vulnerable people, including
people with learning disability. As the noble Lord has raised a
specific point, I would prefer to write to him to give him additional
detail.</p><p><a name="06112884000229"></a><b><a name="61128-0005.htm_spnew72"></a><a name="06112884000374"></a>Viscount

little more from the Minister on the subject raised by my noble friend
Lord Rix. As it happens, we are discussing Second Reading of the Mental
Health Bill this afternoon. Of course, the people involved in those
services are supported by the NHS; but the people to whom my noble
friend specifically referred, those with learning disabilities, are
not. They are funded either in residential homes through county
councils or in supported living. Even the most efficient county
councils are now completely strapped for cash, so it is very difficult
to get adequate support for all those vulnerable people. Would the
Minister kindly take that point on board when she discusses the matter
with her friends in the

reflecting that the changes in the formula that we introduced to bring
the statistical base up to date revealed huge changes in the
population&#151;the sort of people and families to whom both noble
Lords referred. We introduced the damping mechanism, to use a
technicality, to ensure that there were not huge and unfair variations
in what was available. As I said, we will have an opportunity to
consider that formula flow again. We are very conscious that this is a

Greaves:</b> My Lords, last year, the Government
introduced a system throughout the country in which people over 60 got
free bus travel within their districts or boroughs, which was obviously
very welcome. The additional money that that cost district or borough
councils was, as I understand it, provided through the revenue support
grant. Earlier this year, the Chancellor announced that the scheme
would be extended to the whole of England, which will obviously cost
more money.</p><p><a name="06112884000232"></a>Has that been taken
account of in the revenue support grant settlement? How does that fit
with the Government&#146;s recent announcement that they have not yet
decided whether the new system will be administered nationally or
locally and, if it is administered locally, whether it will be funded
nationally or locally? Does the settlement as set out here include the
extra costs for passes for people over 60, which will now be usable
across the whole country rather than simply in their own
districts?</p><p><a name="06112884000233"></a><b><a name="61128-0005.htm_spnew75"></a><a name="06112884000377"></a>Baroness
Andrews:</b> Yes, my Lords, to the best of my
understanding. We have made available a further&#163;250
million to fund the extension of the scheme that we announced recently.
No decisions have yet been taken on how it will be delivered. The
Departmentfor Transport has set up a working group with
stakeholders to consider the best framework, but it is for local
authorities to come forward with their best and most affordable
proposals to ensure that the scheme works, consistent with their
responsibilities, and reaches the people whom we want it to
reach.</p><p><a name="06112884000234"></a><b><a name="61128-0005.htm_spnew76"></a><a name="06112884000378"></a>Baroness
Carnegy of Lour:</b> My Lords, that was a very

Andrews:</b> We know, my Lords, because it is a
national scheme. The previous scheme involved local buses in local
areas providing concessionary schemes. This is a national scheme, which
means that people can move out of areas using local buses. It is
actually quite complicated. The best judgment was that it was important
to get everyone from across the country around the table to see how
this would work best in practice. It is not that we are trying to delay
the scheme: we have a very strict timetable for
it.</p><p><a name="06112884000236"></a><b><a name="61128-0005.htm_spnew78"></a><a name="06112884000380"></a>Baroness
Byford:</b> My Lords, will the Minister tell us a
little more about the consultation? She said quite rightly that there
is further consultation on this. I want to focus on two issues. The
first, to which other noble Lords have referred, is the whole question
of the population growing older. Obviously, more care will be needed in
the longer term, unless we are lucky enough to live very healthy lives
and not need that sort of care. My first question is therefore whether
the responsibilities will fall to the social services rather than to
the health service. Clearly, in the past, quite a lot of elderly people
have had longer stays in hospital. 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_678"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 678</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>If the responsibilities will fall to the social services, will the money
that would have gone to the hospitals be freed up for local government?
What happens to that
money?</p><p><a name="06112884000237"></a>My
second question relates to the provision of services in rural areas.
The Minister will know very well that I regularly ask this question in
the House. In very sparsely populated rural areas, it costs a lot more
money to deliver services for children, old people or whomever. I have
a particular example. Schools in inner cities receive more money per
child to educate each child, but a county such as Lincolnshire, which
has an enormous influx of migrant workers who are there permanently,
clearly has needs that will be nearly as great as those of some
inner-city schools as a result of having many more cultures to teach
across the board. I wonder whether that will also be part of the
equation. My husband is a governor of an inner-city school in
Leicester, which receives more money per capita because of its
multi-cultural needs and the resulting extra demands on teaching staff.
I am sorry that those examples are slightly specific, but I would be
grateful for
clarification.</p><p><a name="06112884000238"></a><b><a name="61128-0005.htm_spnew79"></a><a name="06112884000381"></a>Baroness
Andrews:</b> My Lords, we have no intention of
robbing the NHS budget to pay for social care because that budget has a
very important job to do. It obviously works alongside the social care
budget. One thinks, for example, of the delayed discharge of patients
and the number of people leaving hospital and entering residential or
intermediate care, which is a great improvement on recent years, and of
the amounts of money that social care puts into supporting people in
their own homes. These are separate budgets. The important point to
make is that we understand the full implications of an ageing society
and the numbers of those over 85, not only those over 65. We plan
properly not only to meet our acute needs, but to put preventive
programmes in place that will prevent people becoming acutely ill and
having to go into hospital. These things must be seen as seamless,
which is one reason why, in the local government White Paper, we put
such an emphasis on better and stronger local area agreements. Through
such agreements, partners can place statutory duties on local strategic
partnerships so that they can work together effectively.</p><p><a name="06112884000239"></a>On the rural issue, the grant
distribution formula takes relative circumstances into account when
calculating a grant, so sparsity&#151;rural proofing&#151;is taken
into account in that way. As I said earlier, however, there will be an
opportunity in the coming year for a further review of that formula
before we make the next three-year settlement. SPARSE, the group that
represents the most sparsely populated rural authorities, is very
welcome to contribute to
that.</p><p><a name="06112884000240"></a>On the point about the
children of migrant workers coming into schools, that is a matter for
each school&#146;s dedicated grant. One reason for having a
ring-fenced grant for schools is to enable them to have money that
takes their circumstances into
account.</p><p><a name="06112884000241"></a><b><a name="61128-0005.htm_spnew80"></a><a name="06112884000382"></a>Baroness

at the beginning of the Statement. I declare an interest as a county
councillor in Northumberland,

there was a 2.7 per cent increase in the social care budget. I concur
with the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that that is a real problem in
rural areas. The amount of money paid to people who give social care
does not compensate for the large distances that some of them have to
travel. I hope that that will be looked at very carefully in the
review. Sometimes it is almost impossible to get people to do the job
in rural areas, so we certainly need more
incentive.</p><p><a name="06112884000242"></a>The noble Baroness
talked about the 2.7 per cent increase in the social care grant. She
also talked about the Supporting People programme. I had assumed that
these were different budgets. If they are not, some of that increase is
for the Supporting People budget. At paragraph 19 of the Statement, the
Minister in another place said that he
was,</p><ul><a name="06112884000263"></a>&#147;pleased to
announce that where authorities have generated savings in the programme
through their careful management they will be able to roll
forward&#148;.</ul><a name="06112884000253"></a>Is the
noble Baroness satisfied that these savings in careful management are
not made through not providing the same level of care as before? My
mother lives in sheltered accommodation. Since Supporting People, her
level of care is nothing like it was previously. Although this is not
necessarily to do with the Statement, I am concerned that people are
now so risk averse that wardens are being told that they cannot give
some of the services which were provided for elderly people in
sheltered accommodation because we are terrified of them being sued.
That is also an important
point.<p><a name="06112884000243"></a><b><a name="61128-0005.htm_spnew81"></a><a name="06112884000383"></a>Baroness
Andrews:</b> My Lords, a large number of issues and
elements go into formulas used for assessing the needs of older people,
not just age and so on. For example, recently we surveyed 17 local
authorities, some of which I am sure were rural authorities, where
transport costs are more expensive and where it is always more
difficult to recruit people.
</p><p><a name="06112884000244"></a>Supporting
People is a separate budget, and I am sorry to have confused that.
Following consultation on Supporting People, we want to take forward
how we can distribute future funding based on need. We are still
working through how we can do that. The specific instance that the
noble Baroness raised about the failure of Supporting People is of
interest. Perhaps she will write to me, because I am interested in the
relationship between the various services that clearly are supposed to
be providing a seamless
service.</p><p><a name="06112884000245"></a><b><a name="61128-0005.htm_spnew82"></a><a name="06112884000384"></a>Lord

development of mental health services.

now than in 1999, an increase of more than a quarter. Most importantly,
access to mental health services is improving with the provision of new
outreach teams and crisis-resolution teams aimed at providing care in
patients&#146; homes and early intervention. Outcomes for people are
beginning to improve and suicide rates are the lowest since records
began.</p><p><a name="06112892000004"></a>It is completely
appropriate for the Government to be concerned to get the balance right
between public safety and patients&#146; rights to mental healthcare
and to endeavour to update mental health legislation to keep pace with
the growth of modern community-based patient services. I think it was
UNISON that, in its briefing on the Bill,
said,</p><ul><a name="06112892000114"></a>&#147;progress
towards reform of the Mental Health Act 1983 has hitherto been
arduous&#148;.</ul><a name="06112892000098"></a>Members of
your Lordships&#146; House who have taken part in the debate so far
have echoed those sentiments. It has been a long road that has brought
us to this point.<p><a name="06112892000005"></a>As this is
going to be an involved debate, I shall not focus on areas that I know
others are likely to cover. However, I would like to add my voice to
concerns about the question of treatability by having a broad
definition of mental disorder and a wide definition of treatment. I am
concerned about the ethical position with regard to the use of
treatment without specific or potential benefit to the patient for the
purposes of control. I understand that there is a balance to strike in
the interests of public safety, but I do not yet understand the
safeguards in the Bill well enough to put my mind at rest in this
regard.</p><p><a name="06112892000006"></a>I am also concerned
about the detail underpinning the new community treatment orders,
particularly issues about the nature of the conditions of residency and
behaviour as well as questions about information sharing and
confidentiality. Are we, for example, going to involve landlords in the
making of these orders? Will neighbours be aware of these orders? A lot
will depend on the trust that we place in mental health professionals
to supervise the orders fairly and
effectively.</p><p><a name="06112892000007"></a>I want particularly
to focus on the missing word &#147;advocacy&#148;, to which the
noble Lord, Lord Rix, has already briefly referred. Advocacy is key to
promoting the rights and needs of those detained under mental health
law. In a mental health context, an advocate is someone who supports
another person in expressing their views and concerns; who helps to
access information and services; who defends and promotes their rights,
and explores choices and options. An advocate can reduce a
person&#146;s anxiety and promote a constructive relationship between
the service user and the
psychiatrist.</p><p><a name="06112892000008"></a>Being
detained under mental health legislation can be an overwhelming and
distressing experience. The support of an advocate can help service
users to negotiate the complicated mental health system. For people in
crisis who may feel that they have little control over what is
happening to them, an advocate can be an invaluable source of support,
representation and information. Experience shows that the early and
ongoing support of advocates reduces the need for 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_681"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 681</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>admission to hospital and involvement with other agencies such as the
courts and homelessness services. Advocates can help by limiting the
escalation of financial, housing, personal and medication problems.
During episodes of hospital care, tensions can be eased,
misunderstandings resolved and a constructive approach to recovery
established through an advocate. As a result, the use of compulsory
powers can on occasion be more short-lived and patients may be less
fearful of compulsory care.</p><p><a name="06112892000009"></a>The
Government have a duty to promote race equality and reduce racial
discrimination underthe Race Relations (Amendment) Act. It is
well documented that people from black and ethnic minority groups have
a significantly worse experience of mental health services. They are
more likely to be treated under the Mental Health Act, to be sectioned,
to receive higher doses of medication, as well asbeing more
likely to be restrained or secluded while in compulsory care. I believe
that introducing a statutory right to independent advocacy would be a
positive step in promoting race equality and reducing discrimination.
For example, an advocate can improve communication and the flow of
information between parties, ensure that social, cultural and racial
factors are appropriately considered during the consideration of care
and treatment options, and ensure that the rights of the service user
are upheld. Having access to an advocate can save time and even costs
spent on tribunals and appeals because conflicts can be resolved
without recourse to legal action. As I understand it from the charity
Mind, there is also emerging evidence that advocacy is linked to a
reduction in cancelled tribunal hearings, suggesting that advocacy can
reduce hold-ups in the system and improve
efficiency.</p><p><a name="06112892000010"></a>The
Government have decided not to include a provision for advocacy
services in the Bill. I want to question the merits of that approach,
particularly as I understand that the Government are looking very
seriously at how advocacy services can be improved and made more
accessible. The Joint Committee on the draft Bill, to whose members I
pay tribute for their amazing work in considering the proposals, came
up with strong and thoughtful recommendations on advocacy. The Joint
Committee said that there should be a duty in the Bill to provide
independent mental health advocates to meet the reasonable requirements
of patients as soon as any statutory procedure is commenced. It went
further, recommending that there should be a duty to ensure independent
advocacy for all patients with a mental disorder who should have an
opportunity to use such services right from the start of an initial
examination.</p><p><a name="06112892000011"></a>The Government
responded positively to the committee&#146;s recommendations, saying
that they are keen to ensure that patients are given adequate support
at all times when the new legislation is in operation. There was even
talk about how codes of practice should be used. But now we find that
there is no mention of advocacy in the Bill. This, as I am sure noble
Lords will agree, is a missed opportunity that could easily be put
right.</p>

supportive of the idea of working with advocacy organisations. There
are many parts of the country where best practice is already
established. I am particularly concerned that advocacy services should
be made available to people who are being considered for community
treatment orders with conditions to which I have alluded. Such
conditions, if breached, can put someone back in hospital; they can
affect where people live and their behaviour. Would they, for example,
cover how loud someone&#146;s music should be played? Surely a
vulnerable person in this situation is extremely likely to benefit from
automatic access to an
advocate.</p><p><a name="06112892000013"></a>If the Bill is to be a
progressive strand in the Government&#146;s already successful mental
health strategy, perhaps the extension of control should be matched by
the introduction of new rights of access to independent advocacy for
the most vulnerable members of our
society.</p><h5><a name="06112892000120"></a>4.52

Bottomley of Nettlestone:</b> My Lords, I am more
than happy to follow the noble Baroness and her call for advocacy. In a
Bill where civil liberties are to be removed, we must make every
possible effort to make sure that individuals have that right. It is a
point made by many in the Mental Health Alliance. I do not think that
anyone has so far paid tribute to the alliance. There was a time when
77 organisations coming together with a shared voice to articulate the
needs of that group of patients so often overlooked within our health
services would have been unthinkable. I warmly commend its work; I
admire and respect all it has done, even though my conclusions are not
entirely those of the alliance.</p><p><a name="06112892000015"></a>I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Rix,
is not here. My own background was in the subnormality world. As a
girl, I looked after subnormal children&#151;as they were then
known&#151;on holiday. I was horrified that these youngsters had no
proper clothes, no proper toys, no care and no nurture. I then worked
in some of the subnormality hospitals where children, just because they
had learning disabilities, had no proper rights. They were not properly
regarded in the education system and were treated like sick people, not
citizens. The dramatic change we have seen in our generation concerns
people with mental health problems and those with learning disabilities
who used to be incarcerated&#151; out of sight and out of
mind&#151;in simply appalling institutions, facing abuse and
difficulties. There has been a dramatic change, and I want to register
that.</p>

their mental health problems. What an appalling waste of
talent.</p><p><a name="06112892000017"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady
Morgan, rightly said that the suicide level has been falling, which is
extremely good. During my term in office we introduced a preventive
strategy, <I>The Health of the Nation</I>. As is the way in changes of
government, the new Government introduced a dramatically new preventive
strategy called <I>Our Healthier Nation</I>. The targets were almost
identical, although no mention was made in the subsequent strategy of
the previous one, which I thought was a little mean spirited. Suicide
was one of the targets identified and how welcome it is that there has
been a turn. But let no one be under any illusion: the most common
cause of death for people between the ages of 15 and 34 is suicide, at
twice the rate for men as for children.</p><p><a name="06112892000018"></a>The very eminent and distinguished Member
of Parliament for Worthing West long ago used to be a transport
Minister who worked hard to reduce driving accidents. But accidents on
the roads are as nothing compared with the dangers of suicide.
Therefore, as we discuss the Bill, let us remember that suicide is a
critical cause of loss of life and contribution and that it causes
great suffering to friends and
family.</p><p><a name="06112892000019"></a>Last week I spoke for
the Charlie Waller Memorial Trust. Charlie Waller, a successful account
manager, was 28 when he took his life. His parents, in the way that
some parents are extraordinary and remarkable, set up a foundation to
ensure that more families did not have to live through the savage,
traumatic loss of a successful young person. Through that foundation
they have worked to raise the profile; to fund a chair at the
University of Reading; for CBT outreach programmes in schools; for
depression helplines for students; and so on. This Bill is only a very
small part of what we must do more widely to promote an understanding
of mental illness.</p><p><a name="06112892000020"></a>Of course,
the mental health budget is always the easiest to raid because mental
illness does not show so clearly on waiting lists; it is always the
acute side that takes the glory and the priority. Our job, particularly
in this House, is to speak for the inarticulate needy as opposed to the
articulate greedy&#151;whether they are the professions or the most
forceful patient groups&#151;who are always able to get to the front
of the queue.</p><p><a name="06112892000021"></a>Probably unlike
any other Member of another place, my endorsement when I first became a
Member of Parliament was by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and by a
professor of child psychiatry at the Maudsley, where I was working. I
have a professional background in this area and Professor Lionel Hersov
gave me a clean bill of health and thought it was an excellent idea
that I should pursue a parliamentary path.</p><p><a name="06112892000022"></a>However, at the same time, I was also a
magistrate and a juvenile court chairman. There is a similarity between
what we have seen in childcare and what we see in mental health. There
was a time when children were incarcerated in long-stay institutions
because 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_684"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 684</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their families were thought not to be fit. In some parts of the world,
you can still see, tragically, children in long-stay institutions. Then
children were returned to their families but, time and again, there
were appalling child abuse incidents. The story was always the
same&#151;Louis Blom-Cooper never stopped; he had a season ticket for
writing reports&#151;because in the community it is much harder to
hold the pieces together. It is the same for mental health. It is also
the same in alternatives to custody for people who are not in prison
institutions. It is much more complex to organise the psychologist, the
nurse, the doctor, the teacher, the social worker; it is much harder to
have a co-ordinated approach.</p><p><a name="06112892000023"></a>The murder of Jonathan Zito by
Christopher Clunis was a classic example of what we saw in the
childcare system: the different elements in the community had simply
not co-operated and collaborated. What is more, some of the patients
about whom we are speaking are not particularly loveable, endearing or
engaging of the professional services when they are feeling ill, or
when they may not be feeling ill but are being troublesome to the
community. When a patient going through a psychotic episode failed to
turn up at a clinic, they did not say, &#147;Oh dear, where is this
needy patient?&#148;. They said, &#147;Thank goodness for that, we
can concentrate on the worried well, on other patients, on other
areas&#148;. So the moment when that patient most needed a
co-ordinated approach was the moment they slipped through the net, and
somehow it was no one&#146;s job to go and search them out. After the
Christopher Clunis case I asked for a judicial inquiry. I am not one
who thinks an inquiry is the answer to every problem, but I felt that
we could begin to learn the lessons we had learnt on
childcare.</p><p><a name="06112892000024"></a>Then there was Ben
Silcock, the young man who walked into the lion&#146;s den at London
Zoo. The story was that he had been involved in a Mind day centre in
the Roehampton area, but had proved too difficult. I think Mind is a
brilliant organisation, and this is no criticism of it, its work or its
campaigns. The fact was, however, that when he was suspended from the
day centre no one thought it was their job to find out what had
happened to him. I had a most moving meeting with his
parents.</p><p><a name="06112892000025"></a>In
21 years as a Member of Parliament, I came across more examples than I
care to mention of parents saying, &#147;I know my son or daughter is
failing to take their medication. I know they&#146;re not complying
with the treatment that is arranged for them. I am regarded as part of
the problem&#148;. They had read RD Laing, and they were the
schizophrenogenic mother of all our pasts. They were perceived as the
problem, not the answer. When all else failed, however, some other
parents were supposed to cope. I became convinced that we needed to do
more to identify those mental health patients who needed a more careful
regime and someone to watch over them.</p><p><a name="06112892000026"></a>As a result of that, we moved towards
supervised discharge and supervision registers. Again, overpressed,
underpaid, overworked care staff tend to do the work that is statutory.
With the best will in the world, those who are not on a list or a
register, if there 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_685"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 685</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is no statutory force, so often fall through the net. I understand why
supervised discharge has not delivered the results, or been as useful
as might have been anticipated. It is the reason why today I have
sympathy with the Government&#146;s approach, in so far as I believe
there is a role for supervised community treatment orders, but with
many more safeguards than are currently in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06112892000027"></a>The noble Baroness referred to advocacy.
That must be a requirement, and goodness knows why, when it was in the
original draft Bill, we do not see it now. Many other groups have
talked about the special needs of children. Again, they were to have a
special mention, but they have been omitted; not only the needs of
children and young people whose parents may be subject to orders, but
children and young people who have their own difficulties. I fail to
understand why. Still a fifth of those young people admitted to an
institution under an order are in an adult ward. That cannot be
right.</p><p><a name="06112892000028"></a>In my
view, we need to take this Bill extremely seriously. I will give it the
benefit of the doubt, despite this Government&#146;s history of
endless punitive measures&#151;50 Home Office measures and the
appalling Jack Straw severe personality disorder legacy as an early
response to these difficulties. Provided that this is a small element
of a comprehensive commitment for us all to do better for people with
severe mental health problems, I shall, with modifications, support the
Bill.</p><h5><a name="06112892000121"></a>5.04

Patel:</b> My Lords, I am pleased that the Government
have introduced the Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 1983 and the
Mental CapacityAct 2005, although if the briefings that I have
received are anything to go by, there is widespread concern about the
Bill&#146;s detail, indicating that it will have to be amended if it
is to be
supported.</p><p><a name="06112892000030"></a>The
general feeling seems to be that the Government have ignored many of
the recommendations of their own expert committee appointed in 1998 and
of the 2004 joint parliamentary scrutiny committee. While I support
many of the proposals, I too am concerned about some clauses. I start
by making some general comments. While I am not a clinician who has
worked in the mental health field, patients with mental disorders span
all medical specialties. My comments and concerns are therefore
directed primarily at how the Bill will affect the care of patients
with mental disorders, particularly as the provision of services for
such patients is not optimal, despite the increased funding that we
heard about.</p><p><a name="06112892000031"></a>Reform of mental
health legislation must be set in context. Improving patient care,
including addressing safety issues, depends on a range of measures.
First, it must not add to the stigma and discrimination suffered by
people with a mental disorder. It must not reduce the likelihood of
people feeling able to seek help early, to talk about their fears and
difficulties without fearing scorn, humiliation or loss of status,
freedom or job. Secondly, it cannot replace the need for adequate
resources, including a well trained workforce and access to a range of
treatments, 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_686"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 686</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>including psychological therapies and new-generation medications.
Thirdly, healthcare law should exist to enable patients to receive
treatment within a clear legal framework, to improve personal health
and well-being, to protect against abuse and, through these measures,
to increase the health and safety of the
nation.</p><p><a name="06112892000032"></a>The fundamental
principles that support all good medical practice&#151;respect for
patient autonomy and supporting people in making their own healthcare
decisions, even if ultimately they make what doctors consider unwise
decisions; and doctors acting in patients&#146; best interests if
they are unable to make decisions for themselves&#151;are as
important for mental health as for any other branch of
medicine.</p><p><a name="06112892000033"></a>The medical
profession, particularly the Royal College of Psychiatrists, is very
concerned aboutthe way that some politicians, members of the
Government and parts of the media have linked the need for new mental
health legislation with violence. Major problems with the mental health
services include lack of trained staff, unpleasant in-patient
environments, and lack of funding for research on both the causes of
mental illness and potential treatments. While doctors agree that very
few people with mental health problems pose a danger to others, the
poverty of appropriate resources and training, along with poor
communication between agencies, have been highlighted by homicide
inquiries as issues which need
attention.</p><p><a name="06112892000034"></a>Neither the most
recent homicide report on the care and treatment of John Barrett, which
highlighted significant failings in the system, nor the inquiry into
the case of Michael Stone, which was highly influential in directing
the Government&#146;s development of this legislation, recommended
any new legislation.</p><p><a name="06112892000035"></a>There is a
widespread perception among the general public that violence, and
homicide in particular, are rising problems caused by the introduction
of care in the community and loopholes in the current Mental Health
Act. That assumption makes good tabloid headlines but is incorrect. The
latest Home Office figures show that in 2002-03 there were 873
homicides in England and Wales, of which less than 4 per cent,
approximately 35, involved suspects with a mental illness. Furthermore,
the number of homicides committed by people with a mental illness has
stayed constant for many decades. The number has not risen since
community care began in earnest in the early 1990s. That is not to
minimise the consequences of violent behaviour committed by the
mentally disordered or not, which could be profound. The mental health
field is acutely aware of the impact on victims, which is perhaps
exacerbated when there is a perception that the violence was both
preventable and predictable.</p><p><a name="06112892000036"></a>In
his oral evidence to the Joint Committee that scrutinised the 2004
draft Bill, Dr Tony Zigmond, the vice-president of the Royal College of
Psychiatrists,
said,</p><ul><a name="06112892000115"></a>&#147;the only way
that I can generally decide that somebody is a danger to themselves is
because they have come to see me, I have interviewed them and they have
told me what is in their mind. If they do not do that, I will not know
about it; and so any law that 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_687"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 687</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>drives people away from the service, I have to say, increases risks for
everybody and damages health ... we need to get people to come and
see us&#148;.</ul><a name="06112892000099"></a>The
starting point in risk reduction is encouraging patients to seek help
and talk about their thoughts and feelings. It is hard to believe that
potential patients will not be deterred from the services if they know
that mental health professionals will have a duty to enforce treatment
on them, not only in hospital but in the community, even where they are
perfectly able to make decisions for themselves and when the treatment
may not even benefit their health.
<p><a name="06112892000037"></a>The Government propose to
improve public safety through increasing the scope of compulsory powers
into the community and in detaining people even if they cannot get any
therapeutic benefit from it. Health professionals believe that is the
wrong approach, and it could damage the relationship between doctors
and their patients and therefore may, paradoxically, increase
risk.</p><p><a name="06112892000038"></a>Before I make specific
comments about the clauses, let me state what are important principles
that should form part of the Bill. A modern mental health Act should
commence with a statement of principles to guide professionals in
exercising their powers and the courts in interpreting the law. It is
important that these principles appear on the face of the Act, as they
are vital to the fair operation of the legislation, which has such
powers over people&#146;s lives. The Mental Capacity Act, as other
noble Lords have mentioned, and the Children Act both contain that
principle, as does the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland)
Act. Why should the Act for England and Wales not have that statement
of principles?</p><p><a name="06112892000039"></a>I will now
briefly comment on the Bill, which proposes changes in seven key areas.
I support the principles in several of the areas, although the details
will need to be debated further. Broadly, I support Clauses 21 to 24,
which refer to the nearest relative; Clauses 8 to 20, which refer to
widening the range of professionals able to exercise statutory
functions; Clauses 30 to 31, relating to tribunals; and Clauses 38 to
39, relating to putting in place safeguards for treatment of patients
and people who lack mental capacity. I know that those views are not
shared by some noble Lords who have spoken.</p><p><a name="06112892000040"></a>I have greater concerns about some of the
other clauses. To me, the major problem with some parts of the Bill is
that it is over-inclusive, which may lead to a greater use of
compulsory power. The Bill broadens the definition of &#147;mental
disorder&#148;. It also removes exclusions, thereby widening the
scope of people who may be detained. It abolishes the
&#147;treatability&#148; test, thereby opening the possibility of
detaining people for whom there is no therapeutic benefit, and it
introduces community treatment orders with what seems like a low
threshold. The cumulative effect of all those could be that people get
trapped into a long-term system of compulsory care, which Professor
Genevra Richardson likened to a lobster pot&#151;easy to get into but
difficult to get out of&#151;the impact of which will
disproportionately affect those from ethnic minorities.</p>



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_688"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 688</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06112892000041"></a>Exclusions should form part of the Bill;
they make clear what kind of behaviour, beliefs and lifestyle should
not be brought within compulsory powers. Again, they form part of
legislation in Scotland, New Zealand and some Australian states. The
Bill removes the &#147;treatability&#148; test and replaces it with
a test of appropriate treatment. Legislation that takes away a
person&#146;s liberty must at least confer on them a health benefit.
The breadth of powers given to clinicians should be more precisely
defined.</p><p><a name="06112892000042"></a>The Bill introduces a
form of community treatment order. While a small number of patients
respond well to CTOs, studies, including the Cochrane Library&#146;s
figures, do not show great benefits. Legislation needs to be cautious
and CTOs need to be targeted on a very small group of so-called
revolving-door
patients.</p><p><a name="06112892000043"></a>Finally, I am
disappointed not to see in the Bill safeguards for the care of children
and young people with mental disorders, for such safeguards are badly
needed if we are to improve the care of children with mental disorders.
I would also like to see reference to appropriate care and treatment of
mothers and babies in specialised units where mother and baby could be
admitted. Such is the provision made in the Scottish mental health Act,
particularly as regards mothers with post-natal depression with
children of less than one year
old.</p><p><a name="06112892000044"></a>I hope that we will have
opportunities to debate some of those concerns during later stages of
the Bill. For now, as I said in my opening remarks, I am pleased that
the Government have brought forward the Bill, despite the
difficulties.</p><h5><a name="06112892000122"></a>5.16

Gibson of Market Rasen:</b> My Lords, the Bill before
us is a very far cry from the first proposals for a new Mental Health
Bill&#151;a Bill which was to be comprehensive and would have started
almost from scratch on mental health legislation. In 2004, a draft Bill
was produced and widely considered. It was large, complex and not
widely popular. Now, as a result of much comment and debate, this
Bill&#151;shortened, and somewhat simpler&#151;is to be considered.
It does not remove all previous mental health legislation; rather it
modernises and builds upon it. No Bill will ever satisfy everyone, and,
as we have heard, there are varying views on whether this Bill
suffices. One of the challenges before us is to ensure that, when it
leaves this place, it does.</p><p><a name="06112892000046"></a>As
the Secretary of State for Health, Patricia Hewitt, said during the
Queen&#146;s Speech debate in another
place:</p><ul><a name="06112892000109"></a>&#147;For far too

have invested in our mental health services and this Bill is a further
stage of that process. <p><a name="06112892000101"></a>The
Bill contains some important new proposals. I welcome the introduction
of treatment supervised in the community for those who have already had
treatment in a hospital. It will, one hopes, prevent patients relapsing
and having to be readmitted to hospital. I welcome such provision
because there is no doubt in my mind that such care in the community is

has suffered with mental health problems since his teens. He has been
hospitalised on numerous occasions and then released without sufficient
support. Needless to say, after exhibiting behaviour that was dangerous
to his family, to the general public and, most worryingly, to himself,
he has had to return to a secure hospital. I am sure that other noble
Lords know of similar cases.</p><a name="06112892000102"></a>As the Secretary of State for Health
also said last
week:<ul><a name="06112892000110"></a>&#147;Hon. Members
are only too aware of the problem of those mental health patients who
are treated in hospital and whose condition improves with care and
medication, but who leave hospital and then fail to keep up their
treatment. In a small minority of cases, involving some of the most
seriously ill people, that can lead to terrible and tragic
results&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 16/11/06;

know could be professionally supervised in the community, it would be
good not only for him and his family but for society as a
whole.<p><a name="06112892000047"></a>The
Bill has other positive aims: to expand the skill base of mental health
professionals and, as a vital part of that, to ensure that they have
the right experience and training; to improve safeguards for patients
who are unable to decide for themselves about their care; and to
provide speedier and more frequent mental health review tribunals. The
latter would be of great assistance not only for those with mental
health problems but also for those directly involved with
them.</p><p><a name="06112892000048"></a>Something I support, but
which I recognise raises concerns in many quarters, relates to the
current &#147;treatability test&#148;. The Bill introduces
appropriate treatment to replace the treatability test. This clause
will apply to all the longer-term powers of detention. However,
patients will not be detained compulsorily, nor will their detention
continue unless they are able to receive the appropriate medical
treatment that they specifically require. Any such restrictions
willapply only when it is considered by those with
responsibility for the diagnosis that patients may be a risk to
others.</p><p><a name="06112892000049"></a>I accept that such
considerations are a fine balancing act, but there will always be some
people who are not in a fit mental state to give their consent to
treatment and they must be protected from harming themselves as well as
others. It is also vital that appropriate treatment is available for
all patients regardless of their label or diagnosis. I believe that
that is more likely to be achieved under the new proposals rather than
the existing ones. I know that other noble Lords think
differently.</p><p><a name="06112892000050"></a>I also welcome a
debate on whether a relative is always the best person to have
responsibility for those with mental health problems. I am sure that in
the vast majority of cases a close and loving relative will have the
best interests of their loved ones at heart but, by the nature of human
relationships, there must be instances where others who are not
relatives would be better able to reflect what the individual concerned
would wish for himself or herself.</p><p><a name="06112892000051"></a>Like other noble Lords,
I have received a number of briefs from different organisations. A
small number of 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_690"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 690</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>them have been disappointingly negative. I do not think that it is of
any help to send me or other noble Lords a brief that totally condemns
the Bill. Constructive criticism is important and welcome, but
negativity alone is of little use to the debate. A number of the briefs
pointed to the Scottish legislation, which has already been mentioned
in the Chamber, which is preferable to what the Bill contains. In
particular, the Scottish community treatment orders are recommended, as
they are confined to conditions regarding treatment and residence
rather than the wider proposals contained in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06112892000052"></a>That view is supported
by the Law Society among others. Its chief executive, Fiona Woolf,
believes that,</p><ul><a name="06112892000116"></a>&#147;the
Government has tinkered with our mental health provisions, rather than
introducing radical reforms&#148;,</ul><a name="06112892000104"></a>and have thus missed a golden
opportunity for advancement in this area. Perhaps the Minister could
comment on this preference for the Scottish legislation in his summing
up. <p><a name="06112892000053"></a>A particular brief that
raised matters of some concern for me was that from Barnardo&#146;s,
which concentrated on the mental health issues of children and young
people. The noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone, has already
mentioned that. The Barnardo&#146;s brief covered two angles: those
younger people who have mental health problems and those who look after
adults with mental health difficulties. Both those groups of young
people are among the most vulnerable. Genuine worries are raised about
the current treatment available for children and young people who
develop mental health problems and whether the Bill&#146;s proposals
will tackle what Barnardo&#146;s believes to be a &#147;national
shortage of treatments&#148;, especially among 16 to 18
year-olds.</p><p><a name="06112892000054"></a>Barnardo&#146;s hopes
that the Bill will be amended to add emphasis relating to age
assessment, treatment and aftercare for the younger folk who have
specific problems. They believe that that should include care and
treatment by professionals trained in child development and child
psychiatry as well as aftercare support, which is so essential to bring
back stability to their lives.</p><p><a name="06112892000055"></a>The second element&#151;parental or
other adult care&#151;raises stark issues indeed. Barnardo&#146;s
estimates that up to a quarter of adults with mental health
difficulties are being cared for by young people.Such
circumstances can place unbearable strain on those carers, who become
old before their time from their burdens. Such youngsters must surely
be able to access the widest possible range of support, and I hope that
my noble friend will agree with that view.</p><p><a name="06112892000056"></a>Finally, it seems to me that, for this
Bill to succeed, above all, emphasis must be placed on providing enough
properly trained staff and enough resources generally. Without those
two basic requirements, the Bill will not do what it sets out to do.
Can the Minister reassure the House that the relevant staff will
receive the training necessary for their varied roles and that
sufficient resources will be available to put the Bill&#146;s
proposals into
effect?</p>

Knight of Collingtree:</b> My Lords, there is no
doubt that there is much concern in the minds of a large number of
professional medical groups, who have written to us about the Bill.
Concern has also been expressed in the House this evening. Some people
are anxious about what is in the Bill; some are anxious about what is
not in it. But, as it is put forward as an amending Bill to the Mental
Capacity Act 2005, my concern is whether it will be effective in
strengthening something that the earlier Bill was alleged to ensure
when it was introduced but, in the event, has not.</p><p><a name="06112892000058"></a>Just before the 2005 Act was introduced,
I initiated the Patients&#146; Protection Bill, which sought to end
the practice of denying food and fluids to elderly persons in NHS
hospitals because, or often because, the beds that they occupied were
wanted. There was an amount of evidence of that happening. It even
happened to a friend and ex-colleague in the House of Commons whose
wife was in hospital. He visited her as much as he could and then,
after about three days, he realised that no one was feeding her or
bringing her water or anything else to drink. When he asked about it,
he was told, &#147;Oh, we aren&#146;t feeding her and we certainly
aren&#146;t giving her any liquids of any kind&#148;. He had not
asked for that and neither had she. No one in the family had asked for
that to happen to her, yet, without any consultation at all, the poor
woman was dying in front of his eyes. He made an awful fuss&#151;none
of us will be surprised about that&#151;and the provision of food and
liquid was reinstated, and quite right too.</p><p><a name="06112892000059"></a>It was that and other cases that impelled
me to bring in my Bill. I had support from all parts of this House when
I did so, but the Government blocked the Bill. However, the noble Lord,
Lord Filkin, who at the time had responsibility for constitutional
affairs and to whose courtesy, kindness and caring I warmly pay
tribute, sought me out to assure me that the then Mental Capacity Bill
would do what my Bill would have done to end this abhorrent
practice.</p><p><a name="06112892000060"></a>I have stood aside to
give every opportunity for the Act to do what the noble Lord, Lord
Filkin, promised it would, but I am becoming extremely
concernedat the growing amount of evidence that it has not
done so. Only a couple of weeks ago, the BBC screened a truly chilling
programme, put together by a very experienced researcher and
broadcaster, Sally Chidzoy. It highlighted the statement of one
hospital doctor, speaking in court and under oath, in which he said
that two or three patients per week were dying because they were not
given food or fluids. &#147;I see it happening all the time&#148;,
he said, and that was just in one hospital.</p><p><a name="06112892000061"></a>Those words refer to a case that took
place before the Mental Capacity Act had had a chance to work. The
inquest took place earlier this year and those words clearly refer to
what takes place now. The screening of that programme has apparently
led to a very large number of calls. I am told by the BBC that it has
had no fewer than 136 calls providing further information about the
same sort of thing happening all over the place. I am very concerned
about this. The 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_692"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 692</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>calls have come from nurses and relatives of patients detailing cases
where elderly patients have been deprived of food and fluid and have
died as a result. Again and again, letters, e-mails or phone calls cite
examples. It seems that it is very common for cups of tea or glasses of
water deliberately to be placed where a patient cannot possibly reach
them.</p><p><a name="06112892000062"></a>In the programme, a nurse
who was speaking of the present&#151;not before the Act came into
force&#151;said, &#147;As soon as elderly people come in, they are
doomed. If they are over 60 or 65 they are condemned&#148;. Those are
not my words but they come from a nurse in a hospital who has seen it
happening. A daughter said that her mother begged for a drink but the
dreaded &#147;Nil by mouth&#148; sign was on her bed. The daughter
complained and after some days drink was reinstated, but it was
cancelled again and, in the view of her daughter and those who visited
her, the woman went backwards. In another case, although doctors said
that the patient was allowed free fluids and that she was tolerating
fluids, nurses did not give her any. Another lady said, &#147;There
is not a lack of time to feed patients; it is the lack of care that
worries me&#148;.</p><p><a name="06112892000063"></a>I fully
accept that in some cases&#151;such as patients who have suffered
strokes&#151;the patient&#146;s condition directs that they must
not be fed normally, but too often other methods of giving sustenance,
such as tubes and pegs&#151;I know that one is much easier to
administer and to tolerate than the other&#151;are not applied and
the patient is starved to death. That is a terribly painful and
dreadful thing and it is going on at the moment under our very
noses.</p><p><a name="06112892000064"></a>I am aware that the GMC
is on record as saying that causing patients to die by withholding food
and fluids is unacceptable and illegal. It may be unacceptable, but it
is certainly happening and I am afraid it is not illegal for one very
good reason. A few years ago the medical profession, backed, I believe,
by the courts, reclassified feeding sick people as medical treatment.
That was a licence to kill and, I fear, it is regularly used as such.
Yet it is patently ridiculous to say that giving people a meal is
giving them medical treatment. Do we sit at the long table in our
dining room to receive medical treatment? Are school dinners medical
treatment? Does a husband take his wife out on their wedding
anniversary to a nice restaurant for medical treatment? Of course
not.</p><p><a name="06112892000065"></a>There is another odd
thing. How is it that, when doctors use their rights to withhold food
and liquid, no relative needs to be informed or consulted and yet when
medical treatment which involves apparatus and machines, such as those
that artificially keep people alive, is administered there is
recognised consultation before it is embarked on? Relatives can, and
do, go to court and sometimes the court upholds their right to keep the
machine going, yet, apparently daily, patients are suddenly cut off
from sustenance without a word to relatives and life is ended with no
consultation at all. If no friends or relatives visit you, I tremble
for your chances.</p><p><a name="06112892000066"></a>I give notice
that I shall seek to move an amendment at the appropriate time to give
elderly patients better assurances of their safety and rights 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_693"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 693</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>while in the care of the NHS. I am certainly not saying that that will
be easy for hospitals to implement. Nurses are certainly extremely
busy, doctors always have too much to do and money is tight. But in a
country which claims to have principles and whose people certainly have
rights, we can tolerate no longer the regular, deliberate killing of
sick people because it causes too much trouble to keep them comfortable
and to look after them properly. I am certainly not saying that there
are not thousands and thousands of examples of wonderful loving care
given daily in our hospitals, but these reported instances besmirch the
reputation of everyone connected with British hospital care.</p><p><a name="06112892000067"></a>I should also point out that the 136
people who contacted the BBC after the programme were from only one
small area of the country&#151;the programme was called &#147;Look
East&#148;&#151;so I do not know what would happen if the programme
were broadcast more widely. I cannot think that that practice happens
in only one place so that means that there is a general situation which
cannot be permitted to go
unchecked.</p><p><a name="06112892000068"></a>It
alarms me that some who have serious complaints about what has happened
to their loved ones are frightened to speak out because they fear that
they may be discriminated against if they themselves need care. It
certainly angers me that a hospital&#151;the Norfolk and Norwich
University Hospital&#151;should have tried to influence a coroner to
discount evidence given by two consultants Dr Michael Jarmulowicz and
Dr Philip Howard, because they are Roman Catholics. I have the
submission made by the hospital which is an attempt to influence the
coroner. It is
entitled:</p><ul><a name="06112892000111"></a>&#147;Submissions
... on behalf Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS
Trust&#148;.</ul><a name="06112892000105"></a>Speaking of
the first doctor it says
that,<ul><a name="06112892000117"></a>&#147;his
impartiality and his position as an expert witness is in doubt owing to
his close association with The Guild of Catholic
Doctors&#148;.</ul><a name="06112892000106"></a>Referring
to Dr Howard it
says:<ul><a name="06112892000112"></a>&#147;The
impartiality and position of Dr Howard as an independent expert witness
is disputed. In common withDr Jarmulowicz, Dr Howard is also a
member of The Guild of Catholic
Doctors&#148;.</ul><a name="06112892000107"></a>Does that
mean that he is not competent to give his expert medical evidence? This
has actually happened and fairly recently too. I ask the Minister
directly: is it legal to claim that evidence in court should be ignored
on those grounds? Are expert opinions to be waved away because those
giving them are Catholic or Muslim or Jewish or Methodist? God help
us.<h5><a name="06112892000124"></a>5.38

president of Mind which has been working for better mental healthcare
over the past 60 years. Much has been achieved in mental health
awareness and in mental healthcare over the past few years. The stigma
is finally showing signs that it will slink away. The taboo is starting
to lose its dread. The understanding that mental illness can be just as
harmful as physical illness, that it needs just as much attention and
that, like physical illness, it can be overcome has deepened, 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_694"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 694</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>especially over the past four or five years. Even newspaper language,
which in certain quarters used to be almost an incitement to lynch or
to ostracise, shows signs of achieving some reason and
sanity.</p><p><a name="06112892000070"></a>Despite this
Government&#146;s laudable track record in areas of illness and
disability, those to whom I have spoken in Mind and the Mental Health
Alliance&#151;a unique coalition of 78 organisations committed to
better mental health legislation&#151;are convinced that to let this
Bill pass without serious amendments would be to fail an already
disadvantaged section of our society and to miss a great opportunity. I
share those views. I agree with my noble friend Lord Warner that the
time is right for a major rethink and revaluation of mental health.
Sadly, this Bill does not do
that.</p><p><a name="06112892000071"></a>At times, the Bill seems
to be rooted in the stereotype that those suffering from severe mental
health problems are likely to be threatening and dangerous. More than
one in five of us will, at times, suffer from often grave mental health
problems&#151;one in five. Look around at those we know and know of.
This alone makes a mockery of the murderous stereotype.</p><p><a name="06112892000072"></a>There is a growing culture of alarm in
this country. The fact that it comes at a time when crime is falling
does not make that perception less influential, but this does not mean
that we can therefore tolerate witch hunts. Yet the few high profile
cases of people experiencing severe mental ill health who kill receive
lurid and disproportionate media coverage. They leave the impression
that tragic deaths have occurred because of a failure of the law to
protect us. Yet the clear message from official inquiries into these
incidents is that the key to avoiding them is not to reform mental
health law but investment in mental health
services.</p><p><a name="06112892000073"></a>There is, for
instance, no evidence that extensions in powers to allow compulsory
treatment in the community will improve outcomes for people
experiencing mental distress or increase public safety. As that is the
case, are we not in some way talking about an unfortunate short-term
reaction&#151;even a snatch and grab at a problem&#151;and not a
detailed address to the realities
involved?</p><p><a name="06112892000074"></a>There is a definition
of mental illness in the Bill. It is a useful starting point, but only
if accompanied by exclusions to that definition. It would be absurd,
for instance, to claim that there is merely one definition of physical
illness. Yet, as those of us in Mind and other like organisations
continue to say, the afflictions of mental illness are just as varied
as physical illnesses, from the temporarily disabling to the crippling,
in both cases.</p><p><a name="06112892000075"></a>For compulsory
treatment, the Bill removes a current stipulation that treatment should
have a therapeutic benefit and requires only that treatment is
available as &#147;appropriate&#148;. This is surely too vague a
basis for coercive powers and is not based on therapeutic value. In
effect, it would allow the incarceration of mentally ill people who
have committed no crime. It would also, many psychiatrists say, turn
them into jailers. Furthermore, it would allow curfews to be imposed on
patients in the 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_695"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 695</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>community, which the Royal College of Psychiatrists fears would dissuade
people coming forward to seek
help.</p><p><a name="06112892000076"></a>Research suggests that
compulsory community treatment is not effective. It even deflects
attention from the real issue of providing high quality aftercare and
support. If the Government are looking at what can be achieved in the
community then, as well as aftercare and support, they should be
looking at tackling those factors that contribute to the social
exclusion and isolation of people who have experienced mental distress.
It is those factors, as well as lack of care and support&#151;as much
as any failure to comply with treatment&#151;that contribute to
people relapsing after they have been discharged. To do all this is
extremely ambitious, but the ambition to serve the needs of the most
fragile is a noble one. I believe that the people of this country will
support it.</p><p><a name="06112892000077"></a>There are points
not in the Bill which should be there. Patients should have the right
to a full assessment of their health and social needs before a crisis
point, and a right to advocacy services to help negotiate their way
through a complex system. Mind&#146;s chief executive, Paul Farmer,
said when this Bill was published:</p><ul><a name="06112892000113"></a>&#147;It&#146;s quality health
services that will protect people, not this legislation, opposed by
mental health experts across the board. We hope that the widespread
concern in Parliament will lead to the essential changes that must be
made to give any chance of providing an effective mental healthcare
system. It is vital that health legislation is focused on benefiting
and treating health problems. Treatment that cannot improve or treat a
person's health should not be forcibly given to
them&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06112892000078"></a>The Bill must
also address the distressing over-representation of black and minority
ethnic people in the mental health system. Again, this is difficult,
but essential for individuals and, in the round, for society. The
Scottish mental health Act includes measures to provide services and
accommodation for mothers, of children less than one year old, with
post-natal depression. Surely there should be similar measures for
women in England and Wales. All in all, treatment for those with a
mental illness must be on the same basis, wherever possible, as with
those with a physical illness.</p><p><a name="06112892000079"></a>Finally, the Government have a fine
record in tackling the difficulties in our overall national health.
They have lacked neither courage nor patience. But I hope that this
debate will persuade them to reconsider this Bill and their position in
this too long underserved part of our health
provision.</p><h5><a name="06112892000125"></a>5.44

hard work and dedication of all those involved in drafting the Bill
before us today should be recognised and
recorded.</p><p><a name="06112892000082"></a>Like
many of your Lordships, I share a number of concerns about the general
issues raised by the Bill. For example, the proposed single definition
of mental disorder and the removal of the treatability test must be of
concern to this House. I am also exercised by a number of other
matters. I flag these up in no particular order: the importance of
having guiding principles in the Bill, and not solely in the code of
practice; the needs and rights of informal carers; provision of
improved specialised advocacy, something not present in this Bill which
was in previous Mental Health Bills in 2002 and 2004 and, if I dare say
so, one of the few changes broadly welcomed; improving the consent
provisions of the Act, which include the role of the second-opinion
appointed doctor; the needs of prisoners with mental illnesses who do
not currently receive mental health care; the use and abuse of
seclusion and restraint; information-sharing between professionals and
public bodies; advanced statements by psychiatric patients, allowing
them to refuse potentially life-saving psychiatric care; and widening
the groups of professional staff involved in compulsion. I am
particularly exercised by the idea of losing the specialist expertise
of the approved social worker, and I am not simply saying that because
I am a qualified social
worker.</p><p><a name="06112892000083"></a>I expect others will
want to discuss these points in more detail, but my intention today is
to focus on why we are discussing amendments to the Mental Health Act.
The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, referred to this Bill last week
as,</p><ul><a name="06112892000118"></a>&#147;a Home Office
Bill ... masquerading as a health
Bill&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/11/06; col.
252].</ul><a name="06112892000108"></a>Yes, some of the
amendments being proposed are about public safety, but let us not lose
sight of the fact that this debate should be concerned equally with the
protection of patients. People detained under the Mental Health Act
1983 are among the most vulnerable in our society, and I want to
address how this Bill will ensure the protection of three of those
groups in particular, and how I think we can ensure that this Bill
provides solutions that meet their
needs.<p><a name="06112892000084"></a>I
shall focus on children and young people, older people and people from
black and minority-ethnic communities. These are three of the most
vulnerable patient groups affected by this Bill. Three cross-cutting
themes will help us to ensure that amendments to the Mental Health Act
can provide solutions and meet their needs. First, there need to be
sufficient and robust statutory procedures of notification&#151;I
will elaborate on that in a moment. Secondly, there must be an adequate
system for monitoring, especially what I rather loosely term
&#147;ensuring that we look under the bed&#148;. Thirdly, we must
ensure that CPA&#151;the care programme approach&#151;is given
statutory force as the underpinning process of the proposed community
treatment
order.</p><p><a name="06112892000085"></a>The
Mental Health Act Commission has voiced concerns about the treatment of
children and adolescents under the Mental Health Act within adult
mental health facilities in each of its past four biennial reports. 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_697"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 697</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>A survey of all relevant providers for 1999-2001 found that 62 per cent
of all children and young people under 18 admitted to in-patient care
under the Act were placed on adult wards. The commission
issueda report in December 2004, examining a period
of18 months during 2002-03 when service providers were
required to notify us&#151;something not routinely done&#151;when a
child was admitted to an adult ward, so that we could undertake a
follow-up visit and examine the relevant issues. During this period we
received notification of 270 children, some as young as 12, being
admitted to adult mental health wards. Two-thirds of these young people
were boys or young men, and a third were
girls.</p><p><a name="06112892000086"></a>I am sure that your
Lordships would agree that these children were not only in an
inappropriate environment which did not cater for their basic
educational, recreational and social needs, but liable to be bullied,
have illegal, non-therapeutic or recreational drugs forced upon them,
and witness some distressing and violent scenes. Few staff working on
these wards had received any specialist training to work with children
or adolescents with mental health needs. The children were as young as
12&#151;that is surely a situation we must urgently address. We must
ensure through this legislation that the needs of children and minors,
especially those under 16, are protected and that alternative,
appropriate care is
provided.</p><p><a name="06112892000087"></a>Older people are often
subject to unacceptably low standards of care, which result in abuse.
They, especially those with dementia, are the group most likely to be
de facto detained without the benefit of the protections of the Mental
Health Act. They are not formally detained, yet they are unable to
leave. Their expectations about their rights and protections are low
and they put up with treatment that would horrify many of us. I am
reminded of the significant, albeit short-term, increase in the use of
the Act to detain elderly, incapacitated people as a result of the
Bournewood case. Therefore, I welcome the proposals in the Bill to
incorporate changes to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to deal with the
so-called Bournewood gap, but I remain concerned that they do not yet
provide adequate protections. There is still concern that decisions
under that Act will not be subject to independent scrutiny. I wish to
propose a solution to this
lacuna.</p><p><a name="06112892000088"></a>Finally, I wish to draw
your Lordships&#146; attention to the continued unacceptable
situation, which I believe to be one of the most significant remaining
scandals in the health and care system, of the disproportionate rates
of admission and detention of people from black and minority-ethnic
communities in our mental health settings. We know from the 2005 mental
health and ethnicity census of in-patients in mental health
care&#151;the first ever undertaken by the MHAC and the Healthcare
Commission&#151;that black and minority-ethnic patients are more
likely to be admitted to mental hospitals than their white
counterparts. For example, black African and black Caribbean people are
between three and five times more likely to be admitted and 30 to 40
per cent more likely to be detained. People in the young black British
group of 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_698"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 698</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the census, who are likely to be third-generation young black men, are
18 times more likely to be admitted. It is worrying that these trends
echo the report I mentioned earlier in respect of children on adult
wards, where the commission found that over a quarter&#151;about 27
per cent&#151;of young people detained on adult wards were from black
and minority-ethnic groups.</p><p><a name="06112892000089"></a>I am
deeply concerned that many young third and fourth-generation black
people are more likely than first-generation migrants to have high
admission rates. This is counterintuitive. We would expect rates to
drop as families and communities became assimilated and integrated, but
that is not happening. I am equally worried that we will see higher
levels of second and third-generation Muslim young men, in particular,
coming into the system. We do not understand all the reasons for this,
but we know that these disproportionate rates occur in the
contextof the present Act. With the Bill, we have the
opportunity to make sure that the operation of the Act is equitable in
relation to need and to ensure that it is in line with the positive
duties enshrined in the Race Relations (Amendment) Act
2000.</p><p><a name="06112892000090"></a>There are two issues about
the needs of black and minority-ethnic patients that I need to mention
briefly. First, despite the fact that it has been a mandatory
requirement to collect and record ethnic monitoring data for all
in-patients since 1995&#151;11 years now&#151;the overall
state of collection, recording and use of data is disgraceful. The
census that we conducted managed a collection rate of98.9 per
cent for ethnic monitoring data through providing training, advice and
support to service providers, so we know it can be done. From the
MHAC&#146;s regular visiting, we know that the collection, recording
and use of data are regrettably not sustained on a day-to-day basis at
ward level. Therefore we cannot hope to monitor trends, which raises
questions about how care can be adequately provided and how services
can effectively plan and develop new service
responses.</p><p><a name="06112892000091"></a>Secondly, the race
equality impact assessment undertaken by a committee that I chaired
this summer made a number of recommendations, one of which&#151;I am
pleased to say it has been adopted&#151;will allow ethnicity data
collection on patients as part of the Bournewood safeguards. However,
it is essential that the further actions described in the race equality
impact assessment are also implemented; for example, recognising that
it is essential to have culturally appropriate treatment and that there
must be adequate monitoring of the community treatment order. I am
greatly concerned that without that protection, we cannot be sure what
will happen. Let me briefly give the House two potential
scenarios.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61128-0008.htm"/>


<p><a name="06112892000092"></a>One
possibility is that because a disproportionate number of black people
are admitted under all sections of the Act, more black people will be
discharged on supervised community treatment, with the possibility that
the black community will be stigmatised further. An alternative
hypothesis is that clinical staff will become very risk averse, and the
exact opposite will occur: white patients will be discharged on CTOs,
but 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_699"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 699</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>black patients will stay even longer in hospital, leading to a
concentration effect. In either scenario, there is a real danger that
the new approved mental health practitioners will become social
policemen with all the attendant and obvious problems of tension
between patients and professionals. These potential problems need
careful monitoring and, to do that, good quality data will need to be
collected, recorded and
analysed.</p><p><a name="06112892000093"></a>In summary, we must
strengthen the protections for all those subject to compulsion,
including de facto detained patients as well as those correctly
detained under the Act, and we must provide enhanced protections for
children and older people who are admitted to or detained in mental
health facilities.</p><p><a name="06112892000094"></a>At the
beginning of my speech, I said that I would propose three solutions,
and I shall do so briefly. First, enhancing the protection of the
rights of service users, especially children and older people, demands
that we know where patients are, how many they are, their ethnicity and
their specific health needs. In Committee, I will table amendments to
give statutory effect to notification of all formal admissions to the
Mental Health Act Commission, with a particular emphasis on children
under 18 and older patients, and with sufficient resources to monitor
their care; and notification of all deaths of patients in mental health
and psychiatric facilities, whether detained or not. Noble Lords may be
surprised to learn that each year approximately 380 detained patients
die in care, and about a quarter of the deaths are termed
&#147;unnatural&#148;; that is, they are suicides, occur in
suspicious circumstances and so
on.</p><p><a name="06112892000095"></a>Secondly,
I wish to see an adequate and robust system in place to ensure that
monitoring of the operation of the Act is fully supported with
appropriate information collection. I will table an amendment to ensure
that we strengthen the existing monitoring requirements so that all
services assess, record and retain for analysis and action data on the
ethnicity, age, first language and religion of patients. Ethnic
recording remains unacceptably low, despite a mandatory requirement on
providers for the past 11 years, and it will be essential for the
proper implementation of the Bill that services are required
statutorily to record ethnicity, age, language and religion and to
report them to the Mental Health Act Commission. I need not remind the
House that we are witnessing a growing tide of religious bigotry and
discrimination, often directed against Muslim and Jewish members of our
communities. Knowing the religion of patients will enable us to monitor
and address any discrimination within mental health services on that
basis.</p><p><a name="06112892000096"></a>Lastly,
I wish to see safeguards that will ensure that the proposed
arrangements for community treatment orders are adequately underpinned
by the care programme approach. At present, CPA does not have statutory
force and, as a consequence, it is inconsistently used and too often
used very badly. If we have to have a community treatment order,
patients must have a robust care plan to go with it, and the Bill
offers the opportunity to make CPA a statutory requirement for the
community treatment order and thus extend it to all patients being
discharged. An alternative approach would be to focus on the care plan
instead of a community treatment 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_700"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 700</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>order, which would give the patient statutory rights to the services
covered by the care plan. I will also table an amendment to provide for
improved independent monitoring of the proposed Section 17 community
treatment order.</p><p><a name="06112892000097"></a>I believe
action across these three areas will greatly improve the Bill and will
go some way towards providing the protections that are essential for
any modern mental health legislation in a decent and humane
society.</p><h5><a name="06112897000026"></a>5.59

Howarth of Breckland:</b> My Lords, it is somewhat
intimidating to follow the noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford, because
he has great expertise. It is also particularly intimidating to speak
at this position in the list because many of the points have been made.
I shall try not to repeat them, although, as I know the
Minister&#146;s attention is not always long&#151;that was not what
I meant, but it woke us all up&#151;I want to begin by congratulating
the Government on the present mental health services. I have worked in
mental health for nearly four decades, and the change that was
described earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, has been
outstanding. I worked in large institutions containing elderly people
who should have been out in the community, young women who were
incarcerated because they had had an illegitimate child and many people
who seemed rather more normal than those in community, but we have
moved on to a quite different place.</p><p><a name="06112897000002"></a>It is clear from sitting on Committee G
of the EU Scrutiny Committee considering the Green Paper on the EU
mental health strategy that we are leaders in Europe. I am sure that
there many other nations from which we can learn, but we have much to
share with the rest of Europe. But we can do better.</p><p><a name="06112897000003"></a>Like many previous speakers, I have some
disappointment with the Bill. It is a curious mixture and arouses
strong and deviant feelings. I think that the noble Baroness, Lady
Gibson, is optimistic that we will all agree at the end of the day.
Like others, I welcome the Bournewood provisions, but also, like my
colleagues, would like to see that the principles of implementation are
in the Bill and that there is greater clarification, including exactly
how Schedule 6 will work in practice. Having been the deputy chair of
the National Care Standards Commission, I have real anxieties about
that implementation and who can make the
application.</p><p><a name="06112897000004"></a>However, I intend
to spend my few minutes concentrating on a major gap in the
Bill&#151;the mental health service for children and young
people&#151;and then to raise some questions about definition and
role. The only references I can find to child patients are those in new
Sections 64E and 64F. I am unclear if these sections remove the
confusion about whether parental consent can be used to admit 17 and 18
year-olds for treatment against their will. The provision clarifying
this in the previous draft Bill appears to be omitted in this one
Bill.</p><p><a name="06112897000005"></a>On a more general note, it
seems a lost opportunity not to address those issues of child and
adolescent mental health that touch on containment and are at 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_701"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 701</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>odds with the Children Acts and the frameworks for children. The
Minister knows only too well that children are not the same as adults.
They have different levels of development and dependency and they
process and react to problems differently. Those aged under 18 need
expert, age-appropriate provision, not&#151;as is happening in
significant numbers&#151;to be treated on adult
wards.</p><p><a name="06112897000006"></a>YoungMinds, a charity
which I admire and commend, is dedicated to promoting and improving the
mental health of all children and young people. It would like to see an
assessment of therapeutic benefit and safety of young people if they
are admitted to an adult ward. The Minister will no doubt quote Ivan
Lewis, who has made the welcome request to the health service to
prevent children being held on adult wards as an &#147;unprecedented
priority&#148;. But where is the response and the implementation?
What are the Government doing to enable that to happen when they do
not, as we have already heard, have verified central statistics on the
numbers? YoungMinds knows of young people who have witnessed and
experienced verbal and sexual violence on adult wards, and been denied
access to education. Drug abuse is a major problem. Wards have 30 to 40
patients and are often overcrowded. There is a reliance on sedation and
drug treatment, rather than talking therapies. The welcome growth of
crisis and other teams which can keep people in the community, means
that the severity of illness of people on wards is likely to increase.
These are not places in which to treat our
young.</p><p><a name="06112897000007"></a>If resources can be found
for the supervision of adults in the community&#151;a response to the
media highlighting a few cases, although something I welcome&#151;why
cannot they be found for those with less voice; our children and young
people? Will the Government consider legislation similar to the Mental
Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act, in Section 23 which says
that there should be
provided,</p><ul><a name="06112897000025"></a>&#147;services
and accommodation as are sufficient for the ... child or young
person&#148;?</ul><a name="06112897000022"></a>There was,
after all, a recommendation by the 2005 Joint Committee on the draft
Mental Health Bill
that:<ul><a name="06112897000024"></a>&#147;There should be
a duty on health authorities to provide age-appropriate accommodation
for under-18s subject to the Bill or needing in-patient
treatment&#148;.</ul><a name="06112897000023"></a>Why has
that provision been lost?<p><a name="06112897000008"></a>We
have already heard of children who live in households with adults
suffering from mental health problems. Some of these adults may well be
on the new community supervision orders. My concern here is about the
focus and training of these officers, who will be there primarily, as I
understand it, for the supervisee. Can we be assured that they will not
lose sight of the family as a whole and, in particular, understand
issues around child development and child protection? Like the
Minister, my background stretches back to the days before the Seebohm
reorganisation. Since then we have come full circle. The lessons learnt
must make for a better holistic family service than we have achieved
thus far. As has been mentioned, Barnardo&#146;s has drawn our
attention 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_702"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 702</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the many children who care for a parent with a mental disorder. Will
the new workers be able to give some help to those
children?</p><p><a name="06112897000009"></a>I now turn to Clause 3
dealing with the clarification of definitions of mental disorder. As
the deputy chair of the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, an organisation that
has led the way in understanding the treatment of child
abusers&#151;not all of whom would be described as
paedophiles&#151;it is helpful to see those whose distorted mental
processes enable them to sexually abuse our young brought into the
scope of the 1983 Act. Like many parts of the Bill, this takes us into
the overlap between the role of the Home Office in dealing with
offenders and that of the Department of Health in treating those with a
mental illness or disorder.</p><p><a name="06112897000010"></a>The
foundation&#146;s residential clinic was closed in 2002, although we
have continued our work in the community with the support of
government. The re-opening of the clinic has been hampered by a curious
ruling that we can no longer lock in the men we treat in the
institution, although we did so for many years&#151;and very
successfully. Through this Bill, we might find a way for the foundation
to continue its important and renowned work of treating offenders and
so protect our children.</p><p><a name="06112897000011"></a>As we
move through Committee, I am sure that we will begin to tease out the
balance of compulsion and rights, so well outlined by the noble
Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, at the beginning of the debate. During
those discussions, I hope that we will also understand the relationship
between those who deliver care and treatment and cut through the silos
that divide departments. The Bill seeks this continuity of care. After
all, how many mentally ill people are in prison with little or no
treatment? How many, simply by categorisation, do not receive the
appropriate help? We have heard that this is particularly true of those
from black racial backgrounds, but it is also true of adolescents. In
my day, we had a great debate on the deprived and the
depraved&#151;whether you were deprived and therefore in trouble or
really wicked and therefore in trouble. I suggest that there is not
that demarcation and that somewhere in that spectrum, particularly with
young people, there is a great need to look at how we incarcerate them
and the kind of help we give to
them.</p><p><a name="06112897000012"></a>There are more
developments in cognitive behavioural therapies for people with
so-called personality disorders. I therefore contend that the divisions
between containment and treatment are not so easily defined. The new
community order will surely help to bridge that spectrum. But, no
doubt, we will spend a great deal of time looking at these concepts. I
only hope the issues around children and mental health services will
have as much attention as those about
containment.</p><h5><a name="06112897000027"></a>6.08

Bill, I feel that there is much more that unites us than divides
us.</p><p><a name="06112897000014"></a>I approach this debate as
someone who has worked for UNISON for many years&#151;alongside
members delivering a wide range of mental health services&#151;and,
incidentally, I am pleased that UNISON is supporting the Bill today. I
also approach the issue as a housing campaigner, who has seen first
hand the increased prevalence of mental health issues among the
homeless, which some estimate to be as high as60 per cent, and
the frequent lack of suitable treatment which leads to rapid mental,
and associated physical, deterioration on the streets.</p><p><a name="06112897000015"></a>We all recognise that the best mental
health solution for most people most of the time is a package of
effective care in the community. We also know that, regrettably, the
reality for all too many individuals in the community is that they feel
lonely, isolated and scared. That isolation impacts not just on the
individuals concerned but on their friends and family, who can find
themselves substituting for inadequate care packages. For people on the
streets with no family support network and no adequate care package,
their mental health issues can put additional pressures on housing and
social services and exacerbate the
problem.</p><p><a name="06112897000016"></a>Despite
the Government&#146;s investment and commitment, we are still facing
enormous challenges. That was clearly illustrated by the previous
extensive debate in which we struggled to find a way forward that
balances the complex rights and needs of individuals with a workable
Bill. The time for reflection has been fruitful and, this time, the
Government have found the right
solution.</p><p><a name="06112897000017"></a>Last Thursday, I had
the privilege to be in the Chamber to hear the maiden speech of the
most reverend Primate of the Archbishop of York. Although my
nonconformist tendencies are well known, I was very impressed by his
contribution. In particular, he talked about the importance of values
and beliefs in delivering change. His concern was that the Government
might have an over-reliance on the power of legislation and sanctions
rather than partnership with institutions, groups and individuals in
the community. That advice holds some important lessons with regard to
the progress of the Bill.</p><p><a name="06112897000018"></a>We
have here a simplified, streamlined Bill with new rights for
individuals and new safeguards for communities. We should welcome it
and move on to concentrate on the elements of mental health that
require partnership, not legislation&#151;in particular, the
challenge of delivering resources for effective care packages in the
community.</p><p><a name="06112897000019"></a>I
welcome the concept of community treatment orders. We must acknowledge
that there are some occasions when individuals&#146; mental health
can go into freefall, when they are unable to make rational calls about
their diagnoses or treatment. Community treatment orders can provide
those individuals with a vital safety net. Equally, health
professionals would feel more confident in choosing community care
rather than secure hospitalisation if they could be guaranteed that
their patient was not being discharged into a void.

to make difficult decisions about their loved
ones.</p><p><a name="06112897000020"></a>I also welcome the new
rights for patients to nominate an appropriate individual to assist

effective care and increase the total staff resource in the
community.</p><p><a name="06112897000021"></a>I
said at the outset that there is more that unites us than divides us. I
hope that during the coming weeks, we can continue dialogue with the
professional and voluntary organisations to find a consensus. I hope
that any discussion will recognise the merits of a simplified Bill and
that a great deal of what we all want to achieve can be delivered by
partnership, not legislation. That should include using the
opportunities in the draft code of practice to spell out the key
elements of mental health services that we all feel would be
appropriate for a modern
age.</p><h5><a name="06112899000079"></a>6.14

declare a number of interests before I make my brief comments about the
Bill. I was part of the team that devised the Delivering<I></I>Race<I></I>Equality programme already mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Patel
of Bradford. It is worth mentioning the others who have worked hard to
deliver that programme and are still working hard on the issues of
mental health and black minority ethnic communities. They are Dr Kwame
McKenzie, Professor Kam Bhui and Professor David Sallah, who is at this
moment working hard on delivering race equality in mental
health.</p><p><a name="06112899000002"></a>Along
with the Minister, Rosie Winterton, I am the co-chair of the steering
group charged with improving the experience of mental healthcare for
black and minority ethnic communities as part of the Delivering Race
Equality programme. I am also the chief executive of Turning Point, a
social care organisation that works with more than 135,000 people in
250 locations, more than 6,000 of whom have mental health challenges
but many of whom have mental health challenges, substance misuse
challenges and learning disabilities. Our services span forensic mental
health through to learning disabilities and substance misuse. Turning
Point is also a member of the Mental Health Alliance already kindly
mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone, and is,
I think it is fair to say, a leading member of the Making Decisions
Alliance, which is relevant to the Bournewood gap already mentioned by
the noble Lord, Lord Rix.</p><p><a name="06112899000003"></a>Due to
time constraints and the wealth of experience already expressed by
others in the Chamber, I shall focus my remarks on a few key points.
First, I acknowledge the open style in which the noble Lord, Lord
Warner, introduced the Bill when he invited the House to engage with
the Government to make improvements. We all want a solution that
promotes mental health and gets people the right help at the right
time&#151;and, with due regard to the remarks made by the noble Lord,
Lord Bragg, 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_705"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 705</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>protects the public. I will be the first through the open door to assist
the Government in making the Bill
better.</p><p><a name="06112899000004"></a>I want to refer to
several issues: context, service improvement, dual diagnosis, community
treatment, the Bournewood gap and personality disorders. That may sound
like a long list, but I promise that I shall be quick. As it stands,
the perception is that the Bill will not in and of itself improve
patient care and promote public safety. It is also the perception that
the Government have kept some of the more controversial clauses but
dropped some of the more important safeguards, such as
advocacy.</p><p><a name="06112899000005"></a>I believe strongly
that services should be improved before compulsory powers are
increased. Compulsion should always be a last resort. In that, I agree
very much with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Warner. This very
afternoon, service users and carers from all over the country will no
doubt have made similar views known to many colleagues in another
place.</p><p><a name="06112899000006"></a>The Bill is perceived as
being about the law of compulsion and not about service delivery.
However, it cannot be divorced from the wider context. The fact is that
if people can get the right support when they need it, more people will
use services voluntarily and compulsory powers will be needed less
frequently. The overwhelming evidence is that if people voluntarily
seek help, they are more engaged with services and are more likely to
get better. Therefore, society is
safer.</p><p><a name="06112899000007"></a>Mental health law should
be updated, but services should be improved as an essential first step
before increasing compulsory powers. It would be irresponsible for this
House simply to rubber stamp the use of further compulsion with no
absolute guarantees that that will go hand-in-hand with the essential
service improvements.</p><p><a name="06112899000008"></a>There is
evidence that services have improved. There is less discrimination in
the use of compulsion in some BME communities. We want a reduction in
the widespread cuts in mental health services that have been applied to
tackle the great NHS deficits. Universal access to voluntary community
treatment, especially preventive and crisis intervention services, will
be further evidence of improvement. We want fewer inquiries that cite
critical structural failure and lack of resources as key factors
leading to homicides or serious incidents, such as the Barrett inquiry,
which said that the remedy for what went wrong in that case lies not
just in new laws. That would all be evidence that services have
improved.</p><p><a name="06112899000009"></a>Services need to be
improved in the following ways. There needs to be a focus on funding
prevention; more support on discharge patients and ongoing care;
advocacy to help people to express their views on their treatment, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, has already said; and improved
inter-agency working through the care programme approach already
mentioned by my noble friend Lord Patel of Bradford. The Government
should consider giving the CPA framework statutory force, so that
services have a legal obligation to follow it and to provide the
treatment and support outlined in the care plan.</p>

Point has focused on dual diagnosis in cases where someone has both a
substance misuse problem and a mental health challenge. We agree with
the Government that people should not be subject to compulsion on the
basis of drug or alcohol dependence alone. However, I am concerned
that, under the new Bill, people with a dual diagnosis who need help
under the Act might still be turned away. It should be clear not only
in the code of practice but in the Bill that drug or alcohol dependency
should not exclude people from treatment if they also have another type
of mental disorder.</p><p><a name="06112899000011"></a>As has been
mentioned, the Bill proposes supervised community treatment in the form
of community treatment orders. These can be acceptable only if
community treatment is for a very tightly defined group of
people&#151;we have already referred to revolving-door
patients&#151;and is accompanied by stronger safeguards such as time
limits, with the close monitoring of the powers that clinicians will
have over patients&#146; freedom; the condition that they live in a
certain place or abstain from particular conduct; and sufficient
resources for appropriate&#151;and culturally
appropriate&#151;treatment to be available.</p><p><a name="06112899000012"></a>Discrimination also
needs to be acknowledgedand addressed in practice. The
Government have acknowledged that there is widespread discrimination in
mental health services, and all the evidence is that this is likely to
be mirrored under supervised community treatment. Furthermore, under
community treatment, more people will be subject to compulsory powers
as they will not be dependent on the need for admission. This will mean
that more people from black and minority ethnic communities will face
discrimination.</p><p><a name="06112899000013"></a>We welcome the
proposals to deal with the Bournewood gap, although it has taken eight
years to get to this stage. However, we want changes that simply make
that gap fairer. As the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has already mentioned, a
simple change would be to change the automatic review period to six
months, not a year, and to ensure that the right safeguards are in
place to protect people who lack the capacity to give informed consent
to treatment. In particular, there must be safeguards for people where
depriving them of their liberty is not authorised. Will the Minister
agree to meet representatives of the Making Decisions Alliance to
discuss the proposals on the Bournewood gap in more
detail?</p><p><a name="06112899000014"></a>My
organisation works very closely with significant numbers of people with
personality disorders, some of whom have an official diagnosis and some
of whom who do not. Of these, most are in mental health services, but
some substance misuse services, particularly the open-access services,
are reporting an increasing number of them. We acknowledge that there
have been problems with the treatability test: namely, that it is often
misunderstood, is inconsistently applied, and has contributed to a
culture where some patients requiring compulsory treatment are labelled
as untreatable and are therefore denied access to the services that
they need. This perception also affects people seeking help
voluntarily. It also identifies the problem of focusing on certain
disorders, and therefore on certain individuals, leading to some people
being singled out.</p>

Government&#146;s analysis of this problem, the new proposals may
still fail to meet the personality disorder challenge. There is real
concern that, whether the treatability test or the appropriate
treatment test is used, people will not get access to treatment because
there is little consensus on what treatments are appropriate. Services
for people with personality disorders are still poor, and staff are not
necessarily trained properly to work with people with a personality
disorder.</p><p><a name="06112899000016"></a>The Government are at
last addressing some of the glaring inequalities, which have already
been mentioned, that some people from black and minority ethnic
communities experience when using mental health services. The work of
the Delivering Race Equality programme is hugely important. The first
Count Me In surveys have already highlighted shocking inequalities, the
delivery of focused implementation sites has started to spread good
practice, and there are pilot community engagement projects and a
coalition of stakeholders to support the better delivery of mental
health services to black and minority ethnic groups. The Bill should
act to support this work and not militate against
it.</p><p><a name="06112899000017"></a>The sufficient cultural
training of approved mental health professionals and responsible
clinicians is also critical, and principles are needed in the Bill to
ensure that it is implemented in the way in which it is intended to be.
This is particularly relevant to black and minority ethnic
communities.</p><p><a name="06112899000018"></a>In
conclusion, the Bill needs substantial amendment. As it stands, it will
not improve patient care or necessarily promote public safety. Services
should be improved before compulsory powers are increased, and
compulsion should be used as a last resort. The Bill is the start of
the process, and I compliment the Government on at least acknowledging
that this process is needed. We are, however, a long way from producing
a Bill that will satisfy the needs of many of the people protesting in
the other place this
evening.</p><h5><a name="06112899000080"></a>6.26

Meacher:</b> My Lords, I welcome the opportunity to
debate a new Mental Health Bill purporting to rectify the gross
inequalities and disadvantages experienced by people with dementia or
learning difficulties identified by the Bournewood case, and which the
Mental Health Act Commission discussed more than 20 years ago. That
tells you something about how long it takes to go from having an idea
to having something done about it. But the Bournewood gap is not the
only area where reform is needed. The Government are right to tackle
some of the issues that have arisen where the 1983 Act has become
inconsistent with modern practice. For example, Section 26 of the Act,
which defines the nearest relative, takes no account of the
increasingly normal practice of involving service users in the
decisions that affect their care.</p><p><a name="06112899000020"></a>A new legislative framework with proper
safeguards for compulsory treatment in the community for a small number
of revolving-door patients is justified. I will explain why in due
course. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to deal with the 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_708"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 708</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unsustainable position of foundation trusts that cannot delegate the
functions of Mental Health Act managers from non-executive directors.
That is a small technical point, but one that is causing absolute havoc
around the country. Having said that, many of the proposals in the Bill
are seriously flawed and need amendment. I have several main concerns.
The first is the absence of a statement of principles, which noble
Lords have already mentioned. These are important to guide
professionals in exercising their powers under the
legislation.</p><p><a name="06112899000021"></a>The Royal College
of Psychiatrists rightly points out that patients&#146; choice and
participation in their own care are central tenets in the new NHS. In a
crisis, however, patients may not have the capacity to exercise their
autonomy. Advance statements, setting out both what a patient wishes to
occur and what treatment they would refuse in the event of being
detained and lacking capacity, are gaining currency as useful and
empowering tools for service users. In my humble opinion, the Bill
needs to make provision for those
statements.</p><p><a name="06112899000022"></a>One caveat to the
principle of the autonomy of the patient which I believe we neglected
when the 1983 Act was being developed and debated&#151;I was heavily
involved at that time&#151;is the need to take account of the needs
and human rights of carers; for example, the right to family life under
Article 8 of the convention. Having worked over the years with families
caring for a family member with a severe mental health problem, and
having spent five years as a Mental Health Act commissioner, I am aware
that some families&#146; lives have been severely disrupted&#151;I
suppose one has to say that that can be an understatement&#151;or
they have lived, and still live, in fear of their loved one, who
refuses to take medication. The legislation will need to find the right
balance between the autonomy of the patient and the reasonable rights
of carers. I do not believe this has been achieved in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06112899000023"></a>The second core principle
is that of seeking the least restrictive alternative, and again the
needs of carers, as well as of patients, must be taken into account in
the legislation when putting forward this principle.</p><p><a name="06112899000024"></a>Like other noble Lords, I, too, am
concerned about the criteria for detention. The proposed introduction
of the appropriate treatment test and the abolition of the requirement
that the treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration in
the patient&#146;s condition opens the way for detaining people for
whom there will be no therapeutic benefit&#151;a form of preventive
imprisonment. My main objection is that to override a person&#146;s
autonomy and impose detention and treatment on health grounds, which
may have no therapeutic benefit, is unethical and therefore has no
place in a mental health law of this country.</p><p><a name="06112899000025"></a>We also need to consider the implications
of such a system for the reputation of psychiatrists&#151;who may
become the jailers&#151;the stigma attached to mental illness and the
welfare of people with mental health problems in general. I share the
concerns of the Joint Scrutiny Committee and the Mental Health Alliance
about these issues. The Bill would add to the number 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_709"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 709</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of patients under compulsion and would thereby take resources away from
voluntary patients and those services designed to reduce the need for
compulsion, such as early intervention, assertive outreach and other
recent developments.</p><p><a name="06112899000026"></a>If community treatment
orders are introduced as they stand in the Bill, they could have
profound and very serious consequences for service users, professionals
and the reputation of mental health services as a whole. I agree with
the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the BMA and many others that there
may be a small number of revolving-door patients who would benefit from
CTOs. This proposition would assume several admissions before a CTO
could be applied. As the Bill is drafted, almost every person who would
now be discharged from detention under a treatment section, even on a
first admission to hospital, could become subject to a CTO and thus
required to comply with a regime of medication on an indefinite basis.
Once ona CTO it is difficult to envisage conditions when a
patient might be discharged from that order. This is a potentially
tyrannical regime.</p><p><a name="06112899000027"></a>In this
context we need to bear in mind that the side effects of anti-psychotic
medication for some patients are less tolerable than the symptoms of
their illness, and those symptoms are horrendous in many cases. To
impose such treatment for longer than absolutely necessary for such
patients should be possible only in extreme cases. The consequences of
such CTOs would be exacerbated by the current blame culture. Every
tragedy involving the death of or caused by a mental health service
user tends to lead to recriminations and criticisms of psychiatrists.
We are in danger of creating a mental health system dictated by our
tabloid press.</p><p><a name="06112899000028"></a>The result of
the CTO criteria as presented could be the wholesale application of
CTOs because of the fear of professionals. Tight criteria are essential
to protect patients and professionals. Excessive use of CTOs would
undermine the efforts of doctors, nurses and social workers to
establish a trusting and therapeutic relationship with service users,
which is difficult enough following a period of detention in hospital
with the loss of liberty and controls by professionals that this
inevitably entails. Particularly serious could be the disincentive for
patients to seek early help. At risk would be the work of early
intervention teams, which are one of the great innovations of the
Government in recent years. These teams were designed to prevent the
development of revolving-door patients lurching from crisis to crisis
throughout their adult lives. The envisaged CTOs could seriously
undermine this work by increasing the fear and stigma associated with
secondary mental health services. Families would do anything to delay
the time when their young, increasingly ill son or daughter became
embroiled with those stigmatised and frightening
services.</p><p><a name="06112899000029"></a>In
this context, it is worth noting the Australian experience where CTOs
were embraced in a major way and coincided with a serious failure of
community care. The Scottish CTO system, which was discussed in a
recent King&#146;s Fund report, risks jeopardising its community care
provision. In the Scottish case, the 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_710"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 710</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>burden of increased bureaucracy and workloads on mental health staff is
creating fears,</p><ul><a name="06112899000076"></a>&#147;that
mental health CTOs may result in fewer services being available for
other people with mental health
needs&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06112899000030"></a>Clause 25 sets
out the five conditions to which a patient under a CTO would be subject
while the order remains in force. This is a slightly smaller point, but
it is nevertheless important. I support the view expressed by the Joint
Committee that the conditions should be limited to requirements or
limitations on a person&#146;s place of residence and their
medication. In particular, the
condition,</p><ul><a name="06112899000077"></a>&#147;that the
patient abstain from particular
conduct&#148;,</ul><a name="06112899000075"></a>is out of
place in mental health legislation. It seems to have been brought
across from the
ASBO.<p><a name="06112899000031"></a>The
Bill introduces anomalies concerning professional roles which cannot be
justified. The Royal College of Psychiatrists points out that under the
new Bill, as in the 1983 Act, only registered medical practitioners are
deemed to have the necessary training to make the initial
recommendation that a patient meets the relevant conditions for
compulsion. Quite rightly, the initial detention for treatment is made
only with the recommendations of two registered medical practitioners
and an approved mental health practitioner, which is a proper
multi-disciplinary assessment. How then can it be suggested that one
responsible clinician, who may not be medically trained and thus have
many years of psychiatry training behind them, is able to ensure that
the relevant conditions are still satisfied when the patient&#146;s
section is to be renewed? Is that consistent?</p><p><a name="06112899000032"></a>It is surely even less appropriate to
propose that a responsible clinician, who may not be a doctor, may
discharge a detained patient from hospital on toa community
treatment order. In view of the seriousness of such a step for the
service user, which is potentially more serious than the original
detention order, the reputation of mental health services and the
likely impact on the quality of therapeutic relationships in the
community, the decision should surely be made by a psychiatrist
probably requiring a second medical opinion and, very importantly,
involving the full multi-disciplinary team. A further inconsistency
concerns the decision to recall the patient to hospital. The Bill
envisages this decision being made by the responsible
clinician&#151;again, not necessarily a doctor&#151;and an approved
mental health professional. A similar process is proposed for the
revocation of the CTO.</p><p><a name="06112899000033"></a>The new Bill fails to
follow the recommendation of the Joint Committee with respect to
electro-convulsive therapy. It provides for a responsible clinician who
may not be a doctor potentially to prescribe ECT. The Government may
have in mind to deal with this matter in regulations, but the Bill
would appear to be a more appropriate place for such provisions. Thus,
the Bill presents three different proposals for the professionals or
sets of professionals required to make key detention and treatment
decisions. I ask the Government to consider the consistency or
acceptable nature of those
proposals.</p><p><a name="06112899000034"></a>Finally,
many noble Lords have spoken about the Bournewood gap, so I shall be
brief. Most Bournewood gap patients require high levels of care and
supervision. 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_711"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 711</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Many, but for their compliance with the proposals for their care, albeit
often non-capacitous compliance, would be detained under the Mental
Health Act. I share the concerns of the Mental Health Alliance that the
safeguards set out in the Mental Health Bill are less strong and less
effective than those under the Mental Health Act. In particular, under
Section 58, there is a statutory second medical opinion procedure for
medication beyond three months and for ECT. The Bournewood patients do
not have that protection in the Mental Health Bill. They surely should.
Statutory second medical opinions should also be required for treatment
of these vulnerable patients for physical conditions. I cannot leave
this subject without paying tribute to the powerful speech made by the
noble Baroness, Lady Knight, with whom I do not always agree. She made
a truly wonderful speech about the shocking starvation of elderly
patients. Certainly, we have to find a way of protecting those
patients.</p><p><a name="06112899000035"></a>In summary, the Bill
needs to be amended. However, in my view this is not a party political
issue. In 1983 the political parties worked together to achieve a high
quality piece of legislation, as it was for its time. The issues here
are matters of ethics, justice and legislative support for a modern,
community-focused and patient-centred mental health service. I hope we
can once again work on a cross-party basis to formulate amendments that
will find the right balance between the needs of patients or service
users, carers and the
community.</p><h5><a name="06112899000081"></a>6.40

Pitkeathley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
the style and substance of his remarks and welcome his offer of working
together to improve the Bill as it proceeds through this House, because
I think that we are going to need to. I want to declare two interests.
First, last year I was a member of the scrutiny committee on the
original Bill so ably chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, who I
know regrets very much being unable to be with us today. Secondly, for
many years my main concern about mental health issues was from the
point of view of family carers. It is widely accepted that of all
carers, these families often have the hardest time for reasons that are
well documented and have been mentioned by other noble
Lords.</p><p><a name="06112899000037"></a>We must acknowledge that
changing the law on mental health is an extraordinarily difficult task.
The amount of time it has taken successive Parliaments and countless
Ministers to get to this stage, the number of Bills suggested, drafted
and then abandoned, is surely proof of that. The Government are to be
congratulated on being willing to venture into these dangerous waters.
But before we change the law we have to be absolutely sure that the
change will bring benefits and leave us in a better situation than
before. But there is the rub, because when I talk about
&#147;us&#148;, to whom am I referring? A mental health law must
satisfy many people and cover many areas: professional workers,
including doctors and nurses; carers and families; and, above all, the
needs of patients themselves.</p>



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_712"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 712</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06112899000038"></a>According to public reactions&#151;and
your Lordships will have received as many briefings as I
have&#151;the Bill as it stands satisfies no one except for perhaps a
small proportion of the public who believe that anyone with a mental
illness is a danger to others and must be detained or forcibly treated.
It is true that a few people fall into that category, but the number is
tiny compared with the vast numbers who live in misery, often
committing suicide, and who bring similar misery to their families.
Many would argue that in order to improve our mental health service we
do not need legislation at all, but only an improvement in the services
provided. Too many people with mental health problems are in prison, in
poor housing, living on inadequate benefits and in a cycle of
deprivation which seems never-ending. Legislation is not the way to
deal with these problems; co-ordinated and more extensive services are
the way.</p><p><a name="06112899000039"></a>A criticism which has
been levelled at the Bill, I am bound to say with some justification,
is that it concentrates on containing and controlling the few, not on
treating the many. As the Bill progresses through Parliament, I hope
that Ministers will be able to give further assurances that it is one
strand, but one strand only, of a policy programme which might at last
see mental health services be less the Cinderella than they have been
hitherto. However, like other noble Lords, I acknowledge the
Government&#146;s great record on mental health services, not only in
extra resources but in the extra interest they have shown. Here I
should like also to commend the amazing work carried out over many
years by the many campaigning organisations that represent the
interests of those with mental illness and their families. We must
remember too that many of the most effective ways of dealing with
mental illness do not cost a lot of money. The work of my noble friend
Lord Layard, for example, which has been mentioned before, shows that
the provision of cognitive behavioural therapy at an early stage is not
only cheap but also extremely effective in preventing the need for
further expense later on.</p><p><a name="06112899000040"></a>I
welcome the withdrawal of the treatability test in the draft Bill which
is to be replaced by a test that appropriate treatment is available,
and the definition of treatment is broad, including therapies,
counselling and rehabilitation. But the downside is that it may open
the door to far too much compulsion, raising concerns in
patient/user/carer groups about inappropriate detention and compulsion.
So here again we see the problem with mental health legislation: what
is welcome for one reason is unwelcome for
another.</p><p><a name="06112899000041"></a>Nowhere is this more
apparent than in the area of community treatment orders. Anyone who has
ever listened to accounts of the nightmare experiences of carers of
those with a mental health problem, what they go through because of the
so-called &#147;revolving door&#148; syndrome, will welcome this
provision. Carers see their loved ones&#151;and here I should say as
an aside that they usually are loved ones in spite of the fact that
families are often seen as the cause of the problem or even as the
enemy by mental health professionals&#151;treated in hospital
compulsorily. They take their medication, get better and are discharged




<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_713"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 713</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>into the community, often into the care of
relatives&#151;long-suffering relatives. Once out of hospital, they
cannot be compelled to take their medication and so in spite of the
efforts of their families or their professional carers, they stop
taking it and the downward spiral begins again until they are bad
enough to be admitted and compulsorily medicated. But distressing as
these cases are, we should remember that they are comparatively few in
number. It is for that reason that the scrutiny committee recommended
that CTOs be explicitly limited to a clearly defined and clinically
identifiable group of patients. There is great anxiety about possible
infringements of patients&#146; rights, and I always want us to be
alive to infringements of carers&#146; rights
too.</p><p><a name="06112899000042"></a>All too
often carers are denied any access to information about the condition
of the patient or of the likely prognosis, while at the same time being
expected to provide care in the most stressful of circumstances. It is
possible in most circumstances to deal with these apparently
conflicting sets of rights, but it requires time, good negotiating
skills and experience on the part of the mental health professionals
who do this work. One or all of these are too often missing, and there
is a danger here on which we seek reassurance: whether CTOs will be
used as a sledgehammer to crack a nut and as a substitute for proper
assessment which takes into account the needs of all the parties
involved. A right to a full assessment of all health and social care
needs is surely not too much to ask at the beginning of a
person&#146;s involvement with mental health services before
treatment of any kind is
prescribed.</p><p><a name="06112899000043"></a>Perhaps the biggest
issue for carers is the fact that relatives, partners and friends do
not get either an assessment when they need one or the support they
need. The current system of assessments and requests for help coming
from the patient does not help to get early support and intervention to
people when they need it. The only alternative is to wait for the
crisis when more intervention is necessary, which is costly not only
for the state but for the individuals and those caring for them in
personal as well as in financial terms. It is critical that people with
mental illness have the right to an assessment at an early stage and
that the referral systems are sensitive enough to respond to the
presentation of an illness at an early
stage.</p><p><a name="06112899000044"></a>I want to say another
word about carers&#146; rights. The sections on supervised compulsory
treatment raise new issues on carers&#146; rights, yet they do not
provide a mechanism for balancing those rights. Under proposed new
Section 17B(3), for example, one of the conditions is that the patient
reside in a particular place. It is critical that there is some
consultation and discussion about where that place is. For example, if
it is with a carer, and particularly in the carer&#146;s home, and
the person with mental illness and the carer no longer want to live
together, then the treatment order needs to be sufficiently flexible to
allow that to happen rather than to trap individuals into situations
that might involve breaches of the Human Rights Act as well as a great
deal of distress.</p>



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_714"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 714</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06112899000045"></a>I welcome the nearest relative provisions
and that the powers they contain are being retained. These are
important provisions and I welcome in particular the fact that they are
being updated to ensure that civil partners have equal rights to those
of husbands and wives to be treated as nearest relatives. But while the
Department of Health has rightly accepted that the provisions need to
be updated and amended, it may have missed an opportunity in this area.
I know that over the years Carers UK has provided the department with
many examples of where carers are excluded from decision-making because
they are not at the top of the nearest relatives list. In former draft
Bills, the department has suggested that carers should be second in the
ranking after the nominated person, and many people still feel that
this should be the case.</p><p><a name="06112899000046"></a>I am
also concerned that the patient or carer will have to go through the
county court system to displace a nearest relative. This could prove
divisive and inaccessible for patients and carers
alike.</p><p><a name="06112899000047"></a>The other issue that the
Bill must ultimately deal with is to bring about a culture change where
information from carers is valued, as is their involvement. It is
unreasonable to expect a family to care for someone but not equip them
with the information they need to do so and to ignore their views and
concerns when this could have led to better or more appropriate
treatment for the person for whom they care. The vast majority of
carers act in the best interests of the person for whom they care, and
we should never forget
that.</p><p><a name="06112899000048"></a>Your
Lordships will understand that I am, at best, ambivalent about the
Bill. I cannot forget the overwhelming view of those who gave evidence
tothe scrutiny committee that the proposals set outin
the 2004 Bill were unethical and unworkable. While the Government have
made a brave attempt to rework the original proposals, I am a long way
from being convinced that they have taken on board the conclusion of
the scrutiny committee
that,</p><ul><a name="06112899000078"></a>&#147;the primary

services and safeguards for patients and to reduce the stigma of mental
disorder&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06112899000049"></a>We all know
that services for people with mental disorders are patchy and
inadequate. Much of the need for compulsion, on which the Bill focuses,
could be eliminated if a variety of adequate treatmentwas
available at an early enough point to avoid deterioration and
breakdown. As the Bill proceeds through your Lordships' House and
another place, I hope we shall concentrate on making enough changes to
it so that we can be sure&#151;or, at least, more sure than we are
now&#151;that it will bring this
about.</p><h5><a name="06112899000082"></a>6.51

all those who work daily serving others in providing mental health
services, including voluntary organisations, campaigning organisations,
carers and all those who dedicate themselves to this very difficult
area of care provision for some of the most vulnerable people in our
society.</p><p><a name="06112899000052"></a>I congratulate the
Government on maintaining their priority of improving mental health
services. It is a priority, and the intention is to achieve those
improvements through the Bill. But will that happen? From what we have
heard so far, unless substantial amendments are made to the Bill, that
is unlikely to be the case.</p><p><a name="06112899000053"></a>I am most concerned
about the prospects for those groups of patients who have to date
experienced substantial adverse discriminatory treatment. The Mental
Health Act 1983 has been disastrous in its application to some of our
resident African and Caribbean-origin communities. The Bill fails to
address the evidence of institutional racism&#151;it does
exist&#151;and the practice of psychiatry in its detrimental effects
on the black communities. As drafted, the Bill is likely to compromise
and deny their right to the appropriate services when
needed.</p><p><a name="06112899000054"></a>The irrefutable
substantial body of evidence shows that black and ethnic minority
communities are more often diagnosed as schizophrenic. They are more
often compulsorily detained under the Mental Health Act; admitted as
offender patients and held by the police under Section 136 of the Act;
transferred to locked wards from open wards; not referred for
psychotherapy; given high doses of medication; sent to psychiatrists by
the courts; and they more often have unmet
needs.</p><p><a name="06112899000055"></a>Compulsory
powers continue to be arbitrarily invoked against African-Caribbean
people, who mistrust and fear the services on offer. A 2004 report from
the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister called <I>Mental Health and
Social Exclusion</I> acknowledged that black people have higher levels
of dissatisfaction with statutory mental health services and are twice
as likely to disagree with their diagnosis. Such dissatisfaction has
been around for three decades or more, and it is getting
worse.</p><p><a name="06112899000056"></a>Knowing of such
concerns and representations made by the African and Caribbean
organisations and their advocates, it is very disappointing that the
Government should bring forward the Bill in such a deficient manner,
notwithstanding all the contributors who have sought to make it much
more acceptable. It is deficient in a number of ways: it has failed to
conduct a comprehensive race equality impact assessment; it has
excluded black community organisations in meaningful
discussions&#151;for example, there were last-minute communications
involving black church leaders who were previously excluded from
consultations. It is deficient in its compliance with the race
relations legislation as specified by the Commission for Racial
Equality. It is deficient in tackling the realities of the
disproportionate adverse effects on African-Caribbean communities
through culturally insensitive and detrimental mental health
practices.</p>

looking at the race equality impact assessment, with its lack of data
and its speculative analyses that fail to qualify and determine what
adverse potential impact may arise from these measures other than
assertions such as &#147;The Government are of the view that&#148;
and &#147;The effect of such policies will be neutral&#148; without
the necessary back-up, analyses and data to substantiate such
statements.</p><p><a name="06112899000058"></a>Black
and minority ethnic stakeholders, including patients, are deeply
concerned about community treatment orders and the likelihood of even
more detention of black and minority ethnic people. Similar concerns
are held about the competence of tribunals to operate with cultural
sensitivity to achieve equality and fair outcomes for all. The
composition of panels should reflect cultural and ethnic diversity, but
we have little or no information about their composition. Race equality
and diversity training should be a prerequisite for all tribunal
members. It should not merely be tick-box training&#151;it should be
meaningful, with understanding of diverse needs paramount in the course
content. That also applies to the proposal to widen the range of
professionals who will be involved in the provision of mental health
services.</p><p><a name="06112899000059"></a>Furthermore, the black
and minority ethnic stakeholder groups hold the view that people
detained with a mental health condition should have the basic right to
independent advocacy to ensure that they are adequately represented and
that their needs and rights are protected. I fully back what has been
well expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan. It is also critical
that the Bill provides the right to request an assessment, as is the
case in Scotland, so that people with mental illness and carers can
have their needs assessed and responded to before a crisis point
arrives.</p><p><a name="06112899000060"></a>The Bill has the
potential to be&#151;to use the Home Secretary&#146;s favourite
phrase&#151;&#147;fit for purpose&#148;, but only if the
Government are prepared to consult, listen and be responsive to voices
that have been ignored or marginalised to date and which can help
contributeto it achieving meaningful, fair and appropriate
outcomes for all, as intended. As we heard from my noble friends Lord
Patel of Bradford and Lord Adebowale, their contribution in helping to
shape the Bill and in bringing forward amendments offer optimism that
the Bill can emerge from this House acceptable to all sides and to all
providing mental health services and care for the most vulnerable
people in our
society.</p><h5><a name="06112899000083"></a>6.58

spectacularly long gestation; it has been on the horizon for nine
years, which indicates the degree to which it is difficult to legislate
in this area.</p><p><a name="06112899000062"></a>It is important for us
to remember what the objectives of the Bill are. The first is to make
the Mental Health Act 1983 compliant with the European Convention on
Human Rights, which was incorporated into our law by virtue of the
Human Rights Act 1998. The second is to deliver community-based
treatment. The third is to address what I think of as the Cinderella of
personality 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_717"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 717</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>disorder, so as to provide at least some management of this condition.
The Bill also provides for the protection of those who lack capacity
and are compliant in treatment but who are not covered by mental health
legislation. This is an increasingly necessary requirement given that
one of the consequences of an ageing population is the growing
incidence of dementia. Such people are in hospital or in care homes
outside the ambit of the 1983
Act.</p><p><a name="06112899000063"></a>In considering human rights
it is important to remember that there is no hierarchy of rights. One
person&#146;s rights do not take precedence over another&#146;s. It
is important to seek a balancing of rights. In this area in particular,
that balancing exercise is very difficult because, at its most extreme,
it seeks to balance the liberty of some against the security of others.
This first came to my attention in the early stages of the 1992-97
Parliament as a then new Member of the other place. One of my
colleagues on the Labour Benches raised with the then Prime Minister,
John Major, the case of a promising young musician, Jonathan Zito, who
was minding his own business on a station platform when he was stabbed
to death by Christopher Clunis, who had a personality disorder and
could not be detained. Jonathan Zito&#146;s widow, Jayne Zito, set up
a trust in his name to campaign on these issues. That has remained with
me as being the most intractable of problems because such people did
not fall under the Mental Health Act 1983 and did not get treatment.
Replacing treatability as a concept with the new appropriate treatment
test, as envisaged in the Bill, will at last give some attention and
recognition to a considerable social and health
problem.</p><p><a name="06112899000064"></a>This
has been further reinforced for me because, in March of this year, I
accepted an invitation from my noble friend Lady Scotland to conduct a
review of vulnerable women in the criminal justice system. I have spent
the intervening months visiting women&#146;s prisons and talking to
all manner of people who have an interest in or responsibility for
their care. It is extraordinarily shocking how many women in our
prisons are there because of personality disorder. Such women are
assessed and the people caring for them are told, &#147;This person
is not treatable&#148;, so prison staff&#151;who have no training
at all in such conditions&#151;have to try to cope. The levels of
self-harm and self-inflicted death among those women are truly
shocking. While we may talk about revolving-door patients, these are
revolving-door prisoners. Prison staff will say, &#147;She will be
back soon&#148;, because no one has a responsibility to give her any
help.</p><p><a name="06112899000065"></a>Treatment does not
necessarily mean drugs or a chemical cosh, to use a common expression.
It can involve anger management, cognitive therapy, behaviour therapy,
counselling, rehabilitation and independent-living
skills.</p><p><a name="06112899000066"></a>During my review, I met
a woman who is a magistrate on a Bench in the north-east of England
whose daughter was diagnosed with a personality disorder. The woman
believed that its roots were a combination of chronic alcoholism and
the use of non-prescription drugs. She recounted to me in a moving way
the difficulty she had had in getting 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_718"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 718</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>anyone, anywhere, to take any notice of what was wrong with her
daughter. She finally found a counselling service, which spent a
considerable time with the young woman dealing with the addictions that
her mother felt were at the root of her disinhibiting behaviour. Her
daughter is now what her mother calls a normal young woman with a
family.</p><p><a name="06112899000067"></a>I have always rejected
the notion that such people are beyond any kind of treatment. They
might be beyond the kind of conventional treatment that has been
offered until now, but that does not mean to say that nothing can be
done. This treatment has the potential to be of enormous benefit for
people who lead chaotic lives and are consequently in and out of
prison.</p><p><a name="06112899000068"></a>Other noble Lords have
referred to the lobbying of another place on this Bill today. I have
been talking to my right honourable friend Rosie Winterton, the
Minister of State, about her experiences in that lobby and I was struck
by the fact that a woman said to her, &#147;Rosie, I have a
personality disorder. I would love treatment but I cannot get
it&#148;. I welcome the fact that that will be possible under the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06112899000069"></a>As to community-based
treatment, the provisions in the Bill are also designed to cater for
those people who are called revolving-door patients by mental health
professionals. They are detained; on discharge they feel no more need
for prescribed medication; they lose touch with the professionals; they
can become homeless&#151;and they end up being detained. I support
the principle of supervised community treatment, which is the norm in
countries such as New Zealand and
Canada.</p><p><a name="06112899000070"></a>It is important to
emphasise the safeguards. Community-based treatment will not be
suitable for everyone. It must be appropriate to the person&#146;s
needs, and clinicians must be confident that appropriate services are
available.</p><p><a name="06112899000071"></a>I also welcome the
provisions that give patients the right to appeal to the county court
to discharge and replace the person statutorily designated as their
nearest relative. This is because there may have been a breakdown in
the relationship or the nearest relative could even have been a past
abuser of the patient.</p><p><a name="06112899000072"></a>I am
pleased to note that a draft code of practice has been issued with the
Bill and that interested parties have been invited to make suggestions
as to ways in which the code could be strengthened and
improved.</p><p><a name="06112899000073"></a>One gap that I have
identified in the Bill relates to the provision for children and young
people, for whom mental illness is a growing phenomenon. No doubt these
matters can be debated in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06112899000074"></a>Finally, as a Second
Reading debate is about principle rather than detail, I laud the
principles behind the Bill and its attempt to balance public safety
with private treatment and
care.</p><h5><a name="061128106000031"></a>7.07

nearly 80 mental health service user groups, professional organisations
and campaigning charities established specifically to press for better
legislation for the care of the mentally ill. We are at one in saying
that this is a stigmatising, illiberal and yet curiously timid Bill. It
is a little like a dying wasp which still has a sting in
it.</p><p><a name="061128106000002"></a>I was a
co-author of the 1983 Act code of practice and for seven years
vice-chairman of the Mental Health Act Commission. As a community
psychiatrist I have sectioned dozens of people, so I know only too well
the failings of the 1983 Act and the inadequacies of these proposed
amendments. I have heard it said repeatedly&#151;I think the Minister
said it again today&#151;that this Bill is about a small number,
15,000 or so, of people detained at any one time in hospitals. But
there were nearly 47,000 uses of compulsory powers last year, which is
no small number. In fact, it is more than the annual number of hip
replacements in England Wales, which puts it in perspective. We are
talking about a large number of uses of compulsory
powers.</p><p><a name="061128106000003"></a>Every person
experiencing the terror and distress of mental disorder knows about
these powers, the repressive culture that lies behind them and the
stigmatising attitude towards those who most need our help and support.
I can scarcely believe that a Government who brought forward the
excellent and brave Mental Capacity Act has stuck us with a second-rate
piece of work. It leaves in the wider definition of those who will be
subject to compulsion. </p><p><a name="061128106000004"></a>I think
sometimes that if I had my pink forms with me, I could make some
recommendations in the House. As I see noble Lords nodding off, their
lowered consciousness might fit the bill for mental disorder within the
meaning of this Bill&#151;so watch it because I have just discovered
that the noble Lord, Lord Patel, is an approved social
worker.</p><p><a name="061128106000005"></a>The Bill adds community
treatment orders without many safeguards, but then abandons the
safeguards that were proposed in the draft Bill, such as automatic
appeals and the right to advocacy. The Bournewood safeguards are an
improvement on what we have at the moment, but nothing like the
safeguards that would be available under the Mental Health Act to
people with dementia and learning disabilities in care who are
resisting treatment. That is simply prejudicial and stigmatising to
them. Is this really the best we can do after eight years of
trying?</p><p><a name="061128106000006"></a>There will be time in
Committee to explore the detail of the Bill&#146;s provisions, so
today I shall focus on three matters: public safety; the continuing
stigma of treating mentally ill people differently from people with
other illnesses; and non-therapeutic detention.</p><p><a name="061128106000007"></a>By &#147;public safety&#148; I
specifically refer to homicide by people with mental disorder. I agree
with the Government that this is of serious and legitimate concern.
While the numbers are small&#151;as we have heard, they are tiny
compared with the number of homicides associated with alcohol abuse and
domestic strife&#151;I will not deny their importance, not least
because of the catastrophic impact of such homicides in creating a
false public perception of what mental illness is.</p>



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_720"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 720</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061128106000008"></a>The question is whether the proposals in
the Bill are likely to have the desired effect, or quite the opposite.
I have sat on three homicide inquiries and have read most of the other
reports this past 15 years. My conclusions are similar to those of the
Law Society and many others who have looked closely at the
recommendations of those reports: the law is not the culprit. Time and
again it is the poor co-ordination of services, the lack of follow-up,
failure to listen to relatives and other statutory services, failure to
use the existing legal provisions wisely and the lack of appropriate
service resources and personnel. I remind the noble Baroness, Lady
Corston, that the Christopher Clunis inquiry report said exactly
that.</p><p><a name="061128106000009"></a>Professor Nigel Eastman,
the forensic psychiatrist and lawyer from St George&#146;s,
University of London, pointed out to the scrutiny committee the
marginal contribution that law makes to public protection. It is all
about services, he said, and the way they work. As he explained,
psychiatrists know that,</p><ul><a name="061128106000030"></a>&#147;It is not that you can predict
if somebody is going to kill somebody; it is that you intervene for
their mental health care, and one out of goodness knows how many would
have gone on to kill, but you have intervened.&#148;.</ul><a name="061128106000029"></a>It has been estimated that you would
have to lock up about 5,000 people in order to prevent one homicide,
and I suggest we are never going to do that. It is pointless to prevent
one homicide by repressive measures if the aggregate effect is to
increase the risk of homicides and violence in the community in
general. The majority of those needing help will still be failed when
beds, crisis units, day centres, community and therapy services are
inadequate to supervise these community treatment orders and to get
people into the services they need. We need care and compassion, not
more coercion.<p><a name="061128106000010"></a>The Bill will
frighten away from services potentially violent patients, as others
have said and as was said repeatedly to the scrutiny committee. Early
intervention services, assertive outreach and crisis resolution teams
were all designed in urban inner city services who knew they were not
able to reach the young folks on the streets. Young people in Lambeth,
Hackney and Haringey already have a notion that if you admit to your
frightening experiences, you will be banged up in a terrifying
psychiatric ward and filled up against your will with drugs that make
you drool and get fat. Do we think that word on the streets about a
supervised community treatment order that you can be put on at the drop
of a hat, with no obvious way of getting off it, will encourage people
to come to services? I do not think so.</p><p><a name="061128106000011"></a>This is likely to be ineffective law,
because it will not deliver what the Government want. Safety lies in
readily accessible and welcoming services, and I would include in that
the right to ask for an assessment and get one from the family;
professionals knowing what goes on in patients&#146; heads; and
patients trusting professionals with information; and then getting the
necessary supports in place. Yes, sometimes we need to use coercion and
restraint, but we will know that services are improving when the number
of sections goes down, not up.</p>



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_721"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 721</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061128106000012"></a>My second point is about the failure to
base mental health law on the same principles as medicine in general.
Why is it that the Scots can produce an Act based on the principle of
lack of decision-making capacity, as recommended by Professor Genevra
Richardson&#146;s report to the Government seven years ago, while we
have here a Bill still based on the principle that if someone has
mental symptoms, even when they are capable of making fully autonomous
decisions, they may become subject to compulsion? If we had a
capacity-based Act, it would probably not lead to a very different
group of people being sectioned, although I believe it would protect
some at the margins who are now the subject of what I call the
overenthusiastic psychiatrist. It would, however, have a dramatic
effect on the confidence of mentally ill service users to know that
their care and treatment would be subject to the same principles as
someone with a physical health problem. &#147;Capacity&#148; does
not refer to intellectual cognitive capacity only; it means the ability
to make decisions uninfluenced by abnormal thoughts and emotions too. A
capacity-based Act would stop dead the endless arguments about the
types of mental disorder that ought or ought not to be subject to the
Act.</p><p><a name="061128106000013"></a>My third point is about
ensuring that, asDr Zigmond from the Royal College of
Psychiatrists said in his evidence to the scrutiny committee, mental
health services do not become solely part of either the criminal
justice system or an anti-social order system. They must be part of the
health service. The new Bill apparently turns away from the notion in
the former draft Bill of locking people up in mental hospitals even
when they are untreatable, and of making doctors and nurses do the
state&#146;s business of keeping challenging people out of
harm&#146;s way even before they have committed a crime. That has
been changed. Now a clause has been inserted to say that there must be
appropriate treatment, but I and many others here will want to explore
in Committee exactly what that means. It is by no means clear to me
from the statements in the draft code of practice that the Government
have accepted that clinical services are there to do clinical work, not
to provide non-therapeutic detention.</p><p><a name="061128106000014"></a>This is so disappointing. We want a
Mental Health Act that ensures all treatment provided under compulsion
gives a health benefit to the patient; limits community treatment
orders to a very small number of revolving-door people and does not
impose unnecessary conditions on them; gives everyone sectioned under
the Act an advocate and the right to choose who speaks up for them; and
gives patients and carers the right to an assessment when they ask for
it before the crisis point is reached. I do not think the Bill, as it
stands, will do the job.</p><h5><a name="061128106000032"></a>7.17

the only speaker, I will succinctly say a number of different things
about the Bill. I crave your Lordships&#146; indulgence if I go over
time slightly.</p><p><a name="061128106000016"></a>Noble Lords who have
been reading newspaper articles&#151;for example, last week in the
<I>Times</I>&#151;could be forgiven for thinking the debate on this
Bill is between those who place the importance of patient rights above
concerns for victims of crime and a Government who, almost alone, have
understood that the way to identify those very few people with mental
illness who might present a danger to themselves and others at any time
is to subject many thousands of people who present no danger to
detention and restrictions without safeguards. Such an impression is
understandable, but wrong.</p><p><a name="061128106000017"></a>Those who were severely critical of the
2004 draft Bill and of this Bill&#151;and I am one&#151;have always
accepted the need to incorporate effective risk management and public
protection into mental health policy and into any new mental health
Act. However, we find ourselves in agreement with a wide range of
knowledgeable organisations, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists to
the Royal College of General Practitioners, that the extension of
legislative power to subject people who are ill to compulsory treatment
that may not have any therapeutic benefit for them, without rights to
assessment and review, may not lead to greater public protection. Quite
the reverse.</p><p><a name="061128106000018"></a>The Government
chose to ignore the majority of the joint scrutiny committee&#146;s
proposals&#151;a body which included a former Home Secretary, three
current medical practitioners, several government Back-Benchers and an
opposition spokes person, and achieved unanimity. The Government have
removed from the Bill any mention of people with dangerous or severe
personality disorder but have retained measures that might be
appropriate to that very small percentage of people with serious mental
health problems, and will apply them extensively. They have ignored the
committee&#146;s recommendation that there should be a separate Bill
dealing with people who are dangerous and present a clear risk to
themselves and others, which should contain a far higher standard of
risk assessment before a person is subject to detention. The Government
could have chosen to deal with the 50 per cent of prisoners who have
serious mental health problems and who prison staff frequently tell us
are in prison simply because there is a serious lack of secure to
medium mental healthcare beds for them, but they have not done
so.</p>

<p><a name="061128106000019"></a>Before
turning to the detail of the Bill, I suggest that there are three
overarching criteria upon which noble Lords should judge it. Would the
enactment of these proposals add significantly to the effectiveness of
current mental health practice as it is under the 1983 Act, both in
therapeutic benefit for patients and increased public safety?
Conversely, would it significantly harm the effectiveness of current
practice under the 1983 Act? I ask noble Lords to judge the Bill that
we 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_723"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 723</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have, not the Bill that we want. Many of today&#146;s speeches were
about the Bill that we want but do not have. It was interesting to note
that noble Lords started their speeches saying that they were
supportive of the Bill but went on to describe it variously as deeply
depressing, deficient, fundamentally flawed, or in the words of the
noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, that well known critic of the
Government, as a Bill that satisfies no
one.</p><p><a name="061128106000020"></a>I ask
noble Lords to consider three points. First, the view of my noble
friend Lord Carlile, which he would have given today but will do so at
later stages, that, given the definition of disorder in the Bill, the
proposal for appropriate treatment is intellectually dishonest. What it
amounts to is not appropriate medical treatment but only habitation
defined by a medical practitioner. Most people who will be subjected to
appropriate treatment by compulsion under the Bill would receive
treatment voluntarily under existing legislation. However, the crucial
difference is that the Bill is wholly unclear about how such a patient
would cease to be subject to detention, which is not mental health
treatment.</p><p><a name="061128106000021"></a>Secondly, on
supervised community treatment orders, if these powers are to be used
for a small minority of so-called revolving door patients, why is it
possible to subject a person to a CTO indefinitely after only one
episode of hospitalisation, which may have lasted for just 24 hours?
The Government have not produced evidence from countries where CTOs are
in operation on their effectiveness, or evidence from different
countries on what does or does not work. The Government ignored the
recommendations of the joint scrutiny committee on the level of
safeguards such measures would need by not requiring the determination
to impose a CTO to go before a mental health review tribunal. Nor is
there any requirement on the responsible clinician to discuss the
making of a CTO with a patient, or to explain the conditions to which
the person will be subject, or the consequences of breaking them. A
nearest relative, the person most likely to be involved in the life of
a patient on an ongoing basis, and therefore often the person most at
risk, has no power to object to the making of a CTO. The clinician or
associated mental health professional who will be responsible for a
person in the community need not be consulted about the conditions of
the CTO. If a patient is recalled within one month of a CTO being made
or three months of treatment being given, Section 58 treatment can be
given without consent. The person thereby has fewer rights than a
person detained in hospital, allowing mental health treatment to be
given when it is neither necessary nor
proportionate.</p><p><a name="061128106000022"></a>Thirdly,
those who believe, as the Government say, that this will affect a small
minority of people should look at the Bill&#146;s regulatory impact
assessment. The majority of the &#163;22 million assigned for
implementation will be spent on CTOs. I suggest that the majority of
CTOs will involve the administration of chemical treatments in the
community. Nothing in the Bill will stop rogue practitioners making
that their preferred method of treatment and using it
inappropriately.</p>

serious flaws. It is difficult to know where to concentrate. I make two
points which indicate the problem. Even the good bits of the Bill
contain serious flaws. Noble Lords have spoken at length about the
Bournewood provisions, which are inadequate as they rely on care home
owners to trigger an assessment and give relatives no rights to request
action. Noble Lords have said that there will be no aftercare for
people subject to Bournewood. It is not clear in the Bill whether a
person who is detained under Bournewood will have to pay for their
detention. It seems that the Government may have the power to detain
people and make them pay for their care. That is
astonishing.</p><p><a name="061128106000024"></a>Noble
Lords have spoken of the missed opportunities for young
people&#146;s, children&#146;s and adolescents&#146; mental
health services and of the disproportionate effect of mental health
legislation on people from black and minority ethnic communities. I
suggest that whatever deficiencies there are in current practice will
be aggravated. The regulatory impact assessment accompanying the Bill
refers to &#163;22 million. If the tribunal safeguards were to be
implemented, it would cost vastly more than
that.</p><p><a name="061128106000025"></a>When
parliamentarians discuss social and healthcare policy it is important
that we bear in mind those people whom our comments will affect. I take
the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, that the Bill
will do nothing to help carers, who suffer greatly through lack of
mental health services. Some 25 per cent of mental health users have
reported asking for help but it not being
available.</p><p><a name="061128106000026"></a>Frankly,
the Minister&#146;s opening speech could have been an introduction to
an entirely different Bill. He mentioned balancing. The 1983 Act is a
balance between powers to control and treat people and independent
review and representation. The Bill upsets that balance completely. It
gives to psychiatrists powers that they have not asked for and which
many of them think will not work and will, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Murphy, put so well, risk making those patients who may be the most
dangerous run from mental health services. The work that has been done
to contain many people and enable them to live normal lives will be
lost.</p><p><a name="061128106000027"></a>We cannot compel the
Government to listen. I hope that they will have a serious rethink. I
disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Ouseley; the Bill is unfit for
purpose. We have a very big job ahead of us to make it fit for purpose.
I listened very carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Warner. He welcomed
changes to the code of practice but not to the Bill. People have drawn
parallels with the Mental Capacity Act, an Act that came with a draft
code of practice but had at its centre principles and clear definitions
of when powers would be used. That is in stark contrast to the
legislation in front of
us.</p><p><a name="061128106000028"></a>This is a
clunking fist of a Bill; this is not modernising. This is about
returning people to detention, which is not therapeutic and is not
treatment. It is about turning things back several decades in mental
health legislation. For those reasons, it will not achieve even the
very limited aims that the Government have given to it. I do not
believe that it will make things safer, not for patients and not for
the general public. The noble

deserves the fullest and toughest scrutiny at all stages of its
passage&#151;if it ever does pass through Parliament. In this House,
we have the expertise to put before the Government the reasons why the
legislation is deficient and to make it better. I hope that the
Government will now start to
listen.</p><h5><a name="061128102000029"></a>7.30

Howe:</b> My Lords, as is fitting for a Bill of such
importance, this has been a debate of particularly high quality. I
begin by thanking the Minister for his lucid explanation of the
Government&#146;s policies as reflected in the Bill, and for the very
measured tone that he struck when doing so. As a preface to the
contributions that followed, it was extremely helpful.</p><p><a name="061128102000002"></a>I do not think there can now be any of
your Lordships who is not conscious of the deep concerns aroused by the
issues with which we are dealing. Those concerns come from differing
viewpoints and reflect not only the inadequacies of the present law but
the real fear that, through this Bill, Parliament might legislate in a
way that did more harm than good. That is why it is important for us,
as we debate the Bill, to remain focused on what must surely be the
objective, which is to deliver at the end of the parliamentary process
legislation that is balanced, humane, concise, workable and which will
command widespread acceptance over the long
term.</p><p><a name="061128102000003"></a>Last week, I was rather
critical of the Government for having taken so long to bring a new
Mental Health Bill before Parliament. The road, as we all know, has
been long and somewhat rocky. There is one point that I do not seek to
argue; the Government can be credited with recognising that there is a
problem with the current Mental Health Act. As the Minister outlined,
the problem is that it reflects attitudes and practices that are out of
date and out of keeping with modern mental health service delivery. One
of the tests of the Bill, therefore, will be the extent to which it
corrects those shortcomings.</p><p><a name="061128102000004"></a>I
also agree with the Minister that there is an issue to be addressed
about dangerous mentally disordered people and whether and in what way
there may be scope to improve the legal framework so that those
individuals with an untreatable personality disorder who are dangerous,
either to themselves or to others, can be looked after more
effectively. No one should forget&#151;we have been reminded by many
speakers&#151;the horror and grief which resulted from the case of
Christopher Clunis, the schizophrenic who murdered Jonathan Zito in
1992; or the equally distressing case of Michael Stone, who murdered
Lin and Megan Russell in 1996. It is right to ask what lessons lie in
those tragic cases and whether more could be done to prevent similar
tragedies occurring in the future.</p><p><a name="061128102000005"></a>The Government believe that this Bill
provides part of the answer. Like the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and the
noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, I am not at all convinced that the acts of
violence committed by Clunis and Stone can be laid at the door of the
Mental Health Act 1983. Therefore, to the extent that this Bill is
designed as a means of preventing such 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_726"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 726</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>incidents happening in the future, I shall argue that it holds out less
promise than the Minister hopes. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Barker,
I believe we should be looking at other
routes.</p><p><a name="061128102000006"></a>Nevertheless, it is
right that in our debates we should confront head-on the problems posed
by dangerous people with severe personality disorders and consider ways
in which those individuals might best be treated and dealt with. I say
to the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, in particular, that we should
not labour under any illusion. The Government have consistently stated
in terms that in their view mental health legislation is not about
improving services. According to them, it is about public safety
and,</p><ul><a name="061128102000024"></a>&#147;the legal
processes for bringing people under
compulsion&#148;.</ul><a name="061128102000020"></a>I am
personally very sorry that they should have chosen to make a statement
of that kind so starkly and without qualification. As many noble Lords
have pointed out, mental health legislation provides a perfectly
legitimate opportunity to ensure that services are delivered in a way
that reflects both sound principles and best practice.
<p><a name="061128102000007"></a>I have no doubt that in Committee we
shall debate a number of aspects of best practice, not least the issue
of advocacy. But, aside from
that,</p><ul><a name="061128102000025"></a>&#147;the legal
processes for bringing people under
compulsion&#148;,</ul><a name="061128102000021"></a>can
never depend on just adhering to a set of mechanistic rules. They need
to be underpinned by ethical codes of practice and by legal safeguards
that respect the rights, dignity and autonomy of patients. It is not
only what you do, but how you do it. Compulsion is a tool to be used
very sparingly. Where it is used, it is as a means not only of
protecting the public but of protecting patients from harming
themselves. In both contexts, but in the latter particularly, it is an
instrument of service delivery. It is therefore right that the Bill and
its ensuing regulations should enshrine in the rules of compulsion
those things that will ensure that best practice is fostered, as
opposed to being put at
risk.<p><a name="061128102000008"></a>There is a wider point,
which was well emphasised by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy.
Compulsion, whenever and wherever it is used, is never bland. It is
always, but always, traumatic, demeaning and stigmatising. This is a
Bill which, when enacted, will govern the behaviour and practice of
clinicians for the indefinite future. If we get the balance wrong
between public safety and patient rights; if the Bill unduly widens the
scope for individuals to be treated against their will; if it is seen
to facilitate practice that traumatises, demeans and adds to stigma, it
will be self-defeating. The one thing that we cannot afford is a
generalised fear of the system. If people who are mentally ill are
afraid of the system and of what it might do to them, that fear will
deter them from seeking help when they need it. Good mental health
services create a climate in which people with a mental illness want to
come to a doctor and tell him what is in their heads.</p><p><a name="061128102000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, quoted Dr
Tony Zigmond of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Those words bear
reading in <I>Hansard</I>. The simple truth of 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_727"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 727</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what Dr Zigmond said tells us how delicate the balance is that the Bill
needs to strike. He
said,</p><ul><a name="061128102000026"></a>&#147;we need to get
people to come and see
us&#148;.</ul><a name="061128102000010"></a>The Clunises
and Stones of this world must not be deterred from seeking help; but
nor must you, or I, or anyone else, if we should ever find ourselves
weighed down by mental
distress.<p><a name="061128102000011"></a>In preparing for
this debate, I have been struck by the disparity between some of the
things that the Government say they want to achieve and what is
actually in the Bill. In their response to the Joint Committee on the
draft Bill of 2004, the Government said that they wanted
to,</p><ul><a name="061128102000027"></a>&#147;reduce the need
for
compulsion&#148;.</ul><a name="061128102000022"></a>What
they certainly do not mean by that, judging by this Bill, is that the
law should make compulsion more difficult to achieve. If at one and the
same timeyou broaden the definition of &#147;mental
disorder&#148; to encompass potentially more people, and give
&#147;treatment&#148; a new meaning, so that treating a patient
does not have to involve doing him any good, as night follows day you
are bound to ensure that the scope for administering compulsory
treatment is made greater, not less.
<p><a name="061128102000012"></a>The Bill includes no indication of the
circumstances in which preventive detention might be considered
appropriate, nothing about detention being necessary in all the
circumstances, nothing about the severity of illness or patient need,
and nothing about alternative measures being insufficient or
inadequate. So while the Government may profess that compulsion might
be necessary for only a small minority of people, the Bill as drafted
does not seem to chime in with that policy
intent.</p><p><a name="061128102000013"></a>The Government have
also stated that,</p><ul><a name="061128102000028"></a>&#147;it would be inappropriate to
use the Mental Health Bill to detain (or otherwise apply compulsion to)
people who are not in need of specialist mental health
care&#148;.</ul><a name="061128102000023"></a>What they
certainly do not mean by that, judging by this Bill, is that doctors
should never be put in the position of having to act unethically.
Doctors most surely will be put in that position if the test of
therapeutic benefit is abandoned in relation to clinical care and
treatment. It amounts to abandoning the rule of &#147;first do no
harm&#148;. <p><a name="061128102000014"></a>The other
dimension is that of human rights. The main criticism of the phrase
&#147;appropriate treatment&#148; that we have heard this afternoon
is that it is imprecise&#151;in my judgment deliberately
so&#151;and therefore can be taken to mean almost anything.
&#147;Appropriate&#148; is a classic weasel word. If there is one
thing that human rights law requires in rules that govern the use of
coercion, it is that those rules should provide certainty. If they do
not do that, the way that the rules are exercised is bound to be
arbitrary to some extent, and you need only one piece of case law for
&#147;appropriate&#148; to be applied in a manner that becomes
increasingly authoritarian. In my opinion, the best way for the
Government to begin addressing some of the criticisms levelled at them
in this debate is to look again at that weaselly phrase, which has
aroused suspicion and mistrust.</p>



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_728"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 728</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061128102000015"></a>Our efforts in Committee will be directed
at many areas of the Bill, some of them very important, that I do not
have time to refer to today. But one area mentioned by almost all noble
Lords was supervised community treatment. I do not object to the idea
of CTOs as such, though the evidence for their effectiveness is still
pretty thin on the ground. I accept that for some people a CTO may
prove right and helpful. What I find disquieting about the proposals as
they stand is the potential for them to be used on a large number of
people. The stated aim of CTOs is that they should apply to so-called
revolving-door patients, but as the Bill stands, the door does not need
to revolve at all for a CTO to be imposed.</p><p><a name="061128102000016"></a>The power to apply a CTO to a person is
broader in this Bill than in the 2004 draft Bill. It is true and very
welcome that the power would be applicable only to those patients who
had previously been subject to detention and treatment in hospital. But
in practice it will not take much for a CTO to be approved. In the
current culture of blame in the health service and with scarce
resources for delivering good aftercare in the community, the clinician
will look on a CTO as the safe option; a CTO protects his back. There
is, in my judgment, a real risk that CTOs will become a substitute for
the lack of available services in the
community.</p><p><a name="061128102000017"></a>I am also worried
about the lack of sufficient checks and balances. The clinician
responsible for imposing a CTO does not have to refer to
anybody&#151;not the patient, not the nearest relative, not the
carer, not the patient&#146;s GP. Once the CTO is in place, the
responsible clinician has total control over the conditions that are
applied to it. Not even the mental health review tribunal can alter
them, and the Bill provides for no independent scrutiny of the
waythat these powers of compulsion are to be used. That lack
of checks and balances causes me considerable
worry.</p><p><a name="061128102000018"></a>Not only does the Bill
risk bringing more people into the system, it will also keep them in
the system for longer, as we have heard. There are no maximum time
limits for treatment under a CTO. If the clinician wants to renew a
CTO, he can do so on the same broad grounds as he used before. Again,
one can well envisage clinicians playing safe and opting for renewal.
The analogy of the lobster pot has been used to describe the difficulty
that CTOs represent to the patient: easy to get into, but extremely
hard to get out of. It is not surprising that many people view this
Bill as a charter for keeping people under compulsion for a very long
time. I repeat: the more we see that happening and the more people we
see being made subject to compulsion, the more we will see the trust
between doctor and patient eroding and the more likely it will be that
the Michael Stones of this world will be too afraid to come forward to
recount the dreadful things that are in their
heads.</p><p><a name="061128102000019"></a>That
is why the balance to be struck in the Bill is more complex than simply
rights on the one hand and safety on the other. The rights and the
safety are mutually dependent. The success or failure of the Bill will
be judged on the way that it protects not only 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_729"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 729</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>patient rights but the values of modern-day clinical practice, not least
patient dignity and patient autonomy; because unless the Bill does
those things, it will serve to protect neither patients nor the public.
As parliamentarians, we owe it to some of the most vulnerable
individuals in our society to make this a Bill from which those values
shine
out.</p><h5><a name="061128107000039"></a>7.46

Warner:</b> My Lords, this has been a passionate and
interesting debate on a complex and important issue. I pay tribute to
all those who work in mental health services and share the views of
other noble Lords who have spoken this afternoon about the importance
of producing a workable piece of legislation for those people. From
this debate, I certainly have a clear idea of where people stand on
these issues. After listening to the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, I
shall be sitting up straight with my eyes alert in case she and the
noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford, come calling with their pink
forms.</p><p><a name="061128107000003"></a>I am grateful to the
noble Earl, Lord Howe, for the calm and analytical approach that he
adopted. I agree with him that we need to test the arguments and
evidence, and we need to look carefully at these issues. Now is not the
right time to try to respond in detail to many of the points made, but
I should like to offer a few reflections on some of the key issues that
have been raised throughout this
debate.</p><p><a name="061128107000004"></a>First, I want to
reassure the House that advocacy has not been dropped. Indeed, there
are many areas where advocacy services are already available. In our
view, we need to learn from those and build on that experience. We do
not need legislation to do thatand it is our policy intention
to give patientsaccess to advocacy on a non-statutory basis.
We do envisage developments continuing to take place in this
area.</p><p><a name="061128107000005"></a>Secondly, the issue of
principles on the face of the Bill has been raised by a number of noble
Lords. I remind the House that the Bill makes a series of amendments to
the 1983 Act. It is not a total rewrite of mental health legislation
with a new and different structure. That approach of amending the 1983
Act was a way forward that many people supported. We have re-written
the code of practice accordingly and that contains a number of new
guiding principles that are different from the old code. I refer to
page 8 where noble Lords can see that there are 10 key principles. I
shall refer to one&#151;the transparency principle&#151;which
states
that,</p><ul><a name="061128107000038"></a>&#147;decisions by
professionals and statutory bodies should be made in a transparent
way&#148;.</ul><a name="061128107000037"></a>There is
another principle on participation, another on the assessment of risk
principle, and so on. <p><a name="061128107000006"></a>I
commend to noble Lords a study of the code, which has a statutory
basis&#151;Section 118 of the 1983 Act. Clinicians are required to
operate in accordance with the principles of the code unless there are
cogent reasons not to do so. Courts would have regard to adherence to
the principles in individual cases. That draft code is in the Vote
Office and copies have been placed in the
Library.</p>



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_730"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 730</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061128107000007"></a>It will be easier to keep those
principles up to date in a code rather than primary legislation. A
number of noble Lords have drawn attention to the fact that it is now
23 years since the last amendment of the legislation. That point is
worth considering in this context. A number of noble Lords have raised
the issue of a therapeutic benefit test. The likelihood of patients
benefiting from treatment is clearly a factor in deciding whether
appropriate treatment is available. However, it is worth reflecting
that a therapeutic benefit test is like the so-called treatability
test, which has fallen into disrepute in that it focuses on one
factor&#151;the likely outcome of the treatment.</p><p><a name="061128107000008"></a>We do not think that it is sensible to
require decision-makers to demonstrate in advance that treatment is
likely to have a particular effect. I suggest that that might mean
inaction. An appropriate treatment test allows clinicians to make a
holistic assessment and decide whether they have something clinically
appropriate to offer in the same way that their fellow clinicians would
be adopting for patients in other areas of medicine.</p><p><a name="061128107000009"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Manchester discussed having in the Bill a clinically defined group of
patients to which supervised community treatment should apply. However,
we have defined the criteria and those groups of patients. Since the
2004 draft Bill we have, as I said earlier, restricted supervised
community treatment to patients who are already detained and treated in
hospital. Restricting it further is likely to limit its benefit and
effectiveness. In most areas of medicine we leave a degree of
discretion to clinicians to make judgments on the basis of the evidence
presented in particular circumstances.</p><p><a name="061128107000010"></a>We have also provided in this area for
criteria in the code of practice, and there are criteria in the Bill. A
number of noble Lords have talked about the numbers affected. The
information I have, which underpins the regulatory impact assessment,
is that should the legislation be passed in its present form the
expected number of people with a CTO would rise to the order of 3,000
to 4,000 per year over a five-year period. Those are the kinds of
numbers that we have provided for in the regulatory impact
assessment.</p><p><a name="061128107000011"></a>I shall respond to
some of the concerns expressed by a number of speakers about the Bill
not dealing with certain service areas. I gently suggest that it is a
mistaken belief that it is necessary to prescribe those requirements in
primary legislation. As a number of noble Lords have said, it is more
critical that we expand the resources and range of services, a point
made eloquently by my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley. As I explained
earlier, we have done just that in terms of money, the professionals
involved in mental health services&#151;a good example of that is the
3,000 extra clinical psychologists who have been put in
place&#151;and the range of community services that are now
available. For example, there are now 700 new multidisciplinary teams
working in mental health in the community. That is a sizeable increase
of the resources available to provide community services, which were

nurses, and over 50 per cent more psychiatric consultants in place now
than we had when we came to office. As several noble Lords have
recognised, this is showing through in improved services. I think that
we are entitled not just to take credit for that but to say that we
should be trusted with the expansion and development of the services.
We have delivered in this area&#151;we have much stronger services.
That is illustrated, for example, by the fact&#151;as a number of
noble Lords said&#151;that we have the lowest recorded level of
suicide and one of the lowest levels in Europe. Given our investment in
this area, we can take it as given that we will safeguard our mental
health services and the extra investment that we have put in
place.</p><p><a name="061128107000013"></a>We will clearly need to
discuss supervised community treatment further in Committee. I am
grateful for the support that some noble Lords offered on that issue. I
re-emphasise that in the Government&#146;s view that is a key aspect
of the Bill, with which we need to persist. It has the capacity to
reduce the detention of people as in-patients and the time that they
spend as in-patients. It is worth dwelling on that; I occasionally
thought during our debate that that point was not recognised enough. By
any stretch of the imagination it represents the prospect, if I may say
so, of an improvement in civil liberties, not the reverse. By all means
let us see if we can improve the legislation&#146;s wording but let
us not delude ourselves that we do not need it or assume that
clinicians will not use it for the benefit of patients. It is too easy
to slip into that mode of
thinking.</p><p><a name="061128107000014"></a>A number of noble
Lords raised the issue of children and young people. No one is keener
than me to ensure that that group is properly looked after and have
access to the range of services. I acknowledge that sometimes our child
and adolescent mental health services have not delivered for many of
our young people. It is an area that we need to keep a very careful eye
on. However, it is important, when considering legislation, that we
remember that the Children Act is designed to safeguard children and
that in some cases it is more appropriate to use Section 25 of that Act
than the Mental Health Act. It is also worth remembering that a
Gillick-competent child of whatever age should not have their decision
to accept or refuse treatment overridden by parental consent. All 16
and 17 year-olds are considered to be competent to offer their views on
treatment if they have the capacity. The draft code of practice, which
I mentioned earlier, has a section on the treatment of children and
young people and that code has a statutory basis. They have not been
overlooked.</p><p><a name="061128107000015"></a>I recognise that a
number of noble Lords are not satisfied with our approach and that
people outside this House share that view. I cannot respond to all
those concerns now but I know that we will explore them in more detail
in Committee. I recognise the deep and worrying concerns about the
overrepresentation of black and minority ethnic groups in our detained
mental health services. I pay tribute to the work of the noble Lords,
Lord Patel of Bradford, Lord Adebowale and Lord Ouseley, and I share
the enthusiasm, expressed

am sure that they will do so during the later stages of this
Bill.</p><p><a name="061128107000016"></a>My noble friend Lady
Ashton will join me during the Bill&#146;s later stages on the
Bournewood safeguard issues, which a number of noble Lords raised. I
propose to leave those issues to later debate, but I assure the House
that my noble friend has responded positively to the helpful request
from the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, for a meeting to discuss those
issues as soon as that can be arranged.</p><p><a name="061128107000017"></a>In conclusion, I make it clear that we
are very much in listening and negotiating mode, and we will continue
in that vein with the various interests that have concerns about the
Bill. I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that what I am saying
applies to the Bill as well as to the code. Our listening mode will not
distinguish between those two documents.</p><p><a name="061128107000018"></a>However, it is essential that we
modernise the 1983 Act and I am grateful to noble Lords who have
recognised that. We have to do that particularly, as the noble Earl,
Lord Howe, rightly said, to reflect the expansion of community services
and the range of mental health professionals working in this area. We
must deal with the definitional problems that arise from the 1983 Act,
and we need to improve patient safeguards, such as those relating to
the nearest relative. So there is much work to do. We need to adopt
that constructive approach&#151;it will certainly be the approach
adopted by the Government&#151;and produce a workmanlike Bill that
can go to the other place. I ask the House to give the Bill a Second
Reading.</p><p><a name="061128107000019"></a>On Question, Bill read

Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee, Session
2005-06.</I></p><p><a name="061128107000021"></a>The noble Lord
said: My Lords, three separate matters are covered by this order. The
first enables the National Assembly Government for Wales to make
regulations for the content and conduct of the census in Wales. The
second concerns Section 156 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990,
transferring the power to make regulations in relation to waste on
land. The third amends the basis on which the National Assembly for
Wales makes regulations prescribing conditions in relation to water
fittings under the Water Industry Act 1991. The Wales Office has
obtained formal agreement with the Treasury, Defra and, of course, the
National Assembly for Wales itself for all the matters contained within
the order.</p><p><a name="061128107000022"></a>The first matter,
concerning the 2011 census of population, would give the Assembly the
right in law to be consulted on the draft census order and the 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_733"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 733</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>power to make the regulations for the census in Wales. Information
arising from each census of population is used by central and local
government to form policy, to plan services for specific groups of
people and to distribute resources effectively. Only a census can
provide information on a uniform basis both about Wales as a whole and
about individual small areas and sub-groups of the population in
relation to one another.</p><p><a name="061128107000023"></a>Your
Lordships will recall that, following the late introduction of a
Scottish tick-box in the 2001 census, there were calls for a Welsh
tick-box on the census form in Wales. The Economic Secretary to the
Treasury and the Registrar General for England and Wales subsequently
agreed that the Assembly should have a more formal role in agreeing
future census forms in
Wales.</p><p><a name="061128107000024"></a>Officials
of the Welsh Assembly Government, the Office for National Statistics
and the Wales Office, including legal advisers, have identified an
option that gives the Assembly a greater role within the constraints of
current legislation. The function, under Section 1 of the Census Act
1920, of making a census order is exercisable by Her Majesty in
Council. Such functions do not fall within Section 22 of the Government
of Wales Act 1998 and cannot be transferred to the Assembly. However,
under Section 22(1)(c) of the 1998 Act, it is possible to direct that
the function of a Minister of the Crown is to recommend that a census
order be made by Her Majesty in Council.</p><p><a name="061128107000025"></a>The function of making census
regulations,under Section 3 of the Census Act 1920, falls
within Section 22 of the 1998 Act. Therefore, in so far as that
function is exercisable in relation to Wales, it can be transferred to
the Assembly. It would give the Assembly greater influence in the
decisions that the Office for National Statistics takes and give it the
final say on the way that the census is conducted in Wales. Where there
is a sufficiently strong case to do so, different information could be
collected on census forms in
Wales.</p><p><a name="061128107000026"></a>The second matter
transfers Section 156 as it applies to Part 2 of the Environmental
ProtectionAct 1990 and will enable the Assembly to make
regulations in relation to Wales giving effect to Community and other
international obligations in relation to waste on land.</p><p><a name="061128107000027"></a>The devolution settlement gives the
Assembly extensive responsibilities for environmental matters,
including waste management. The National Assembly has powers to give
effect to Community law obligations with respect to waste management
under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. The penalties
which can be imposed by regulations made under the European Communities
Act are lower than those imposable by regulations made under Section
156 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Thus, the main advantage
of Section 156 powers is that they are not subject to the same
limitations as attach to the use of Section 2(2) of the European
Communities Act 1972, particularly in relation to the maximum penalties
that may be imposed.</p>



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_734"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 734</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061128107000028"></a>The
Hazardous Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2005 were made by the
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs partly in
reliance on Section 156. Consequently, the regulations, which amend
provisions relating to penalties in the Environmental Protection Act
1990, were able to include provision on penalties beyond the maximum,
which would not have been permitted had the regulations been made under
Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 alone.</p><p><a name="061128107000029"></a>Because of the need to rely on Section
156 for certain provisions in the Hazardous Waste (England and Wales)
Regulations 2005, those regulations had to be made by the Secretary of
State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to cover England
andWales for the Section 156-related issues and England only
for the Section 2(2) issues. The Assemblymade regulations
covering Wales only for theSection 2(2)-related issues. That
is untidy and confusing for all interested parties. Even where the
Assembly and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs make regulations together, those regulations have to reflect
the different powers held by both parties.</p><p><a name="061128107000030"></a>That situation can be avoided by the
transfer of Section 156 provisions as they apply to Part 2 of the
Environmental Protection Act 1990. Following the transfer, on occasions
where policy/regulations made partly in Wales and partly in England are
reviewed by both Defra and the Assembly Government, the Assembly will
be able to implement any amendment fully in Wales without being reliant
on Defra.</p><p><a name="061128107000031"></a>The third matter
amends the basis upon which the Assembly may make regulations under
Sections 47, 53, 55 and 66A of the Water Industry Act 1991 prescribing
requirements in relation to water fittings, contravention of which will
release a water undertaker from its water supply duties in certain
circumstances. The requirements that can be prescribed by these
regulations are confined to those contained in regulations made
separately under Section 74 of the Water Industry Act 1991.</p><p><a name="061128107000032"></a>An anomaly exists in
the way in which the functions under Section 74 and Sections 47(2)(g),
53(2)(c), 55(4) and 66A(6) have been transferred to the Assembly. The
power to make regulations, under Section 74, has transferred in
relation to water undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in Wales
but not in relation to any licensed water suppliers. However, the
powers, under Sections 47(2)(g), 53(2)(c), 55(4) and 66A(6), have
transferred &#147;in relation to Wales&#148;. Water undertakers are
the principal suppliers of public water and are appointed under Section
6 of the Water IndustryAct 1991. Licensed water suppliers are
a fairly new phenomenon.</p><p><a name="061128107000033"></a>The Water Act 2003
introduced new provisions into the Water Industry Act 1991 permitting
companies that are holders of a water supply licence to have access to
water undertakers&#146; supply systems, enabling the licensee to
supply water to eligible non-household premises. Prospective suppliers
have to obtain a licence from Ofwat.</p><p><a name="061128107000034"></a>The areas of supply of the Welsh
undertakers do not align with the boundary of Wales and consequently
some functions are transferred to the 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_735"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 735</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Assembly on a water undertakers&#146; area basis, such as Section 74.
Because the functions under sections of the Act that I have already
mentioned are exercisable by reference to regulations made under
Section 74 of the Act, the basis of transfer of all those provisions
needs to be aligned.</p><p><a name="061128107000035"></a>The
proposed transfer of functions is intended to correct the disparate
manner in which these interrelated functions have been transferred to
the Assembly so that the Assembly&#146;s ability to regulate the
water industry in Wales more accurately reflects the devolution
settlement as it has effect in relationto the supply of water
by water undertakers. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="061128107000036"></a>Moved, That the order
laid before the House on19 October be approved. <I>36th Report

Roberts of Conwy:</b> My Lords, we are all grateful
to the Minister for his clear exposition of the order before the House
and for supplying us with ample Explanatory Notes on its detailed and
occasionally abstruse provisions. The order is not hugely contentious,
as far as I can see, although others may take a different view. That
said, it would be helpful if the Minister could respond to one or two
questions in his winding up.</p><p><a name="061128108000002"></a>Before I comment on the provisions in
the order, I would like briefly to refer to what I can only describe as
the casual discussion that took place at the Welsh Assembly plenary
session on this order on 18 October this year. Only two Members
participated in the debate, one of whom was the responsible Minister.
The fleeting discussion that occurred concerned me, and I fear that the
level of scrutiny was far from appropriate. The order includes, as the
Minister said, the transfer of three items, two of which were barely
even mentioned. I would be interested to hear whether the Minister
believes that the debate that took place was
satisfactory.</p><p><a name="061128108000003"></a>The first part of
the transfer order would give the Assembly the right to be consulted on
the draft census order and the power to make regulations on the content
and conduct of the 2011 census of population in Wales. That would allow
for different information to be collected on census forms in Wales, as
is currently done for data on familiarity with the Welsh language which
has been done since 1891. It is sensible for the Assembly to have a
share of influence over the production of the census form, especially
since the tick-box debacle of 2001 to which the Minister
referred.</p><p><a name="061128108000004"></a>Discussions on the
recording of Welsh identity, which became controversial prior to the
2001 census because of the absence of the Welsh tick box, has finally
resulted in agreement that the Assembly should have a more formal role
in agreeing future census forms in Wales. It is important that the
Assembly gets the census data required to support effective
policy-making in Wales. This is, therefore, a change that I welcome in
principle. Of course, the 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_736"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 736</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>challenge will be to exercise restraint and discrimination in the choice
of special Welsh data sought in the
census.</p><p><a name="061128108000005"></a>Before moving on, I
would like to clarify the financial implications of transferring these
powers. Will the funding of the census in England and Wales still
remain the responsibility of the Office for National Statistics, as
will the conduct of the census? Is it the case that the Assembly will
meet the costs of any change which it specifically requires? Can the
Minister confirm that any such costs will be met from the Assembly
budget? Are any extra administration costs expected and how will they
be met?</p><p><a name="061128108000006"></a>On the transfer of
Section 156 of the Environmental Protection Act as it applies to Part 2
of that Act, this will, as the noble Lord said, supplement powers
already available to the Assembly under the European Communites Act
1972 and enable the Assembly to make regulations giving effect to
community and international obligations about waste management on land.
I understand that the penalties for offences under the EPA are greater
than those available under the European Act. The noble Lord has
confirmed that. Will that have any specific significance in this
context? Will it radically change the situation in
Wales?</p><p><a name="061128108000007"></a>The devolution
settlement gives the Assembly extensive responsibility for
environmental matters, which include waste management. Wales
contributes to the 330 million tonnes of waste produced annually in the
UK, a quarter of which is from householdsand business. The
rest comes from construction, demolition, sewage sludge, farm waste,
spoils from mines and the dredging of rivers. The issue of waste
disposal is an increasingly important one, but because the functions
under Section 156 have not been transferred to the Assembly, the
Assembly has relied on the Secretary of State to use powers on its
behalf. This has resulted in a confusing and messy situation where the
waste management regulatory framework varies across England and Wales.
The transfer is a tidying up measure which will help to avoid the
difficulties of maintaining a common waste management regulatory
framework across the
border.</p><p><a name="061128108000008"></a>The Assembly Government
published their waste strategy in 2002, and have made substantial
financial resources available to local authorities to
supportthe delivery of the strategy. Any measures
whichcan further improve the organisation of waste management
must be supported. I therefore welcome this
transfer.</p><p><a name="061128108000009"></a>Finally, the transfer
under the Water Industry Act will amend the basis on which the Assembly
can make regulations prescribing requirements in relation to water
fittings, or connections, and the prevention of contamination or waste
of the public water supply by water or sewerage undertakers whose areas
are wholly or mainly in Wales. It will amend an anomaly in the way that
powers under the Water Industry Act 1991 have been transferred to the
Assembly. I understand that this has been supported by Ministers in the
Assembly and at Westminster, and I wish to add my support to the
transfer.</p>

whether it is wholly appropriate to introduce orders containing three
unconnected items, as this one does. I would be grateful if the
Minister would comment on this decision. It is not that I have any
strong objection, but I would have thought that it might be somewhat
confusing to have three such disparate and different matters combined
in one order, from a governmental point of
view.</p><p><a name="061128108000011"></a><b><a name="61128-0012.htm_spnew103"></a><a name="061128108000021"></a>Lord
Livsey of Talgarth:</b> My Lords, this transfer of
functions order and the variation of the 1999 transfer order are the
precursor of business to come next year, when many Orders in Council
will arrive here for debate as a result of the Government of
WalesAct 2006. I look forward to many initiatives of
progressive legislation coming here from the Welsh Assembly Government
and the National Assembly for Wales after next April, when the
Government of Wales Act is implemented.</p><p><a name="061128108000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy,
and the Minister have adequately outlined the structure we are
discussing. I shall not detain the House by going over all of what has
been said. However, the three census issues, the Environmental
Protection Act 1990, the variation of the 1999 Act and the Water
Industry Act 1991 are contained in these measures. We welcome these
measures, which are timely, and all the detailed information that the
Minister and his team have provided.</p><p><a name="061128108000013"></a>The census has been a controversial
issue for some time. There was denial of the very fact that one was of
Welsh origin, although the census in Wales did ask whether one was
Irish, English or Scots. It was an incredible anomaly. The &#147;no
tick box&#148; issue was an amazing situation for the Welsh, in their
own country. I am pleased to see that there has been a quantum leap in
putting such anomalies right.</p><p><a name="061128108000014"></a>A number of things
have concerned me over the years. For many years the Office for
National Statistics issued no statistics at all for my area, Powys.
Earnings, employment and especially GDP figures were
&#147;unavailable&#148;. I bombarded the ONS and the Welsh Office
for information but it was not forthcoming for a long time.
Fortunately, that has recently been put right. Eventually, in the
mid-1990s, some figures emerged just in time to prove that the GDP in
Powys was only1 per cent above the 75 per cent level
requiredto qualify for Objective 1 funding. So Powys got
Objective 2 funding. But then 12 wards receiving Objective 2 funding in
Powys were somehow transferred to Cardiff, leaving little or no
Objective 2 funding in south-east Powys. It illustrates the importance
of ensuring that we get the correct statistics and that the Welsh
Assembly is able to provide
variations.</p><p><a name="061128108000015"></a>I remain
unconvinced that health needs are not accurately compiled in existing
census information. The important points of demography and poor health
from a lifetime of hard physical work by, for example, miners,
steelworkers, farmers and farm workers&#151;of which Wales has a high
percentage&#151;have resulted in greater health needs in Wales.
Indeed, if that is put together with a low-wage economy, it kicks back
to 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_738"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 738</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>resources&#151;at the moment, the NHS in Wales is in debt to the tune
of &#163;100 million&#151;the Barnett formula and the block grant.
Unless we have good statistics from the ONS and sub-regional
information from the Assembly, Wales will lose out because inadequate
information will result in inadequate resource allocation. We must
remind ourselves that Wales is one of the poorest areas in the United
Kingdom, with average GDP at only 80 per cent of the UK average.
Planning matters in the use of statistics.</p><p><a name="061128108000016"></a>Transfer of the power
under Section 156 of the Environmental Protection Act to make
regulations is all about waste on land and matters allied to it. It
will allow the Assembly to take care of European Community issues on
the one hand and international obligations on the other. In such
matters it is vital to have cohesion with England. Those are
undoubtedly excellent and sensible objectives. They impact on crucial
issues such as hazardous waste and it is good that the Welsh Assembly
Government will be able to produce their own regulations and not have
to rely on Defra.</p><p><a name="061128108000017"></a>Other
important and interesting issues relate to the Water Industry Act 1991,
for example, and deal with preventing contamination or waste of the
public water supply by means of water fittings. Amendments will be made
to the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions Order) 1999
and the regulations will then apply to water or sewage undertakers.
Although we welcome these transfers of functions under the 1991 Act, a
question remains. In the information which the Minister gave us there
was mention of water undertakers whose areas are mainly in Wales. As
the Minister will know, some water undertakers areas are mainly in
England though they have functions, customers and consumers in Wales.
When I was a Member in the other place, there was a situation where a
water undertaker whose main operations were in England long refused to
sortout the sewage situation in the town of Knighton, which
was in my constituency. It took a long time and a lot of hard words to
get it to do anything at all about the situation&#151;which actually
prevented housing development. Indeed, sewage pipes were overflowing.
So this is a two-way business for water undertakers. Dwr Cymru, for
example, operates in more or less the whole of Herefordshire, and
people in England can say the same thing in reverse of what I have just
said about the situation in Wales. We therefore hope that these
transfers will ensure that there are obligations on water undertakers
that operate mainly in England but have functions in Wales. That is a
cross-border issue that is complicated and needs sorting out.</p><p><a name="061128108000018"></a>Finally, why was the Welsh Assembly
Government or the National Assembly for Wales not consulted on the
transfer of these functions? The Minister was candid when he said that
Defra was one of the consultees and the Wales Office was another, but
there was no consultation with the Welsh Assembly Government or the
National Assembly for Wales. I have extrapolated that omission and am
sure the Minister will tell me if I am wrong in that. On the whole,
however, we welcome these transfer orders and are grateful for the
information that the Minister
provided.</p>

he is sitting with two colleagues this evening. However, the level of
debate that Assembly Members enter into is a matter for the Assembly,
and it really is not appropriate for me to comment on
that.</p><p><a name="061128109000004"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s
second point concerns funding. I can confirm that funding of the census
in England and Wales will remain the responsibility of the ONS, as will
the conduct. The Assembly will have only to meet the costs of any
variations it wishes to make to the census in Wales. Assembly
committees will discuss the 2011 census over the next few months. It is
not yet possible to quantify the extent of additional costs, if
any.</p><p><a name="061128109000005"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s
third point concerned penalties for offences under Section 156 of the
Environmental Protection Act 1990. I can confirm that the level of
penalties has no specific significance for the Assembly seeking these
further powers. It will simply ensure that the Assembly is competent to
legislate in this area to the same extent that the Secretary of State
for Defra can in
England.</p><p><a name="061128109000006"></a>Finally, the noble
Lord, Lord Roberts, questioned why unconnected items were contained in
this single order. This is not the first time unconnected functions
have been transferred to the Assembly in one order. It merely reflects
different departments within the Assembly seeking to transfer functions
within a common parliamentary timetable. It also means that we do not
have to take up parliamentary time with individual orders, some of
which are very small.</p><p><a name="061128109000007"></a>The noble
Lord, Lord Livsey, asked what type of questions could be contained
within the Welsh census, and made a number of very important points.
This is a matter for the National Assembly and, as I mentioned earlier,
will be discussed in committee over the next few months, but I am sure
that representatives of the National Assembly will be very interested
to read the noble Lord&#146;s
comments.</p><p><a name="061128109000008"></a>The transfer of the
Water Industry Act functions has not been subject to public
consultation because its purpose is merely to amend a technical
anomaly. The Assembly will consult interested parties as and when
regulations using the stated powers are brought forward.</p><p><a name="061128109000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, also raised
some interesting points about the water industry&#146;s cross-border
concerns. The Assembly does not have cross-border concerns in relation
to this industry. However, any future concerns or problems that may
occur can now be resolved following the transfer of this
function.</p><p><a name="061128109000010"></a>Finally, I can
confirm that the Assembly would have been heavily involved in the
consultation on transferring powers under the Water Industry Act 1991,
as it was the instigator of the transfer request.</p><p><a name="061128109000011"></a>On Question, Motion agreed
to.</p>

Davies of Oldham</b> rose to move, That the draft
order laid before the House on 11 October be approved [<I>35th Report
from the Statutory Instruments Committee</I>, <I>Session
2005-06</I>].</p><p><a name="061128109000013"></a>The noble Lord
said: My Lords, the National Lottery Act 2006 received Royal Assent in
July. We are aiming to make the Big Lottery Fund fully functional on 1
December. So the fund can start distributing money from that date, we
need to make this order under Section 22(3A) of the National Lottery
etc. Act 1993 and to issue new policy directions under Section 36E of
that Act.</p><p><a name="061128109000014"></a>This order will allow
the Big Lottery Fund to distribute lottery money for good causes that
are charitable or connected with health, education or the environment.
It largely re-enacts, within the new legislative framework, the interim
orders we issued to the New Opportunities Fund last year. It is also
almost identical to the illustrative order we made available to the
House during the passage of the2006
Act.</p><p><a name="061128109000015"></a>The order will ensure that
the Big Lottery Fund, once established as a new statutory body, can
continue to fund exciting and worthwhile projects, making a real
difference to communities the length and breadth of the
country.</p><p><a name="061128109000016"></a>I
will set out as quickly as I can what the order does. It specifies two
types of expenditure for the Big Lottery Fund: devolved expenditure and
non-devolved, or UK-wide, expenditure. There are two types of devolved
expenditure. First, there is expenditure on the three high level themes
of community learning, promoting community safety and cohesion, and
promoting well-being. The second type of devolved expenditure is
expenditure on small grants: the popular and successful Awards for All
scheme. Devolved expenditure will be the responsibility of the new
country committees established under the 2006 Act&#151;a subject on
which I recall that the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, waxed eloquent during
our deliberations&#151;but subject to directions issued by the
relevant devolved Administration. That represents a significant
devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as
within England. Each part of the UK will have a dedicated committee and
lead board member. I know that the House will welcome that.</p><p><a name="061128109000017"></a>The order also
specifies one type of non-devolved expenditure: transformational
grants. Transformational grant expenditure is intended to transform
communities, regions or the nation as a whole, and is being delivered
by the Big Lottery Fund through its Living Landmarks programme. Its
budget of &#163;140 million will fund a number of projects of more
than &#163;10 million, with a single major grant of up to &#163;50
million. The vote will be conducted in partnership with the
People&#146;s Millions programme and ITV. The order will therefore
allow the fund to continue to back the kind of major project that the
Millennium Commission supported, such as the hugely successful Eden
Project in Cornwall.</p>



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_741"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 741</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061128109000018"></a>I remind the House why we need to be able
to prescribe types of expenditure for the Big Lottery Fund. That was
the subject of considerable debate during the passage of the Bill
earlier this year. Our policy has always been to adopt a much less
prescriptive approach with the Big Lottery Fund than we did with New
Opportunities
Fund.</p><p><a name="061128109000019"></a>Nevertheless, we do not
want to be in a position where the fund could be given 50 per cent of
all the lottery good cause money to spend on anything that is
charitable or connected with health, education or the environment
without further recourse to Parliament. The new Big Lottery Fund good
cause is both broad in scope and large in terms of the percentage of
lottery money allocated to it. It is therefore completely reasonable
that we should be able to set out at the very highest level the types
of expenditure on which the fund should focus, but I emphasise
again&#151;we discussed this extensively during the passage of the
Bill&#151;that only broad, high-level funding themes are
envisaged.</p><p><a name="061128109000020"></a>We will no longer
set out relatively narrow funding initiatives, as we did with the New
Opportunities Fund, where we sometimes went as far as detailing not
only the specific outcomes to be achieved but how they should be
achieved. Under the order and the accompanying policy directions, it
will be the Big Lottery Fund, not the Government, that makes all the
important decisions. The fund will have sole responsibility for
deciding on programmes, choosing delivery mechanisms, identifying
partners and selecting projects. In other words, the Big Lottery Fund
will operate on the same basis as other lottery distributors&#151;a
point of considerable concern during the passage of the Bill, which is
why I take this opportunity to emphasise
it.</p><p><a name="061128109000021"></a>We have made the decision
not to carry out a full consultation on this order and to have limited
consultation on the statutory requirements. I can assure the House that
that is simply because the order and policy directions largely
replicate the interim orders and policy directions that we issued to
the New Opportunities Fund and the Community Fund last year, on which
there was extensive
consultation.</p><p><a name="061128109000022"></a>Furthermore, they
are almost identical to the illustrative Big Lottery Fund order and
directions that we made available during the passage of the 2006 Act.
For these reasons, and conscious of the need to avoid consultation
fatigue, we did not think that full consultation was warranted on the
order. I must stress, however, that we remain committed to our policy
of increasing transparency as we move forward to the Big Lottery Fund,
and we expect to consult widely with lottery stakeholders on new orders
and directions to be issued to the
fund.</p><p><a name="061128109000023"></a>I
should also point out that the order is needed so that the Big Lottery
Fund can continue to fund its new programmes. Following two rounds of
public consultation, and with continuing stakeholder involvement, the
fund hopes to have launched all its new programmes by the end of the
year. Programmes will deliver the funding themes set out in the order.
They will also help to achieve the four outcomes and the funding
priorities 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_742"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 742</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>set out in the policy directions. Underpinning all the programmes is the
fund&#146;s mission to improve communities and the lives of people
most in need. The fund has said that it will distribute no less than a
third of its funding via demand-led programmes, which encourage
organisations and groups to propose their own ideas and local solutions
for funding. It has also given an undertaking that between 60 and 70
per cent of its funding will go directly to voluntary and community
sector
organisations.</p><p><a name="061128109000024"></a>The
order has been debated and approved in the other place, and I commend
it to this House. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="061128109000025"></a>Moved, That the draft
order laid before the House on 11 October be approved [<I>35th Report

Verma:</b> My Lords, we on these Benches agree with
the Government that the order should be
approved.</p><p><a name="061128109000027"></a><b><a name="61128-0013.htm_spnew107"></a><a name="061128109000052"></a>Lord
Shutt of Greetland:</b> My Lords, the order gives us
the opportunity to express a few views. As I understand it, although
the gun has been jumped with the 1 December start date, the order sets
out what the Big Lottery Fund can do. I was thinking as I
read,</p><ul><a name="061128109000043"></a>&#147;charitable or
connected with health, education or the
environment&#148;,</ul><p><a name="061128109000044"></a>that,
when we see the word &#147;charitable&#148; now, we mean charitable
as set out in the Charities Act 2006, which we passed a few days ago.
Although I do not think that what is charitable has changed much, if at
all, it is clearer what charitable means to anyone who could not think
as widely as they might have done when hearing the phrase,
&#147;other purposes beneficial to the
community&#148;.</p><p><a name="061128109000028"></a>For a
regionalist like me, it is strange to see England, Wales, Scotland,
Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man set out as the regions under
&#147;Devolved expenditure&#148;, and that the regions of England
do not count. The Minister will well recall amendments that I have
offered on several occasions. However, among the suggestions for the
way forward, which
include,</p><ul><a name="061128109000045"></a>&#147;the
promotion of community
learning&#148;,</ul><a name="061128109000038"></a>and,<ul><a name="061128109000046"></a>&#147;the
promotion of community safety and
cohesion&#148;,</ul><a name="061128109000039"></a>I am
attracted to the
phrase,<ul><a name="061128109000047"></a>&#147;the
promotion of physical and mental well
being&#148;,</ul><a name="061128109000040"></a>in that
potential applicants who see that phrase may well be able to achieve
it. Whether their grant application will be agreed to is another
matter, but that can certainly cover a huge amount of what voluntary
and community organisations want to
do.<p><a name="061128109000029"></a>Under
&#147;Non-devolved expenditure: transformational grants&#148;, it
is interesting to
note:</p><ul><a name="061128109000042"></a>&#147;The description
of expenditure is expenditure on or connected with projects which are
intended to transform communities, regions or the nation as a
whole&#148;.</ul><a name="061128109000041"></a>I
find it strange that transforming the regions is an aim. Yet there is
no regional base to the Big Lottery Fund. I am very concerned about Mr
Big being London-centric. Therefore, I have heard the comments about
consultation on this order. Here we are in the late days 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_743"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 743</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of November and this order starts on 1 December. I give the Minister the
opportunity to indicate what the Big Lottery will do to see that it is
fair to the regions and the applicants who come from the regions of
England. It should not be just a matter of people saying &#147;The
headquarters are in London, so we&#146;ll say okay, but we do not
know anything about these fuddy-duddy people in the provinces&#148;.
We need to be certain that this is the case. I find it very
strange&#151;as I did at the time&#151;that the regions are not to
be catered for in the way that I thought they ought to be and as they
have been previously. But that is in the past. However, it is important
to see that regional dimension in the
grant-making.<p><a name="061128109000030"></a><b><a name="061128109000053"></a>The
Lord Bishop of Manchester:</b> My Lords, I listened
to the Minister with great interest. I hope that my point is germane to
the debate and that your Lordships will forgive me if it turns out not
to be so. Can the Minister give an assurance that the Government will
continue to recognise the significant role of the Christian churches,
particularly in enhancing community cohesion among people of all faiths
and none? Will those who make decisions about lottery grants to
voluntary and community sections recognise that and not in any way
discriminate against Christian churches which make such applications?
If they do discriminate, one should know on what spurious grounds they
do
so.</p><p><a name="061128109000031"></a><b><a name="61128-0013.htm_spnew108"></a><a name="061128109000054"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to
noble Lords who have contributed to this debate and I welcome the noble
Baroness, Lady Verma, to her new role. I am sorry that this is such a
restricted measure on which to make her debut, but I am very grateful
for her assent. I am sure that we will discuss broader
themes&#151;after all, this has derived from the Act and the
substantial debates that we had throughout last year when she was
unable for obvious reasons to participate. I understand her limited
contribution today and I know that she will be much more extensive in
due course. I look forward to debating issues with her as much as I did
with her predecessor, the noble Viscount, Lord Astor. As she knows, he
fulfilled the role of Front-Bench spokesman for many years with great
&#233;lan and often with great penetration in his questions. I
enjoyed debating issues with him. I cannot say that it is not a slight
relief that I will not have his penetrative challenges to contend with
in the immediate future, but I know that the noble Baroness will
sustain the level which he
set.</p><p><a name="061128109000032"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Shutt, inevitably revisited old pastures, at which I am not surprised
at all. We had extensive debates about the whole question of whether
the Big Lottery would be excessively London-centric&#151;that is the
word he chose to use today. I sought to emphasise during the passage of
the Bill, and I reiterate today, that the Big Lottery is under an
obligation to have regard to the interests of 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_744"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column 744</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>England as a whole&#151;not London, but the different parts of England
and the relative population sizes, and the scope for reducing economic
and social deprivation in the different parts.</p><p><a name="061128109000033"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, is wise
enough to recognise that there are parts of London which have social
and economic deprivation as well. He will also know that within that
framework is a clear recognition that there are parts of England, which
he would define in terms of certain regions, which deserve and merit
special attention. The Big Lottery is under an obligation to address
those issues. I seek to give the reassurance which I sought to give
during the debates last year, but I am not at all surprised that the
noble Lord, Lord Shutt, stayed true to his last and re-emphasised these
points, about which I know he cares a great deal. On the Charities Act,
it can be only beneficial that it defines these things more clearly,
thus helping to make clear the role of lottery funding. That is a gain
with regard to the working of the
lottery.</p><p><a name="061128109000034"></a>I am not sure that the
right reverend Prelate strayed too widely in his comments on the order.
After all, this is the first order to be made under the new Act. It
sets up the biggest lottery funding operation and therefore a great
deal will come within its purview. Given that, the right reverend
Prelate has every right to ask for an assurance that lottery funding
will not discriminate against the Christian Church. Given the way in
which the lottery is constructed and its obligations regarding fairness
and recognition that it is there to serve the community, I cannot see
how it could possibly behave adversely towards the Christian community.
In many parts of the country the Christian Church is obviously the
major force in the locality in many respects, so I can give the right
reverend Prelate an assurance on that point. On church heritage, that
is a different dimension on which we had some fairly substantial
debates during the passage of the Bill, and I sought to give
reassurances on that point. However, I am grateful to him for raising
the issue again.</p><p><a name="061128109000035"></a>We look
forward to seeing the lottery board address the issues so dear to the
heart of the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, not only in its perception of the
nation as a whole, but also of the different countries and regions
which make up the United Kingdom. By the same token, the board cannot
fulfil its duties unless it is sensitive to the issues raised by the
right reverend Prelate.</p><p><a name="061128109000036"></a>We will
no doubt return to these issues in due course and I look forward to
wider debates on aspects of the lottery. But this evening I hope we all
recognise that the order takes matters forward along the lines we
eventually agreed on after much hard debate during the passage of the
Bill earlier this year. This order gives effect to a crucial part of
that legislation.</p><p><a name="061128109000037"></a>On Question,

Flooding</h3><p><a name="061128101000014"></a><b><a name="061128101000642"></a>The
Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My
right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International
Development has made the following
Statement.</p><p><a name="061128101000015"></a>Having suffered
severe drought, parts of the Horn of Africa are now experiencing
exceptionally high rainfall, resulting in severe flooding in Ethiopia,
Somalia and Kenya. The UK has responded swiftly, committing &#163;6
million to the humanitarian relief effort over the past few weeks. This
brings our total humanitarian contribution in these countries since
April 2005 to &#163;50.8
million.</p><p><a name="061128101000016"></a>The worst affected
areas are south-eastern Ethiopia, southern Somalia and northern and
eastern Kenya. Although there has been some respite in the past few
days, the forecast is for the rains to continue at above-normal levels
for the next two or three months. The UN currently estimates that the
floods are affecting nearly 1.5 million people&#151;360,000 in
Ethiopia (80 deaths), 902,000 in Somalia (52 deaths) and 207,000 in
Kenya (45
deaths).</p><p><a name="061128101000017"></a>Since
August, DfID has committed &#163;6 million to UN, Red Cross and
non-governmental organisation (NGO) operations in Ethiopia (&#163;2
million), Somalia (&#163;2 million) and Kenya (&#163;2 million).
This money is funding relief flights, distributions of relief kits
(containing items such as plastic sheeting for shelter, jerrycans,
blankets and soap), provision of water and sanitation supplies, and
nutrition and health supplies and services. The flooding in Ethiopia
has been affecting that country since July and the UK contributions
were made at the end of August (&#163;1 million) and in October
(&#163;1 million to address the diarrhoea epidemic that was a
consequence of the
flooding).</p><p><a name="061128101000018"></a>The
UN has released funds from the United Nations Central Emergency
Response Fund (CERF). There was an initial $3 million for the floods
response in Ethiopia in October, and two further contributions last
week for Somalia ($3.3 million) and Kenya($11.8 million). In
Ethiopia, an additional $2.6 million is being requested, and the
Somalia contribution from the CERF is expected to rise to above $10.3
million as additional requests from UN agencies are considered. The
total funding from the CERF is therefore likely to amount to $28
million. The UK is the largest contributor to this mechanism, providing
26 per cent of current paid contributions. I welcome this full and
speedy response.</p><p><a name="061128101000019"></a>National
authorities, Red Cross, UN and INGOs are all responding. Access to the
affected areas is of course difficult. Roads are blocked by the flood
waters, and unmade roads are turning to mud and becoming impassable.
Bridges and culverts have been destroyed. Aircraft, including
helicopters, are being deployed to achieve access where this is
impossible by road. In Ethiopia and Somalia, insecurity is also a
factor.</p>

closely. We are particularly concerned about likely increases in
waterborne disease and malaria. Shelter is also a major concern. There
are also risks to animal health, which may affect livelihood security
in the region. In the medium term, when the flood waters recede a
consequence may be improved water availability, improved pasture and
improved soil moisture, creating better farming
conditions.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="061128101000003"></a>Diplomatic

Council</h3><p><a name="061128101000271"></a><b><a name="061128101000646"></a>The
Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Scotland of
Asthal):</b> The Justice and Home Affairs Council was
held on 5 and 6 October 2006 in Luxembourg. I attended the council with
the Home Secretary and Baroness Ashton, Parliamentary Under-Secretary
of State at the Department for Constitutional Affairs. I thought that
it would be useful to outline what was discussed and decided at the
council meeting.</p><p><a name="061128101000272"></a>The Finnish
presidency opened the council with the &#147;A&#148; points list,
which was approved. This included Community strategic guidelines on
cohesion and a framework decision on the mutual recognition of
confiscation orders.</p><p><a name="061128101000273"></a>The
presidency confirmed that a deal had been reached with the United
States on an interim passenger name records agreement. Negotiations on
a new permanent agreement will start
shortly.</p><p><a name="061128101000274"></a>On
The Hague programme, it was agreed that more co-operation was needed on
immigration between member states and between the EU and third
countries. Countering terrorism and organised crime needed closer
member state co-operation with Europol, SitCen and between member state
agencies. The UK emphasised that new legislation should be proposed
only when it met a real need. It was important to focus on delivery of
existing instruments and action plans. There was some emphasis on the
challenges faced by some member states from illegal
migration.</p><p><a name="061128101000275"></a>The presidency
reported back on the discussion held at Tampere on the use of the
passerelle inArticle 42 TEU, noting that a significant number
of member states had expressed concerns about the possibility of such
use. The presidency is still reflecting on what its next steps should
be, but we consider the current debate to be over and believe that we
should instead focus on practical measures. The presidency noted that
it was still working to a European Council mandate to improve decision
making in JHA, but the JHA council was split on the use of the
passerelle in Article 42 TEU. The Commission urged the presidency to
reach agreement on the passerelle by the December European
Council.</p><p><a name="061128101000276"></a>There had been a
discussion about the future development of mutual recognition at the
Tampere informal council in light of which the presidency planned to
present draft council conclusions to the December JHA
council.</p><p><a name="061128101000277"></a>The
Home Secretary thanked the presidency, member states and the Commission
for the help and solidarity received in August, saying that the EU had
done much good work to establish a political and legislative framework
to deliver real benefits to citizens and that migration and
counterterrorism were key priorities.</p>



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS78"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column WS78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061128101000278"></a>An in-depth discussion
was held on the draft framework decision on the transfer of prisoners.
No agreement was reached on the issues of prisoner consent and the
treatment of third-country nationals. The UK argued against watering
down the text through the inclusion of broad grounds for refusal, such
as a proposal that refusal should be possible where the aim of social
rehabilitation would not be met. It was proposed, however, that
concerns about meeting the social rehabilitation aim could be addressed
through a definition of residence, since it was arguable that social
rehabilitation was dependent on the links to a member state that would
have been created by five years&#146; previous residence there. It
was argued that this could also be used to determine whether or not
there was an obligation on the executing state to take back the
prisoner notwithstanding his or her nationality. The UK agrees that a
solution might rest with this approach, although the presidency
concluded that work would continue on the basis of a regime that did
not include an obligation to accept third-country nationals. Work will
continue at expert level with a view to concluding negotiations in
December.</p><p><a name="061128101000279"></a>The new member states
were deeply disappointed by the delay to the SIS II timetable. There
was some strong support for the Portuguese proposals to integrate the
new member states into SIS I+. A number of member states underlined
that an effective task force was critical to the SIS II implementation
timetable; some stressed that work to explore the Portuguese proposal
should not detract from continued focus on implementation of SIS II or
result in further delays. The presidency achieved agreement to the
council conclusions.</p><p><a name="061128101000280"></a>There was
debate on the draft framework decision on taking account of convictions
in new criminal proceedings. However, it remained clear that the detail
of Article 3 needed further work, in particular in relation to the
exceptions to the obligation to assimilate foreign convictions into
national systems. The presidency hopes to finalise the text at the
December JHA
council.</p><p><a name="061128101000281"></a>The
presidency called for political agreement to a compromise proposal on
civil protection, which limited Community financing of transport and
equipment to third-country assistance and included the possibility of
reimbursement to the Community budget. There was some agreement around
the table, but the UK rejected the compromise because it blurred the
clear member state responsibility for civil protection. The UK
commented that the Commission&#146;s role in helping co-operation
between member states was welcome, as was improving interoperability of
member state assets. However, we could not agree the instrument with
the contentious articles. The Government insisted that, while all
member states agreed that solidarity was critical and helped each other
in practice, the proposed measures were not the way to strengthen our
systems. The presidency agreed to send the item back to COREPER for
further discussion.</p><p><a name="061128101000282"></a>The
presidency outlined the progress made in the proposal to establish a
European Union fundamental rights agency and, unexpectedly, pressed for
political agreement. As a result, several member states stated 



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS79"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column WS79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their positions and concerns with the proposal. The UK made it clear
that the agency should be focused solely on Community law, with no
third-pillar remit. The presidency confirmed that discussions on the
proposal would continue at COREPER
level.</p><p><a name="061128101000283"></a>In
considering the management of future negotiations on the draft
directive proposing criminal penalties to enforce intellectual property
rights, member states were split as to whether (i) there was a need for
further legislation at this time and(ii) whether it was
appropriate to continue discussions on the directive pending the ECJ
judgment on maritime pollution, which should address the scope for
Community action in relation to criminal matters. However, there was
agreement that the scope of any instrument should be limited to those
intellectual property rights harmonised at Community level. The
presidency concluded that work would continue on that basis at expert
level both on the need for legislation and on the substance of the
proposed directive, but without prejudice to a final decision on the
legal base.</p><p><a name="061128101000284"></a>The draft council
conclusions on reinforcing the southern external maritime borders were
agreed without
discussion.</p><p><a name="061128101000285"></a>There was
discussion about visa waiver reciprocity and the Commission highlighted
its successes with south African countries. The US was not abiding by
an undertaking made during the Austrian presidency and there was some
call for taking the first punitive steps, although other member states
called for a more measured
response.</p><p><a name="061128101000286"></a>There
was no substantive discussion on visa facilitation and readmission
agreements with Moldova. The presidency invited the Commission to draw
up mandates.</p><p><a name="061128101000287"></a>Finally, the
European conference on active participation of ethnic minority youth in
society was highlighted, with requests for opinions on what more could
be done to fight radicalisation, how politicians could learn from the
young and how integration could be further promoted. This item will
feature on future council
agendas.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="061128101000007"></a>Legal

Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor (Lord
Falconer of Thoroton):</b> I am
publishing <I>Legal Aid Reform: The Way Ahead</I> (Cm 6993). This sets
out how we will reform the procurement of legal aid services, moving
towards a market-based system. It takes account of the responses that
we received to the consultation paper <I>Legal Aid: A Sustainable
Future</I> (CP 13/06), which was published simultaneously on 13 July
2006 with the independent report by Lord Carter of Coles, <I>Legal
Aid&#151;A Market-based Approach to Reform</I>. The paper has been
laid before both Houses of Parliament. Copies are available in the
Printed Paper Office and the Vote

aid procurement fit squarely within the Government's wider programme of
reform across the justice system. We are promoting simple, speedy,
summary justice in the criminal courts and modernising the legal sector
through the introduction of the Legal Services Bill last Thursday. The
proposed

this programme and will bring benefits for clients, taxpayers, the
legal profession and the wider justice system. The reforms will ensure
that we have a modern legal aid system and a legal profession that is
customer-focused and in which the public have
confidence.</p><p><a name="061128101000290"></a>The consultation
period closed on 12 October. We received 2,372 replies to the
consultation paper. Over the summer months, the legal aid Minister,
Vera Baird QC MP, toured the country to meet practitioners and to hear
their views on the proposals. This involved some 25 meetings in 11
cities, attended by around 1,000 practitioners. The Legal Services
Commission also met practitioners to explain the proposals and answer
questions. Over 1,700 legal aid professionals attended 14 of these
events in the early autumn.</p><p><a name="061128101000291"></a>The
<I>Legal Aid Reform: The Way Ahead</I> paper sets out how the
Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Legal Services Commission
will deliver a new system of legal aid procurement. The reforms will
set legal aid on a sustainable footing for the future and will ensure
that the most vulnerable people in our society receive the help that
they need. The reforms will ensure a future in which the legal advice
provided is of the highest quality and practitioners are able to make a
decent financial return, and a future in which access to justice
remains at the heart of our
society.</p><p><a name="061128101000292"></a>We are fully committed
to the market-based approach set out by Lord Carter. We will move to
fixed and graduated fees as a transitional step to best-value
competition. However, we have listened carefully to the concerns
expressed by legal aid practitioners. We have therefore made
significant adjustments to the timing and sequencing of some of the
proposed schemes, as well as to the detail of some of the original
proposals, where we believe that they will bring
improvements.</p><p><a name="061128101000293"></a>In summary, we
are proceeding with Lord Carter&#146;s proposals and we are
delivering on our commitment to rebalance the funding between civil and
criminal legal aid.</p><p><a name="061128101000294"></a>The
approach set out in the <I>Legal Aid Reform: The Way Ahead</I> paper
offers the best guarantee of an affordable, good-quality legal aid
system that will protect the vulnerable and is fair to taxpayers, fair
to defendants and fair for
practitioners.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="061128101000008"></a>Ministry

certainty and improving medium-term planning. We intend to implement
the settlement for 2007-08 broadly unchanged from last year's
announcement. It is our intention to move to three-year settlements

and central spending on services for the police will have increased by
over 62 per cent, or over &#163;4.2 billion, between 2000-01 and
2007-08. Our investment in recent years has helped to expand local
policing, reduce crime and help to make our communities safer. Since
peaking in 1995, British Crime Survey (BCS) crime has fallen by 44 per
cent, which represents 8.4 million fewer crimes, with domestic burglary
and vehicle crime falling by over a half and violent crime falling by
43 per cent. The risk of becoming a victim of crime remains at the
lowest level recorded since the BCS began in 1981. The Government
continue to work with the police service to ensure that it has the
right tools to tackle crime without being burdened by any unnecessary
rules and
paperwork.</p><p><a name="061128101000306"></a>Our
ambitious police reform programme continues to produce real
improvements, but there is still more to do. We will be publishing a
vision for policing and a reform road map by the end of the year,
following consultation with policing partners. A clear workforce
strategy will ensure that the police service is well led, skilled,
motivated and representative of the communities that it serves; this is
also linked to initiatives to enhance performance and to improve
efficiency and effectiveness from available resources. To improve the
capability and capacity for protective services, forces are working
regionally and individually to develop new initiatives in
collaboration, shared services and other
efficiencies.</p><p><a name="061128101000307"></a><I>The police

policing grants and central spending in 2007-08 will be &#163;11,043
million, an overall increase of 3.1 per cent. This includes a broadly
flat rate increase of 3.6 per cent in general grant for all police
authorities in England and Wales. All police authorities will have
planned ahead on this basis. The increase is above inflation (forecast

within the local government finance system are being announced by my
honourable friend the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth today and
by the Welsh Assembly
Government.</p><p><a name="061128101000349"></a>Provisional general
policing grants (i.e. Home Office police grant, revenue support grant
and national non-domestic rates) for English and Welsh police
authorities in 2007-08 compared with 2006-07 are given in table
2.</p><p><a name="061128101000350"></a>The settlement continues to
take account of our commitment to improve efficiency and effectiveness
in the police service. Authorities will be expected to deliver 1.5 per
cent cashable efficiency savings and1.5 per cent non-cashable
savings in 2007-08. If police authorities deliver efficiency gains and
exercise judicious financial planning, there remains no reason for them
to set excessive increases in police precepts on council tax next year.
The Government's policy in relation to average council tax increases of
less than 5 per cent in England in 2007-08 has been clearly
set out by my honourable friend the Minister for Local Government. The
Government are prepared to take capping action if necessary to deal
with excessive
increases.</p><p><a name="061128101000351"></a><I>Welsh police
authorities</I></p><p><a name="061128101000352"></a>In line with
previous years, we have ensured that Welsh police authorities are
treated in line with English police authorities with respect to the
floor damping mechanism. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary
has provided additional support of &#163;12.9 million in 2007-08 to
ensure that Dyfed-Powys Police Authority, Gwent Police Authority and
North Wales Police Authority receive at least a minimum increase in
grant in line with English authorities. The shortfalls are further
funded by scaling police grant to South Wales Police Authority, which
would otherwise have received a general grant increase of 5.7 per cent
but now receives the equivalent increases to a police authority in
England.</p><p><a name="061128101000353"></a><I>Metropolitan Police
funding</I></p><p><a name="061128101000354"></a>The settlement
provides for the Metropolitan Police Authority to receive &#163;192
million in 2007-08 (+&#163;5m over 2006-07) in general grant to
reflect its unique national and international role as well as the
functions that fall to it by virtue of London being a capital
city.</p><p><a name="061128101000355"></a><I>Special formula
grant</I></p><p><a name="061128101000356"></a>We made it clear in
2006-07 that we wanted to give police authorities more control over
specific grants and consolidated four specific grants
totalling&#163;193 million into a single pot for each
authority.We continue to expect authorities to honour
commitments and agreed policy initiatives. Totals for each police
authority are set out in the <I>Police Grant Report
2007-08</I>.</p><p><a name="061128101000357"></a><I>Specific grants
for police
authorities</I></p><p><a name="061128101000358"></a>Police
authorities will continue to receive extra funding through a number of
specific grants for particular schemes. Targeted grants were introduced
as a direct response to what the police service and the public told us
that they wanted. Total provision for specific grants in 2007-08 is
&#163;1,699 million (table 3).</p>

are:</p><p><a name="061128101000360"></a>Crime fighting fund:
&#163;277 million will again be made available to forces to continue
to support the costs of officers recruited through the crime fighting
fund. In 2007-08, there will be additional flexibility for forces
selected by ACPO to be demonstration sites for workforce modernisation
in order to improve the delivery of services to the
public.</p><p><a name="061128101000361"></a>Police community
support officers (PCSOs): for 2007-08 we will be providing &#163;315
million in total towards the cost of 16,000 PCSOs, to have a dedicated
neighbourhood policing team embedded in every area in England and Wales
by 2008.</p><p><a name="061128101000362"></a>Basic command unit
(BCU) fund: &#163;50 million will again be provided for BCUs. In
England, BCU commanders will again have discretion to pool their
allocations locally in local area agreements where they exist or in the
safer and stronger communities fund where they do
not.</p><p><a name="061128101000363"></a>Initial police learning
and development programme (IPLDP): we will provide the same level of
funding for IPLDP in
2007-08.</p><p><a name="061128101000364"></a><I>Counterterrorism
funding</I></p><p><a name="061128101000365"></a>In January 2006,
the Government announced a single consolidated counterterrorism grant
for the police service, enabling it to increase its counterterrorism
capability and improve effectiveness. In order to achieve this, we
pulled together resources from existing grants, including the provision
for dedicated security posts formerly in general grant. For 2006-07,
this totalled more than &#163;460 million, including an extra
&#163;63 million for local and regional policing and &#163;30
million for the MPS. In 2007-08, we will be increasing this extra
funding to &#163;100 million for local and regional policing and
&#163;45 million for the MPS. To enhance further the counterterrorism
capability of police authorities, we have also made provision of
&#163;25 million within the increase in general grant to police
authorities in 2007-08.</p><p><a name="061128101000366"></a>We have
been working very closely with ACPO on this matter. We see an important
role for ACPO in the management of this grant and for ensuring
coherence, strategic direction and the provision of a nationally
co-ordinated response. We have worked closely with ACPO to ensure that
both this uplift and funding from the new consolidated counterterrorism
grant are used to create a significant increase in the strength of the
police&#146;s counterterrorism capability. Both we and ACPO are
committed to ensuring that the police service both nationally and
regionally has a robust, resilient and effective counterterrorist
capability.</p><p><a name="061128101000367"></a><I>Central spending
on policing</I></p><p><a name="061128101000368"></a>Provision is
made for the costs of organisations supporting policing such as the
National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) and the Serious Organised
Crime Agency (SOCA), as well as scientific and technical support. SOCA
was successfully launched on 1 April 2006. It is a new type of law
enforcement body with workforce strength of 4,200 staff and an initial
budget of &#163;415
million.</p><p><a name="061128101000369"></a>We intend to establish
the NPIA on 1 April 2007. It will be a central resource to help police
forces to improve how they work, and it will be committed to

deliver better services to the public. It will be owned and led by the
police and will introduce a radically different model of police service
leadership, as well as producing greater efficiency, consistency and
clarity of purpose in service delivery. The NPIA will replace the
existing organisations of Centrex and the Police Information Technology
Organisation (PITO). There will also be significant implications for
the work of ACPO, the Home Office and the APA. Its budget will be
announced by 31 January.</p>

have delivered another fair settlement for all police authorities in
England and Wales which will enable them to provide an effective and
efficient policing service. We will expect forces to deliver further
sustained improvements in performance and continue to make further
efficiency gains. We will work closely with the police service over the
coming months and listen carefully to its concerns as we consider the
distribution of resources for the coming three years (2008-09 to
2010-11). Decisions will be announced next

Bicentenary of the
Abolition</h3>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61128-wms0004.htm"/>


<p><a name="061128101000627"></a><b><a name="061128101000651"></a>The
Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My
right honourable friend the Prime Minister (Tony Blair) has made the
following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="061128101000628"></a>The
transatlantic slave trade stands as one of the most inhuman enterprises
in history. At a time when the capitals of Europe and America
championed the enlightenment of man, their merchants were enslaving a
continent. Racism, not the rights of man, drove the horrors of the
triangular trade. Some 12 million were transported, some 3 million
died.</p><p><a name="061128101000629"></a>Slavery&#146;s impact
on Africa, the Caribbean, the Americas and Europe was profound. Britain
was the first country to abolish the trade. As we approach the
commemoration for the 200th anniversary of that abolition, it is only
right that we also recognise the active role that Britain played until
then in the slave trade. British industry and ports were intimately
intertwined in it. Britain&#146;s rise to global pre-eminence was
partially dependent on a system of colonial slave labour and, as we
recall its abolition, we should also recall our place in its practice.
It is hard to believe that what would now be a crime against humanity
was legal at the time. The bicentenary offers us a chance not just to
say how profoundly shameful the slave trade was and how we condemn its
existence utterly and praise those who fought for its abolition, but
also to express our deep sorrow that it ever happened and that it ever
could have happened, and to rejoice at the different and better times
we live in today.</p><p><a name="061128101000630"></a>The people
who fought against slavery came from all walks of life. They included
slaves and former slaves such as Olaudah Equiano, church leaders and
statesmen such as William Wilberforce, and countless ordinary citizens
who signed petitions, marched, lobbied and prayed for change. The
bicentenary is an opportunity for us all to remember those who were
bought and sold into slavery and those who struggled against its
injustices.</p><p><a name="061128101000631"></a>Community, faith
and cultural organisations, with the support in many cases of the
Heritage Lottery Fund, are already planning events to mark the
bicentenary. The Government, with local authorities, will be playing a
full part. Also, the UK is co-sponsoring a resolution in the UN General
Assembly, put forward by Caribbean countries, which calls for special
commemorative activities to be held by the United Nations to mark the
occasion.</p>



<notus-date day="28" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS89"></a><b>28 Nov 2006 : Column WS89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061128101000632"></a>We also need, while reflecting on the
past, to acknowledge the unspeakable cruelty that persists in the form
of modern-day slavery. Today slavery comes in many guises around the
world&#151;such as bonded labour, forced recruitment of child
soldiers and human trafficking&#151;and at its root are poverty and
social
exclusion.</p><p><a name="061128101000633"></a>We
also need to respond to the problems of Africa and the challenges
facing the African and Caribbean diaspora today. Africa is a place of
great beauty, fantastic diversity and a resilient and talented people
with enormous potential. It is also the only continent getting poorer
and where, in many places, life expectancy is falling. But the world is
now focusing on how we can help Africa to tackle its problems, not
least because of the G8 summit and the Make Poverty History campaign.
Agreement was reached to double aid to Africa by 2010, to write off the
debts of the poorest countries and massively to increase funding to
tackle AIDS and improve healthcare and
education.</p><p><a name="061128101000634"></a>Britain is playing
its full part both through increasing bilateral aid and through
international leadership. The international finance facility for
immunisation, which we have launched, should save5 million
children a year.</p><p><a name="061128101000635"></a>All this is
making a difference. Debt relief is already beginning to flow. It has,
for example, enabled Zambia to scrap charges for healthcare. This is
taking place in partnership with African Governments and their people.
But there is a great deal more to
do.</p><p><a name="061128101000636"></a>At home, the bicentenary is
also an opportunity for us to pause and consider the enormous
contribution today of black African and Caribbean communities to our
nation. Britain is richer in every way&#151;for example, in business,
politics, sport, the arts and science&#151;because of the part played
by these

after the Race Relations Act and the creation of the Commission for
Racial Equality, there are still barriers to overcome before everyone
can make the most of their talents and
potential.</p><p><a name="061128101000637"></a>Across government,
we are investing in tackling inequality in education, health,
employment, housing and the criminal justice system in order to ensure
a future in which everyone can achieve their full
potential.</p><p><a name="061128101000638"></a>This
bicentenary must also be a spur for us to redouble our efforts to stop
human trafficking and all forms of modern slavery. Above all, this
200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade is a chance for
us all to increase understanding of our heritage, celebrate the
richness of our diversity and increase our determination to shape the
world with the values we
share.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="061128101000012"></a>Treasury:

Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent question asking why
the question about ethnic groups in the 2007 census test in England
does not include Ulster-Scots; and why it included Northern Irish. I am
replying in her absence.
[HL211]</p><p><a name="061128115000041"></a>The question asking for
national identity in England includes a category for &#147;Northern
Irish&#148; to reflect user requirements identified through extensive
consultation. The question also includes categories for
&#147;English&#148;, &#147;Welsh&#148;,
&#147;Scottish&#148; and &#147;Irish&#148;. A similar demand
for the recognition of &#147;Ulster-Scots&#148; as an
identity/ethnicity category in England did not emerge from the
consultation and consequently the 2007 test question in England does
not include a specific category, though people who wish to identify
themselves in this way can do so through the write-in response
option.</p><p><a name="061128115000042"></a>The
prime purposes of the 2007 census test is to assess the effect on
response of posting out census forms and including a question on
income, and to assess the feasibility of the major innovations in the
proposed 2011 census design. The topics and questions for the test were
selected on the basis of widespread consultation since the 2001 census
involving local authorities, central government departments and other
users of census data across the UK, but are not necessarily those that
will be included in the census in 2011. The programme of consultation
and testing is continuing and in particular a further consultation
exercise on the ethnicity, identity, language and religion questions
will be launched shortly.</p><p><a name="061128115000043"></a>It is
important to note that space constraints on the census questionnaire
will limit the number of response categories that can be used for each
question.</p><p><a name="061128115000044"></a>It will not be
possible to confirm what questions are to be included in the 2011
census until the consultation and testing programme is complete and
formal approval is given by Parliament in
2010.</p><p><a name="061128115000045"></a>A White Paper setting out

Metropolitan Police will increase the capacity to investigate and
recover the proceeds of money-laundering by politically exposed
persons, through the UK's financial system. Assets will be recovered

before March 2001 by the then Solicitor-General. From the judgment of

belief that, on the facts alleged and found by the jury, the sentence
imposed was unduly lenient&#151;a proposition with which the Court of
Appeal agreed.</p><p><a name="061128115000059"></a>The position on
unduly lenient sentence referrals generally is that the law
officers&#146; consideration of cases is predicated on the basis that
the conviction is safe. Law officers take into account the facts and
circumstances of the case as it was put in the Crown Court and receive
advice on sentence from lawyers involved in the prosecution. Advice on
sentence is also received from experienced specialist barristers not
previously involved in the case, as well as from lawyers in our own
department. A case may not be referred to the Court of Appeal unless a
law officer is satisfied that the sentence imposed was unduly

individual Crown prosecutor, but it was supplemented by guidance for
police officers and prosecutors. The guidance gave examples of
potentially undermining material, including previous convictions or
cautions of a witness, any other information that cast doubt on the
reliability of a witness, or evidence of a motivation for making false
allegations. The guidance stressed that previous convictions for

investors rather than businesses. Inaddition, a number of
companies surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers also would not be eligible
for the featured reliefs on grounds of company size. Therefore, the
Government's assessment is that, although the report is a useful
contribution to the debate on how best to support business and the
importance of awareness, it would be unwise to draw specific
conclusions from
it.</p><p><a name="061128115000194"></a>Research
has shown that government initiatives often take time to get into the
decision-making processes of companies. HM Revenue and Customs uses a
variety of approaches to raise awareness of tax issues, including
information packs, online information, press coverage, simplified
guides, media advertising and working with business support services
and other external groups&#151;for example, the &#147;Working
Together&#148; initiative. The promotion of government initiatives is
also often delivered in partnership with other government departments
and external stakeholders, including business representative
organisations such as the British Chambers of Commerce.</p>

of this. The UK has close contacts with UN agencies working in the
Middle East, including in Lebanon, where we believe the UN has played a
key role in helping to move forward the implementation of UN Security
Council Resolution 1701. We have no reason to doubt their competence or
