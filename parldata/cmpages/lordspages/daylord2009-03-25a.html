They supported a Private Member&#146;s Bill, which will, among other things, facilitate transfers between one type of mutual and another. This has recently been implemented for building societies.</p>

<a name="90325-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="09032542000003"></a>In addition, building societies are eligible for assistance under the Government&#146;s recapitalisation and credit guarantee schemes, and the Banking Act 2009 contains provisions which will help building societies to access liquidity support and ease legislative restrictions on their business.</p>

Is it fair that the mutual societies, which on the whole have conducted themselves in a fairly cautious and risk-free way, should be required to pay such large contributions to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme to make up for the failures of Icelandic banks and similar institutions? Is this consistent with the Government&#146;s support for the mutual societies?</p>

The allocation of constituencies through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme was the subject of consultation and the current arrangement was welcomed by the building society movement. However, it is based on retail deposits and it is recognised that this means that a heavy burden is falling on building societies. The Financial Services Authority is consulting on the proposals for allocation although I do not think that an announcement is imminent.</p>

The demutualisation of building societies, approved, supported and encouraged by the members of those societies, has had regrettable conclusions. I, for one, regret that mutuals are less significant in the financial services sector, both in insurance and in banking, than they were originally. Mutual building societies exhibited a sense of community responsibility, attachment to their geography and, above all else, prudence and responsibility which is so different from the greed and self-serving motivation of those who have led some of our banks which have got into so much difficulty. I deeply regret the fact that the prudence of building societies did not remain in the ascendancy and instead became subservient to those who led our banks so monstrously badly.</p>

If, out of this disastrous affair, which has afflicted a small number of our major banks, some opportunity for promoting mutuality can be identified, I would be the first to endorse it.</p>

I am referring of course to the Presbyterian Mutual Society which, alone among all the financial institutions in trouble in the United Kingdom in recent months, has received no help at all from the Government. I wonder what it is that the Government do not like about it; is it perhaps because it is in Northern Ireland?</p>

Discussions are continuing with the Presbyterian Mutual Society and I am very aware of the concerns that have afflicted that particular society. The Financial Services Authority and the Treasury are in continuing discussions in respect of the Presbyterian. I do not think that it would be appropriate for me to say anything further at this stage.</p>

Why can the Government not come forward with a new proposal? As I understand it, the Government have lent the money. This money is going to be paid back. It will be paid through higher mortgage payments by people who have mortgages with building societies and lower interest payments for people who are depositors

The Financial Services Authority is consulting, and we shall await the outcome of that consultation.

When he looks at this matter again, will he agree that special consideration should apply to judges of the Supreme Court, in that they are the cream of the judiciary and inevitably take time to rise to the top, normally after serving for several years in the High Court and then in the Court of Appeal? Is it not therefore a terrible waste of our most valuable judicial resources to dispose of them after a short stay in the Supreme Court?</p>

However, there are arguments on the other side. We have to try to strike a balance between retaining experience and ensuring the flow of high-quality applicants to the highest judicial office. When we consider this&#151;we consider it all the time&#151;it will be only in relation to Supreme Court justices.</p>

Consequently, if they have to retire at 70, they will serve only 15 years on the Bench and it becomes difficult to get through to the Supreme Court in time to do more than 18 months or two years. Is he also aware that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Carswell, the former Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, was 70 when appointed&#151;he is about to retire&#151;but that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott, was 67? The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, was also 67, I think; if we had lost him as the senior Law Lord, we would have lost a huge amount of jurisprudence.</p>

Of course, there have been many changes to the judicial system since then&#151;many more than I had ever envisaged. This difficulty has shown up particularly in relation to the Supreme Court. The age limit of 70 came in when the Pensions Act became law and, therefore, it applies only to judges who were appointed after that time. In this situation, the quicker one arrives at the Supreme Court, the more likely one is to be cut down by this provision. That is a serious loss of talent. It is difficult to generalise, but those who reach the Supreme Court the quickest will, on the whole, be among the best of the talent available. I hope that this review will happen quickly and will have the outcome for which the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has asked.</p>

Later, in the early 1990s, under I believe the Lord Chancellorship of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, it was reduced to 70.

Of course, this is a totally unbiased House of elders whose average age is about the age that we are talking about. In considering the 1992 scheme of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, will the Minister and his colleagues bear in mind the fact that the supreme courts of Australia, South Africa and New Zealand in the Commonwealth, the supreme court of Ireland outside the Commonwealth and the European Court of Human Rights all have retirement ages of 70, the only exception being Canada, as a result of the imperial Constitution Act 1867? Will he also bear in mind the fact that the scheme established by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, very sensibly provides for a supplementary panel so that one can go beyond 70 and sit until 75? Will he consider whether that is proportionate and fair if one wants to enliven and enrich the Bench and have diversity, rather than simply being ruled by rather old people?</p>

There have been a number of reports on which we are drawing heavily as sources. There was the Amnesty report on 23 February. Our defence attach&#233; in Tel Aviv has carried out an assessment. Once we have arrived at a clear picture of what materiel and equipment was used by the IDF, we will assess again whether any UK-exported parts or equipment were likely to have been involved. If so, we will adjust our export licensing policies accordingly.</p>

Let me add that we do not consider European arms sales to Israel to be the big stick implied. Ninety-five per cent of Israel's defence imports come from the United States. If you add in the gifted element, it comes to 99 per cent. The other 1 per cent indeed comes from the European Union, and the three big providers are Germany, France and Romania. I say that to give us a sense of proportion here. UK arms sales are not a big factor.</p>

The Government very carefully assess the potential privacy impact of any new database system or policy. It is not clear from the report what evidence the authors have used to reach their conclusions or the methodology that they have employed in reaching them. Frankly, there seems to be little real analysis. However, we are never complacent about such issues and, if we find that changes need to be made, we will make them.</p>

Does he not realise that doctors, teachers, youth workers and the public in general have been very worried about these databases? If the Government will not review the legality of their databases, will they at least follow the recommendation in the Rowntree report that those databases should be subjected to an independent review of both their privacy impact and their overall benefits to society?</p>

However, information is fundamental to the delivery of modern public services and public protection because it helps citizens to receive the services to which they are entitled, front-line staff to have the information that they need to do their jobs effectively and public services to be accurate and efficient.

The reason for returning to this issue is not to be stubborn but because I am genuinely puzzled as to why the Government have proceeded with the provisions in all 37 clauses in Part 1 to bring together personnel from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs with those already employed on immigration, to increase the role of both in providing support to the UK Border Agency, which deals with customs and immigration but has no incorporated police element.</p>

<a name="90325-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09032542000064"></a>I understand the need for this legislation, which has clearly been brought about with some speed because the UK Border Agency, which includes personnel from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, is already operating in shadow form. The implementation process of Part 1 must proceed if the moves, which have already been made, are to have any legal force. The cart of opportunism seems to have been put before the horse of coherence.</p>

<a name="90325-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09032542000065"></a>My party gives no ground to anyone in its determination to see that our borders are policed and administered in such a way as to protect our island from terrorism, serious crime, trafficking, drugs and all the other aspects of crime, including unauthorised immigration, which the Minister laid out in his response to the debate in Committee. In this regard, we believe that the powers should be enlarged to extend the remit of the border force to investigate those who may be encouraging illegal immigration and to ensure that those who come here and have no right to remain are removed&#151;something that is singularly lacking under present arrangements and which is surely germane to the control of who is in this country.</p>

<a name="90325-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09032542000066"></a>There is no disagreement between my party and the Government about the need for robust and foolproof measures. There is, however, a mismatch between us on who should be involved in carrying them out. I was grateful in Committee for the almost support of the Liberal Democrats, who tacitly agree that a unified  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_663"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 663</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>border force should be the ultimate goal. Although their ideas may not run along identical tracks to ours, they seem to be somewhat closer to our view than the Government&#146;s. I ask the Government again why this is so. It is abundantly clear from the Minister&#146;s long reply in Committee that huge efforts are having to be made to ensure that the police are working not as an integral part of the border agency but at a tangent to it. The Minister referred to a senior chief constable being a member of the UK Border Agency&#146;s board. He also told us that 280 police officers had been seconded to local immigration teams,</p>
<ul><a name="09032542000192"></a>&#147;up and down our country&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/2/09; col. 213.]</ul>
<p><a name="09032542000161"></a>However, this is a tiny part of what needs to be done in a united and cohesive way.</p>

<a name="90325-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09032542000067"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, conducted a detailed inquiry for David Cameron into the safety and security of our borders. It is a published document of which I am sure the Home Office, if not the Minister, has had sight. Although a little time has passed since it was produced, the noble Lord&#146;s observations remain relevant today. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09032542000193"></a>&#147;failure to take this opportunity to bring all the services involved in securing the border together in a single agency carries several challenges&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90325-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09032542000068"></a>I will not go into all the challenges that the noble Lord mentioned, but it is worth citing a few: the lack of a comprehensive overarching strategy; inefficiency in the sharing of information and the development of intelligence; a focus on narrow issues that have an impact on the work of individual agencies rather than a focus on the overall UK border security effort; and the inefficient use of resources, both human and financial. He concluded in this part of his report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09032542000178"></a>&#147;The creation of a single border agency responsible for all immediate tasks required to secure the borders should provide a positive public perception of the services being provided and improve confidence in the efforts being made to protect national wellbeing, and in the Government&#146;s ability to exercise proper control. Equally important, a more coherent, comprehensive and robust regime should also have a similar effect in terms of deterring criminal activity&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032542000162"></a>I am sure that no one in this House would disagree with him.</p>

<a name="90325-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09032542000069"></a>Although we are not entirely reliant on his conclusions, my party strongly believes that, in the piecemeal reform that is before us again today, the Government have missed the opportunity to bring about a totally coherent system to protect our borders.</p>

<a name="90325-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09032542000070"></a>Finally, my other amendments would require consultation with other bodies before additional functions were included among those listed. They recognise that this is a developing field. Those who want to breach our border controls are constantly devising new ways of doing so. This will never be a static situation.</p>

<a name="90325-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09032542000071"></a>Whether or not we continue this debate in the House today, it will continue largely because of this missed opportunity in the Bill. We have today rushed through provisions against the background of a shadow organisation that has already been set up. The detailed consultation on this should continue. The Government are making a mistake in not ensuring that the border police are the force of our borders but at some stage it will come about. I beg to move.</p>

I hope, as a result of the discussions we had in Committee and the ones we are going to have this afternoon, that that will be the next step in thinking about a unified border force. As the noble Baroness has already said, this was the first amendment that we discussed in Committee and it would be remarkable if anybody had anything radically new to say about it&#151;we spent, I think, an hour and three-quarters debating it and the Minister dealt thoroughly with Clause 1 and gave a general review of how Part 1 will operate. We all agreed that the protection of our borders is of vital national interest; the noble Baroness reiterated this proposition in her speech.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90325-0003.htm"/>


<a name="90325-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09032542000073"></a>The two main themes of the Minister&#146;s response were, first, that the police were already working very closely with the border force at every level and, secondly, that the amendments&#151;both the ones tabled by the Conservatives and ours&#151;left many issues that needed to be resolved. For example, who will be the head of the unified force? Should that person be a chief constable? Who will be responsible for the discipline of the police to be added to the force? Will the IPCC or some other body have jurisdiction over complaints against those officers? Will the police in the unifying force cover protection of the infrastructure of the counterterrorism force and general crime and disorder there? We take a different view from the Conservatives, as I tried to explain in Committee. While we share the long term objective that there should be a unifying force, we look at Part 1 as being an important step towards that ultimate goal. We were encouraged that nowhere in his lengthy remarks did the Minister query that proposition in principle.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09032542000074"></a>Our two main objections to the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment were that some of the functions that the Tories wanted to give their UK border police force went beyond the protection of our borders and the issues involving employers of illegal immigrants and the internal policing of human trafficking, extending into matters that were the result of the failure to protect our borders adequately but were not about present day protection of those borders. As I also mentioned in that debate, there is the vital question of how the unified border force will operate in Scotland, where the police come under the jurisdiction of the Scottish Parliament. From the inquiries that I have made via Scottish Lib Dem colleagues, the matter has

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09032542000075"></a>In our previous debate, the Minister said that the Government intend to pursue a phased approach to the enhancement of our border security. The approach will concentrate on counterterrorism, including joint operations between the police and the border force, and intelligence sharing between them. He referred to measures in the Policing and Crime Bill, which deal in particular with security at airports. I have read Clause 76 of, and Schedule 6 to, that Bill and did not see anything that reads across into the matters with which we are dealing under this Bill. I do not question the Minister&#146;s assurance that there will be close co-ordination between the police and the border force, but it would be interesting to hear more about what he called the &#147;even more practical improvements&#148; that emerged from the conference being held on the same day as our debate, 25 February.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09032542000076"></a>As we see it, the Government are taking the pragmatic view that the Immigration Service and HMRC need time to digest the far-reaching changes that are being imposed in Part 1 and to explore with the police any non-statutory arrangements that can be made for the closer collaboration that is necessary and desirable between them. However, at the same time, they are not ruling out the creation of a unified border force to bring in the police at a later date. If it can be shown that that is the most effective way to protect our borders, that will be the way to go. We accept that challenge and will seek to launch our own study to see how far we can get ACPO and the Association of Police Authorities to agree on what the next step should be. In the mean time, we do not intend to press our amendment to a Division.</p>

The whole attitude is different: it is positive and constructive. Our first proposal in the amendment is for the UK border police force to protect UK borders, which is important. The Conservative amendment first proposes,</p>
<ul><a name="09032542000194"></a>&#147;detecting and removing illegal overstayers&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032542000163"></a>That is a sort of Alf Garnett approach, suggesting a desire to grab headlines, such as &#147;Tories want to see overstayers expelled&#148; and that sort of thing. Our approach is more rational, progressive and constructive. If there is a vote&#151;I do not think that there will be&#151;I would say that the Liberal Democrat amendment is far superior to that of the Conservatives.</p>

I want to comment on the place of the police within a border agency. I spoke on this in Committee on 25 February, when I supported a single all-embracing border agency, as outlined in the Stevens report, to which reference has already been made today. As I said at the time, that would ensure a number of things.  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_666"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 666</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It would ensure that effective counterterrorism measures could be taken. It would confidently allow us to combat other serious and organised crime, and prevent the importation of illegal drugs, illegal weapons and people trafficking. It would try to do quite a lot to prevent smuggling and protect the UK tax base. It would protect us against illegal immigration in all its forms and certainly would address environmental control and protection issues.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09032542000079"></a>Significantly, I said at that time that the Association of Chief Police Officers supports the concept of a single agency, including the police within such a border agency. The Minister challenged that view at cols. 214-15 of the <I>Official Report</I> on 25 February 2009. I repeat today that it is the stated view of ACPO that it supports a single agency, including the police within that body. I checked immediately after the Committee stage and found that I was right. I checked as recently as this morning in a lengthy telephone conversation with the president of ACPO, and nothing has changed between 25 February and today.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09032542000080"></a>I will take your Lordships quickly through the stages to remove any doubt. In the summer of 2007, ACPO asked one of its number, Assistant Chief Constable John Donlon, the national co-ordinator for ports policing, to produce a report, and he did so in the summer of 2007. The report was entitled <I>Border Po</I><I>licing&#151;O</I><I>ptions for </I><I>C</I><I>hange</I>. The options that were investigated ranged from the formation of a fully integrated, single border agency right through to no change at all. The stated objective was for,</p>
<ul><a name="09032542000195"></a>&#147;a single border agency bringing together all agencies operating at the border, including the police, into one truly integrated organisation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032542000081"></a>In November 2007, the Cabinet Office carried out its own border review and published the results. It recommended the UK Border Agency, which ruled out the inclusion of the police. ACPO was anxious to work with the grain of government, against its now stated policy, and was anxious to make the best of the concept of the UK Border Agency, as included in the Bill. In other words, it was going to make the best of an indifferent job. I hasten to add that &#147;the best of an indifferent job&#148; are my words, and not ACPO&#146;s.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09032542000082"></a>ACPO then asked John Donlon to produce a second report. He produced that report, entitled <I>Border Policing&#151;T</I><I>he </I><I>N</I><I>ext </I><I>S</I><I>tep</I>, in July 2008. I draw your Lordships&#146; attention to the strapline to that report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09032542000181"></a>&#147;A paper to inform discussion on modernising police structures in the light of Cabinet Office Border Review recommendations&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032542000083"></a>It recommended the establishment of a single national police force to police ports and airports in this country, working alongside and with the newly envisaged UKBA. In other words, there would be a national police force covering the ports and there would be the new UK Border Agency. ACPO deserves praise for that. It was co-operating with the Government, as one would hope, and it was, significantly, willing to give up a good deal of its own operational responsibility, manpower, budgetary base, and so on, to create that force.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09032542000084"></a>It was not a change of preference. Its stated preference is still to espouse the single agency that has been mentioned already by the two noble Lords who have spoken before me. We should declare the aim of having  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_667"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 667</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a single border agency that includes the police. That would, of course take time, step by step, stage by stage. It cannot happen overnight. To fail to declare a single, all-inclusive border agency as an aim is to go off at half cock and is, in many ways, waste of time and effort. It is a scrambled opportunity; it misses a golden opportunity. I certainly support what both previous speakers have said on this subject.</p>

I declare an interest as vice-chairman of the All-Party Group on Trafficking of Women and Children. One reason is that the proposals of both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats would include the UK border police force having the function of preventing and detecting human trafficking, which is to be seen nowhere else&#151;as far as I know&#151;in any policy requirement. I am in no way suggesting that the police around the country do not do their best, but they are doing it in different areas. It is extremely important to have a border police force with the specific duty and responsibility of preventing and detecting human trafficking. For that reason in particular, and for the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord Dear, I support both amendments. Since it looks as though only one will be put to a Division, I will support it.</p>

If the Government could assure us that they will right this particular aspect, one which particularly horrifies us&#151;we know how many trafficked people, particularly women and children, are in the country but not accounted for&#151;by stating it explicitly in the Bill, I might then have second thoughts. However, I have listened carefully to my noble friend Lord Dear and have considerable sympathy with his view. I look forward with hope and expectancy to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

I hope that the Minister will listen to what has been said by the noble and learned Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Dear. Our country needs the tightest regulation and rules, as well as a concerted effort being made by one force. I detect from the Government&#146;s present view that they are being a little wishy-washy about a real border protection force. I therefore support the speakers who have gone before me and I hope that the Minister will be tough and positive about this.</p>

I am in no doubt whatever that everyone in this Chamber believes in strong borders for all the reasons we have given about their importance to the security of this nation.  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_668"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 668</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Moreover, I can assure the noble Viscount, Lord Slim, that we are not in the least bit wishy-washy; far from it. Indeed, we are being forceful in establishing the border arrangements, and the basis on which we are going forward is an indication of that.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09032542000089"></a>We discussed the noble Baroness&#146;s proposals at length in Committee, when I had to go through a whole raft of clause stand part Motions which I have to admit was rather over-long. I set out then the reasons I felt that we are going in the right direction and that the proposals in the amendments were not the right approach. I have to reiterate those reasons. We are not at all clear about exactly what is meant when talking about a single police border force, and the sheer complexity of it would be great. The noble Baroness referred to the complicated arrangements set out in the Bill to form the border force we have proposed. When you are in government and trying to make something work both administratively and operationally, it is a highly complex exercise. Just to say in loose terms, &#147;Let&#146;s have a border police force and shove them in with it&#148;, begs certain questions. What are the functions, who should be put into the force, who should the leadership of the organisation be&#151;a police officer or a civil servant?&#151;to whom would it be accountable, issues of devolution and huge issues of funding&#151;would it require top-slicing and how would it be done? These are extremely complicated and difficult questions.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09032542000090"></a>This was looked at in the Cabinet Office report, <I>Security in a Global </I><I>Hu</I><I>b</I>, to try and deliver practical improvements to border security as a result of the attacks in 2007. Having looked at the complexities and difficulties, the Cabinet Office decided that having a single border police force was not the way ahead at the time. It did reach that decision because it would have been happy with something less good, but because there are real and practical ways of going about these things. Certainly, what we are doing is practical and will work. We have a responsibility and a duty to back up our policy proposals with well-thought-through provisions, which these are. I know that the noble Baroness seemed to think that they were a bit rushed, but they are not. For a Government, we are moving quickly, but we are not rushing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09032542000091"></a>Indeed, we already have the border force in place and working to some rather ad hoc rules, with work-arounds&#151;that is not the way to do it&#151;to achieve what we are saying we want to do. We need to get it on a proper basis; that is why the provisions in Part 1 of the Bill provide the necessary legal framework to build on the earlier successes of our border force and ensure that the officers and staff have the powers that they need to do their job effectively in the modern world. The measures in Part 1 complete the job of laying the foundations, where we have already started that work.</p>

I explained why we have not left this to later legislation; we want to get this in place and working for the security of the nation, so that we can have it fully in

Without these provisions, we will not be able to transfer to the border force officers from HMRC who are currently engaged in customs controls.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09032542000093"></a>I shall say a little more about policing. I have already mentioned that we had a long debate about this before today, and on the proposal to create a new border police force we have really heard nothing to persuade us that our approach is wrong. It is a highly complex thing to do. The judgment within the Cabinet meeting was that this is not the right way to go. The noble Lord, Lord Dear, talked about the ACPO position; all I would say there is that it seems to fluctuate a bit. As the noble Lord made clear, we have talked to ACPO at length. I have talked to a number of people within ACPO&#151;a number of chief constables&#151;and there are various views about this. The APA has a different view. There are a number of different views about this because it is so complex and hard to know exactly how to go ahead.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09032542000094"></a>Our bottom-line judgement remains that we have not seen a compelling case as to the operational benefits to be derived for setting up a new national border police force, when we set them against the potentially significant costs, which are probably real, and a number of drawbacks involved. I do not believe that we have heard noble Lords articulating such a compelling case. It seems superficially attractive, and is easily said, but if you have to be there to implement it would not be quite so straightforward or so clear-cut that it will work as well as has been said.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09032542000095"></a>In Committee, I set out to your Lordships our approach to enhancing significantly the already close working relationship between the police and the border force. The noble Baroness may not have said that it was at arm&#146;s length, but she gave the feeling that it was not close, but it is a very close relationship and works well. We are trying to make it even better. Indeed, ACPO is helping us on this and I am grateful for its work there. We have a very firm platform to build on. I think of the creation, within the past few years, of the police counterterrorism network, and of dedicated regional assets closely linked to local Special Branches, which gives quite a lot of flexibility&#151;particularly to the local chief constables. We will take steps to enhance border policing within that network and to improve standards, consistency and co-ordination. So, I believe that it is good and getting better.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09032542000096"></a>Yesterday, the government strategy known as CONTEST came out. It is the first time that we have set out, in a public document, a detailed account of the history of the threat from international terrorism, the impact that has had on the UK, our understanding of its causes and our view of its likely direction. The current threat of international terrorism remains &#147;severe&#148;, meaning that an attack is highly likely. A key part of the strategy is ensuring the security of our borders. I am delighted, as I have said, that all noble Lords who have spoken absolutely see that, understand it and support it.</p>

We will continue with our e-Borders work and biometric visa programme; we will improve our capacity to detect, deter and intercept radiological material, as I mentioned yesterday. That will all be done by the new border force.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09032542000098"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked what happened at the conference referred to in Committee on 25 February. I was not there myself, but I understand that it was a very useful meeting between senior police, the border force and Home Office officials. They discussed quite a lot of the detail on some of the proposals to improve standards and national co-ordination. There is no doubt that we are improving intelligence sharing. They are going to meet again in April to go the next step further. In a sense, these things are still living; I would never say that never in future would we ever say we are not going to have a border police force. Perhaps conditions will change and we will see things differently but, at the moment, it is not the appropriate thing to do. It is much more important that we achieve what we are achieving here, which is something that is achievable and practical and will absolutely enhance the security of our borders and, therefore, our nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09032542000099"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked about the Policing and Crime Bill. There are provisions to assist with collaboration between police forces in that Bill, which is presently in the other place. It also refers to airport security.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09032542000100"></a>The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, referred to trafficking. I cannot put something in this Bill on that issue, but I absolutely understand the full horror of trafficking and how important it is. Later in the Bill, when it comes to children, this subject will again be mentioned. What I certainly will do is consider whether there is some measure that could be reflected within the new border force, because this is a very high priority for everyone. I shall see what can be done in that sense.</p>

<a name="90325-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09032542000101"></a>We will not or do not intend to create a new national border police force. Our energies and those of the police and the border force are much better put to delivering increased protection through the steps that we have outlined, rather than stretching out towards a rather vaguely articulated position, with all sorts of implications that we do not understand, which may or may not be workable in practice. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It would be interesting to know whether ACPO has any response to the objections that have been ventilated thoroughly, for an hour and a half in Committee and now for 35 minutes on Report, on why this is not the appropriate time to proceed with a unified border force.</p>

Will he kindly place any outcome of that conference in the Library so we can all have a look at it? If we can see that the arrangements that are being made between the police and the border force are such as to promote this ever-closer co-operation, which everybody wants to see, to deal with the menace of trafficking and drug importation and to counter the threat of illegal immigration, we will all have achieved the result that we wanted, even if we have not reached the ultimate goal of a unified force at this stage.

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09032542000111"></a>We had much debate in Committee about the nature of general customs functions under the Bill. General customs functions include not only the functions exercisable in relation to a general customs matter by the commissioners, but also any functions currently exercisable in relation to those matters by officers of HMRC. Under the Bill, these functions will all come to the UK Border Agency.</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09032542000112"></a>Clause 1 defines general customs matters as those in relation to which the commissioners of HMRC have functions other than those that concern revenue and other excepted matters set out in Clause 1(2). However, some non-revenue customs functions are conferred on customs officers directly, rather than via the commissioners. Examples include the ability of officers to detain unsafe goods on import under the Consumer Protection Act 1987, in order to allow for their inspection by a trading standards officer, and the ability of officers to detain ships under the Public Health (Ships) Regulations 1979 on behalf of port health authorities.</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09032542000113"></a>Of course, it could be argued that, by conferring functions on an officer of HMRC, a statute also confers functions on the commissioners, who, by virtue of the provisions in the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, are responsible for directing and supervising the actions of their officers. On balance, though, we think it better to put it beyond doubt that general customs functions include those functions exercisable in relation to general customs matters by the commissioners and by the officers of HMRC, particularly as the term &#147;general customs matter&#148; is also used in Clause 3 to delineate what a designated general customs official may do under the Bill. These amendments simply make it clear that, irrespective of whether a statute confers functions on the commissioners or on their officers, or both, those functions will be fully exercisable by the UK border force in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09032542000114"></a>The purpose of government Amendment 14 is to clarify that the functions of the commissioners of HM Revenue and Customs, which may be exercised concurrently by the Director of Border Revenue under Clause 7(1), do not include those functions that were formerly vested in the commissioners of Inland Revenue.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_673"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 673</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90325-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09032542000115"></a>It is clear from the overall context of the Bill, particularly given that Clause 7 defines customs revenue matters as those relating to taxes for which the former department of HM Customs and Excise was responsible, that we are conferring only customs-related functions on the UK Border Agency in this Bill. However, we need to make it clear that it is only Section 5(2)(b) of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, which deals with the functions formerly exercised by the commissioners for HM Customs and Excise, that applies to the Director of Border Revenue. The remainder of Section 5(2) relates to the former functions of the Inland Revenue. I hope that noble Lords will agree that these amendments, although they sound complicated, assist in clarifying the functions that may be exercised by the Secretary of State and by the Director of Border Revenue.</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09032542000116"></a>If the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, will indulge me, I shall speak to her Amendments 6, 15 and 63 ahead of her. If I understand correctly, the noble Baroness and the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, have tabled a series of amendments that have at their heart the quite legitimate aim of attempting to further clarify exactly which functions will be exercised by the Secretary of State and the Director of Border Revenue respectively. I hope that that is the aim; if I am wrong, I am sure that the noble Baroness will make that clear to me. Unfortunately, the amendments as drafted will not achieve this aim. As I must therefore resist them, I will explain why.</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09032542000117"></a>We can all agree that the drafting of Part 1 is complex. Amendments 6 and 15 both make reference to the schedule that Amendment 63 proposes, so Amendment 63 provides the real substance of these amendments. As your Lordships can see, Amendment 63 contains two lists: one of customs revenue functions and one of general customs functions. The list of general customs functions included in Amendment 63 attempts to expand on the general functions of the Secretary of State set out in Clause 1. However, the list&#151;I acknowledge that it was supplied to the House by the Government&#151;is far from comprehensive. It was precisely because of the difficulty of drafting a comprehensive list that we have taken the approach that we have in the Bill. The list of customs revenue functions, meanwhile, simply repeats what is already set out in Clause 7(2) of the Bill and is therefore unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09032542000118"></a>Clause 1 defines the functions to be exercised by the Secretary of State by reference to those functions of the commissioners that she may not exercise. I can understand why noble Lords have raised concerns about this, but a careful look at Clause 1 will show that these concerns are misplaced. Let me explain the Government&#146;s approach. Taking the functions of HMRC as a whole, we have first excluded all the former Inland Revenue&#146;s functions from the definition of general customs functions. We have then excluded any other revenue, duty or tax matter. We have then excluded the functions of the Paymaster-General given to HMRC and the regulatory role of HMRC in controlling money-transfer businesses. Thus the Secretary of State is left with the non-revenue customs, shipping and enforcement functions of HM Revenue and Customs. These are the  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_674"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 674</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>functions that the commissioners and customs officers exercise in relation to ports and airports, the movement of goods, preventing drug smuggling and the smuggling of other prohibited and restricted goods, and the regulation of trade and shipping.</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09032542000119"></a>We have not set out each and every relevant function in the Bill because the statutes conferring powers and functions on customs officers are many and varied. It would be a very long list and not one that could sensibly be set out in legislation. I shall give some examples. As noble Lords will no doubt be aware, our customs administration is one of the oldest in the world and, as such, many customs functions date back hundreds of years. The Slave Trade Act 1873 gives customs the power to seize a vessel used for the purpose of the slave trade. The Naval Prize Act 1864 provides for customs to take custody of any ship taken as a prize. The Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 gives customs a role in preventing trading with the enemy. The Docking and Nicking of Horses Act 1949&#151;that is clipping their ears, not stealing them, I hasten to add&#151;gives customs a role in preventing the import of horses whose tails have been docked.</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09032542000120"></a>In more modern times, the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 gives customs a role in ensuring ship safety, requiring production of ships&#146; documents and detaining ships if necessary. As a naval officer, I mention in particular a very important power relating to shipping. If a ship is flying improper colours, a customs officer may board the ship and seize and take away the colours. I could go on. The Chemical Weapons Act 1996, the Rabies Act 1974, the Explosives Act 1875 and the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 all give a role to customs in enforcing their provisions. However, I do not believe that there is any need to list them all in the Bill, because all that is left for the Secretary of State, after we have excluded all the revenue and other &#147;inland&#148; work of HMRC, is the appropriate non-revenue customs work. In future, the exercise of all these various functions at ports and airports will be for the border force and not HM Revenue and Customs. I beg to move.</p>

I should like to take a straw poll across the House to determine which noble Lords have understood what the general customs functions and the general revenue functions will be. As he clearly indicated, they are still as opaque as they were originally. I am extremely grateful to him for trying to help us out on the allocation of these functions and their definition, both in the explanation that he gave this afternoon and in the long letter that he sent prior to our laying the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09032542000122"></a>However, as I say, I do not think that anything has taken us much further in obtaining transparency about what these duties are. Without referring to several other pieces of legislation, it is still difficult to know what is involved and what the exact functions covered under the general customs functions are and what is covered under those given to the Director of Border Revenue. As we understand it&#151;the Minister has tried to explain this today&#151;the intention is that, as regards the customs matters, only those functions of HMRC that relate to the importation and exportation

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09032542000123"></a>The Minister rather decried the extremely helpful list that he sent, which seemed to me to delineate carefully what those functions will be and what powers are to be passed across.

When we look for advice from experts outside, as we normally do, we have to remember to send them copies of these letters so that they can see them. There may be a lot of other practitioners who do not get to see the letters but who would enormously value the advice that they give. The suggestion on the table is that perhaps the Minister could consider how they could be placed on the web so that they would be accessible to a much wider audience than simply this House.</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09032542000131"></a>The Minister&#146;s letter referred to Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act, which allows an examining officer to question a person at a port or in the border area, to search the person or his possessions and to take his fingerprints or a DNA sample. This power may be exercised already under the Terrorism Act 2000 by a constable, an immigration officer and a customs officer who is designated for the purpose of Schedule 7 by the Secretary of State and the commissioners. So all immigration officers may conduct an examination under Schedule 7, whether or not they are designated under Clause 3(1), and the Minister could perhaps explain why he singled out this enactment in the letter.</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09032542000132"></a>Perhaps it was because of the discussion that we had on 4 March, when the Minister said that a public consultation was being undertaken on how to bring the S and Marper judgment into effect and that he would put copies of the consultation documents, as well as the interim response to the European Council of Ministers, on the Home Office website. I looked on the Home Office website on Saturday evening and I could not see the material, still less anything about the sensible timescales that the Minister said would be attached to the process. I would be grateful if he would look at that mater.</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09032542000133"></a>The point of raising the matter at this stage is that, as the Minister&#146;s letter underlined, the taking of biometric samples under Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act is not exclusive to the Special Branch, as in the example that I gave in Committee, but can be done by any immigration or designated customs officer. The fingerprints and DNA samples taken by all those officials are being stored indefinitely, contrary to the judgment mentioned. It is surely very unusual, if not totally unprecedented, to launch a public consultation on how to comply with the law, rectifying the violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The samples have to be destroyed once it becomes clear that the person is not subsequently charged with any criminal offence; that is the principle to which we would invite the Minister to agree now. We are not objecting to Schedule 7 itself, but this may be the only opportunity that we get to point out, as the Minister has done so helpfully in his letter, that thousands of officials have the power to make ordinary passengers give them biometric samples, which are still being retained for ever, three and a half months after that was declared unlawful by the highest court in Europe.</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09032542000134"></a>On government Amendment 14, Clause 7 deals with the customs revenue functions of the commissioners, which are exercisable concurrently by the Director of Border Revenue in relation to a customs revenue matter, as defined in subsections (2) and (3). I interrupt myself to say that we had a very encouraging response from the Minister when we suggested that there should be a schedule of definitions attached to the Bill, as in the draft Bill that was published in July 2008. It would be useful to know whether the Minister has given further thought to that since we discussed it offline, as it were. The functions in question are those conferred on the commissioners by,</p>
<ul><a name="09032542000196"></a>&#147;an enactment passed ... before the end of the session&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032542000164"></a>The Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 deals with those functions of the commissioners that had formerly been vested in the commissioners of Inland Revenue. If those functions did not relate to any customs revenue matter, they would not have been covered by this clause, and I am wondering why it is necessary to spell out the provisions of the 2005 Act that are included in Clause 7(7), when they must be sufficiently defined already. Is the 2005 Act the only legislation that deals with HMRC commissioners&#146; powers over both customs revenue matters and other functions, where it might be necessary to make the distinctions between the two?</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09032542000135"></a>The Conservative amendments would insert new definitions of &#147;customs revenue&#148; function and &#147;general customs&#148; function into a schedule, but something has gone wrong with the quotation marks in the amendment. The terms defined should be plural, but no doubt this is how they were in the document circulated by the Minister&#151;they were copied verbatim from a document that perhaps was not drafted very thoroughly. In the Bill, each of the terms is defined as a function exercisable in relation to the corresponding matter, conferred by specified enactments enumerated in the corresponding clause. The matters are then defined separately. The Conservative amendments condense these matters into two lists that are much shorter than the two lists in the Bill&#151;as in the Minister&#146;s letter but, no doubt, at the expense of some precision, as the Minister has said. For example, the customs revenue function list includes all excise duties, while some are purposely excluded in Clause 7(2)(e), such as lottery duty or pool betting duty, presumably because they have nothing to do with our borders.</p>

<a name="90325-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09032542000136"></a>On reading the explanation in the Minister&#146;s letter, I thought that it might be useful to have a Venn diagram showing the overlapping functions and responsibilities. We look forward to seeing the promised partnership agreement between UKBA and HMRC, but we would also welcome a visual presentation that might help to convince us that the complicated structure of Part 1 is unavoidable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09032542000141"></a>The necessity to specify parts of the CRCA 2005 is because we have excluded application of that Act generally, but we need to apply certain provisions of it specifically, such as the example given by the noble Lord relating to the commissioner&#146;s functions.

May I look in <I>Hansard</I>, see exactly what was said and come back when I have taken advice about what I can do?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09032542000145"></a>The union states that it,</p>
<ul><a name="09032542000200"></a>&#147;strongly believes that government policy on the creation of a unified border force militates against effective border security for two main reasons: at present, with three sequential control points there are three opportunities for detection and intelligence purposes, with passenger and vehicular traffic potentially subject to three checks by immigration, police and customs officers at points of entry. Currently these checks are separate and sequential, allowing each organisation the chance to display their skills and experience to tackle trafficking. Our experience has shown that each intervention has yielded intelligence and concrete results in dealing with human trafficking. The proposed reduction to a single primary line may reduce the barriers at the border to one and accordingly reduce the deterrent and interceptive effect of three separate controls&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90325-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09032542000146"></a>The union believes that complementary skills of three trained and experienced groups of specialists&#151;immigration officers, customs officers and police&#151;are not likely to be matched by one officer attempting to fulfil a variety of roles. The PCS&#146;s view is that,</p>
<ul><a name="09032542000201"></a>&#147;effective co-ordination of separate organisations presents a much tougher barrier to human and goods trafficking than the reduced presence and deskilling as a result of a single border force&#148;.</ul>

As she rightly says, we have been approached by the Public and Commercial Services Union, which is concerned about certain aspects of the Bill. As my noble friend said, I want to talk about the power of the Secretary of State to designate officials as set out in the Bill. The union states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09032542000187"></a>&#147;These clauses widen the definition of who is able to carry out immigration and customs functions. If &#145;officials of the Secretary of State&#146; can include people from outside the civil service then contractors could be used to carry out all the functions described in the Bill. In previous legislation powers have been specifically designated to immigration officers, customs officers or the police&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032542000168"></a>The wording in the Bill therefore, according to the union,</p>
<ul><a name="09032542000202"></a>&#147;provides the government with the means to privatise all functions to which the designated powers apply&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032542000169"></a>I and the union have grave concerns about the clause. The union states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09032542000188"></a>&#147;PCS believe that if low paid contract workers, without the benefits of civil service pay and terms and conditions carry out this work then they will be more open to criminal inducements. This argument was accepted by previous Ministers when used by PCS in defence of members&#146; jobs in freight searching, which were under threat of privatisation by the previous Immigration and Nationality Act&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09032542000148"></a>Furthermore, the wording in the clauses states,</p>
<ul><a name="09032542000203"></a>&#147;may be permanent or for a specified period&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032542000170"></a>In other words, you could well have temporary contract workers performing immigration functions. That would not be in the public interest either. Rightly, it would not be in anyone's interest to have those important jobs done by people who are quite inadequately trained, which could very well be the situation if we had temporary contract workers doing those jobs.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09032542000149"></a>Why are the proposals in the Bill? Why is there an attempt to widen the definition? I hope that we will not be told that the job will be done more efficiently through contracting-out or privatisation. I would not find it at all acceptable if it were intended to do it more cheaply. We must not accept such an argument in regard to this very important function. I am sure that that is not the idea behind the wording, but it could well be believed to be by the union, and that is a bad situation.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09032542000152"></a>The amendments would prevent the Secretary of State and the Director of Border Revenue designating immigration officers and other existing officials of the UK Border Agency as customs officials. They would also reduce the agency&#146;s operational flexibility by removing the ability to make and to vary designations according to business needs. I should point out straightaway that Clauses 3 and 4 do not permit the Secretary of State to designate contractors as general customs officials; contractors are not officials of the Secretary of State for the purposes of these provisions. I assure my noble friends that that is not the intention and it will not happen.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09032542000153"></a>By not allowing other designations, however, this would prevent the full integration of customs and immigration functions within the new border force and it would jeopardise delivery of a unified customs primary checkpoint, as recommended by the Cabinet Secretary&#146;s report, <I>Security in a Global Hub</I>. My noble friend talked about not having the same number of barriers. We now have a first line of the border force which is abroad, where the visa agency used to be. We will monitor all of that, and in future there will be e-Borders as well. The second line is the full development of e-Borders, targeting based on PNR and intelligence and the line of people at the port itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09032542000154"></a>Combining immigration and customs powers in the hands of our officials will enable us to improve the breadth and depth of protection at our borders. It will mean greater operational flexibility for the agency to deploy its staff better. Over time staff can be redeployed quickly to manage effectively any change in the nature  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_681"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 681</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or scale of the threats that we face. That is often very intelligence-based. The agency can cover more locations and respond to a greater number of threats. The approach will bring benefits for our staff too. As a consequence of our proposals, some roles will broaden as we develop an integrated approach to the front line, providing opportunities to learn new skills, take on new responsibilities and have wider career paths.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09032542000155"></a>We will be careful to ensure that we do not lose the strong capabilities that exist in HM Revenue and Customs and the former Border and Immigration Agency and UKvisas. Accordingly, in some areas, specialisms will be retained. The UK Border Agency was created because it represents the best model to secure the border. We will aim to retain good practice where it already exists. Rather than dilute the skills, Part 1 will enhance the capabilities of our border force officers.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09032542000156"></a>The new legislation will make sure officers have all the powers, tools, equipment and training that they need to carry out passport and customs controls at the borders. That training will provide them with the instruction and skills appropriate and necessary to allow them to exercise the full range of their functions. I hope that my noble friends will be reassured to know that we have kept trade unions across all affected departments updated as we have taken our proposals forward. The national body, the Council of Civil Service Unions, was consulted by the Cabinet Office review team during the preparation of its report, <I>Security in a Global Hub</I>.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09032542000157"></a>We continue to build on this involvement as a key part of the implementation process and regular meetings are held with the recognised trade unions. Any proposed changes that might impact on jobs or terms and conditions will be subject to full consultation with those unions. We need every man and woman that we have to ensure the safety of our borders. This is certainly not some hidden way of trying to reduce numbers.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09032542000158"></a>In summary, the Bill is intended to increase the flexibility to deploy UKBA officers and officials where they are most needed and to build on existing skills and manpower. We do not envisage reducing the number of personnel at the border in any way. Rather, we intend to deploy people on the basis of intelligence in the most appropriate way, given their skills to meet the threats that we face. The amendments would prevent the flexible deployment of the agency&#146;s staff and would impact on its ability to deliver the broader and deeper coverage of our borders that the Bill is intended to achieve. While I understand exactly where the amendments come from, I hope that I have been able to reassure my noble friends that the unions need have no fear in this area and we will not be employing temporary staff as they are not covered by this. I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It became apparent that, for the moment at least, the chief executive of the UK Border Agency is the person on whom the Secretary of State&#146;s hand has fallen to become the Director of Border Revenue, so we have two senior roles in one. As things stand, none of this needs to be approved by anybody other than the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09032552000003"></a>I made it clear then as now that I have no objection to the person who has been appointed as Director of Border Revenue&#151;she is a distinguished chief executive of the UK Border Agency&#151;but I have concerns with the principle of what is happening. If the Secretary of State is, on each occasion, going to put her hand on the chief executive of the UK Border Agency and make that person the Director of Border Revenue, we ought to make that clear. It ought to be assumed to be part and parcel of the UK Border Agency chief executive&#146;s role and Parliament needs to know about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09032552000004"></a>If that is not going to be the situation and, as time passes, new people are appointed and the Secretary of State no longer thinks that the chief executive of the UK Border Agency should be the Director of Border Revenue, then those two positions part and you have two senior people in two different roles. If that is the situation, one of two things must happen. Either there has to be a full and transparent appointments process under the Nolan principles, whereby people put their names forward as an applicant for this post, whether they are in the department or not, or Parliament has to approve in some way the person who is going to be appointed. There are several ways of doing this. It can be done by a Select Committee, by the Treasury Select Committee, by a report to Parliament or even by appointment by Members of Parliament. This post has a significant job to do controlling the revenue brought into this country or claimed at the ports and it carries a big customs role as well. We need to make it clear that this post cannot for ever more be designated by the Secretary of State. That is the reason for this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

We know, because the Government said so when we dealt with the appointment in Committee, that Lin Homer is going to be appointed, doubling as head of the UKBA and ensuring that the two functions are joined from the top down. The Bill does not actually provide that the chief executive of the UKBA will always be the same person as the Director of Border Revenue. However, as the Minister told us in Committee that the intention was that they would always be one and the same person, I merely wonder why that is not in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09032552000006"></a>At some time in the future when the post becomes vacant&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has hypothesised about this&#151;the Minister said that it would be possible to fill it through an open competition under Civil Service rules on the basis that the chief executive would also be the Director of Border Revenue. His wording indicated that other scenarios might be being contemplated, which may account for the absence of any reference to the accommodation of the post in the Bill. Assuming that it is envisaged that, in some remote circumstance and at some future date, two different individuals could occupy the posts, how would the department&#146;s wider strategic objectives for a unified operation and management command of the UK&#146;s border forces be achieved? We remain uncertain of the future, because this is not in the Bill, and we would like to learn more from the Minister now.</p>

<a name="09032552000007"></a><b><a name="90325-0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09032552000484"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> My Lords, it is anticipated that the Director of Border Revenue and the chief executive of the border force will be the same person. I am not sure why that cannot be in the Bill. I will take that away, because I see no reason why it should not be. That is absolutely the intention, because it provides a single management chain of command&#151;the noble Lord alluded to this, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham&#151;within the border force over customs revenue functions, customs non-revenue functions and immigration functions. I am about to be told why we cannot put this into the Bill&#151;I have been handed some great long sheet&#151;but I do not see why we cannot. I will have another look at this.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09032552000008"></a>The Director of Border Revenue, who has a statutory responsibility for customs revenue functions, will act independently of Ministers. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is absolutely right about that. That is how it should be. However, like Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the Director of Border Revenue will be subject to general directions from the Treasury. It is absolutely appropriate that, in selecting this person, the Home Secretary should fit within the structure of deciding who will come into this job, but she will do so in conjunction with the Treasury, so there will be Treasury agreement at the same time.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09032552000009"></a>The amendment would give Parliament the right of veto over the designation of the director. To require the Bill to state that the designation process is subject to parliamentary approval would be a very unusual and inappropriate step. Under the Bill as it is currently drafted, the Secretary of State is required, before designating a person as director, to obtain the consent of the Treasury, as I said. This reflects the Treasury&#146;s important interest in running the agency. Ultimately,  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_684"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 684</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Secretary of State is also accountable to Parliament both for her choice of director, if she gets it wrong and the director does things wrong, and for the wider running of the border force.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09032552000010"></a>It is interesting that, following the publication of the <I>Governance of Britain</I> White Paper, the Government have agreed that some key public appointments&#151;mainly of ombudsmen, complaint investigators and those with inspection roles&#151;should be subject to pre-appointment Select Committee hearings. The arrangements for these appointments are set out in much more detail in the <I>Governance of Britain</I> White Paper. The aim is to provide further reassurance that government appointments to roles such as those are made on merit and are properly independent of the Executive.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09032552000011"></a>The Government agreed this approach and the list of posts that are suitable for pre-appointment scrutiny with the Liaison Committee. Civil Service posts such as that of the Director of Border Revenue are not suitable for this form of pre-appointment scrutiny, as they are not intended to be independent of the Executive. Indeed, they should not be independent of the Executive. If the post of chief executive of the UK Border Agency were to become vacant, we would fill the post by open competition under Civil Service open-competition rules on the basis that the post holder would also be the Director of Border Revenue, and the Home Secretary would have the final say about whether that person would work for her. The person may, for example, not get on with her.</p>

<a name="90325-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09032552000012"></a>On this basis, I hope the noble Lord and the noble Baroness agree that the amendment is unnecessary. I have not read the two pages of close written stuff, saying why we cannot possibly put it in the Bill. May I go away and have a look at that to talk with the staff? If at all possible, I would like to put it in the Bill but if there is some real reason why I cannot then maybe I could come back to her on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09032552000014"></a>This needs transparency. Even the Minister was talking almost as if these were two roles and two different people. It is clear&#151;and I think the Minister accepts this point&#151;that, if you are going to refer to the position as &#147;the UK Border Agency chief executive (Director of Border Revenue)&#148;, the Secretary of State cannot designate an official in the department to be that person. That does not stand up. It does not make sense. The Secretary of State is not going to designate the UK Border Agency chief executive because that is clearly a matter that is open to at least competition or some form of selection; the Director of the Border Revenue is subject to that as well. It is not subject to a designation. The pretence that this is going to be a different person needs to be resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09032552000015"></a>By the Third Reading, I hope the Minister may have found a way of resolving this unfinished business. We need to make clear who we are talking about rather than try to pretend that this is a separate person

I appreciate that the Director of Border Revenue has responsibilities. They are clear and probably different to, but included in, the position of the chief executive of the UK Border Agency. This is misleading and misleading legislation is bad legislation. Therefore, I hope the Minister will find a way of correcting that by the Bill&#146;s next stage.

When the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, moved her amendment, she talked of some of the fears of the unions about deskilling. This goes to the heart of what we are trying to do with getting a better definition of adequate training in the Bill. The wording that we have chosen to use for this definition is the wording that the Minister himself used to define it in Committee when he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="09032552000163"></a>&#147;For training to be deemed adequate, the definition is that it must provide a designated customs official with all the instruction and skills appropriate and necessary to exercise the customs revenue functions conferred on them fully and properly.&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/2/09; col. 249.]</p>

These are all vastly different. So staff from both functions will do very different work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09032552000019"></a>We were not fully satisfied with the depth of explanation given in Committee. Mention was made of 14 weeks&#146; training. I have reread what was said, but I am still not fully clear on whether that refers to 14 weeks on-the-job training. Clearly, it would not be 14 weeks of nothing but training. It is not clear how much of each day will be spent on training or even what the criteria for successfully passing the training will be. It was said that training will be delivered by trainers accredited by HMRC and that they,</p>
<ul><a name="09032552000183"></a>&#147;will be mentored by the personal training officer network&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/2/09; col. 249.]</ul>
<p><a name="09032552000148"></a>I am surprised at that. I am not sure whether that should be the &#147;personnel&#148; training officer network. I assume that it should be &#147;personnel&#148;, the old-fashioned word for HR. Alternatively, does it mean personal trainers of the type used by celebrities? The interpretation can be slightly ambiguous, which may be due to the spelling on the record. Perhaps the Minister will explain that more fully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09032552000020"></a>For the reasons explained by the Minister when he spoke to the first amendments to the Bill, this is supposed to strengthen the border force and improve it. This afternoon, we have heard some of the fears. In fact, the adequacy of training is exactly what will make this entire exercise a success or not, of which I am sure that the Minister is fully seized. That is why it is worth going back to this issue at this stage. I beg to move.</p>

We had considerable discussion about this in Committee, but I do not think that we entirely clarified what would happen. As I understand it, these new arrangements are already, in some shadow form, being applied by the UK Border Agency. How many staff have already been transferred from HMRC to the UK Border Agency and are shadowing either immigration officers or being taught their roles? Information on training in shadow form should be readily available to tell us what is being done, what is being put forward and how staff are being informed. Presumably, they are half doing the job.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09032552000022"></a>If no staff have been transferred or identified, we need to understand how many will be transferred at any one time and how many will be subject to training immediately. Potentially, there would be a hold-up in starting this process if a training course has to be undertaken. Fourteen weeks is either a very long time or it is not a long time at all. It depends on what has to fit into it and how much &#147;personal&#148; or &#147;personnel&#148; training will have to be given. I do not think that we are clear on how much training is involved. If a person comes from HMRC to be trained as an immigration officer, he or she will have to be trained in all that immigration officers do and an immigration officer will need to be trained in all the revenue aspects of the job.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09032552000023"></a>As the Minister said, the training will be complex because people will have to understand the legislation and, in particular, certain bits of legislation&#151;even the slave trade, perhaps. All that information has to be imparted. I am more worried about the people being transferred than I am about those who will come into the new agency. The people being transferred really need a proper training package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09032552000024"></a>How many people are already within the UK Border Agency on either a shadow or a temporary basis and what sort of training have they had? How many are due to transfer to the agency from HMRC and when, if they have not already done so? If some have been transferred, how many more are to be transferred? How much training has already taken place and will those trained be ready to start whenever these provisions come into effect? I suspect that we are more than three-quarters of the way down the line, as we so often are with legislation. Everything has happened except the final imprimatur, which comes from our having spent an enormous number of days talking about an enormous number of clauses to enable the implementation of what is already half-implemented.</p>

<a name="09032552000025"></a><b><a name="90325-0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09032552000490"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> My Lords, the noble Baronesses have rightly homed in on the important area of training. Clause 12 sets out the supplementary provisions relating to the Director of Border Revenue&#146;s powers to designate customs revenue officials. Before making any such designation, the director must be satisfied that&#151;among other things&#151;the official has completed adequate training. For training to be deemed adequate, it must provide a designated customs official with all the instruction and skills appropriate and necessary to exercise the customs revenue functions conferred upon them fully and properly. Amendment 19 does not, in practice, impose any different requirements from those already imposed by the Bill.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09032552000026"></a>Broadly, training for designated customs officials will mirror that which is given to officers of HM Revenue and Customs who currently exercise customs functions at the border. This current training in HMRC is externally accredited by Edexcel. The training given to those officials will enable them lawfully to discharge all the functions vested in them. The customs training a UK Border Agency frontline official receives will be needs-based and will depend on the official&#146;s role and the customs functions that he or she is to exercise; and whether the official is an officer of HM Revenue and Customs who has transferred to the border force, an immigration officer in the border force, or a new recruit to the border force.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09032552000027"></a>First, I will say a little more about the training of officers of HMRC who have transferred. Some 4,500 officers of HM Revenue and Customs will transfer to the UK Border Agency to continue carrying out customs functions. On transfer, they will lose their status as HM Revenue and Customs officers but will be designated as customs officials. They are already adequately trained and have expertise in exercising customs functions. Current training for officers of HM Revenue and Customs involves guided learning for two weeks, a residential course of six weeks and training at a port or airport for four to six weeks, depending on the location and the skills required.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09032552000028"></a>Existing immigration officers of the UK Border Agency will be trained to exercise customs functions where required for the role that they are undertaking. The training that they receive will depend on the customs functions that they are to carry out. The skills and knowledge covered by existing HMRC training will continue to form the basis of the training for those in the agency who are required to exercise customs

Once adequately trained, immigration officers will be designated as customs officials, subject to them meeting the other designation criteria. Some immigration officers are already trained to carry out questioning for customs purposes at the primary checkpoint and search freight for customs purposes.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09032552000029"></a>Finally, let me say a little about new recruits to the UK Border Agency. A new UK Border Agency training programme for operational staff working at the border is currently under development. For new recruits, the training programme will support the development of the unified border force culture and cover both immigration and customs work, enabling staff to operate across all border controls. The set of skills and knowledge covered by existing HMRC training will continue to form the basis of the training for those in the agency, including new recruits who are required to exercise customs functions. New recruits will undertake an accredited foundation course, including training to enable them to carry out customs functions where this is part of their role. Once adequately trained, new recruits who are to carry out customs functions will be designated as customs officials.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09032552000030"></a>Customs training covers a wide range of areas, including relevant legislation; customs regimes, such as the common agricultural policy; targeting for customs purposes; disclosure-handling of material gathered during criminal investigation; questioning and note-taking; how to arrest and caution; custody, charging and bail procedures; rules of evidence, interviewing, witness statements and giving evidence; customs allowances; dealing with EU and non-EU goods; calculation of duty and VAT; how to take payments, seize or detain goods and vehicles, and issue paperwork; prohibitions and restrictions; recognition of, and how to deal with, controlled drugs and offensive weapons; searching persons, baggage and vehicles; personal safety training; and, for officers working in Scotland, specific training in the working of the Scottish legal system and the different regimes in place there.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09032552000031"></a>The border force also trains its officers to help them deal with difficult situations. The training delivered to officers includes modules on stress awareness, personal safety training, and cultural and customer awareness to assist them in communicating with all passengers in a professional and sensitive manner, and in resolving difficult situations. Following on from their training, policy guidance and education is available for staff dealing with specific stressful posts, and an employee assistance programme is available to support all UK Border Agency members of staff 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. In addition, the border force has arrangements in place to ensure that staff can communicate effectively with non-English speaking passengers arriving in the UK and with those who the agency encounters during the course of its business within the UK.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09032552000032"></a>A number of front-line officers are qualified in a variety of languages and can provide assistance immediately. The UK Border Agency also has access to over 2,000 interpreters via a database who can assist by telephone or attend in person. This service provides access to speakers of over 50 languages.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09032552000033"></a>Some 4,500 HMRC officers will transfer formally to the UK Border Agency on the Bill receiving Royal Assent. They are already trained and skilled on the customs side, and immigration officers&#146; training to take over these functions has already begun. The figures I have at the moment show that 2,600 officers have already completed the training.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09032552000034"></a>On the basis of what I have said, I hope the noble Baroness will agree that the amendment is unnecessary and that she will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

This is a good opportunity to ask the Government to explain exactly how much advance information will have to be provided and how far in advance it must be done.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09032552000038"></a>We have discussed on many occasions the progress of the e-borders system that will enable passengers&#146; details to be held and processed while they pass through an airport, and how identification will be improved by the use of biometrics such as fingerprints and eye scans. However, I do not believe that anyone anticipated that information such as telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, credit card details, addresses of destination and travel information would all be required. We are aware of the advance passenger information that will be collected, but is it really desirable or practical, or within this country&#146;s values about which we hear much spoken, that every journey is to be scrutinised and identified by the provision of information to the authorities, having been collected by the people about whom we are talking?</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09032552000039"></a>Will the Minister tell us today exactly what advance information is going to be required for any journey both now and in the future, for how it is anticipated the information will be held, and how it will affect those who make a last-minute decision to travel somewhere or have business requirements that suddenly arise? The security of our borders and the work of the UK Border Agency are totally germane to this. Private citizens in this country are not accustomed to having their movements subjected to interrogation by the authorities. For generations, citizens have been free to come and go, as our passports say, without let or

Situations change and we appreciate that things may have to be tightened up, but the limitations that the Government, in their enthusiasm to record the details of travellers&#146; movements and make sure that our borders are secure, are proposing to put on our right to roam around the world need to be clear. It may be that the newspaper reports have exaggerated the situation, but if that is so, the Minister has an excellent opportunity to clear it up today. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="09032552000040"></a><b><a name="90325-0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09032552000494"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for tabling this amendment to discuss further this important issue, which was brought up today at Question Time by the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy. I shall look forward to hearing the reply from the Minister. International and EU requirements place plenty of onus at the moment on us to supply passenger list information, and there are adequate international agreements on what information is required, so that each country can check any threat&#151;obviously, a terrorist one in particular but also from serious criminals, and so on, who may be travelling from here to there.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09032552000041"></a>However, the reports that any more advanced travel plans will have to be lodged are worrying. I will briefly give three categories of people for whom that, at least, will be extremely difficult. There are the young and the retired, who can travel week after week; those in their gap years can change their plans at the last minute, while retired people have that same freedom&#151;they are not tied by having to return to work in two weeks and may, on the spur of the moment, go where the weather is better. Why should they need to furnish anything in advance? If they are in the south of Spain and fancy taking the ferry to Morocco, why should they not be able to do that at will?</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09032552000042"></a>There is also last-minute travel, particularly on business. One might have all sorts of reasons for having to travel at the last minute or change one&#146;s plans; partly business or, sometimes, family disasters such as death, et cetera. This even comes down to someone as specific as a yachtsman, whose travel plans depend entirely on the direction of the wind. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us that, when we leave this country, the Government do not have plans to start requiring us to furnish anything other than our first destination. That is the extent of what the Government should require, and then to get to know when we are coming back. They get substantial information at the moment, as I said, from passenger lists, which carriers are required to furnish; beyond that is really a step too far.</p>

However, I want to get something from the Dispatch Box and on the record on this important issue of &#147;without let or hindrance&#148;. Would the Minister confirm that no part of the powers of the Border and Immigration Agency have been devolved, or are intended to be devolved, to any commercial organisation or any other non-governmental body? A particular example would be any employee of BAA.</p>

The report that I saw went even further than that; it seemed to suggest that, eventually, the provision would apply to internal journeys, too, so that if you went from London to Swansea by train you would have to give a note of where you were going and what you were going to do there.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09032552000047"></a>That is such a restriction of the freedom of people in this country that I simply cannot believe that there are people in the Government or the Civil Service, or even the police or security services, who would even dream up such a proposal.

Some of your Lordships may have seen that brilliant German film about the Stasi&#151;I think that it was called &#147;People Like Us&#148;, or something like that&#151;which illustrated the way in which a massive effort is made by a natural bureaucracy to collect a lot of wholly irrelevant information.</p>

We are exploiting modern technology such as e-Borders to make our border even more secure and to target terrorist suspects, known criminals and would-be illegal immigrants before they can do harm, so as to protect the public. To do that, we need to monitor all cross-border travel. That does not mean that we are interested in where law-abiding members of the public go on their holidays, but it is a sad fact that terrorists and criminals make use of the latest technology and we would therefore be negligent if we did not harness the same technology to protect our border. An increased use of technology enables us to target our resources where risks have been identified and facilitate travel where they have not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09032552000051"></a>We must make clear that e-Borders information is information that people give to carriers. We will not ask people for it&#151;the carriers have a liability to provide it. The carriers can only provide the data that they have received from passengers: there is no question of passengers having to complete a form or questionnaire when they travel. The data are provided electronically by the carrier&#151;that is what some of the debate on e-Borders is about. It is not absolutely clear how that will be done, but it will probably be via some form of data transfer. This is travel document information, known as the &#147;passenger name record&#148;. When details crop up of high-risk movements and people whom we have background data on, we will be able to find out more about those people.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09032552000052"></a>E-Borders was successfully trialled through a prototype, Project Semaphore. It did not stop people making short-notice journeys, or several journeys in a row. It was the subject of extensive consultation with the travel industry. The then Prime Minister announced plans for an e-Borders system in September 2004. Up until February 2009, there were 82 million passenger movements, which generated 35,000 alerts. More than 3,000 arrests were made for crimes including murder, rape and assault. The arrests also included a number of counterterrorist interventions. Significant numbers of passengers were properly refused leave to enter the UK on the basis of this information.</p>

<a name="90325-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09032552000053"></a>The e-Borders programme has been subject to appropriate scrutiny both by Parliament and the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office, with which we engage regularly. The code of practice on data-sharing was drawn up in consultation with the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office and is available in the Commons Library. We are due to publish a review of that code shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09032552000054"></a>Clause 14 sets out the purposes for which customs information may be used and disclosed, and by whom. Clause 15 imposes statutory duties of confidentiality in respect of personal customs information. Clause 16 sets out the limited and strictly prescribed exceptions to those duties. The framework ensures that the operational needs of the border force to protect the public from harm are balanced against the right protections for personal customs information. I do not consider that a further restriction, such as that proposed in this amendment, is necessary or appropriate.</p>

There have been some bad hiccups over data protection and IT systems, not just for the Government, but also in the private sector. However, to try to turn back the clock 30 years and pretend that we do not have to use information to protect and administer ourselves is mad. E-Borders will fulfil a very important role. It will not impinge on the privacy of individuals, or their ability to live their lives with no interference from the state. However, it will enable us to get those who intend to do us harm, criminals and those who have no right to come into this great country of ours. On that basis, I call on the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

It would put into the Bill the limits on the length of time that someone may be held in different types of facility by the UK Border Agency. By definition, we are almost definitely talking about either illegal immigrants or somebody who has been apprehended at the border for other reasons. It is necessary that we put this in the Bill because the Government have created this confusing bundle of powers, sharing around customs and revenue functions to different officials, and then adding to that those who will be covered by the PACE provisions. That means that police-type functions are being envisaged for people who are not police. We would like to be clear about who is allowed to do what under these provisions.</p>

<a name="90325-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09032552000066"></a>The Government introduced the new clauses on PACE powers so that we would have them in the Bill. That is well and good, but in Clause 22(4) we have a reference to people who are held in UK Border Agency detention if they are in,</p>
<ul><a name="09032552000184"></a>&#147;an office of the UK Border Agency&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032552000149"></a>I would like to explore how, if at all, an office of the UK Border Agency might be categorised. Plainly it is different from a police cell. The Minister made some efforts, in correspondence and in Committee, to describe what was meant by &#147;short-term&#148; accommodation. In correspondence and in Committee, the Minister endeavoured to describe what is meant by short-term  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_695"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 695</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>accommodation. In Committee, he explained that places that are now designated as short-term holding facilities will, or may, in future be used to detain persons under customs and revenue investigation powers. Do offices of the UK Border Agency fall into that category?</p>

<a name="90325-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09032552000067"></a>My amendment makes it absolutely clear that there is a firm difference between premises partly occupied by the UK Border Agency&#151;that is one of the definitions given in Clause 22(4)&#151;and police cells. I do not want to see any confusion about where people can be held and for how long. If they are held in an office of the UK Border Agency by a member of staff of the UK Border Agency who has rights under PACE to hold people, they can be held there only for three hours to sort the matter out. If they want to hold a person for longer, they will have to find a policeman and put them in a police cell before the three hours are up. Under the UK Borders Act, once they are in a police cell, they can be held for no more than seven days, as the Minister said in his letter. We need to make it absolutely clear that they can actually only be held for five days. The seven days applies only to someone who is to be deported. However, this is an awfully long time to be held in a police cell and we want to be very clear what this is all about.</p>

<a name="90325-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09032552000068"></a>I hope the Minister will accept that these limits not only must be observed but are germane to the Bill and should be clearly stated. If there are rights under the Bill and there are responsibilities under PACE as regards arresting and holding people, it is proper for the relevant measure in the UK Borders Act to be included in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

It also deals with detention in police cells.</p>

<a name="90325-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09032552000070"></a>The Minister's letter of 10 March went into some detail describing the categories of powers exercised by UKBA officials, and now by some 4,500 HMRC officials under the Bill. There is administrative detention under the 1971 Act of a person pending their examination, removal or deportation; detention under the UK Borders Act of a person who may be liable to arrest or who is the subject of an arrest warrant, and detention following arrest by an immigration officer for an offence under the 1971 Act. In addition, customs officials have powers of arrest and detention under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979, which can now be exercised presumably by immigration officers as well.</p>

<a name="90325-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09032552000071"></a>As we understand it, the short-term holding facilities mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, could be used for all three categories, and by the police to detain people pending charges for ordinary criminal offences or terrorist offences committed at a port. This means that the population of the facility could be extremely variable in terms of the seriousness of any offence they may have committed, and the appropriate degree of security that should apply to them.</p>

<a name="90325-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09032552000072"></a>The new definition of a short-term holding facility also allows a person to be detained indefinitely in one of those facilities, as the amended definition read out by the Minister in Committee at col. 287 of <I>Hansard

I think that the maximum length of time that a person can be held in a UKBA office&#151;I am subject to correction if I am wrong&#151;is dealt with in Section 2 of the UK Borders Act 2007. It prescribes that a person may be detained only for three hours. Although there is no reading across to Clause 22 in the Bill, I take it that the powers which are exercised to hold somebody in one of these offices would be the powers in the UK Borders Act. If not, should there not be some reference back to the UK Borders Act so that we know that the three hours applies to both?</p>

<a name="90325-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09032552000073"></a>As regards detention in a police cell, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has put her finger on a problem that exists and which has been extremely troublesome from time to time. Where the police detain someone and hold them in a cell under immigration Act powers, they are normally transferred fairly rapidly to UKBA officials, but delays do occur, and the limit of seven days is exceeded in certain cases. We need to watch this very carefully and take steps under this Bill to see that the rules are properly observed, which they are not always at the moment.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked whether police-type functions are envisaged by border force officers. The answer is yes. They will have powers of arrest, detention and other enforcement powers, as immigration HMRC officers currently do. That is why it is essential to apply PACE to these officers.</p>

<a name="90325-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09032552000075"></a>It might be helpful if I explain that the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Application to Revenue and Customs) Order 2007 currently allows a person to be detained following arrest for a maximum of six hours in a non-designated office of HM Revenue and Customs. This is a reasonable period, and it currently enables HM Revenue and Customs to deal effectively with a significant number of arrested persons at its offices at ports and airports. Cases which may be resolved within a six-hour period are dealt with without the need to transfer arrested persons to custody suites or to police stations.</p>

<a name="90325-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09032552000076"></a>The arrested person is protected by the application of the PACE codes of practice regardless of whether he or she is at an office of HM Revenue and Customs or detained in a designated custody suite or police station. As I have said previously in debating the application of PACE, PACE (Northern Ireland) and the PACE codes to the UK Border Agency, we need to ensure that, in so far as they will in future be investigating and detaining people for the same offences and exercising the same functions at the border as officers of HMRC do currently, designated customs officials of the agency have the same powers and are required to provide the same safeguards.</p>

<a name="90325-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09032552000077"></a>That includes ensuring that the same power as is currently in place to allow a person arrested for a customs offence to be detained at an office of HM Revenue and Customs for six hours is available in respect of future detention of persons by designated customs officials in offices of the UK Border Agency.

I have been absolutely clear all along that the holding power of arrest under PACE was three hours, and the Minister keeps talking about six hours. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has very kindly just handed me the UK Borders Act, which states absolutely clearly:</p>

<p><a name="09032552000151"></a>I had never understood it to be other than three hours. We discussed it as three hours in Committee ad nauseam, and no one corrected us.

That is what I understand, unless I am told otherwise. The three-hour limit is the power referred to specifically in subsection (3) of the UK Borders Act on power to detain at a port. The other power is a standard over-arching power to hold someone for six hours. Section 30 of PACE allows a person to be detained at any HMRC or police office for a period of six hours. The provision in the UK Borders Act is for a different purpose.</p>

Under Section 2 of the UK Borders Act 2007, an immigration officer can detain someone for only three hours, whereas the customs, under the legislation quoted by the Minister, have always been able to detain someone for a period of six hours. In Clause 22(4), we are talking about an office of the UK Border Agency. The noble Lord has just said that because the customs function is to be integrated within the UK Border Agency, it has suddenly acquired the power to detain someone for six hours, when up until the point when the Bill comes into effect, no immigration officer will have been able to detain someone in one of the offices for longer than three hours. We have just learnt that this afternoon, somewhat to my distress. I was involved in the detail of the UK Borders Act proceedings in Committee and on Report and I thought three hours was a perfectly legitimate maximum. To learn that we have suddenly doubled that to six hours is a matter of enormous concern. I hope the Minister will be able to clear up that discrepancy.</p>

It provides that complaints can be made to the IPCC about the conduct of customs and immigration officials, whether they be in the UK or at the juxtaposed controls that we discussed at length in Committee. At that point, we moved a similar amendment to this one, Amendment 37. I refer to col. 293 of the <I>Official Report </I>of 25 February. We have now changed that amendment to recognise the roles that were added to the functions of the IPCC in what is now Clause 30, which I very much welcome, extending the remit of the IPCC to include the private contractors of the UK Borders Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09032552000097"></a>The Minister said then that there was no need to provide power for independent investigation of misconduct by officials at overseas posts because they did not exercise enforcement powers. On juxtaposed controls, the Minister said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="09032552000175"></a>&#147;The Government are considering whether an independent oversight system can be put in place for matters arising at the juxtaposed controls&#148;. &#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/02/09; col. 295.]</p>

<ul><a name="09032552000187"></a>&#147;the IPCC jurisdiction does not cover detention in the escorting of prisoners on probation outward from the UK. An individual being escorted for deportation ... is really for the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. There probably is something here that needs a little more looking into. My Box tells me that this is a Prisons and Probation Ombudsman issue but I will look into it a little more because it looks like something could fall between the cracks and I want to look at it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/02/09; col. 297.]</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09032552000098"></a>The importance of provision for independent investigation of complaints of misconduct by immigration officers and the private contractors at juxtaposed controls and in the course of escorted removals, especially the latter, was highlighted by the <I>Outsourcing Abuse</I> dossier, which is now being investigated by Dame Nuala O&#146;Loan. It would be very useful if the Minister could tell us when it is expected to report, because I dare say that we will not make any progress until we know what the recommendations are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09032552000099"></a>If the Government will not accept the amendment, we need an explanation of how they are going to ensure that misconduct overseas by officials or contractors, particularly at the juxtaposed controls or during escorted removals, can be adequately investigated. We should also like to hear from the Minister about the division of responsibility for investigation of misconduct within the UK between the IPCC and the ombudsman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09032552000100"></a>In Committee, my noble friend Lady Miller raised the distinct situations in Northern Ireland and Scotland, where the IPCC remit does not run. On Scotland, the Minister promised to write to my noble friend, but she still awaits an answer to her question. We understand that there has been some correspondence between the Home Office and the Scottish Government on extending the remit of the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland to match the extended remit to be granted to the IPCC in Clause 30. We should be grateful for a progress report on that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09032552000101"></a>Regarding Northern Ireland, the Minister said that the police ombudsman there will be given statutory powers to look into serious complaints incidents and conduct matters in relation to the exercise of specified enforcement functions by all border staff and contractors. If it is only specified enforcement functions, does that mean a more limited range of matters than in England or Scotland? Will the enforcement of the police ombudsman&#146;s recommendations be the same as if the complaint had been made in one of the other jurisdictions, and to whom will the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland report? In the report on public awareness of the system for complaints to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, it was found that only 11 per cent of respondents said that they could go to the police ombudsman if they had a complaint. I wonder whether the Minister expects that there would be as low a rate with complaints against the UKBA or customs, where intrinsically the complainants are less likely to have knowledge of the ombudsman's powers.</p>

This will apply in respect of the exercise of customs functions by officials of the Secretary of State and the Director of Border Revenue, and the provision of services&#151;other than those involving escorting and detention, which fall under Part 8 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999&#151;relating to the discharge of those customs functions and the immigration and asylum-related enforcement functions referred to in Section 41(1) of the 2006 Act.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09032552000103"></a>As I think the House is aware, oversight of the provision of services involving escorting and detention is already undertaken by the Prison and Probations Ombudsman. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would enable the Secretary of State to make regulations giving the IPCC an oversight role in respect of the functions to which I have referred not only in England and Wales, but in Northern Ireland, Scotland and overseas.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09032552000104"></a>As has been mentioned, in Committee a similar amendment was proposed by the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Roberts of Llandudno. However, there has been no change to our view that any such power to extend the IPCC&#146;s jurisdiction is unnecessary and would be inappropriate. I do not believe that the IPCC would want that.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09032552000105"></a>The Government are committed to securing appropriate, proportionate oversight of all complaints, incidents and conduct matters relating to the UK Border Agency or its contractors, but it has always been and remains our intention that the IPCC should have a role only in relation to the UKBA in England and Wales, just as it does in respect of the police and the other organisations that it oversees.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09032552000106"></a>I should like to explain why we think it is inappropriate to give the Secretary of State power to extend the IPCC&#146;s jurisdiction, as envisaged in the amendment. First, it is not clear that the Government would be able to secure the necessary overseas powers that the IPCC  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_702"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 702</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would need in order to investigate matters in the way envisaged in the amendment. Secondly, if it is intended to propose that the IPCC look at matters overseas involving detention and escorting, this would be a significant creep in the scope of the matters to be overseen by it. Further, Section 41(3) of the Police and Justice Act specifically carves out detention and escorting matters from the IPCC&#146;s remit in view of the existing oversight role given in respect of those matters to the Prison and Probation Ombudsman. We would not want to change that position.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09032552000107"></a>The policy intention behind Section 41 of the Police and Justice Act 2006 was to ensure that the IPCC provided independent oversight of UKBA officials exercising enforcement powers consistent with its oversight of the police and other law enforcement agencies. The amendment would give the IPCC much greater powers in respect of the border force and its contractors than it has in relation to the police and other agencies that it oversees. We feel that that would be inappropriate.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09032552000108"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has made clear that he has concerns about the oversight arrangements for the escorting of immigration detainees overseas. I shall try to explain arrangements in this area. Where a detainee has displayed disruptive behaviour or where we believe he will not comply with removal directions, escorts are provided on the aircraft who are responsible for the detainee on the flight, and remain with detainees until they are handed over in destination countries. Where the detainee is known to have a medical condition, a medical escort is provided if required.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09032552000109"></a>Escorting officers are regularly monitored at the airport up until the point of departure, which tends to be the point at which a detainee becomes disruptive. It is often an extremely difficult and very unpleasant task for them to do. They are permitted to use reasonable force against non-compliant or disruptive detainees, but only where it is considered necessary and as a last resort. They are trained in approved methods of control and restraint including, where appropriate, the application of mechanical restraints such as handcuffs.  Restraints will be used only as long as they are assessed to be necessary. After each job, escorts are required to provide end-of-task reports. These include use-of-force reports if force was employed. All uses of force must be recorded and reported to the contract monitor, who reviews every incident to ensure that the use of force is proportionate and reasonable.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09032552000110"></a>The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman is the correct body to oversee complaints, incidents and conduct matters relating to detention and escorting functions undertaken by UKBA's officers, officials and contractors. In essence the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman investigates deaths in detention and also considers complaints where detainees are not content with the response they receive from the border force or the contractor. This oversight is not restricted by geographical boundaries and therefore the type of escorting work I have just described can be referred to the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman if the complainant is not satisfied with the border force&#146;s handling of their complaint. This oversight ensures that there is suitable scrutiny of matters arising while immigration subjects are detained, escorted and removed from the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09032552000111"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred to the Home Secretary&#146;s appointment of Dame Nuala O&#146;Loan to review independently the border force&#146;s handling of the allegations that appeared in the <I>Independent</I> newspaper&#146;s <I>Outsourcing Abuse</I> dossier. This concerns cases where it was suggested that some of those removed from the United Kingdom had been assaulted by the border force&#146;s staff and its contractors. I am afraid that I cannot give an exact date when the report will come out. Under new arrangements, all allegations of serious misconduct against the border force staff and contractors are now investigated by the professional standards unit, a specially trained team of investigators independent of other business areas. These arrangements were implemented in response to the Complaints Audit Committee&#146;s recommendations for improving the quality of investigations. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman provides a robust oversight of detention complaints where the complainant is dissatisfied with the investigation carried out by UKBA investigators.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09032552000112"></a>UKBA officers and officials are exempt from prosecution under French or Belgian law for acts committed in the UK control zone at juxtaposed controls in those countries where the relevant acts take place in the course of the officers&#146; or officials&#146; duties. Under the terms of the treaties in place for juxtaposed controls, those matters are investigated by the authorities of the host state and all evidence gathered is handed over to the relevant police authorities in the UK for consideration under UK law. All criminal matters that do not relate to the exercise of official functions in a UK control zone are a matter for the French and Belgian authorities and will be processed in accordance with their domestic legislation.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09032552000113"></a>I am sure that your Lordships will also wish to know what oversight there is of contractors at the juxtaposed controls and, in particular, of those who search freight. Section 40 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 provided for and regulated the work of contractors searching freight at border control. The UK border force currently employs Eamus Cork Solutions&#151;ECS&#151;a French security company at juxtaposed controls. Given the limitation on its jurisdiction to England and Wales, the IPCC is not responsible for overseeing those contractors. However, the legislation provides for a Crown servant to be appointed to monitor the exercise of these powers, to inspect the way in which they are exercised and to investigate and report to the Secretary of State any allegations made against a contractor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09032552000117"></a>Turning to oversight of matters arising at the non-juxtaposed overseas locations, such as those where immigration liaison managers, formerly known as airline liaison officers, operate, I can confirm that no enforcement powers are exercised at these locations.</p>

He said that a senior customs official deals with them, but that person cannot be fully independent now that we are talking about the integration of the customs and immigration services. However independently minded the person may be, he is not technically independent of the service that he is investigating. That arrangement must be looked at again to see whether the person who is investigating the complaints could be separated entirely from those whom he is looking into.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09032552000121"></a>The Minister is aware that I have a particular anxiety about the situation with juxtaposed controls, where I do not think that we exercise real oversight. He confirmed that when there was a case of alleged criminal misconduct by any of the UK staff or contractors, it would be for the French or Belgian criminal authorities to look into it. We do not get any knowledge of the reports that are made to the French and Belgian authorities, but this Parliament should be aware of what is going on. We have always said that the juxtaposed controls are not liable to the same kind of parliamentary scrutiny as the services of the immigration authorities in this country. The noble Lord confirmed what we have always feared. There is not the same oversight as if the events took place at Yarl&#146;s Wood or at detention offices at Heathrow or Gatwick. The juxtaposed controls are less open to scrutiny and, as far as I know, there has never been a report laid before your Lordships&#146; House or another place summarising the complaints that have been made to the French or Belgian authorities about the treatment of people detained in those centres.</p>

The Government are seeking to change the routes in this Bill for those applying for various categories of naturalisation and residence in this country. However, we have some issues with some of the planned changes. The people who have faithfully adhered to the current rules and thought that they were firmly established on the road to citizenship should not now have the rug pulled from beneath their feet. They have an expectation of a timescale in which their naturalisation will be fulfilled. Since the last debate in Committee, I have been inundated, as I am sure have other noble Lords, with letters and messages from people in categories that my amendment would help. They have movingly and eloquently expressed their worry, anger and distress that the Government are prepared to muck them about yet again. The Government have already changed the highly skilled migrant programme and applied that retrospectively, even though there is a court case against that, so they must take note of what is happening to those on what used to be called limited leave to remain.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09032552000124"></a>My amendment has two paragraphs. The second deals with persons in the latter stages of the citizenship process who are at the most advanced stage of getting their UK passports and ought to be protected. The Government have recognised this but the debate in Committee did not end as clearly as we had hoped. If provisional arrangements are to be put in place, I would like to hear them explained fully on the Floor of the House. It is imperative that we get protection for those who are on the road.</p>

I deliberately set the period to within 12 months of the commencement because the longer the Government dither and hold on to this, the less certainty people have. We hear so

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09032552000126"></a>We are seeking to prevent retrospectivity. In his letter to us, the noble Lord, Lord Brett, suggested that those who are currently on indefinite leave to remain and those moving into citizenship within the next year or so will not have anything to do under the new citizenship arrangements, but those who are on limited leave to remain will be affected by transitional arrangements. We are seeking to ensure that those who are in the closing stages of limited leave to remain do not get caught up in the transitional arrangements. Many of them have been on the path for three, four or five years and are ready to move on. It seems completely unfair that they should have to go back and start again or even take into account the earned citizenship provisions in this Bill. I beg to move.</p>

It is in the PPO and I recommend that noble Lords have a copy, as it is rather relevant. I am speaking to support this amendment on behalf of the committee. The best way that I can do that is by referring to the report, which is unanimous, all-party and beyond party.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09032552000128"></a>Paragraph 1.50, under the heading &#147;Retrospectivity&#148;, says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="09032552000179"></a>&#147;The Bill does not make clear what the effect of the new provisions will be on those whose applications for citizenship are pending on the date at which the Act comes into force, or on others further down the path to citizenship, such as those with limited leave to remain who have not yet qualified for indefinite leave to remain. There are no transitional arrangements ... We expressed our concern about the injustice done by retrospective changes to rules which affect migrants&#146; eligibility to settle in the UK in our report on the Highly Skilled Migrants Programme&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032552000155"></a>That was in 2007.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="09032552000180"></a>&#147;Those concerns were subsequently upheld by the High Court and the Government was forced by court order to do what we had sought to persuade them to do in Parliament: honour the legitimate expectations of those who had planned their future lives in the UK on the basis of the law as it stood when they came to this country ... The Minister told the House of Lords that &#145;we have yet to make a final decision on how our proposals will impact on people who are already in the immigration system.&#146; He promised to provide a note explaining to whom the transitional arrangements will apply&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032552000156"></a>We put the following in bold, and it is entirely on all fours with the powerful speech that the noble Baroness has just made.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="09032552000181"></a>&#147;We urge the Government not to repeat the unedifying spectacle of riding roughshod over migrants&#146; legitimate expectations of settlement, which undermined many migrants&#146; faith in the UK&#146;s commitment to basic fairness ... We recommend that clear transitional provisions are made which meet the legitimate expectations of those already in the system&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032552000157"></a>That, as I understand it, is the basis of this amendment. It is a matter of great importance in terms of public confidence and we hope that Ministers will feel able to support it and not oppose it.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09032552000130"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, would provide transitional protection, but only for those who have outstanding applications for indefinite leave to remain or for British citizenship at the time of commencement of the provisions in Part 2, so it is more limited than the recommendations of the JCHR. In Committee, at col. 540, the Minister gave an assurance that any application for naturalisation that had been lodged before the earned citizenship provisions came into effect would be treated under existing arrangements. He went on to say that an examination was in progress to determine what transitional arrangements should be made for those in the immigration system who had yet to submit an application for ILR or for naturalisation.</p>

<a name="90325-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09032552000131"></a>I asked the Minister at the time whether the transitional arrangements for all those in the system, including those who had applied for ILR, would take into account the ruling, referred to indirectly by the JCHR and my noble friend, upholding the right of legitimate expectation and against retrospection in the Immigration Rules in the case of HSMP Forum Ltd, which I quoted in Committee. I had not given the Minister prior notice of that question but, now that he has had the opportunity to consider it, can we have it on the record that the transitional arrangements, including those for people whose applications for ILR were lodged prior to commencement, will have full regard to that judgment?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09032552000132"></a>I appreciate that there is a problem regarding persons now on limited leave to remain who need to complete five years&#151;or two in the case of closely related family&#151;before they can apply for ILR. The principle should be that they reach the point where they were entitled to apply for naturalisation no later than they would have done in the absence of this Bill. We would be grateful for an assurance to that effect from the Minister.</p>

We are seeking to resist the amendments. Noble Lords will recall that when we discussed a similar amendment in Committee, I confirmed that any application for naturalisation received by the UKBA before the earned citizenship provisions are implemented, and which remains undecided at point, will be considered under existing arrangements set out in the British Nationality Act 1981. To be clear, the earned citizenship clauses will not apply to those cases. We will set this out in the commencement order giving effect to Part 2 of the Bill. This means that primary legislation is not needed in this area so I hope noble Lords will agree that there is no need to discuss this part of the amendment further. However, I see that noble Lords seek assurances about those with limited leave to enter or remain who also have an application pending for indefinite leave to remain; those who submit an application for limited leave to remain within the 12-month period prior to commencement; and those with limited leave to remain  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_708"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 708</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who are in a category leading to ILR or who have an application pending for asylum/humanitarian protection or a human rights claim whose claim is subsequently granted.</p>

<a name="90325-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09032552000134"></a>I said in Committee that officials were examining what transitional arrangements will apply to those with ILR when earned citizenship becomes law, and I have written to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about that. I hope that he and other noble Lords who are interested in this have seen a copy of the letter and have had a chance to read what I have said about the transitional arrangements that we propose. I will, however, summarise the position. Migrants with a pending application for ILR that is submitted but not decided before the Immigration Rules are changed following commencement of the earned citizenship provisions will have their applications considered under the existing rules. This is also the case for those who have a pending human rights or humanitarian protection claim or who have applied for asylum.</p>

<a name="90325-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09032552000135"></a>Any migrant who already has ILR in the UK will be deemed to have permanent residence status for the purposes of the earned citizenship clauses. They will not need to make an application to be recognised as a permanent resident or pay any sort of fee, and they will continue to have full access to benefits and services, subject to the general eligibility criteria. Migrants with ILR, or those whose pending application for ILR is subsequently successful when the earned citizenship clauses in the Bill are commenced, will be able to apply to be naturalised under existing Section 6 of and Schedule 1 to the British Nationality Act 1981, provided that they apply within a set period after the clauses have been commenced. We have not yet confirmed this period, but it is likely to be for between 18 and 24 months after the clauses have commenced. Such a period is fair, given that the aim behind our proposals is to encourage more people who are here legally to become British citizens, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said.</p>

<a name="90325-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09032552000136"></a>We do not propose that the transitional arrangements should permit those who do not have ILR when the earned citizenship clauses in the Bill are commenced to be able to apply to be naturalised under existing Section 6 of and Schedule 1 to the British Nationality Act 1981 after the changes have taken effect. This means that when the provisions of the Bill come into force, all migrants with limited leave will have to progress through the earned citizenship architecture to obtain British citizenship or permanent residence.</p>

<a name="90325-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09032552000137"></a>The Government will undertake information campaigns between now and the implementation of the earned citizenship proposals to ensure that migrants are aware of the changes and their impact on them. These campaigns will make it clear that the earned citizenship clauses will not be commenced until the beginning of 2010 at the earliest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09032552000138"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester, referred to the JCHR&#146;s ninth report of Session 2008-09, <I>Legislative Scrutiny: Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Bill</I>, which was published very recently. Indeed, the ink is almost still wet, and there has been time to give the report only a cursory glance. The Government will respond to the JCHR&#146;s four major recommendations in due course. The noble Lord asked about retrospection. The

I can confirm, as I already have done, who will be allowed access without reference to the new clauses and who will not. We will therefore have to consider matters, but let me be clear; the consistent position is that a migrant&#146;s only legitimate expectation is to be assessed under the rules in force at the time of their application. The question then is: when does that time clock start? In the light of the JCHR&#146;s report and the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, the sensible thing for us to do is to respond in writing, setting out more clearly the Government&#146;s position. In the mean time, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</p>

Having read the report, the Government may be able to respond at Third Reading if amendments can be tabled then. I know the rules about Third Reading and how careful one must be not to expand it, but frankly it is the only opportunity that the House will have to deal with some of the issues in the report before the Bill becomes law. I say that now simply in the hope that if we cannot deal with the report in next week&#146;s debates on Report, we may have to come back to some of these issues at Third Reading.</p>

If we could return to it next week, it would be helpful to all concerned.</p>

I am extremely grateful, too, for sight of the report that has just been issued. We understood as clearly as we could after the last sitting that the Government were going to allow those with indefinite leave to remain to move to the next stage without any transitional arrangements, and we included the two extra areas in our amendment to seek to have that established in the Bill. That is what the Minister had said.</p>

<a name="90325-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09032552000142"></a>We are less than happy with the Minister&#146;s reply about those with limited leave to remain. We made it quite clear in our amendment that we were looking at those who are in the final stages of limited leave to remain before making their application. The report is extremely important, and it totally underlines what we have been saying: that it is inherently unfair to people who have started on a process to change it suddenly midway. For migrants on higher levels, this will be for the second time, and with a court case against them.</p>

<a name="90325-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09032552000143"></a>I am sure that the Minister&#146;s written reply to the report will be very good, and I am sure that there will be an opportunity to discuss it further, but those in the latter stages of limited leave to remain should not be left in limbo any longer, not knowing what their process is. I therefore beg leave to test the opinion of the House.</p>

I will speak also to the three amendments in my name in this group.</p>

<a name="90325-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09032552000145"></a>As regards Amendment 24, I suggest that Clause 39(2)(c) is unclear and that subsection (11) is not sufficiently explicit. Amendment 24 is designed to assist the integration of genuine recognised refugees and those granted long-term humanitarian protection. Refugees should be helped to integrate. They should be mentioned in the Bill; that will provide practical help to those who have to practise and advise in these matters.</p>

<a name="90325-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09032552000146"></a>Amendment 31 is designed to ensure that time spent by refugees in Britain, prior to a determination of their claims, counts as part of the qualifying period for citizenship. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees does not want to see delayed decisions and the time taken over appeals postponing the grant of citizenship. This is most relevant to the so-called backlog cases where years go by with no decision being reached.</p>

<a name="90325-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09032552000147"></a>Amendment 37 is designed to assist the earliest possible integration into British society of refugees and protected persons. It also removes the requirement to take part in community activities. Refugees, by definition, have usually suffered and have lost their home countries.

My amendment will be helpful to practitioners because it includes the relevant article of the convention in the Bill. I should add that there has been a very small misprint in the text of Amendment 41. After the words &#147;UN Convention on Refugees&#148; the brackets should contain the figures 1951.

At paragraph 1.53 of our report, under the heading &#147;Compatibility with Refugee Convention&#148;, we first refer to introductory matters, including the fact that Article 34 of the refugee convention,</p>
<ul><a name="09032556000022"></a>&#147;requires that States &#145;expedite naturalisation proceedings&#146;&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032556000012"></a>We pointed out that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="09032556000019"></a>&#147;The UNHCR has expressed its concern that the tighter requirements for naturalisation contained in the Bill make it more difficult in practice for refugees and those with humanitarian protection to qualify for naturalisation and may in fact operate to impair their integration ... The Bill would require all refugees and those with humanitarian protection to pass a qualifying period of five years plus an additional probationary citizenship period of three years prior to qualification for naturalisation. The introduction of the probationary citizenship period would therefore increase the total period of time before refugees become eligible for citizenship to eight years. This could be reduced to six years if the person concerned can demonstrate that they have satisfied the active citizenship requirement, but that is also a requirement which refugees may find it difficult to fulfil because of their particular circumstances of having faced persecution or ill-treatment in the past&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032556000013"></a>At paragraph 1.55 the report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="09032556000020"></a>&#147;We are concerned that the effect of certain of the earned citizenship requirements in the Bill is to make it more difficult for refugees and those with humanitarian protection to qualify for naturalisation as a British citizen, contrary to Article 34 of the Refugee Convention. We welcome the fact that the Government appears to have acknowledged that these concerns are legitimate and is considering bringing forward its own amendments. We intend to scrutinise any Government amendments with a view to ensuring that adequate exceptions are made for those qualifying for citizenship through the protection route&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032556000014"></a>I am now coming to the end. We continue:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="09032556000021"></a>&#147;Article 31 of the Refugee Convention prohibits States from imposing penalties on refugees on account of their illegal entry or presence. The Bill makes it a requirement of naturalisation that an applicant must not, at any time in the qualifying period, have been in the UK in breach of immigration laws, which is widely defined. The UNHCR is concerned that penalisation for illegal entry may operate to prolong the period in which refugees or those with humanitarian protection will be able to apply for naturalisation. We agree with this concern ... We recommend that the Bill be amended to ensure that penalisation for illegal entry does not affect the qualifying period for refugees and those with humanitarian protection&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032556000015"></a>I hope that that is all helpful. I am sorry to have to do this in this way, but the report came in so late. I very much hope that the opposition Front Bench, if it comes to power, will recognise the value of this committee, which has become something of a very important addition to both Houses. It is excellent that one can have this debate straight off, with this report being brought to the Minister&#146;s attention and time still for it to be properly considered. The speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and his amendments are part of what I have been trying to put forward.</p>

Over the years, we have prided ourselves on having a door that welcomes people who are in desperate situations. Often, the refugee is the most desperate of all.

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09032556000004"></a>The situation can be desperate, which means that we must be people of realistic compassion who are ready to give such refugees an opportunity to walk the path of citizenship. I would expect the word &#147;humanitarian&#148; from the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. We still must be a people ready to welcome those who are not in circumstances that we, nor they, would desire.

I do not think that these amendments go that far. Amendments 28 to 30 and Amendments 33 and 34 merely provide for discretion. In exceptional circumstances, the period during which the claim was pending may count towards the qualifying period. I hope that the Government will reflect hard on these amendments, which I support, and perhaps move others in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09032556000006"></a>As to penalisation, covered by Amendment 41 to Clause 41, the Minister seemed to imply that any breach of immigration law would only become relevant during the period after an asylum seeker had achieved refugee status. If that is the case, it would be welcome. Many of us are arguing for more than that. We argue that the qualifying period for subsequently recognised refugees should begin at the point of their entry to the UK. Therefore, the Minister would have to give a further assurance that any breach of the law at the time of entry, when a refugee might have been forced to enter illegally&#151;and we have heard countless examples of that&#151;would have taken place before the qualifying period starting at that time. Could the Minister give that reassurance?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09032556000008"></a>Our Amendment 52 is also in this group. It adds to Clause 46, dealing with the meaning of references to being in breach of the immigration laws. Proposed new subsections make it clear that, during a period of awaiting successful determination of a claim for asylum, or human rights protection, the applicant is not in breach of the immigration laws. One would have thought that this was obvious, considering that it had been determined that such a person had a legitimate reason for entering the UK. Section 11(2) of the NIA Act 2002 says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09032556000024"></a>&#147;reference to being &#145;in breach of the immigration laws&#146;&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09032556000017"></a>in the British Nationality Act applies to a person who, </p>
<ul><a name="09032556000025"></a>&#147;does not have leave to enter or remain&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09032556000018"></a>here. That applies to the refugee while he awaits the outcome of his claim. It is therefore necessary to have these subsections inserted in the definition. They will also make it possible for the waiting time to count towards a later citizenship application.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09032556000009"></a>We faintly welcome the Government&#146;s amendments, which allow for discretion to waive the requirement for a person to have qualifying immigration status throughout the qualifying period, where a person&#146;s temporary leave had expired shortly before his or her application for probationary citizenship, or where the person&#146;s probationary citizenship had expired before his or her application for citizenship itself. We also agree that the requirement should be waived for successful asylum seekers, but not only&#151;as the Minister said in Committee&#151;where there is an undue delay in determining a claim, and this delay is not attributable to the claimant.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09032556000010"></a>There are still some 200,000 so-called legacy cases of people who have been in the system for several years. On the Government&#146;s own assertion, those cases are not expected to be cleared until July 2011. The time taken to deal with many current cases is also profoundly unsatisfactory. At the end of 2008, there were 10,800 applications awaiting an initial decision, compared to 6,800 a year earlier, in spite of fewer cases arising in 2008. When decisions are finally reached, these are not reliable, as can be seen from the fact that one in four of the appeals determined in the last quarter of 2008 was successful. In those cases where the applicant&#146;s case was judicially found to be valid, he ought not to be penalised and, at the very least, the time between refusal of the application and the determination of the appeal should count towards the qualifying period. The amendment says that the whole time spent awaiting determination of the claim should be treated as falling within that qualifying period.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09032556000011"></a>Since the general aim of the Government&#146;s naturalisation policy is to promote greater integration, as the noble Lord, Lord Brett, said in Committee, the logical and right solution would be to treat the whole of the time from first application to successful determination as part of the qualifying period. This, again, is referred to in the JCHR report as being part of the UNHCR&#146;s convention, to which we are signatories. In the unlikely event of reaching the target of six

We hope to persuade the Government to give the matter further consideration.</p>

However, as the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, has said, the amendments do not seem to go far enough. I remind the Minister that we are talking here about people to whom the terms &#147;failed&#148; or &#147;bogus&#148; are not applicable. We are talking about people whose cases have been accepted as legitimate. They have been accepted as refugees or in need of humanitarian protection and they are entitled, eventually, to become citizens. The UNHCR is very clear about what we need to do to comply with our international obligations on this matter. I very much hope that the Government will listen to what the UNHCR has been saying to those of us involved since this Bill came before us&#151;and what it continues to say&#151;about what we need to do to comply, which is to treat refugees as the international community expects and as, in the past, this country has always tried to do.</p>

I will start with the JCHR recommendations, which we have had little time to study. I can advise noble Lords that our officials have corresponded recently with the UNHCR and sought to address the points that it raises. Importantly, the Government are clear that we do not believe that our proposed changes are incompatible with Article 34. Although there is nothing in current UK nationality law or our proposal that specifically facilitates the acquisition of nationality by refugees, the residence requirements are not unduly onerous for any applicant. It is possible for refugees to be naturalised. Any decisions not to naturalise are taken in good faith.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09032565000003"></a>Only six years&#146; lawful residence will be required, or just three years if the applicant is married to a British citizen, ensuring that the active citizen condition is met in both cases. It is therefore possible for all refugees to be naturalised if they meet certain statutory criteria and these criteria are justifiable. Furthermore, we do not believe that, by not counting time spent in temporary admission for purposes of naturalisation, the UK is penalising refugees for illegal entry or breaching Article 31 of the 1951 convention. Nothing in the earned citizenship clauses of the Bill imposes criminal sanctions on refugees who enter the UK illegally.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09032565000004"></a>It might be helpful if I explain that the existing requirement not to be in breach of immigration laws, as inserted by Clause 46, is concerned with a person holding the correct sort of status in the UK rather than with commission of offences. In future, as now, any commission of criminal offences will be taken into account in assessing whether an applicant has the separate requirement of good character on the date of the application for naturalisation in Schedule 1 to the BNA 1981. As noble Lords know, we have tabled amendments to ensure that the earned citizenship  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_717"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 717</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clauses provide a discretion to waive the requirement to have had a qualified immigration status for the whole of the qualifying period in relation to applications made under Section 6(1) and (2) of the British Nationality Act. Having this discretion will give the necessary flexibility to the system that we are creating. In the case of refugees, we would usually expect to exercise it where undue delay has occurred in determining an asylum application or where the delay was not attributable to the applicant. I will go into further detail as we go through the amendments.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09032565000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, commented on his discussions with my noble friend Lord West. We gave an assurance that we would table amendments and we have done so. However, his Amendment 41 goes further than the Government&#146;s intent and would allow refugees to count any time spent in the UK since entry, including time spent pending an asylum decision, towards the qualifying period for naturalisation. I would like to develop the point. No doubt noble Lords will have looked at the government amendments tabled in the name of my noble friend Lord West. They ensure that the discretion to waive the requirement for a qualifying immigration status for the whole of the qualifying period is included in the Bill, thus providing the necessary flexibility. I have described where it might be applied, which is where there is a question of undue delay.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09032565000006"></a>As I explained in Committee, we do not feel that allowing those who are subsequently recognised as refugees to automatically count the time spent in the UK pending a decision on their asylum claim towards the qualifying period for naturalisation is the right approach. For example, if we provided an exemption on the face of the Bill specifically for refugees, this would have counterproductive results. First, if a person applied for asylum on arrival in the UK and subsequently absconded and then some months or even years later came to light and was recognised as a refugee, we would have to count the time during which he had absconded towards the qualifying period for naturalisation. It seems wrong to reward an abscondee in this way when others who comply with the process must complete the temporary residence and probationary citizenship stages. It would also go against our aim to increase compliance with the system. Similarly, if an individual failed to comply with the system, by not attending interviews, for example, we would not want that time to count automatically towards the qualifying period.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09032565000007"></a>Another important point is that in asylum cases a decision is based on the prevailing circumstances at the time when the case is actually considered, in addition to taking into account the facts of the claim when it was originally made. For example, the fact that a person may be recognised as a refugee does not always mean that he was so from the start. Events in the country of origin, fresh evidence or fresh case law could mean that the person qualifies as a refugee only after the initial application was made. The amendment would mean that a person who may have had no basis to his claim at the time when it was made could nevertheless count that time pending his decision towards his qualifying period. UKBA is seeking to determine asylum claims as quickly as possible and has made considerable progress; the period of six months was

We do not consider that the time taken to resolve asylum applications represents a significant disadvantage in the majority of cases.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09032565000008"></a>I reassert the Government&#146;s full commitment to meeting their international obligations in respect of those fleeing persecution. However, we do not propose to go as far as permitting any time spent in detention, on temporary admission or on temporary release, or any time spent pending an application for leave to remain in connection with an asylum or human rights claim, to count towards the qualifying period for naturalisation. We will use discretion where this is appropriate.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09032565000009"></a>Amendment 37 would amend the Bill so that the qualifying period for persons granted refugee status or humanitarian protection is fixed at five years. I must also resist this amendment. Under the present system&#151;</p>

Will he explain what incentives are to be built in, under his approach, to encourage the machinery to deal with refugee claims more expeditiously? How is the Home Office going to be made to operate more quickly? How will having a broad discretion make the system work better, rather than lead to yet more arguments and perhaps more litigation and thus slow the whole thing down? In terms only of the efficiency of the machine, I do not understand from what the Minister has said how this is going to encourage officials to get on with it and how it will make the whole thing work better. The more discretion one gives, the more likely it is that there will be more arguments and in the end higher costs, to the detriment of the public interest.</p>

Clearly, if a case such as the one mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, carries on for 18 months through no fault of the applicant, that is a clear case where the exercise of discretion can be used for the purpose of resolving undue delay.</p>

He has given two examples. One was the case where the person absconded before his claim was determined. He then resurfaced and was successful. The other was where the circumstances in the country of origin had changed so that the person became a refugee at some point during the currency of his application being determined. However, those are not normal cases. What we are talking about is the normal run of asylum cases where a person complies with all the rules that are imposed on him, but in the end he has to wait around for a year or 18 months. Is it not then reasonable and in compliance with the passage from the convention quoted by the JCHR for that time to be counted towards his legitimate stay in the country for the purpose of determining his claim?</p>

We are looking at a target of six months, so, if it took 18 months, it is clear that something must have gone wrong. If it is unlikely that it was the fault of the applicant, this would be a case where it would be right to exercise discretion.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09032565000014"></a>The question that arises is what we mean by &#147;undue delay&#148;. That is where guidance will be developed to deal with the circumstances where we should exercise the discretion. In broad terms, discretion will be exercised where undue delay has occurred, which would be a delay that extended significantly beyond the timescale applying to the majority of applicants. If we have a target of six months and we meet it for the vast majority, but for some reason some individuals encounter delays beyond that period, the balance of time beyond the normal period of six months would be the argument for using discretion to allow it to count.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09032565000015"></a>Perhaps I may return to my response to the amendments. The noble Lord has asked me several questions and I should like a little time to think about them and return to them before the end of my remarks. As I said a moment ago, Amendment 37 would make the qualifying period a fixed one of five years. We shall also seek to resist this. Under the present grounds for refugee status or humanitarian protection, someone can qualify for citizenship after a minimum of six years. Our proposed provisions maintain this position and we do not consider that there are strong arguments for reducing the period for those on the protection route.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09032565000016"></a>As has been said, we want refugees to follow the path to citizenship and fulfil the criteria of that path in the same way as other migrants do. We have designed the path so that it encourages migrants to integrate with their local communities. I know that noble Lords share my objective of improving the extent to which migrants integrate into our society. That must be equally true of refugee migrants as it is for those who arrive by other routes. Removing the requirement that refugees must meet the same criteria as other migrants to qualify for citizenship would do nothing to assist their integration, so I must respectfully resist this amendment.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09032565000017"></a>Finally, Amendment 52 would ensure that persons with a pending application for leave to remain, pursuant to an asylum or human rights claim, are not treated as being in the UK in breach of the immigration laws where they go on to be granted leave to remain. The requirement not to be in breach is relevant only to those whose qualifying period has started and, as I said, in the case of those seeking protection the qualifying period will normally start only when they are granted leave on that basis. In those cases where we choose to exercise the new discretion&#151;for a delay, or whatever&#151;to count periods before the date of leave being granted towards the qualifying period, we will also apply discretion to waive the requirement not to be in breach, where that is a necessity.</p>

Therefore, I hope that in moving those amendments we will be able to persuade the noble Lords and the noble Baroness not to press the other amendments.</p>

Therefore, I believe that while there is no resistance in this House to the government amendments, there is some concern about the broader system that we are putting in place. There also seems to be some concern about discretion. However, as I said, guidance will be developed on that. In the mean time, I hope that the normal cases that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred to would be those that we can deal with quite easily&#151;if we are not talking about the exceptions&#151;once we have a clear understanding of what delay we are talking about. We believe that such a delay would be beyond that normally associated with a swift determination of refugee status, which would be six months.</p>

Is that the position? If the discretion is unfettered, that seems inappropriate. If the Minister is saying that there will be guidance that will, in some way, limit and define the discretion, that position is much more acceptable. I am not clear what he is saying on that.</p>

On the argument that exceptional cases do not make good examples and that the more normal application problem is that which the noble Lord outlined&#151;namely, that of undue delay&#151;the answer is: yes, there will be discretion, and guidance will be developed to meet those problems and to assist in a speedy resolution.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09032565000023"></a>I return to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. Government Amendment 30 will ensure that the earned citizenship clause in the Bill allows for discretion to waive the requirement to have the qualifying immigration status for the whole of the qualifying period. Having that discretion will give the flexibility that we believe the system that we are creating needs. In the case of refugees, we would expect to exercise that discretion where we have the undue delay factor, or others, so the guidance will be developed to give officials an understanding of what &#147;undue delay&#148; means and how to apply the discretion. I do not think that I can add anything else.</p>

The main aim is to make the legislation clearer, better structured and easier to use than the source legislation, which is often dense and difficult to follow. The Bill has been produced by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs Tax Law Rewrite Project. It is the first of two Bills that will rewrite corporation tax. The second will be introduced later this year, along with another which will rewrite international and other provisions, some of which apply for the purposes of both income tax and corporation tax. The work follows the success of the project&#146;s previous Acts which rewrote the capital allowances and income tax legislation.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09032565000027"></a>I should explain that the Bill has been certified as a money Bill. It was introduced into Parliament in another place at the beginning of last December. Under the special procedures applying to tax law rewrite Bills, the substantive debate on Second Reading was held in Committee. The Bill then passed to a Joint Committee of the two Houses, where it was considered on 27 January. The Joint Committee included among its members the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and my noble friend Lady Goudie. I am grateful to them for their efforts in scrutinising the Bill, and to Sir Peter Viggers MP who chaired the Committee. The Bill then passed back to the House of Commons for its Third Reading and is now before us for its remaining stages, which the rules say can be taken in one day.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09032565000028"></a>It is beyond the remit of the project to make any significant changes in tax policy, so it takes great care to preserve the effects of the legislation. It can, however, make very minor agreed changes; for example, to remove ambiguity, repeal obsolete material or correct  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_722"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 722</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>minor, unintended anomalies. To ensure that any changes made are within the remit of the project, they are considered during an extensive, detailed and thorough consultation process involving the project&#146;s consultative committee, whose members are drawn from the main tax professional and business representative bodies. The work is overseen by an independent steering committee, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Newton of Braintree, whom I am pleased to see in his place and who will contribute to our proceedings a little later. It includes Members from both Houses, the judiciary, business and consumer groups and the accountancy and legal professions.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09032565000029"></a>The extensive consultation process that I mentioned involved publication for public comment of papers containing almost all the clauses in the Bill, and the Bill was also published in draft form for another round of consultation. In addition, groups of private sector specialists met the project to consider the detail of some of the more complex provisions so that the views of those who are the main users of the legislation were taken fully into account. Throughout the process, proposed minor changes in the law were specifically drawn to the attention of consultees; no minor changes in the law were included in this Bill without the considered approval of both the project&#146;s committees.</p>

<a name="90325-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09032565000030"></a>The Joint Committee of both Houses heard oral evidence from members of the Tax Law Rewrite Project team. It considered and accepted all the government amendments to the Bill, all of which it agreed were of a minor, technical nature. The Joint Committee concluded that the Bill is a welcome clarification of the existing law and, as a result, it will be easier to use and more accessible to Parliament, the judiciary, informed professionals, business people and other users of the legislation. It was satisfied that the changes of the law in the Bill are of very minor significance.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09032565000031"></a>The success of the project in improving the accessibility of the legislation to users has been borne out by independent market research, which showed that in the main, users of rewritten legislation warmly welcomed it. It was seen to be of particular help to those newly entering the profession. Consultees have also been positive about the project&#146;s work.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09032565000032"></a>It would be wrong of me to conclude without paying tribute to everyone who has taken part in this important work. There are many consultees who have given their time and have used their considerable expertise to consider the detail of the rewritten clauses. As with all rewrite Bills, tax professionals who provide expert comment already understand the legislation and, therefore, have the least to gain from the rewritten provisions. Their selfless contribution to the consultation process for the benefit of the wider range of tax professionals who use the legislation is therefore particularly welcome.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09032565000033"></a>We owe a particular debt to the noble Lord, Lord Newton, for his service as chairman of the steering committee and to the members of both the project&#146;s committees for their expert input and guidance. This is an extremely worthwhile project with a track record that shows that it makes our direct tax legislation more modern, clearer and easier to use. The Bill maintains the high standards achieved in the project&#146;s

Nevertheless, I am very privileged to be allowed to speak in this debate.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09032565000035"></a>It is interesting that, although at 821 pages this Bill is the longest ever to appear before the House, the list of speakers at this Second Reading and remaining stages debate is one of the shortest. Indeed, until I somewhat rashly decided to add my name last night, no Back-Bench speaker at all had expressed an interest in participating in this debate. That is rather a pity, because the structure as well as the applicable rate of corporation tax are of great importance in ensuring that our competitive position as a preferred location for foreign companies to set up businesses or establish their European headquarters is protected and enhanced. Unfortunately, the competitive advantage that the United Kingdom formerly enjoyed in terms of comparative corporation tax rates has significantly eroded under the present Government, which made it all the more important that the rewrite of corporation tax legislation should have enhanced our competitive position in its structure and simplicity. This it has singularly failed to do.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09032565000036"></a>It was originally envisaged that the Tax Law Rewrite Project introduced by the Conservative Government in 1996 would make legislation clearer and more user-friendly by adopting consistent terminology, shorter sentences and better use of definitions. However, the areas of overlap between income tax and corporation tax are relatively limited. The rewriting of the overlapping parts, in order to achieve consistency, was justified; but was it worth while rewriting the parts that do not overlap if that rewrite failed to achieve clarity, simplicity and, therefore, international competitiveness? Does the Minister not agree that the Government have missed a trick in failing to use this opportunity to make the UK corporation tax system simpler and more internationally competitive?</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09032565000037"></a>It is generally believed that UK tax law is uncompetitive and overly complex. This hits smaller firms hardest, as they are the least able to afford the enormous cost of obtaining enough external advice. World Bank data show that countries with clearer tax laws collect 6 per cent to 10 per cent more tax revenues than those whose tax laws are complicated and difficult to understand. Is the Minister confident that the expensive resources that the Government committed to this rewrite project, which has achieved so little, were justified? Did the Government consider the alternatives, such as leaving the legislation alone and providing better guidance instead? Unless rewrites achieve benefits in brevity and simplicity, they place a great unwelcome burden on the accounting profession, in that experts who knew the tax law well have to start again and relearn the law.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09032565000038"></a>The absolute rate of corporation tax is more important than the structure, but this Government&#146;s extreme profligacy over a decade has ensured that they are in

It is a pity that, with this 821-page blockbuster Bill, they have also failed to do anything material to improve our position in terms of structure, complexity, clarity or length of our corporation tax law. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

While I shall look forward to the Minister&#146;s no doubt carefully phrased reply to the remarks that have just been made, as a former Minister myself&#151;although not a Treasury Minister&#151;I accept that there is a big difference between clarifying the existing law and simplification, which inevitably involves policy decisions and political consequences in terms of gainers and losers that, frankly, no Government would wish to put into commission to the sort of accelerated procedure that applies to these Bills. Nevertheless, it is fair to acknowledge also&#151;and I am sure that the Minister will&#151;that there is quite a demand among practitioners for the sort of simplification for which my noble friend has called, even though it is not the business of the committee that I chair or of the tax law rewrite project to deliver it.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09032565000040"></a>I shall speak only briefly, not least because, although chair of the steering committee, I was indisposed at the time of the Joint Committee meeting and unable to attend it. I thank the Government, through the Minister, for bringing forward the Bill. I also thank my colleagues on both the steering committee and the consultative committee for their labours, to which the Minister rightly paid tribute, taking into account the volume of paper that they had to wade through. The weight of the documents&#151;even the weight of the Explanatory Memorandum&#151;is such that I have not strained myself by bringing them into the Chamber. I also congratulate the band of dedicated officials led by Dr Steve Batterby, and the parliamentary draftsmen, whose diligence needs no demonstration beyond the size of the papers that we are discussing.

I start by congratulating, and possibly commiserating with, those officials who had to labour so long on such a huge piece of work. I hope that they feel that their efforts have been adequately rewarded, and that the accountancy profession will thank them, sotto voce at least, for a formidable piece of intellectual work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09032565000043"></a>Of course we support the project and the Bill. The problem is that this exercise does not deal with the principal problem facing British tax law, which is that it is far too complicated, to such a point that even  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_725"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 725</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when it is written in clear language, it is extremely difficult for anyone except the most erudite practitioner to have the faintest idea how it applies in many cases. As the Minister is aware, there is a growing sense that we need to do something more fundamental than simply improve the drafting and clarity of this very complicated system.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09032565000044"></a>There are a number of proposals to do just that. Only today, the ACCA has produced a report entitled <I>Is there a way out of the tax labyrinth?</I> My first response was to say, &#147;Given previous history, almost certainly not&#148;. However, the report raises issues, and makes a number of suggestions about how we might simplify tax law, ensuring, importantly, that as we build on the body of the law, we do not unnecessarily complicate it.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09032565000045"></a>The proposal from the ACCA is only one of many. Some elements seem very sensible. Others, such as the suggestion that we should abolish the annual Finance Bill, are ones that very few people in your Lordships&#146; House or another place would think show the way forward. However, the report is a useful contribution to the debate. Another significant contribution is the report undertaken by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, which made proposals for simplifying the law, and looked at how we might make sure that, as we bring forward new law, we avoid some of the mistakes of the past.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09032565000046"></a>There is quite a ferment in this narrow area among people who are worried about the law and are thinking hard about how to improve the system. Of course, there is one area where ferment appears not to have had any impact, and that is in the Government. They have shown absolutely no interest in simplifying the law. When the current Prime Minister was Chancellor, he had a schoolboyishly macho desire to ensure that every Finance Bill was longer than its predecessor. If that was his aim, he was extremely successful, because with every passing year, the Finance Bill got longer, to such an extent that he is personally responsible for adding several thousand pages to the body of tax legislation. That, as a principle and a process, is madness. Much of the law is virtually incomprehensible. It is not accessible to those who are unable to pay expensive accountants to unravel it for them. I would welcome any hope that the Minister can give us that the Government might at least take seriously some of the ideas about procedures and simplification processes, and possibly even come forward with proposals of their own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09032565000052"></a>The real work is of course done by HMRC's tax law rewrite project, overseen by the steering group and assisted by a consultative committee made up of practitioners. The quality and quantity of work involved is amazing, and we admire hugely the work that has gone in to producing this very complex Bill.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09032565000053"></a>The Bill, for all its virtues, does not assist in the reduction of the tax code. Last year we passed India in having the longest tax code, and the net effect of the Bill, even after the repeal of a large amount of existing legislation, will not help us to lose that dubious accolade.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09032565000054"></a>The Minister in another place said that the Bill would reduce costs for taxpayers by &#163;25 million a year. I have no idea on what that figure is based, but I do not believe it. I do not think that the rewrite project needs flimsy calculations of cost savings to justify it. Its main virtue lies in showing how tax legislation can be drafted in simpler and more accessible language, and it sets a standard for all kinds of future legislation. The Minister referred to the fact that it has been welcomed by practitioners, and I am sure that it is helpful. Equally, however, I am not sure that it answers enough of the questions about our tax law-making process. Simplification simply does not go far enough. As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, has already mentioned, my noble and learned friend Lord Howe of Aberavon produced a report last year on making taxes simpler. If my party gets an opportunity, we intend to implement his proposals for an office of tax simplification, which would really pursue the issues that have been spoken about this evening.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09032565000055"></a>My noble and learned friend&#146;s proposals also included Finance Bill clauses being published at the time of the PBR, so that there was a long time for proper scrutiny. He also recommended, rightly, that the skills of your Lordships' House in scrutiny, which are sadly not  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_727"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 727</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>currently allowed to be used in the Finance Bill, would be brought into that process. The convention that has kept our House away from detailed involvement with tax legislation has been to the detriment of the public and keeping us away from the detailed drafting of the Finance Bill is not necessary for the preservation of Commons privilege&#151;we have no intention whatever of challenging that.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09032565000056"></a>The involvement of my noble and learned friend Lord Howe of Aberavon with the movement for simpler taxes goes back a long way. Researching for this evening&#146;s debate, I found reference to a pamphlet published by the Bow Group in 1969 written by my noble and learned friend together with my noble friend Lord Lamont over 40 years ago. Many of their themes in that pamphlet about the need for radical simplification were echoed in the report of the Tax Reform Commission which my noble friend Lord Forsyth produced two years ago.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09032565000057"></a>The need for tax simplification has got much greater over the past 10 years because we have had a decade of hugely complex tax legislation. As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said, the Government have been complacent about the way in which they have over-complicated the tax system and been complacent about its effects. Businesses need many things from the tax system that they have not been given in the past decade. They need long-term stability, certainty and simplicity. The endless tinkering, about-turns and short-termism that has driven the development of tax policy over the past 10 years has, frankly, driven businesses crazy.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09032565000058"></a>The CBI recently published a tax task force report, setting out how uncompetitive our tax system has become. The Government like to quote a 2007 study that said that the UK topped the G7 league for ease of paying tax&#151;if there is such a thing&#151;and for the time taken in compliance. However, as the CBI reminded us, as long as the Government are satisfied with benchmarking the UK against the G7, we will fail to be truly competitive in a global sense.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09032565000059"></a>The highly respected annual global competitiveness report issued by the World Economic Forum shows that we have been slipping down the overall competitiveness league tables. We used to be near the top and now we are not even in the top 10. On tax, we are in the bottom half of the 134 countries surveyed for the extent and effect of tax. Two of the biggest issues which cause problems for those doing business in our country are the tax regime and tax rates. Put simply, we need to reverse that trend and simplification is one route.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09032565000060"></a>I am sure that there will be no simplification from this Government and I regret that. However, perhaps it will not be too long before another Government will have an opportunity to make real change to our tax code. In the mean time, we welcome the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09032565000062"></a>I had presumed that there would be one or two obvious criticisms of the process we have gone through with the Bill. Not a Bill comes before Parliament without being subject to critical scrutiny, but I had not quite expected the principled ferocity of the trenchant attack of the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard. I can only say to him that I accept that there is always an argument for greater simplification, a point amplified by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, who has done so on numerous occasions. However, I cited institutions that have played their part in the consultations on this measure, and the actual process of and clarification involved in the rewrite won widespread support and has been commended for its success. The noble Viscount must give us some credit for the fact that those who must use this legislation benefit from the rewrite, which helps, if not to bring about the level of simplification that he would wish, nevertheless to bring real benefits.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09032565000063"></a>A full impact assessment was published on the benefits and costs of the project&#146;s work. The noble Lord will recognise just how difficult it is to produce quantitative evaluations of effectiveness, but users have been positive about all previous rewrite Acts. We have had positive responses to this legislation indicating that the benefits outweigh the costs, which are about &#163;6 million. We estimate that the monetary benefits of tax-law rewrites for this Bill, although difficult to quantify, are about &#163;25 million. I am of course open to challenge on those statistics, but the noble Lord will give the Government credit for seeking to evaluate benefits and costs, which come down on the plus side.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09032565000064"></a>On simplification, the last Finance Bill was concerned with clarification; a fair number of the clauses set out to do precisely that. Of course, clarification and making something simpler often involve, as the noble Lord, Lord Newton, indicated, a policy choice. The moment one has a policy choice, one is into a different form of legislation&#151;the consideration of the Finance Bill and the length of time that the other place has to devote to that&#151;whereas this Bill can only come before the House as it has, and could only proceed through Parliament as it has, including through the other House. Essentially, there is no intent to change the law with it, merely to simplify it and make it more user-friendly.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09032565000065"></a>I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Newton, said. The noble Baroness backed him to a degree by saying, &#147;Well, what is this comparison with these other countries? We will never get improvements in our taxation when we compare ourselves with the G7&#148;. Compare ourselves with the G7? In terms of the ease of paying taxes and responses to the taxation system, we are at the top of the league. I know that the noble Baroness does not need reminding, but if she disparages the G7, I remind her that that league places Britain as better than Canada, better than Germany, better than the United States, better than France, better than Japan and better than Italy. If the noble Baroness says, &#147;Well, of course, that merely shows that we are uncompetitive&#148;, then we are in a strange global economy.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_729"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 729</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90325-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09032565000066"></a>If the noble Baroness is indicating that some of the new tigers of the financial world have a different position on taxation, that is a debate for another occasion. The Government can establish that in this area, against the criteria we are discussing, we bear favourable comparison with the great economies of the world. Therefore, I do not accept being chided by the noble Baroness on that point. However, I accept the points she made on the necessity of striving continually to make taxation simpler and easier to understand. Of course, we all recognise that the Bill has a minor role in that respect, but one which was created in 1996&#151;I pay tribute to her party for that&#151;before the present Administration entered office. As she rightly said, the chairs of the committee are members of her party, and I pay due regard to that. We are building on those proposals and the Bill is the outcome.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09032565000067"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Newton, indicated in his brief contribution, the Bill is a product of very substantial expert work. The very act of simplifying and seeking to make the legislation more intelligible without raising policy issues is itself a very deft art and we should pay due regard to the skill with which the objectives have been fulfilled by those involved in the rewrite exercise, and to the techniques which they have been obliged to use.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09032565000068"></a>We could not debate finance without an element of controversy entering the discussion, nor could I ever stand at this Dispatch Box opposite the noble Baroness without knowing that she will make one or two pertinent points to which I have to respond. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, was more generous. I understand exactly what he says&#151;if we can translate legislation so that we are able to increase the understanding of ordinary citizens and the owners of small businesses to enable them to look after their affairs a great deal better, we shall make progress. However, business life is complex. We have a complex economy with complex demands and when the public articulate a demand for a change in taxation and politicians seek to respond to that, it often results in a variation of existing measures. It results in qualification and often in extra complexity because in a very real sense people&#146;s lives are becoming more specialised, as are processes and economic operations, and taxation is bound to follow. Oh for the days of William Pitt and the 2p rate of income tax. There are pretty good reasons why we cannot go back 200 years although the noble Lord, Lord Newton, would have found his task a good deal easier if the brief had permitted a return to those halcyon days.</p>

<a name="90325-0011.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09032565000069"></a>I emphasise that we have support for this rewrite measure. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales supports the way in which the measure has been drawn up. It has reservations about particular points but not sufficient to have occasioned great anxiety in the other place or here this evening. The Bill is a product of considerable work. I pay tribute to the work of all those who contributed to the measure. I particularly thank the noble Lord, Lord Newton, for the work that he does with regard to the committee.</p>

The discussion in Committee was quite frustrating, because we spent a lot of time on the name &#147;probationary citizenship&#148; rather than on the principle of what it adds to the citizenship journey. It was clear from the government amendments and the debate in Committee that the Government&#146;s drafting and thinking on the amendments are not as advanced as they ought to be. Given that the Government propose to introduce a draft Bill in October, there is the opportunity to return to these provisions when thinking is a bit more advanced and the proposals are sufficiently developed for us to scrutinise them.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09032565000071"></a>As drafted, probationary citizenship is no more than another name for temporary or limited leave, which is why our amendment seeks to actually call it what it is. As named now, it contributes to the complexity of the Government&#146;s naturalisation proposals. It gives the impression, by renaming it, that something new and different is being proposed, when it is actually the same process by another name. While we are on the matter of the name, it is worth noting that the consultation threw up the fact that the very word &#147;probationary&#148; has negative overtones and makes people tend to think of someone who has done something wrong and is on probation. I am sure that is not the Government&#146;s intention&#151;I am sure that they have heard this view before&#151;but it would be good, if they intend to change the terminology, if they could think of something more positive.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09032565000072"></a>The main reason to question this again is that the debates we had before dinner have shown very clearly that we are talking about the same process but simply renaming it. I would be grateful if the Minister could elucidate what the Government&#146;s thinking is on what this actually adds to the object that we are all trying to achieve, which is to have a much better assimilation programme. We do not feel that simply renaming it in this way is the strongest way of achieving it. I beg to move.</p>

Sometimes it is better just to leave things as they were. The noble Baroness has put it very well. We are trying to do something that makes things better, not just tinker around with the words.</p>

<p><a name="st_180"></a>
<a name="09032565000074"></a><b><a name="90325-0012.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09032565000235"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, I appreciate the contributions by both noble Baronesses. I recall in Committee being upbraided by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for getting into the argument about the name, when he made the point, which has been made again tonight, that it is a question of substance and what it actually means and does. I will try to deal with those principal points of concern in turn.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09032565000075"></a>First, it is argued that &#147;probationary citizenship&#148; is merely further limited leave and as such it should simply be called that, and doing otherwise merely serves to complicate the system. That was, succinctly, the position of the noble Baroness. I agree that probationary citizenship is, legally, a grant of further limited leave to remain. We have made no secret of this. The question is on the second point, where the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said that it is the same system by another name. We do not believe that it is. I strongly disagree with the point that it adds nothing to the system other than to complicate it. We would argue that it supports our aim to make the path to citizenship clearer for migrants and the public. Our proposals set out a much clearer architecture than exists at present, by simplifying the multiplicity of routes to citizenship and replacing them with three clear routes&#151;the work route, the family route and the protection route&#151;and three clear stages: temporary residence, probationary citizenship and British citizenship or permanent residence.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09032565000076"></a>There have been suggestions that another stage is being put in, but that is not so. At present, all migrants must pass through two stages&#151;limited leave, then indefinite leave to remain&#151;to qualify for citizenship. Under the new system, they must still pass through two stages to get to citizenship; namely, temporary residence and probationary citizenship.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09032565000077"></a>A second accusation is that probationary citizenship serves no purpose and offers no benefit to the migrant. That is not correct. The new stage of probationary citizenship marks out that migrants who qualify for it have already started to make a significant step on the road to citizenship; probationary citizens are eligible to naturalise if they meet the requirements. All migrants, whether they intend to stay here for one day or for ever, start off as temporary residents, subject to certain exceptions, such as gateway refugees who get permanent residence on arrival. There are no distinctions between migrants in terms of the leave that they have; they are all temporary residents. But it is not possible for migrants in this first stage to progress directly to citizenship/permanent residence. Only those who make that significant step to probationary citizenship are in the privileged position of being able to naturalise. That hugely significant benefit to the migrant should be acknowledged; it gives them a distinct status and it is our way of acknowledging that step.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09032565000078"></a>I also reject the suggestion that probationary citizenship does not encourage integration. Once a migrant takes that significant step towards citizenship by qualifying   


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_732"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 732</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for probationary citizenship, our aim is to give them a distinct form of leave with a distinct name so that their minds will be focused on the fact that they now have to choose whether and when they wish to apply for citizenship. If they wish to qualify for citizenship, they can do so in a minimum of one year if they do active citizenship. We think that by introducing probationary citizenship, we will encourage migrants to make a conscious choice about their long-term future in the UK.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09032565000079"></a>At the same time, giving this group a distinct type of leave helps to demonstrate to the UK public that these people are making a significant commitment and have advanced on the path to citizenship, thus promoting community cohesion. We want to encourage all migrants who qualify to stay in the UK permanently to take up full British citizenship. We think that this is the best way to facilitate the full integration of a migrant into UK society. Under the old system, in which migrants passed from limited leave to remain to indefinite leave to remain before being eligible for citizenship, there was little incentive to apply for citizenship as the terms of ILR are similar to those of British citizenship. However, by introducing probationary citizenship we are rectifying this. There are significant benefits to the migrants of being a citizen compared with having probationary citizenship and they can qualify for citizenship more quickly than they can permanent residence. As such, by introducing probationary citizenship, we are creating strong incentives for migrants who qualify to stay here permanently to take up full British citizenship and thus integrate more effectively into UK society. I am sure that the whole House supports efforts to improve integration.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09032565000080"></a>Noble Lords will appreciate that what I have stated leads us to the conclusion that the stage should be called &#147;probationary citizenship&#148;. Indeed, as I stated in Committee, I am more than happy to consider other names if someone can suggest a preferable alternative. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that a positive term would be welcome. My judgment of &#147;probation&#148; is not the same as that held by people with a background in law and order. However, at present, I do not think that the phrase &#147;limited leave to remain&#148; improves the proposals, as we would lose the advantages that I have outlined which &#147;probationary citizenship&#148; would attract. For the same reason, I do not think that the suggestion made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, in Committee of &#147;interim leave to remain&#148; is an improvement. We want to make it clear that the migrant has advanced on the path to citizenship and neither suggestion does that. The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, suggested the term &#147;qualifying citizenship&#148; as an alternative. While that has its merits, our concern is that it does not quite capture the essence of the stage, in that, at that point, the migrant is on probation and, if they so wish, can prove that they have earned the right to citizenship.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09032565000081"></a>Therefore, I continue to consider that &#147;probationary citizenship&#148; is the right term for this stage. As I have said, we do not suggest that that is the best phrase. If more positive and more effective names are put forward, we could be persuaded, at a later stage in the Bill, to make a substitution. In the mean time, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This is another attempt to get some clarification about how that term will be interpreted. We extracted from the noble Lord, Lord Brett, an acknowledgement that in the present economic circumstances migrants would often cease to be in employment, but he then added &#147;for short periods&#148;. With 2 million people out of work, and that number rising, it is getting increasingly difficult for somebody who is thrown out of a job through redundancy or through the employer going bankrupt to find a new job, however widely he casts the net. The compelling circumstances may not be of that short a duration and victims of the recession are entitled to know how this discretion will be exercised.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09032565000084"></a>Like so many things in the Bill&#151;we have discussed this before&#151;everything will be left to guidance so that noble Lords and another place will have no say in what the final solution is to be. The noble Lord, Lord Brett, said that he took the point about domestic servants who leave an abusive employer and may not be able to get a reference, and he promised to let us have greater detail on how that problem will be tackled. Although the problem was raised in the context of domestic service, there may well be other circumstances where a reference is unobtainable. A case where the employer goes bankrupt is perhaps the most obvious. We also discussed what happens when the worker loses his job a few weeks before he comes to the end of probationary citizenship and the latitude that would exist when interpreting &#147;continuous employment&#148; in an elastic way that would allow that final period out of work to be overlooked. I presume there is to be guidance on all these questions, but we have to take it on trust that what comes out in the end, weeks after the Bill receives Royal Assent, would have been agreed by Parliament if we had been able to look at it. That is not a satisfactory way to legislate and makes a mockery of the idea that Parliament exercises control over the Executive.</p>

The Government recognise that it is in no one&#146;s interest to refuse people who for the vast majority of the time have been contributing to the UK if they are subject to a relatively brief period of unemployment.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09032565000087"></a>I wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, setting out details of what &#147;continuous employment&#148; means. I hope that he and the other noble Lords have had chance to read that correspondence. I will summarise the position. This requirement is wholly consistent and underlines the Government&#146;s clear policy that migrants who enter via the work route&#151;for example, tiers 1 or 2 of the points-based system&#151;are here to work or to be economically active. This is what the points-based system makes clear.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09032565000088"></a>To respond to the points raised in Committee, I was grateful to the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, for raising the point that &#147;continuous&#148; is not same as &#147;continual&#148; and to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for reading us part of the UNISON briefing which asserted that &#147;continuous employment&#148; is a specific legal term that means that in the majority of cases an employee must be working for the same employer in order to qualify. The question was asked whether continuous employment means continuous employment with one employer. I confirm that it does not. We are absolutely clear that a person can meet the continuous employment requirement in the earned citizenship clauses where they change job, or types of job, or self-employment during the qualifying period. That will not be a disqualification.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09032565000089"></a>Within our guidance,<I></I>which we are continuing to develop taking into account the helpful points raised by noble Lords in Committee, we will explain that a person need not have had the same employer throughout the qualifying period or have remained in the same business where he is self-employed. We will ensure that any definition of continuous employment takes into account the position of certain groups, such as entrepreneurs who may be company directors and therefore not technically employed.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09032565000090"></a>I was asked for further detail on how we exercise discretion to waive the requirements for individuals to have been in continuous employment. I reiterate that we expect that any discretion will be exercised sparingly and in deserving cases. However, as I said, the Government recognise that it is in no one&#146;s interest to refuse people who, for the vast majority of their time here have been contributing economically to the UK. In assessing whether to apply discretion, we would take into account a number of factors, including the person&#146;s overall employment record while in the UK; the length of time for which they have been out of work; and the explanation or evidence offered by the individual. I think that that deals with several points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about redundancy and bankruptcy, which is not necessarily anything that the individual migrant worker has any control over.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09032565000091"></a>A key point raised in Committee was how overseas domestic workers could be affected by the continuous employment requirements. As we confirmed, continuous employment does not need to be with one employer.

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09032565000092"></a>Overseas domestic workers in private households will remain a separate category outside the points-based system, while private servants in diplomatic households are included in the international agreement sub-category of tier 5. So we have two groups: those in domestic diplomatic households, who are covered by an international agreement on tier 5; and a separate category for domestic workers. We are committed to preserving that existing separate route for overseas domestic workers and the protection that it affords; and we will review it as appropriate after two years of operation of the new immigration system. We will also want to allow the anti-trafficking strategy to be properly road-tested.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09032565000093"></a>All overseas domestic workers currently have an avenue to settlement in the UK after five years&#146; continuous employment. Overseas domestic workers in private households will, under requirements for obtaining probationary citizenship in this category, still be able to leave their employer and seek alternative work with another employer.  That continues to enable domestic workers from overseas to remove themselves from abusive situations.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09032565000094"></a>Clause 39(7) gives discretion to waive the requirement to have been in continuous employment.  We will carefully consider the exercise of that discretion, particularly in cases where overseas domestic workers have left their employment due to abuse.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09032565000095"></a>I hope that the assurances that I have given noble Lords will allow the withdrawal of the amendment.</p>

Surely those are precisely the circumstances in which the Minister should have been able to assure us that the discretion would be exercised. I cannot imagine why, if it is proved that a domestic worker was beaten up by the employer and that was the only reason they left, there should be any valid excuse for not using the discretion. I still feel anxious about the way in which the discretion is to be exercised, because there is no indication of how long a person can be without employment before the discretion ceases to be operative.</p>

Even if there was no guarantee that that could be proven, it would be a circumstance in which I would expect a very keen eye to be cast with a view to taking that discretion to a point where it relieved the abused migrant from a situation where they continued to be deprived because of their having left the household.</p>

It is a question of precision.</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09032565000099"></a>I was in the middle of saying that no one who loses their job would be certain whether the Minister would even consider waiving, let alone decide to waive, the requirement. As I said initially, given the economic circumstances at present, it is increasingly difficult for anyone who is thrown out of work to find another employer, particularly in the same category. A person who comes in under a particular tier may be allowed to change employer, but will he have to seek employment within that category? If, for example, he comes in as a tier 1 professional and cannot find a job in his sphere, would he be allowed to take a much more humble job just to be certain that he does not come within the exclusions of the clause?</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09032565000100"></a>Fundamentally, under the rules for the points-based system, a person is required to be and to continue to be in work, so I question the necessity of having such a discretion in the Bill. Would the noble Lord agree that under the points-based system adequate safeguards already exist to make sure that a person remains in work, so we should not try to gloss it in the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="09032565000101"></a><b><a name="90325-0012.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09032565000243"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, I am slightly surprised by those last comments because I thought that the concerns of noble Lords in Committee was that when considering continuous employment we should not be so rigid as to reject someone whose unemployment came from a situation beyond their control for a relatively short period. The noble Lord raised the question of how the condition interacts with the employment requirements under the points-based system. I recognise that migrants on work routes will have further conditions attached to their leave, such as not having recourse to public funds. Migrants granted leave under tier 2 may have that leave curtailed if they are out of employment for more than 60 days. I do not think that that makes the continuous employment requirement unnecessary. It is wholly consistent with, and underlines, the Government&#146;s clear policy that migrants are here to work and to be economically active. By having a discretion, we can apply a human face, which we are often accused of not applying when coming up against rules and hard cases. I had hoped that what I was saying about continuous employment not being with the same employer would be more encouraging to the noble Lord than it has been.</p>

The noble Lord said that a person in tier 2 can be out of work for up to 60 days under the employment rules. Is he now saying that when Ministers come to exercise their discretion under the Bill, they will always excuse someone who has been out of work for as much as 60 days, and that the discretion only comes into play if you exceed the limits in the existing tier requirements?</p>

<a name="90325-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09032565000103"></a>Can he also deal with my other question that if a person is in, say tier 2&#151;it does not matter which tier&#151;and he cannot get a job in the category under which he came in, would he be permitted to accept less professional or less advanced work without forfeiting his right to apply for citizenship at the end of the period?</p>

I was trying to signal that in the current employment situation, which the noble Lord used as background at the start of his contribution, there would be hope that the discretion which we believe is necessary would be exercised sympathetically for the people who had lost their jobs through no fault of their own. That is the intention. For those who have contributed economically, which can be demonstrated over a number of years prior to their losing their positions, it is not our intention to deny them the chance of continuing their valuable contribution to society.</p>

In this amendment, we are discussing the shortage of information that is essential, in my view, to enable the Government to protect the realm. It seems extraordinary that this amendment should be necessary at all. I have talked to a number of colleagues on all sides of the House about it. To paraphrase their view, they said that it is common sense that the UK passport authorities should have full details of any other passport held by an applicant for UK citizenship and that any UK passport holder should be required to inform the UK passport authorities if they subsequently acquire the passport of another country. An obvious sanction to ensure compliance, as included in my amendment, is the risk to a dual passport holder of having their UK passport cancelled and withdrawn if they have concealed the possession of the passport of another country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09032565000108"></a>I raised a number of points on the inadequacy of the administration of the passport system at Second Reading and the noble Lord, Lord West, replied:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="09032565000188"></a>&#147;I am listening. There are some difficult areas there. I think that overall the UK Passport Agency does well, but some issues need to be looked at closely&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/2/09; col. 1208.]</p>

<p><a name="09032565000182"></a>I have heard nothing more from the Minister. My plan was to seek in Committee to amend the Bill to cover various points on passports that I raised at Second Reading, such as the need for the Registrar-General on the recording of a death to tell the Identity and Passport Service so that the passport can be cancelled; the need for sensible fees for people who lose their passports, have them stolen or sell them; and the need to deal with the complicated problem of some members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces holding dual nationality. However, I was advised that passports are issued under the royal prerogative and that this limits the power of Parliament to legislate on their administration. I hope that the Minister will comment on that suggestion. In my view, this is precisely the sort of thing that Parliament should be able to legislate on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09032565000109"></a>Whatever consultations the Home Office may have had since I raised these points six weeks ago at Second Reading&#151;I suspect there may have been none&#151;I have consulted widely with colleagues of all parties.

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09032565000110"></a>The danger of would-be terrorists and other criminals, such as money launderers, travelling in and out of the United Kingdom on one passport and then using a second passport for other nefarious journeys has been well demonstrated. It is therefore crucial that details of any passports held are on the database of the Identity and Passport Service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09032565000111"></a>I have been told by persons in the intelligence community that our security services are much concerned about certain gaps in our control over dual passports and their use. The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, who has much expertise in these matters, explained to me this morning that she had to be at a conference on terrorism this evening but that she strongly supports my amendment. We are constantly told of the risks of terrorism from Pakistan, in particular, and my amendment could help to guard against that.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="09032565000189"></a>&#147;Although applicants for British passports are asked for details of any other passports held at the time of application, any system of recording passports obtained or renewed during the validity would be costly and difficult to enforce where a person with dual nationality chose not to notify the acquisition of a passport in their other nationality&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 9/2/08; col. <I>WA 167</I>.]</p>

<p><a name="09032565000183"></a>That demonstrates why this amendment is needed. It would be nice to feel that the Home Office could add to its much needed objective of becoming fit for purpose by replacing its costly and difficult philosophy with a &#147;can do, will do&#148; philosophy.

I hope that the Minister will realise that just occasionally an individual in this House or somewhere else has a good idea. The Government think that individuals cannot possibly have good ideas and that only their advisors, huge organisations or&#151;occasionally Oppositions have good ideas. However, this is an extremely good idea and it comes from someone with an original mind, and I will be very disappointed if the Government do not at least look at this; it could be explored when the Bill goes to the House of Commons. I hope that we will not have a dismissive speech of a much needed good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09032565000118"></a>For many years I had a second passport: I used one to enter Israel&#151;for instance, when I was there in 1976 to hear President Sadat addressing the Knesset, which  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_740"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 740</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was quite an historic occasion&#151;and the other I used for neighbouring Arab countries where an Israeli stamp on the passport could have meant refusal of admission. There may be legitimate reasons why people have more than one passport. Since the UK does not object to dual nationality, there is no reason why a person who acquires British citizenship should not retain both the citizenship and the passport of his previous nationality.</p>

<a name="90325-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09032565000119"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, is seeking an additional requirement that a person would have to satisfy in order to be naturalised as a British citizen. He would have to declare whether he holds a passport of another nationality and, if so, which one; and, if, once he has been granted British nationality, he subsequently obtains the passport of another state, he should declare that as well. This sounds very reasonable.</p>

<a name="90325-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09032565000120"></a>In other countries, there are records of departures as well as arrivals. We know that the intention is to extend our own records to include departures as well as arrivals. It would be convenient to be able to match the records where a person used different passports for arrival and departure. There may be another reason for wanting to compare the records of particular individuals. For example, if a person is a criminal suspect it may become important to trace his movements in or out of the country. That would make it not only desirable but perhaps essential to know which passports he was using.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09032565000121"></a>As far as I am aware, the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, is the originator of the proposal in this amendment and it has yet to be canvassed or discussed outside Parliament. Although one can see that it would facilitate the detection of cross-boundary criminal or terrorist activity, I respectfully suggest to the noble Lord that he finds a way of consulting more widely or of pressing the Government to do so, rather than asking for the clause to be prematurely inserted in this Bill. I do not disagree at all with him with regard to the sense in which he has raised this but, before we finally agree to it, there should be wider consultation, for example with civil liberties organisations, to check that we are not doing something that we would regret later on. I hope that the Government will adopt this proposal, have their own consultation and come back to the House with definite proposals based on them.</p>

I have always been entitled to an Irish passport, which is often very much more useful to entering the United States, for example, where I am likely to be arrested if I enter on a British passport. There are all sorts of reasons why business people, politicians and the like might need more than one passport&#151;in my case, three. I would hate to feel that the Irish passport details were on a database alongside my British passport or that, if I had a second British passport, it was also on a database so that the world&#146;s terrorist organisations or anyone else could suss exactly where I was and what I was doing.</p>

About 300,000 applicants have had to have a personal interview before being issued with a British passport. I have heard that, after 246,000 interviews, not one applicant had been refused. Did the Government not introduce personal passport interviews in order to prevent this from happening? Has any evaluation been made of the effectiveness of the personal passport interview? If so, could that information be published in order to let us know whether the interviews have been any help in eliminating dual passports, terrorism, fraud and whatever else they were set up to do?</p>

I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, whose expertise and endeavour on this question of dual passports I have experienced and dealt with previously. I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, that good ideas in this House do survive and prosper. On a number of occasions during my 10 years here, legislation has been improved by individual Cross-Bench Members and individual Members of all parties putting forward compelling amendments, which have, perhaps not at the first attempt, persuaded the Government to adopt the policy.</p>

<a name="90325-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09032565000126"></a>I should like to assure noble Lords that this is not a proposal that we have not looked at. However, while at first glance it seems to have attractions, examination reveals that there are significant problems with it in terms of its effect and its enforcement. We must be clear that a legitimate passport is but one documentary proof of an individual&#146;s identity. As has been said, a person may legitimately hold passports of different nationalities, but those passports all do the same thing: they confirm the person&#146;s identity.</p>

<a name="90325-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09032565000127"></a>In criminal investigations, including those relating to terrorism, what is important is knowing the identity of a person of interest to the authorities. Passports and other travel documents help with this, but they are by no means the only way of fixing a person&#146;s identity. Details of persons of interest to UKBA and the law enforcement agencies are held centrally. These check lists, containing names and known aliases, are used in a range of circumstances. When people are travelling, passenger details are checked in advance against these check lists using our e-Borders system. In this way, an individual of interest can be detected, regardless of how many passports he may legitimately hold, and appropriate action can be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09032565000128"></a>Furthermore, it is not clear that this amendment would be enforceable. A passenger of dual nationality cannot be forced to show a passport of a particular nationality at a border.

As a number of noble Lords have said, this proposal perhaps requires a little more investigation, construction and consultation before the Government would be prepared to consider it. We are not relying on the royal prerogative in defence of our position; I will write to the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, on that. I also take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, on the effectiveness of passport interviews, which were introduced in 2007 at regional offices throughout the UK. I do not have the statistics that he seeks, but I will ensure that he gets them. In the mean time, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment, which at this stage is being resisted as unnecessary and unenforceable.</p>

Surely we are looking at the making of citizenship. It is pertinent to ask if those seeking to stay here have an alternative passport. We all know that there are good reasons for having a couple of passports, as has been ably demonstrated. I hope the noble Lord will, as he has said, look at this. I will certainly not accuse him of wriggling. I liked his answer, which was measured and very good, but in a matter of citizenship we had better find out how many passports an immigrant has.</p>

The amendment calls, of course, for the power to cancel a passport if a person fails to tell us that he has another passport. It is not clear how we could establish that a person holds a different passport if he does not disclose that information. Further, as failure to disclose that you hold a passport of a different nationality is not grounds for the refusal of a passport in the first place, there does not appear to be anything to prevent the person in question simply applying for a new passport after the existing one is withdrawn and cancelled. This would appear severely to undermine the effectiveness of the amendment. These are the practical problems associated with the amendment, although we all identify with the wish behind it and the noble Lord&#146;s intention of making our borders safer. At this stage, we remain unconvinced that it is practical to put the proposal into effect.</p>

I can reassure everyone, including my noble friend with three passports, that this is in no sense directed against dual or triple passport holders, or against having several passports. As the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, pointed out, it is narrowly intended that those who are being given British citizenship should be required to disclose details of other passports that they hold. Of course it is enforceable and recordable. If you apply for anything, be it a passport, a driving licence or an insurance policy, and you tell lies about it, you are subject to sanctions. If somebody deliberately conceals that they have another passport when they are asked and required by law to declare it, it is not unreasonable for there to be a sanction. Potentially, this would be the removal or cancellation of the existing British passport. That seems to be perfectly sensible.</p>

So far as the citizenship requirements are concerned, we have been through the changes of names of the various stages&#151;I do not think that we have achieved anything&#151;but we now move to the requirements for citizenship. I want to concentrate on what those requirements will be under the earned citizenship proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09032565000136"></a>It is ironic that while the Bill is so short on detail that we have been trying to instil some transparency into it, Part 2 sets out a prescriptive list of requirements for naturalisation that will have to be fulfilled. They include that people are of good character, have sufficient knowledge of the English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic language, and know about life in the United Kingdom. Those are already requirements under previous legislation. They are not new; they have been part of the nationalisation procedure for some time. I do not complain about them, although this is the first time that we have seen provisions from other legislation in this area laid out. It is right that they should be easily identifiable. However, the one requirement that has not been part of the process so far is the need to undertake an activity.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09032565000137"></a>Perhaps I may declare my role as chair of the England Volunteering Development Council, which is part of Volunteering England. Two members of the staff of Volunteering England are on the design group that is formulating recommendations on how the activity requirement is to work. I want to underline once again not my objection to the notion that some sort of voluntary service could be a useful contribution to citizenship, but to its virtually compulsory nature. In Committee the noble Lord, Lord Brett, said that it is not compulsory, but if people want to expedite their citizenship application and get there on a faster track by reducing the number of years on the journey, they will feel compelled to fulfil this requirement. It is therefore essential to ensure that there is clarity about what &#147;activity&#148; actually means, how potential citizens are going to know what they should do, and what would qualify as voluntary work. It is also essential that they know how to access the relevant information.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09032565000138"></a>Many people who come to this country hail from completely different cultures with no detailed idea of what active citizenship or voluntary service actually mean. We need much greater clarity on the amount of time they need to be involved. I understand that the current suggestion is likely to be a minimum of 50 hours; that is the recommendation from the design group. But how those 50 hours are to be achieved, and over what timescale, has still not been properly identified. It could be 50 hours over six months or even six years. The information I have seen does not make it clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09032565000139"></a>Another problem is that the Independent Safeguarding Authority, which will operate from September this year, is to be the arbiter of the CRB checks. Can the Minister tell us what level of checking citizenship applicants will have to go through if they wish to work with children or older people, and how long the delay is likely to be before they could start on what will be a necessary process? The entire experience of the CRB and ISA is based on checking people who come from this country, and not on those who do not necessarily have a history over here which can be identified. It could be a long time before the checks to see whether people are suitable are ratified. It could also rule out a great deal of voluntary work if whichever of the ISA or the CRB deals with it is not able to bring those forward at some speed.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09032565000140"></a>It will also be a requirement that anyone doing voluntary work will have to have a referee, who will have to sign the document confirming that the applicant&#146;s activity had been properly carried out. However, while the design group suggested that any regulation of applicants will be light touch, there are potential penalties if the referee makes any false statement. There is concern that that may deter some people from acting as referees, particularly if they are from small organisations or not absolutely certain what qualifies as a suitable activity. The referee will, as I understand it, have to come from the organisation supervising the activity; will it, then, be a requirement that that person is sufficiently senior to know all the answers about whether the activity is proper?</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09032565000141"></a>Questions remain, therefore, about those who will find it difficult to give the time to an activity, such as mothers with young children, particularly as we have just discussed that one requirement for full citizenship is that there will be people who will have been in virtually full-time employment. Mothers with small or disabled children are going to find that difficult, and it seems hard to jeopardise their possibility of an expedited citizenship for that reason. Will there be any let-out or exceptions made for people whose position makes it completely impossible for them to do an activity but who, under any other circumstances, would want to because that activity is in the list of requirements? I beg to move.</p>

Nevertheless, a fundamental question remains: why can the person not provide, at least initially, proof of what they have been doing as an active citizen? That seems the right way round, so my Amendment 36 suggests it. That is the right approach.  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_746"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 746</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The amendment takes into account what they can do, where they are living and what sort of activities are available there, what their community sees as its own priority, no doubt, and so on. It is a far more normal way to further the aim that we all have that everybody should be happily slotted in to being an active citizen.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09032565000145"></a>I was also struck by the concerns of Volunteering England, which are worth listing. Some refer to the applicant, among them the concern that it might be hard to find opportunities. Certainly, I can see that applying to some rural areas. For example, where I live in north Devon, if you were living on the fringes of Exmoor for some reason&#151;if you had, perhaps, come here to be something as remote as a beekeeper&#151;it might be hard to find any other volunteering activities out there.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09032565000146"></a>Volunteering England is also concerned about whether applicants would understand the criteria. A very serious problem, which it lists next, is the risk of devaluing volunteering. That is something that we should all bear in mind: volunteering is supposed to be just that and, if it becomes compulsory, it is hard to still call it volunteering. The fact that Volunteering England has this concern is something that the Minister should take seriously. The process should not become a tick-box exercise.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09032565000147"></a>Volunteering England is concerned, too, about the treatment of volunteers, as some organisations might be a bit ruthless. If they know that the applicant has to be a volunteer, they might exploit them. Then there is the question of volunteer expenses. Volunteering England also lists a lot of concerns about host organisations. That is equally serious; at the moment most host organisations, especially the smaller ones, are already under tremendous pressure. What are they supposed to do if three or four people turn up wishing to volunteer, making large demands on the time of the people running the organisations? On the other hand, it would be mean to turn them down, because that would jeopardise the possibility of even becoming a citizen.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09032565000148"></a>Volunteering England mentions supporting applicants with additional needs; that will, again, be hard for smaller organisations. If most people are addressing big organisations, by its very nature that will become a problem for the big organisations. There are also lots of legal issues to be addressed. Then there is the question of referees, which the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, talked about. Would they have direct knowledge of the activities? The Government fall back on the fact that local authorities could do a lot of the accrediting. The Minister will know that local authorities at the moment, for one reason or other to do with the economic crisis, are under tremendous pressure. There is simply not the capacity in their staff to take on a whole other tranche of work doing vast amounts of accreditation.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09032565000149"></a>I still have deep concerns about the bureaucratic nature of this design, whether or not a design group has been designing it. It would seem a much better starting point to come from where the applicant is and then, if the UKBA staff assessing the situation have

He said that he preferred the description, &#147;a fog of uncertainty&#148;, because he did not know what shape the activities would take. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, several of us met two representatives from Volunteering England, who gave a very full explanation of the ideas of the design group. I have read the latest document in the Library, and I am grateful to the Minister for circulating another version. However, I still have serious misgivings about the principle.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09032565000151"></a>I have heard the noble Baronesses talking in detail. It worries me a little that we are getting into the detail; I do not know why we are even discussing it today. I have misgivings about the whole scheme, because it seems to be in contradiction of the whole point of voluntary work. I said in Committee that voluntary work should be judged retrospectively, as it is rather like a curriculum vitae and, far from designing activities in advance, whether you get the co-operation of the voluntary sector or not, the Government should take account of the work that the applicant has done, not prescribe what it should be. Voluntary work is just that&#151;something that a person volunteers for. It can never be a condition. I do not see how the monitoring exercise will work. Think of how many avenues you have to go down in the voluntary sector. It would be a classic, expensive piece of bright red bureaucracy, with no clear conclusions for citizens.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09032565000152"></a>I am not against listing types of voluntary work. I am not against using volunteering as supporting evidence to help towards a qualification or drawing up guidelines. I am against the voluntary sector being roped in to police a scheme, almost as an agent of government. After all, non-governmental work is often the opposite of government.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09032565000153"></a>The Minister made another important point in Committee&#151;col. 562 of <I>Hansard</I>&#151;when he said that organisations had not raised major concerns. Well, they would not, would they? They have not been told about the scheme. Only a handful of organisations have been drafted in. The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, suggested a pilot scheme before this goes into legislation, which may be a good idea. It might work, but I remain sceptical, and I go along in particular with Amendment 36.</p>

I hope that the Government have received a copy, because it contains serious criticisms of the way that the scheme is being approached. Those must be taken on board by the Government, because Volunteering England is a participant in the UK Border Agency&#146;s active citizenship design group, which is advising civil servants on how the proposals could affect the voluntary sector. If Volunteering England, as a participant in the design group, has raised all these questions, surely we need to probe much more thoroughly into what the Government&#146;s plans are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09032565000155"></a>My noble friend listed many concerns raised in this document. I will highlight one item that the Government should pay attention to, namely the burden of the active citizenship scheme on organisations that will employ volunteers and the fact that the scheme has not planned a budget or guidance for helping organisations to meet these costs. I invite the Minister to say whether this is the end of the matter and whether there will be no public money to assist volunteer organisations that participate in the scheme.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09032565000156"></a>I also ask the Minister what he has to say about Volunteering England&#146;s injunction to local authorities and other public bodies to fully engage with the scheme as potential host organisations. My noble friend has said that we are expecting a lot of the existing volunteer organisations. Can we not enlist public authorities to fill the gap, if there are not going to be enough places? I seriously think that may be the case, if there is suddenly a host of applications from people wanting to take part in the active citizenship scheme and there are no places for them. How are we enlisting local authorities and statutory bodies to fill the gap? Obviously, no effort has been made so far, otherwise Volunteering England would have known about it.</p>

It is a nice, good, warm idea, but the structure and guidance seem completely absent. When somebody comes from an entirely different culture and environment, you cannot expect them immediately to take their place in a volunteering sense in a community. It will take time. They have to become aware of the community and its needs. Some of them will be thrilled to voluntarily volunteer; that is what they will want to do. However, we are asking the ordinary person on the citizenship path to do something that the majority of people in the UK do not do. What percentage of those in the United Kingdom volunteer? I do not know; it is a question that we cannot answer. However, we must not ask those from different backgrounds and cultures to do more than we are willing to do. I suggest that they will also come across hurdles such as CRB checks. Who will verify their CRB checks if they are new in the community? We want to see all these things work and we would love to see people integrated into our communities, but we need far more guidance than we are currently receiving.</p>

At Second Reading, I said that it seemed quite wrong to be requiring this degree of volunteering in order to knock quite a proportion off the increased period required for qualifying for citizenship. Above all, if we all volunteered&#151;it would be a good idea, and a large proportion of people do during their lifetime&#151;it might be much more acceptable. However, as the noble Lord has just said, to require it not of all citizens but only for this reason is not a good idea.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09032565000159"></a>We all need to know a great deal more about the point about Volunteering England and the design group, which everybody seems a bit nonplussed by. If the Government are absolutely fixed on it, I suppose that we are not likely to see them pull back from it. Particularly in the case of those immigrants with the

I hope that this can be gone into in much more detail.</p>

<a name="09032565000160"></a><b><a name="90325-0014.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09032565000272"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, I appreciate the contributions that have been made. I heard some of these points made in great detail in Committee. I will not repeat what I said then, except for two points. First, the Government are clear that they see active citizenship as a positive way for migrants to earn citizenship more quickly and to assist with their integration into British society. However, I hear a number of terms, and I heard them in Committee, such as &#147;roped in&#148; and &#147;compulsory&#148;. It would not be compulsory for any migrant to participate in the active citizenship scheme. It would not be compulsory for any voluntary organisation to take part in the scheme. It would not be compulsory for any local authority. This scheme is, we hope, designed by those who know rather better than Home Office civil servants and&#151;dare I say it?&#151;Ministers what will work and what incentive we are seeking to create. In fact, the design group itself is voluntary.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09032565000161"></a>Volunteering England has asked a series of relevant questions and there are others. All the questions put by noble Lords tonight have the validity of a question to which there must be an answer. However, that answer is coming through the design group. The questions are discussed within the design group, although some of them will be external and will have to be addressed to the Home Office as the sponsoring department that wants to see this light-touch, non-bureaucratic system put in place.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09032565000162"></a>It is a mistake to suggest that the compulsion element is severe. It is not. If people do not want to volunteer in real life, they do not, and they will not do so in these circumstances or otherwise. However, this is about providing an incentive, which will help not only the individual but the integration of migrants into our society so that our society is at ease with itself and understands the multicultural and multiethnic backgrounds of its citizens.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09032565000163"></a>In Committee, several noble Lords expressed interest in the work of the design group. I believe that a document exists entitled <I>Clearing the</I><I> Fog</I>. A further substantial document has been produced and I have arranged to have it put in the Library. However, this is not the end game by any means. The Bill will proceed through the other place, where no doubt demands will be made for updated information, and the questions which have been posed here and others will be asked and will need to be answered. However, the situation is not entirely as has been suggested tonight because in Committee I heard some noble Lords speak in support of the proposal. Indeed, some noble Lords support it tonight. They are not questioning the concept but asking practical questions about how to make it successful. Those questions deserve to be answered. It is vital that people understand how the measure will operate. That is why we have placed a further document in the   


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_750"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column 750</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Library which contains more information from the Active Citizenship Design Group on its emerging thinking. Where I cannot deal with noble Lords&#146; questions tonight I undertake to write to them with a more detailed response.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09032565000164"></a>I hope that the information we have provided goes some way to alleviate noble Lords&#146; concerns and shows that we are willing to share our findings as soon as they have been agreed by the design group. We want provisions that will work and be transparent. I also trust that this information demonstrates that we are developing proposals on active citizenship in the fairest and most common-sense manner. Therefore, I hope that noble Lords will not feel that they have to press their amendments.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09032565000165"></a>These amendments would severely restrict the ability of the Secretary of State to prescribe in regulations the conditions which will be used to determine when a person meets the active citizenship requirement. However, we are not seeking to determine that from on high. The design group is discussing the legitimate questions asked by Volunteering England and other bodies, and no doubt will in turn ask those questions of the Home Office. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked about people effectively being able to self-assess their contributions. It is hard to see how a system that relies solely on evidence submitted by the applicant would operate. We need to set down certain parameters to this requirement which can be easily understood and followed by all concerned so that we produce a not overly bureaucratic system which people value and seek to take up.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09032565000166"></a>Noble Lords have mentioned people with disabilities or those with family responsibilities. Discretion is built in to the system to allow such circumstances to be taken into account. Noble Lords also referred to the need for a light touch to be applied. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked what CRB checks are required with regard to active citizenship. Criminal Record Bureau checks are a key concern. We acknowledge that there is clear benefit in carrying out these checks in order to protect our children and vulnerable adults from harm. Clearly, it is not an option to abandon those checks. Protection issues must take precedence in this area. CRB checks are relevant to certain existing volunteering opportunities. However, many of the individuals and organisations who take part in active citizenship will not have to get involved in CRB checks. But as part of our communications strategy we will ensure that migrants are aware of what is expected in terms of CRB checks if they choose to volunteer to work with children or vulnerable adults.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09032565000167"></a>I was also asked about the role of the referee. We need to prescribe who can act as referee to ensure that those verifying active citizenship can make a quick objective decision and that applicants can approach a suitable person for that reference. Our current proposal is that a referee should be defined as someone in a supervisory capacity with personal knowledge of the applicant&#146;s active citizenship. This presents a lower risk of fraud compared to allowing simply anyone to act as a referee. The referee will have personal knowledge of the activity and, because they are in a supervisory capacity, they will be keen to

As I said, it is important that we have information available, that migrants can find out what the opportunities are and that those from different cultures can understand the concept of volunteering as it has grown up in the UK over the past century or more.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09032565000168"></a>One of the suggestions is providing an information pack for migrants on arrival in the UK and, equally, when they are seeking probationary citizenship. There may be other questions that I have not been able to answer, but I offer to pick those up and write to noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90325-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09032565000169"></a>I appreciate that noble Lords are concerned that we are coming with a lot of information which, if not a fog, still has a degree of mist around it. I offer the assurance that the regulations will be subject to the affirmative procedure, so that Parliament will be able to scrutinise and agree beforehand what emerges from this very hands-on&#151;for those involved&#151;and, we hope, voluntary system, which will assist the migrants and the aims not only of the Government but of everyone in this House for a more integrated society which is at ease with itself.</p>

If there is no adequate scheme available for an individual migrant within a reasonable travelling distance of where they are living, would they be exempt?

In essence, I would have thought that the first thing was to establish clearly with all the available voluntary organisations where opportunities might be most local and most appropriate.

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09032565000173"></a>One area which was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and which I touched on, is important for the Government to take on board. Who is going to pay the voluntary organisations for helping to undertake this work? The volunteers by definition may very well need volunteer expenses, such as childcare, travel and so on. That needs to be taken into account and cannot just be slid over. The worry about this is that the Government issued a question and answer document, and this expenses question was not part of it. It is something that needs to be picked up.</p>

<p>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Local Government (Structural Changes) (Miscellaneous Amendments and Other Provision) Order 2009.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="09032555000003"></a><b><a name="90325-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09032555000139"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> As Members of the Committee will know, this order is consequential on the local government structural change orders that Parliament agreed in early 2008. The order makes specific provision to ensure that various matters relevant to the new single-tier councils are dealt with before the reorganisation date.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000004"></a>These changes are necessary to update the statute book in light of the changes made by the structural change orders. Without these provisions, some of the new unitary councils would have to continue to refer to themselves as county councils, which is extremely confusing for their communities. Areas with historic traditions, including city status, would be lost to local residents. For example, Chester City would no longer be Chester City; new unitary councils would not be able to appoint members to relevant national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty conservation boards within their areas; and there would be no administering authority for the Cheshire and Bedfordshire pension funds. I am sure that noble Lords would agree that these are necessary and sensible measures.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000005"></a>I shall take a little time to go through the order in more detail. Part 2 of the order makes provision to ensure that members of the new Central Bedfordshire Council&#146;s shadow executive can continue as members of that executive until the June election notwithstanding that the authorities from which they were appointed will cease to exist before that date. Provision is also made to amend the electoral arrangements for some  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC196"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC196</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>parish councils in Bedfordshire so that their elections are properly synchronised with the election cycles for the new Bedford Borough Council and Central Bedfordshire Council.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000006"></a>Part 2 also adds provisions to the structural change orders for Cornwall, Northumberland, Shropshire, Wiltshire and County Durham to make provision regarding the names of the new councils, essentially allowing them, subject to resolution, to omit the word &#147;county&#148; from their legal names. This is entirely sensible. It was requested by the councils themselves to provide the new unitary councils with the opportunity to adopt truly new identities in the eyes of their residents and, just as importantly, to make a fresh start in the eyes of the new council staff, whether they are from the previous county or district councils.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000007"></a>Part 3 of the order makes provision for the appointment of charter trustees as appropriate bodies in which historic rights and privileges may vest for parts of Cheshire West and Chester, Cheshire East, and County Durham. As has been requested by both the new and outgoing councils in the areas affected, we are creating charter trustees for the cities of Chester and Durham, the towns of Crewe and Macclesfield and the historic area of Ellesmere Port, to which historic rights can be transferred until such time as an appropriate parish council is established to which those rights can transfer.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000008"></a>Members of the Committee should note that the actual transfer of historic rights and privileges to these charter trustees is made in regulations of general application which have been laid before this House. Special provision is also made in this order in relation to market rights in Chester, where we have provided that these rights vest in the Cheshire West and Chester Council, essentially allowing the new council to continue to run the Chester market.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000009"></a>Part 3 also provides for the retention of the ceremonial counties of Cheshire and Bedfordshire by amending the Lieutenancies Act 1997 and the Sheriffs Act 1887 to update the definition of counties for the purposes of these Acts.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000010"></a>Part 4 of the order makes provision for the vesting of the local government pension fund maintained by the Bedfordshire County Council and the fund maintained by Cheshire County Council. It provides, further to the results of the consultation with those affected, that these funds will vest in Bedford Borough Council and Cheshire West and Chester Council respectively.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000011"></a>Part 5 of the order makes amendments to a number of port health authority orders. These orders are amended to reflect the changes as a consequence of the new local government arrangements in Cheshire, Cornwall and Northumberland, and provide for the new single-tier unitary councils to exercise the port health functions after 1 April.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000012"></a>Part 6 of the order makes provision regarding the membership of the conservation boards for the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty and the Cotswolds area of outstanding natural beauty to reflect the changes to local authority arrangements as a consequence of reorganisations in Bedfordshire and Wiltshire. Similar provision is made for the membership of the national park authorities, the New Forest and the Peak District,  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC197"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to reflect the changes as a consequence of the changes in local government arrangements in Wiltshire and Cheshire.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000013"></a>Part 7 of the order makes a number of miscellaneous amendments. These include amendments to primary legislation which use local authority boundaries to define geographical areas and which are updated to refer to the new local authority arrangements. Provision is also made in this part for the membership of the River Tweed Commission consequential upon the restructuring in Northumberland. Provision is also made to designate Central Bedfordshire Council as the relevant council for Bedfordshire and Luton coroner&#146;s district within the meaning of Section 1(1)(a) of the Coroners Act 1988. The relevant council is responsible for the appointment of coroners and has other functions in connection with coroners under the 1988 Act.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000014"></a>I am sure that Members of the Committee will agree that the provisions in the order are sensible and necessary consequential amendments following the structural change orders that Parliament has already approved.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000015"></a>I propose to speak now to the Cornwall (Electoral Arrangements and Consequential Amendments) Order 2009. This order contains necessary and sensible provisions which are consequential on the Cornwall (Structural Change) Order that was approved by Parliament in February 2009. The order makes provision for the 2009 local government elections to be held on the basis of 123 electoral divisions, implementing the Boundary Committee&#146;s draft recommended warding arrangements as published on 2 December 2008. These changes are necessary as without them the elections in Cornwall would be held on the basis of 71 wards returning 82 councillors, a number which is widely recognised by all in Cornwall and all involved in electoral administration as not sufficient to provide the strategic leadership that is needed for the new unitary Cornwall Council.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000016"></a>As we come to debate the order we find ourselves in unusual circumstances, to which the Merits Committee has referred, and I will address some of the issues it has raised. The circumstances are unusual because, in most cases, provision for electoral arrangements would be made by the Electoral Commission on the basis of recommendations by the Boundary Committee. However, Members of the Committee will be aware of a series of events which explain why we are in this unusual position today. I shall explain the background and put it on the record as part of understanding the order.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000017"></a>In February 2008, when the structural change orders establishing the new unitary councils were approved by Parliament, we planned that three of the new unitaries based on existing county areas&#151;Cornwall, Shropshire and Wiltshire&#151;would have elections in May/June 2009 on the basis of new ward electoral divisions, together with a new number of councillors, reflecting the new unitary status of the council. It was for the Boundary Committee and the Electoral Commission to decide the number of councillors there would be in future and to designate new wards, which would be established by a non-parliamentary order made by the Electoral Commission following a process of consultation undertaken by the Boundary Committee.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC198"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000018"></a>The Boundary Committee commenced its electoral review in Cornwall, Shropshire and Wiltshire in February 2008. The Electoral Commission and the Boundary Committee have essentially done what was expected of them and completed the review in Shropshire and Wiltshire. We understand that the orders for these authorities specifying the new wards which will be used for the 2009 local government elections in June were made by the commission on 6 March.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000019"></a>However, in the case of Cornwall, the Boundary Committee and the Electoral Commission have, for a number of reasons, failed to deliver the new electoral arrangements in time for the June election. This is unfortunate. Delay has largely been caused because of the difficulty that the Boundary Committee and the council have about agreeing the appropriate size of the new council.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000020"></a>On 15 August 2008, the Boundary Committee wrote to the leader of Cornwall County Council, confirming that on the basis of the evidence available to it, it was minded to base its draft recommendations on a council size of 123 members for the new unitary authority. However,</p>
<ul><a name="09032555000119"></a>&#147;given the serious delay to which this review of Cornwall has been subject, the view of the Boundary Committee is that there is now no possibility of any new electoral arrangements being implemented in any combined elections in June 2009&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000021"></a>Members of the Committee can see the difficulty we face. All, including the Boundary Committee, are in agreement that there should be 123 councillors for the new unitary council, instead of the existing 82 for the current county council. However, the Boundary Committee is not in a position to specify the new electoral divisions. Indeed, it only finished consulting on a draft of what the new wards could be on 10 February 2009, and there is no prospect of it making an order specifying new wards in time for the 4 June elections.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000022"></a>When the Merits Committee said in its report that the decision to proceed with North Cornwall council elections in June 2009 had not been an obvious one, I would point to this process and the reason why there has been delay, and the admission by the Boundary Committee that there was no prospect of it making an order specifying new wards in time for the 4 June elections. Furthermore, when it became clear that the Electoral Commission was not going to be able to make an order in time for the elections, in the debate on the draft Local Elections (Ordinary Day of Elections in 2009) Order 2008, the Minister for Local Government stated that he was,</p>
<ul><a name="09032555000120"></a>&#147;minded to introduce for consideration an order that would, exceptionally, move the election date for Cornwall from the beginning of June to the end of October 2009&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons, 20/11/08; col. 771W.]</ul>
<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000023"></a>However, before introducing such an order, the Minister proposed to take soundings seeking views from those affected in Cornwall and, as necessary, from the Boundary Committee and the Electoral Commission. That exercise was commenced on 1 December last year, when the Minister wrote to Cornish MPs, all Cornish councils, the Electoral Commission and the Boundary Committee. As part  of the exercise, he made it clear that central to any decision on deferral was the likelihood of the  Electoral Commission putting in place the new electoral  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC199"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC199</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arrangements in time for an October election. If there was any significant likelihood of this timetable not being met, he believed that it would be wrong to defer the election and a preferable course might be to hold elections on 4 June 2009, but on the basis of interim electoral arrangements to be specified in an order which, if Parliament approved, the Secretary of State could make under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. The Minister was quite clear that there was an option here, and a condition being set. That is in part our answer to the concern of the Merits Committee.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000024"></a>The Electoral Commission&#146;s response to the soundings exercise stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032555000114"></a>&#147;Aiming to hold elections in October 2009 using electoral arrangements which have been approved by the Electoral Commission relies heavily on meeting an uncertain timetable for implementing the electoral review recommendations and could involve considerable risk to effective administration of the electoral process&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032555000106"></a>In other words, the commission could not guarantee what the Minister had asked for&#151;that the arrangements would be finalised for an October election. Given this position, the Government felt that it would be wrong to proceed on any basis other than a June 2009 election.</p>
<h5><a name="09032555000128"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000025"></a>On 19 February 2009, the Minister for Local Government confirmed that the local elections to the new unitary council for Cornwall would go ahead on Thursday 4 June 2009 and that the Government intended to lay an order before Parliament that would provide for the elections to be held on the basis of the draft electoral arrangements that the Boundary Committee has been consulted on, which would have the effect of returning 123 councillors for the new unitary council. As I have said, without such an order, the elections in Cornwall would be held on the basis of 71 wards returning 82 councillors, a number which is widely recognised by everyone in Cornwall and everyone involved in electoral administration as not sufficient effectively to run the council.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000026"></a>Accordingly, we have laid this order before Parliament, and we find ourselves debating it this afternoon. If it is approved, we will make the order under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, specifying the electoral divisions for the Cornwall 2009 local government elections on 4 June.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000027"></a>Some have questioned whether the Government&#146;s objective of providing for democratic legitimacy&#151;that is, a fully elected council&#151;for the new Cornwall Council as soon as possible after its inception could have been more fully achieved if elections had taken place after the Electoral Commission had completed its electoral review. This question was also raised by the Merits Committee. However, as I have just explained, even in January when the Boundary Committee responded to the soundings exercise, it felt that the timetable for implementation was uncertain and that it could not be sure that it would be able to make an order in time for an October 2009 election. It appears that there is still no certainty about when the order will be made.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000028"></a>Is there then some suggestion that the council should have to wait until an unspecified later date when the Electoral Commission has decided on finalised boundaries   


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC200"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>before it has a newly elected and mandated council of sufficient size to lead the new council? When would this election be? Would it be in May 2010 or May 2013, when there would be more and unforgiving uncertainty?</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000029"></a>If the local elections are not held in June, the council will continue to be run, until elections can be held, by the implementation executive, which, as noble Lords will remember from our debates, is essentially an appointed body made up of county councillors and some district councillors whose councils are being abolished on 31 March 2009. I cannot believe that that is a situation that noble Lords would wish to see. It certainly was not a situation that the local MPs in the area wanted to see.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000030"></a>In an ideal world, we would see an election held in June on the basis of boundaries made on the final recommendations of the Boundary Committee, and the Electoral Commission would have made an order to establish them in time for the election. However, this is not the situation in which we find ourselves. It is most important now that we ensure that the new Cornwall Council gets off to the best start and that it is of a sufficient size to ensure that it has the strength of leadership to deliver improved service delivery from the earliest opportunity.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000031"></a>The Merits Committee said that the Government should have willed the means to ensure that the preparatory stages were completed in time. Both the Electoral Commission and the Boundary Committee are independent of government. There is no role for government in influencing the electoral review process.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000032"></a>As I said, the order provides for the draft electoral divisions on which the Boundary Committee has been consulting. There were suggestions in another place to modify these boundaries. Referring to the debate in another place, I am sure that noble Lords understand that it would be quite wrong for the Government to amend boundaries on an ad hoc basis following representations from individuals who may have a vested interest without the means to test the validity of the boundaries suggested by local people.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000033"></a>It has also been suggested that boundaries could be amended where there is consensus among parties or councils. However, altering boundaries is not a simple decision based on agreement. Representations would have to be considered against the key criteria of electoral equality, community identity, and effective and convenient local government. Indeed, those representations have been made to the Boundary Committee and not to the Government. The Government are not in a position to test representations without regard to the key criteria. The only way in which to proceed with any safety while recognising, as we do, the imperfections, is for the elections to go ahead on the basis of the boundaries proposed by the independent Boundary Committee.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000034"></a>The approach that we are proposing will therefore give the new Cornwall Council full democratic legitimacy as soon as possible as a newly elected body of councillors in June. In the expectation that the next election to the council will be held in May 2013, on the basis of the Electoral Commission&#146;s final electoral arrangements, our proposals will allow the new council from its early days to have the strength and stability necessary to  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC201"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pursue innovative and demanding improvements in service delivery and give it clear and effective leadership particularly at this time of great economic challenges.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000035"></a>A final issue is capacity to implement new arrangements to a very tight timetable so close to the election. The timing of this order specifying the wards for the 4 June elections in Cornwall is about the same as the Electoral Commission&#146;s own orders for Shropshire and Wiltshire. We accept that electoral administrators in Cornwall, unlike those in other counties, have not been certain about when or on what basis the elections would be held. The Minister for Local Government announced his decision as soon as was practicable, on 19 February, in order to provide all those in Cornwall with clarity as early as possible.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000036"></a>We know that the work being undertaken in preparation for an election on the basis of new electoral divisions is challenging, but it is significant that Cornwall Council is confident that it can meet it. Indeed, senior officers of Cornwall County Council have commented that they believe that the 4 June combined local and European elections can be organised on the basis of new wards. They have sufficient resources to deliver this, they have dedicated resources, and they have sufficient programme management resources to ensure that the election is delivered successfully.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000037"></a>With the correct support, the job is entirely doable. Officials in CLG have facilitated discussions between those leading the preparations in Cornwall and Ministry of Justice officials, the Electoral Commission, the Association of Electoral Administrators and SOLACE&#146;s electoral panel, about providing support for Cornwall. All of them have been incredibly helpful. Following the discussions the Electoral Commission and the AEA are working with the council directly, undertaking a series of assurance reviews to support the combined election within Cornwall. An initial review undertaken on Tuesday 10 March looked at, among other things: the overall approach to delivering the combined elections within Cornwall to ensure that a low-risk approach is being undertaken; the governance, management and reporting arrangements relating to the project; the risks and issues, with associated mitigating and corrective activities; the process for generating polling districts&#146; electoral registers from Boundary Committee draft recommendations and verifying those registers; the polling district review approach and evidence; and polling day arrangements. I have gone into this degree of detail because they are precisely the challenges that we need to know Cornwall is capable of meeting.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000038"></a>This initial review was very encouraging. Both the AEA and the Electoral Commission were impressed with the amount of work that had been done in Cornwall and the progress that had been made. I am told that they are confident that, on the basis of the plans to date, sufficient programme management arrangements and measures are in place to deliver a successful election.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000039"></a>Following the initial review, the AEA and the Electoral Commission are continuing to provide periodic review check points in line with the key stages of the project plan and to provide further assurance. In addition, the AEA will review the council&#146;s plan and the risk register weekly to ensure that any areas of concern are addressed

My officials, too, are in contact with the council on a weekly basis as a minimum, and they have very recently visited the council as part of a stock-take exercise on unitary implementation progress that the Minister has asked them to undertake.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000040"></a>The immediate challenge for administrators in Cornwall is finalising and publishing the updated registers on the basis of the new electoral divisions for 1 April 2009, ahead of the notice of election on 28 April. That, too, has been a challenging deadline but I am told that the council is on track to meet it. Following the publication of the register the council will essentially move into business as usual as far as preparation for the elections is concerned.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000041"></a>Of course the timing is tight and of course we wish it had been otherwise. However, in our judgment the risks posed are wholly manageable. The alternative&#151;no new electoral mandate for the council, and the implementation executive, which was always meant as a temporary forum, continuing to lead the new council&#151;presents a serious risk to the success of the new unitary council and puts in jeopardy the delivery of local services in Cornwall. That is a risk we cannot run. As the Minister for Local Government made clear when he confirmed the decision to proceed with an election on this basis, what is most important at this point is to provide effective local leadership and improved service delivery for Cornwall&#146;s people and to ensure that the council has real democratic legitimacy at the earliest opportunity, which would give it the best start possible. I commend the orders to the Committee.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000043"></a>We cannot miss an opportunity to mention again the big-picture issue here: consequential orders on the reorganisation of local government. These orders are necessary because of the introduction of the five new unitary authorities that are coming our way. This side of the Committee tried to resist the change because we felt it was taking decision-making away from small local authorities that were closer to the people whom they represented and the place where they raised taxes. Moving to these monolithic, giant authorities, particularly in the case of Durham and Northumberland, is detrimental and has a democratic deficit attached to it. I speak and declare an interest as a council tax payer of the County of Durham&#151;or should I call it Durham now? I am not quite sure. Perhaps it is the Shire of Durham. I remember being taught in my history lessons that, when it was originally founded, the proper name for the County of Durham was the area of St Cuthbert between the Tyne and the Wear. I am not sure that we need to go back that far, with all due reverence to St Cuthbert, but the point is that County Durham has a traditional position, as did the district authorities in places such as Sedgefield and the City of Durham where the local authorities were making a real difference and working very well.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000044"></a>The change was sold to us on the basis that it would reduce expenses and be a much cheaper way of conducting local government. In her comments on 21 February

GC48 of <I>Hansard</I>, the Minister said that in the case of County Durham, for example, the savings would be &#163;11 million annually. If that is so, we in Durham do not understand why it is proposed that our council tax bills should increase by 5 per cent this year. That is causing a lot of people and a lot of businesses a lot of hardship in the present climate.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000045"></a>An opinion poll conducted in Durham found that a massive 76 per cent of people across the whole of the county were against this single unitary authority. The people of the north-east have a long tradition of their views expressed in opinion polls and referendums being overridden by this Government. Of course, we had a referendum on a regional assembly, which was rejected by 78 per cent to 22 per cent.</p>
<h5><a name="09032555000129"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000046"></a>I take the opportunity to say that we would have preferred it if the orders had not been necessary. We think that the previous arrangements represented something closer to the aspiration of the local people and something that local people clearly said they wanted. I have not seen a reorganisation in local government that does not end up costing a lot more money than the previous arrangements.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000047"></a>Perhaps I may run through some parts of the order. I turn, first, to ceremonial matters. The Minister mentioned that the charter trustees would hold on to these ceremonial rights until a parish authority or another authority could be formed. It would be useful to know what it is envisaged that authority should be and when it will come into being. There is some reference in the order to how charter trustees, which is a very grand name, will be appointed. We would want to resist and probe further anything other than charter trustees being elected representatives and being democratically accountable. Perhaps the Minister could look at that.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000048"></a>The next issue that I want to mention briefly is local government pension funds in Cheshire. The order, in Article 13 under Part 4, makes provision for the division of rights and liabilities in respect of the fund to rest with Cheshire West and Chester Council. There may be a miracle under way here whereby the complex negotiation concerning who falls within each pension fund and who is liable for the contributions as between the two councils of Cheshire West and Chester Council has been resolved amicably, but it would be good if in her response the Minister could tell us whether that has now been formally agreed between the two councils or whether there is still some element of dispute.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000049"></a>I was interested to see that Part 5 refers to the amendment of port health authority orders. Last week, we debated the very distressing effect of the backdating of the rating revaluation on ports. I hope that I will be forgiven if I take this opportunity to remind the Committee about the rating revaluation in the context of these port health authority orders. I should be interested to know, for example, whether the port health authorities are classed as port-side operators. In other words, will these health authorities, whose buildings are on the port side, be hit like other businesses by the backdated rating revaluation? If so, that adds further strength to what was demonstrated by a vote in the Chamber last week to resist that revaluation.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC204"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC204</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000050"></a>Part 7 deals with amendment of the European Parliamentary Elections Act and concerns some changes that are going through. In the context of the Minister&#146;s remarks about elections and the timeliness of elections, is it acceptable to be putting through amendments with regard to boundaries for European parliamentary elections and to be passing them in relation to Bedford and Bedfordshire with name changes this close to the European elections? Will it not lead to confusion? Could it not have been done at an earlier date?</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000051"></a>Perhaps I may also ask for clarification in respect of the amendment of the Scotland Act 1998 (River Tweed) Order 2006. This provision suggests that governorship of the River Tweed will now become a joint responsibility; the council for the county of Northumberland will take over from Berwick-upon-Tweed. As someone who is regularly in Berwick, I am interested in where the actual boundary falls between England and Scotland. What consultations took place with the Scotland Office and what is the arrangement? Fish, I am reliably informed, often swim between England and Scotland, and not only to get free prescriptions and avoid tuition fees. It would be useful to know that.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000052"></a>On the Cornwall (Electoral Arrangements and Consequential Amendments) Order, some real concerns were mentioned. The Minister has explained at considerable length the background to the order, so I do not intend to test her patience or that of the Committee in going through it further. However, it is important to place on record our support for the conclusion of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032555000115"></a>&#147;It is clear that the decision to proceed with Cornwall Council elections in June 2009 has not been an obvious one for the Department to take&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032555000107"></a>In parliamentary draftsman-speak, I suppose that means that it was the wrong decision to take. It continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032555000116"></a>&#147;The proposal advanced by DCLG at the outset of the December 2008 sounding exercise was the postponement of these elections from June to October 2009, and this proposal was supported by the existing County Council ... DCLG now say that, in confirming June 2009 as the date for the elections, the Minister for Local Government believed that this would give the new Cornwall Council &#145;full democratic legitimacy as soon as possible after its inception&#146;&#148;.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000053"></a>There seems to be some confusion because when Mr Khan referred to this on 16 March in the Committee considering the order in another place, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032555000117"></a>&#147;The approach that we are proposing will give the new Cornwall council full democratic legitimacy as soon as possible. In the expectation that the next council election will be held in May 2013 on the basis of the Electoral Commission&#146;s final electoral arrangements, the new council will, from its early days, have the strength and stability necessary to pursue innovative and demanding improvements in service delivery&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Second Delegated Legislation Committee, 16/3/09; col. 5.]</p>

<p><a name="09032555000108"></a>That suggests that Sadiq Khan believes that that democratic legitimacy will come into effect in May 2013, as opposed to June this year. That is regrettable. It is not as if these orders are new; the draft Cornwall (Structural Change) Order 2008 was debated in Standing Committee on 7 February 2008 and approved by the House on 18 February. A whole year has passed, and it would seem that it was not too difficult to have the Boundary Committee look at those issues. When this issue was taken to judicial review before Justice Cranston, he found on 8 January 2009 that,</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC205"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="09032555000121"></a>&#147;consultation could properly proceed in stages so that the decision to defer the issue of affordability was not improper; nor was it irrational; ... While it was correct that consultation should not be narrowly confined to expert opinion, but should extend to the public as a whole, and that consultation required the publication of sufficient information in a timely fashion, the Boundary Committee had not failed in these respects; ... The Boundary Committee had given proper consideration to the earlier Exeter proposal and had duly reached its own decision on the matter ... Nor had it been in error in considering the requirement that any proposal must &#145;in aggregate&#146; have to deliver outcomes specified in the five applicable criteria ... Its considerations had, however, been constrained by legal advice that it could advance only one alternative proposal&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032555000109"></a>The Minister touched on that point, but, for the record, in a debate on this issue in another place my colleague Hugo Swire said that he believed the Boundary Committee had misinformed Devon Members of Parliament by saying that the status quo was not an option. Following a legal challenge for judicial review by East Devon, Mr Cranston made the point that I have just made. It would be good to have the Minister&#146;s response to that. Other than that, we are happy to accede to the orders going through.</p>

<p><a name="09032555000054"></a><b><a name="90325-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09032555000141"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I thank the Minister for her long and detailed introduction, as the noble Lord has just said, in her usual careful fashion. I do not wish to rehearse the background or the arguments that we have had on the decisions that underlie the order; I suspect that the influx of people into this Room is not to hear this debate but is for the next business.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000055"></a>Before anyone teases me about it, I should offer that, on future legislation, if I protest about reserve powers held by the Secretary of State, this could well be an instance held up of why they are sometimes necessary.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000056"></a>In the debate in the Commons, my honourable friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne asked for the Minister&#146;s comments. They were not given, and I ask the Minister here to comment on what decisions took place regarding Cornwall between the Boundary Committee and the Electoral Commission. She asked what reasons it accepted as decisive in giving carte blanche approval to the proposals. If the Minister has anything she can say on that, I would be grateful.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000057"></a>On the other order, I ask about the position in Bedfordshire, where the shadow executive is to continue as a member of the new council&#146;s executive until the June election. What happens to the other things that go on in that interregnum period? In particular, are overview and scrutiny arrangements in place&#151;one would expect there to be arrangements to hold the executive to account if executive powers continue&#151;or do they have to hold their fire until after the election? If it is the latter, I suppose they will be holding to account people who may no longer be in an equivalent position.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000058"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, mentioned pension funds. They are topical, given that we are hearing suggestions that there may be shortfalls in certain places. I was interested to see that the pension funds have been vested in the outgoing councils, if I may put it that way. I assume that that is the case, as they are to vest in the new authorities. I had thought that there would be separate pension trustees rather than vesting in the authorities themselves. I hope the Minister can

Other than that, we welcome the two orders.</p>
<h5><a name="09032555000130"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09032555000059"></a><b><a name="90325-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09032555000142"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for her long explanation. I am sure that I learnt a number of things. I shall apply my comments to the Cornwall order and, in doing so, I declare an interest: there is a possibility of my being a candidate in that election.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000060"></a>The most important thing about this issue is democracy. I feel strongly that, with a new local authority as important as Cornwall unitary will be, representing some 500,000 citizens, it is important that that authority has renewed and legitimate democratic control early in its life. The authority starts on 1 April but we will have to wait until 4 June to hold elections, as that is the earliest possible date. But we are now able to hold elections. I welcome that strongly, as do a number of my colleagues in Cornwall. At this time of unprecedented economic challenges, it is important that local authorities have proper leadership and the legitimacy to move forward, agree strategies and plans, and implement them. It is important for the business community in particular to know the direction of a local authority. To have left matters to the end of the year, with a none-too-legitimate interim executive in the mean time, would have been far from satisfactory. From all those points of view, this is a good decision.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000061"></a>My only concern is that there will be 123 members. I have just received news that the Government of the Czech Republic, which hold the EU presidency, have just fallen. It occurred on a vote of 101 out of 200 members of the Czech Parliament. If 200 MPs can represent the whole of the Czech Republic, an EU member state, then the figure of 123 for Cornwall is perhaps rather large. However, I recognise entirely that the Government accepted the recommendations of the local authority. Those are purely my personal views.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000062"></a>Although I accept the Minister&#146;s explanation, there were a number of clear clerical errors in the initial boundary review that could have been put right. There are a couple of anomalies, particularly in north Cornwall, and I regret that they were not put right. However, all the boundaries&#151;into which parish councillors in particular have put so much work with their recommendations&#151;can be put right during the term of office and can be made perfect, if these things ever are perfect, by the time of the next elections.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000063"></a>The noble Lord mentioned Devon. Although it is nothing to do with this order, I would plead with the Government not to have another unitary authority as small as some of the existing ones in the traditional, historic Devon area, and to make Devon outside Plymouth and Torbay one unitary authority. Neither the business community nor possibly anybody outside the City of Exeter itself can understand why a second option, an enlarged Exeter, is still on the table, because it just would not work. But that is for another day.</p>

I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Bates, was not part of our debates two years ago on the 2007 Act. I am sure that we would have some very lively debates around his perspective.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000065"></a>I am conscious that a large and lively body is waiting to debate a fascinating report, so I shall make my remarks as swiftly as I can and try to pick up some rather detailed points raised especially by the noble Lord. If he will forgive me, I shall not rehearse any of the arguments that we had about the merits of moving to unitary status, nor shall I pick up most of the comments about the Merits Committee. However, I shall come back to some of the things that he said about restructuring as a whole.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000066"></a>In relation to the specific arguments, the name of Durham council has exercised a lot of people. Under the order the council could choose to call itself Durham Council, although we understand that it will call itself Durham County Council. That is slightly perverse, but that is the local choice, which is absolutely fine. I have to say that the council tax in Durham will increase by an average of 2.9 per cent, not nearly 5 per cent, because it ranges from a 1 per cent reduction in council tax for the current district of Derwentside to an increase of 4.75 per cent in Easington.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000067"></a>The point on the ceremonial issues is interesting. The parish councils, when they come into being, will be the authorities which inherit the ceremonial rights. It is very much a local decision for the new unitary council on how it manages that.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000068"></a>We had a good and extremely detailed debate the other evening on port health authorities. The point is that they are public authorities which consist either of the local authority or a joint board of a number of local authorities. If they occupy portside hereditaments, the same rating arrangements will apply to them as to anyone else. Again, it will be a matter for decision in each individual case.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000069"></a>The noble Lord mentioned the combining of these elections with the European elections. All the evidence provided by the electoral authorities suggested that they were perfectly conscious they were handling combined elections and that they had the resources to deal with them. They were not concerned about the combination of elections in that instance.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000070"></a>In relation to the River Tweed&#151;we are ranging far and wide&#151;we had discussions with the Scotland Office and will write with details on the nature of those discussions.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000071"></a>As for the quotation from the Minister in the other place, he was perfectly clear that the approach we are proposing&#151;elections in June, on the basis of 123 members&#151;will indeed give the council full democratic legitimacy as soon as possible, which will be from 4 June.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000072"></a>The noble Lord raised issues about the timetable. The Boundary Committee started work immediately after Parliament approved the order; it did not waste time. Finally, he raised issues about the Boundary Committee&#146;s undertakings on Devon. I am very glad that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, took part in this debate, given his role in Cornwall. That order related

Here we are talking about electoral boundaries, but I acknowledge that he wanted to put his point on the record.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000073"></a>On the questions raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the issue that a Member for a Cornish constituency, Julia Goldsworthy, drew attention to, we did not discuss adjusting the boundaries with either the Boundary Committee or the Electoral Commission. Even if those discussions had taken place, it would have been quite wrong, as I said, for the Government to try to adjust the electoral division boundaries on the basis of representations, because they would have been parti pris. It is not a simple decision based on local agreement; there must be objective criteria, concerns about electoral equality and community identity, and effective and convenient local government. I hope that that will satisfy the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000074"></a>The noble Baroness also asked what happens during the interregnum in terms of overview and scrutiny. Central Bedfordshire will from 1 April be a full council and will therefore have normal arrangements for its committees, including overview and scrutiny. Bedford Borough Council is a continuing council and therefore its overview and scrutiny arrangements will continue between 1 April and the election in June. We debated the difference between continuing and full councils when we looked at the original arrangements.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000075"></a>The local government pension fund in every case is vested in the responsible administering local authority. Unlike private pensions, there are no trustees and the use of local government pension funds is controlled by the superannuation legislation and pensions regulations.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000076"></a>Finally, on the political question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bates, the councils in Cheshire are in agreement that Cheshire West and Chester, which is one council, will hold the pension funds for all local government employees in Cheshire, so any outstanding difficulties there appear to have been resolved.</p>

<p><a name="09032555000078"></a><b><a name="90325-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09032555000146"></a>Lord Sutherland of Houndwood:</b> In introducing this debate, I pay tribute to those who prepared and published two previous reports on relevant and related matters: the late Lord Dainton, whose report was published in 1992, and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, happily a member of this committee and still with us, whose report was published in 2002. It is on those foundations that the present report was built, and they were the benchmarks by which we measured progress, or the lack of it, in government and public sector responses. I am also deeply indebted to the superb team of committee members, the committee secretariat and our special scientific adviser, Professor Geoff Boxshall from the Natural History Museum.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000079"></a>Let us begin at the beginning, with definitions. The opening paragraph of the report says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032555000118"></a>&#147;Taxonomy is the scientific discipline of describing, delimiting and naming organisms, both living and fossil, and systematics is the process of organising taxonomic information about organisms into a logical classification that provides the framework for all comparative studies&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032555000110"></a>If I was in any doubt about the need to restate these definitions clearly, the Word package on my computer prompted me to do so by indicating that it regarded the word &#147;systematics&#148; as of dubious provenance.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000080"></a>The next question that the report addresses is why these skills are important. Consider the case of Charles Darwin, whose 150th anniversary is, as we all know, being widely and royally celebrated this year. Question: what do Charles Darwin and Andy Capp have in common? Answer: a fascination with pigeons. For Andy Capp the fascination had to do with their racing capacities. In fact, had they been contemporaries, they might well have met, for Darwin tells us that,</p>
<ul><a name="09032555000122"></a>&#147;I have associated with several eminent fanciers, and have been permitted to join two of the London Pigeon Clubs&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032555000111"></a>There is a thought to tempt the imagination&#151;a meeting between Darwin and Andy Capp. I wonder how David Attenborough would have handled that one.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000081"></a>To return to the original point, Darwin tells us in the first chapter of <I>The Origin of Species</I> that it is always best to study some special group. His chosen example, &#147;after deliberation&#148;, was domestic pigeons. One might even say that the mighty edifice that we have come to know variously as &#147;natural selection&#148; or &#147;evolution&#148; was based initially on a minute and detailed study of what we all see daily in Trafalgar Square. But, of course, the difference is between how we see and how Darwin sees.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000082"></a>We see grey, sometimes intrusive birds whose aerial gifts are to be avoided. Darwin saw and was &#147;astonished&#148; by the variety of breeds&#151;the carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the common tumbler, the runt, the barb, the pouter, the turbit, the Jacobin, the trumpeter, the laugher, the fantail, not to mention,</p>
<ul><a name="09032555000123"></a>&#147;several other less distinct breeds (which) might be specified&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032555000112"></a>He goes on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="09032555000124"></a>&#147;at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which, if shown to an ornithologist ... would certainly be ranked by him as well-defined species&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09032555000113"></a>but not, he adds, as &#147;the same genus&#148;.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90325-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000083"></a>And so, in nine beautifully lucid pages in the opening chapter of his great book, Darwin distinguishes his interest in pigeons from those of Andy Capp and the  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC210"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC210</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tourists in Trafalgar Square. How does he do this? He sees in a different way. He provides detailed observations. He describes some experiments in breeding. He marshals his evidence. He offers a hypothesis or two. He even explains where his opponents go wrong. And so, monumentally, he begins to build the intellectual edifice which changed our understanding of the world in which we live. The Andy Capps of this world focus on details relevant only to the dual primary purpose which he saw of pigeons&#151;speed and endurance. Darwin comments that,</p>
<ul><a name="09032555000125"></a>&#147;they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they ignore all the general arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive generations&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000084"></a>So I ask again, why are taxonomy and systematics so important? I have given one example already. One answer is that they lie at the very foundation of our understanding of the natural world, and not only because Charles Darwin shows us that in a most spectacular fashion. For even if, per improbabile&#151;to invent a Latin phrase&#151;he were wrong, it would require a similarly rich cocktail of observation, experiment, analysis, hypothesis and evidence-based conclusions even to begin the argument with him. I am tempted to add, &#147;Fundamentalists please take note&#148;, but that belongs to a different debate.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000085"></a>A rather different answer to the question of importance lies in a concept which we have all learned to use with respect&#151;biodiversity. We have come to understand more fully the importance of the variety to be found in the natural world and the complex interrelations within that variety. I recently read with delight of the fact that Scotland&#151;it was not because it was Scotland; it was just a good example I happened to have to hand&#151;has amazing biodiversity: 10 species of reptiles and amphibians; 63 species of mammals; 242 species of birds; 240 species of fish; 20,000 species of plants and fungi; 24,800 species of invertebrates; and, at an estimate, 40,000 species of virus bacteria and protozoa. I dare say some noble Lords in this Room could correct me on the specific numbers, but I was simply staggered and amazed. How do we know this? Because we have in our society the skills and techniques of taxonomy and systematics.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000086"></a>Of course, a fundamental and important question follows: does it matter that we know this? The answer is a resounding yes, for many reasons. The big reason is that changes in biodiversity can be either consequences or harbingers of climate change. Equally important, therefore, is to enhance even further our ability to measure changes in biodiversity, and that requires the skills of taxonomy and systematics.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000087"></a>The implications of these measurements for food supply and safety are central to our capacity as a race, let alone as a society, to prepare for that change. The absence of bees and butterflies, of which we heard something last summer and the summer before it, will affect my crops of fruit and vegetables, but their continued presence has much greater significance than that&#151;ultimately, the capacity of the human race to feed itself.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000088"></a>If changes in biodiversity have such potential gravity, the importance of the study of taxonomy and systematics is beyond question. For coherent thought and therefore  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC211"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC211</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>policy preparedness in such matters, the measurement and analysis of change in the biodiversity of our community is essential. For that, we need taxonomists and practitioners of systematic biology.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000089"></a>I began by setting out the social and economic reasons for the importance of these disciplines, because I realise that I am in a political context and utilitarian arguments are important. The disciplines are essential for our survival as a human race. Other important arguments will be elaborated by my colleagues who speak after me. I shall briefly mention just two by way of an amuse-bouche for the wider discussion that will follow.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000090"></a>First, sheer intellectual curiosity about the natural world is of value in itself. From a utilitarian point of view, that almost always has to be the forerunner of the technologies and understandings which change our society for the better. Sheer intellectual curiosity is a driving point. The pursuit of such curiosity must be based, as it was in Darwin&#146;s case, on observation, experiment, analysis and evidence-based argument, and on learning to see as a taxonomist and as a systematician. It must be based on taxonomy and systematics.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000091"></a>I advance a further argument. In this country, due in part to our adventurous history during the past 200 or 300 years, we have three of the most important, relevant collections in the world: in the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, in the Natural History Museum and in the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. These collections must be curated, maintained and expanded; we have an intellectual as well as a moral responsibility to do so. Other societies, some of which were once our colonies, are often the source of these collections. They will want to use them as reference points for understanding changes in their own regional biodiversity. Whether we like it or not, we are the curators; we are responsible for the maintenance and expansion of those collections.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000092"></a>I have given two examples&#151;there are many others&#151;of why the disciplines are important. I turn briefly to how we assess government awareness and policy in these matters. First, I acknowledge and thank the Government, whose response indicates acceptance of a number of our central recommendations. There has been significant progress following the reports of 1992 and 2002, and the signs are that, with the help of our continued prompting&#151;and that is a manifesto of the Science and Technology Committee&#151;there will be further progress from 2009.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000093"></a>I shall give some examples of acceptances and moving forward. NERC will commission a study which will deal, I hope, with our concerns about numbers of future scientists in this area&#151;so there will be hard evidence. NERC and the Natural History Museum have agreed to study further the national priorities that we should formulate in this area. BBSRC and NERC will provide funds for the development of a road map for delivery of internet-based taxonomy. I am happy to say on a very specific point that our pleas concerning the needs of the fungal reference collection at Kew have been heard and, in part, answered.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000094"></a>There are a number of further positive responses that will doubtless be discussed by my colleagues, one of which I will mention because I am particularly  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC212"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pleased by it. In their response, the Government imply an understanding of the importance of biodiversity-related topics in schools. However, lest the Minister believe that he can now relax, I reassure him that there is a &#147;can-do-better&#148; coda to this report, and doubtless we will hear much of that in the debate that follows.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000095"></a>I highlight two examples to which, for various reasons, I attach particular importance in that regard. The first is the rejection of our recommendation that there should be a lead department in this area. We thought hard about that, and we had many arguments for and against. We came to the conclusion that a lead department would enhance our capacity significantly in important respects. The policy needs in this area are great. Significant developments of policy will be required whether we, or the Government, like it or not. Their commitment to one of their central focuses being climate change indicates that, for the reasons I have already given, a lead needs to be taken, rather than things falling between the cracks. That is at the core of our recommendation and our disappointment that it has not been accepted. We see that there are dangers to our traditional strengths in the supply of sufficient numbers of well trained people in these fields.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000096"></a>My second example also perhaps relates to the need for a lead department. We noted that the notion of co-ordination, or joined-up government, as it was once called, was not being fully exercised. A good example is an apparent failure on the part of the government response properly to consult the regime in Scotland. The evidence for that is a short and rather pathetic paragraph&#151;I speak now as a Scot&#151;that apparently summarises its response to what we believe is quite a significant report. That is underlined by the fact that one of the three great national collections is in Edinburgh, and therefore significantly the responsibility of the current Scottish Parliament. There was a lack of joined-upness there, which was a pity. I hope that we can do better next time.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000097"></a>I look forward to the contributions that are to come, including the Minister&#146;s response. I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="09032555000133"></a>4.58 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09032555000098"></a><b><a name="90325-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09032555000147"></a>Lord Haskel:</b> I join the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, in thanking our clerks and our special adviser for all their hard work. The noble Lord reminded us that your Lordships&#146; committee has been concerned about the state of systematics and taxonomy since 1992. Since then we have been bringing this concern to the attention of the Government by reports, follow-up reports, correspondence and debate. Frankly, we are not sure if the decline has been halted or reversed. Have committee members been banging their heads up against a brick wall, or are we getting somewhere by wearing away the stone with a constant drip,  drip, drip?</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000099"></a>I apologise to my academic colleagues, who are probably giving me nought out of 10 on my report card for mixing my metaphors. I agree with the noble Lord that we are getting somewhere&#151;but my metaphors are mixed because the messages are mixed, as are the messages from the Government. The greatest mixed message of all is the assurance that Defra will monitor the ecosystem. That requires the expertise of taxonomists,  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC213"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but nobody is sure if there are going to be a sufficient number to carry out the work. We are told that the NERC will commission a study this year to find out the number and trends. Hopefully, we will then know.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000100"></a>We are all agreed that web-based taxonomy is having, and will have, an enormous impact on taxonomy services and knowledge. We believe that a road map for delivering internet-based taxonomy should be developed. But the Government are referring to biodiversity data, whereas the committee wants to use the internet as a means of identification. Is that a mixed message or just confusion?</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000101"></a>During our debate with the Government there has been an exchange of views about the management and culture of science within the Government. The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, explained the importance of understanding environmental sustainability. This is why taxonomy and systematics should be firmly in a powerful lead government department, such as DIUS&#151;a department strong enough to halt its decline. At present, though, the responsibility for systematics and taxonomy is spread over many departments.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000102"></a>Again, the response we get is mixed. We are told that the Government&#146;s role in science is to set the overarching strategy, and it is left to the research councils and others to decide how research money is spent, yet we are told that occasionally cases arise where Ministers rightly provide strategic direction. Is that a message to try harder to persuade the Government that systematics and taxonomy are of sufficient importance for Ministers to give strategic direction? Or is it a message saying, &#147;Don&#146;t talk to us, talk to the research councils and others&#148;?</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000103"></a>I come back to my original question: are our concerns being acknowledged and acted upon or are they being ignored? Our concerns are clear&#151;recruitment, funding, governance, availability and distribution of knowledge&#151;but the response is mixed. Yes, there will be a study of numbers and trends; yes, there will be dialogue on priorities and some work on distribution. Very good, but is it enough?</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000104"></a>I am a lay member of this committee. I do not have any special scientific knowledge. But our report reflects the thoughts of many well informed people who are concerned that if we do not boost the taxonomic community, both professional and voluntary, then we will miss out on some important aspects of environmental sustainability through ignorance or neglect.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09032555000105"></a>I am an unashamed supporter of this Government. I know that the economic crisis dominates government thinking at the moment, as it should. But fairly soon politics will be moving into election mode, a time when many issues are raised and when perhaps climate change will again come to the top of the agenda. During that debate, it would be nice for the Government to be able to say yes, we listened to your concerns about ecosystem services and have done something about it. There is nothing mixed about that message.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC214"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and taxonomy. I can record with some pride that I am the only person, I think, who has served on all three committees. I know that others present gave evidence in 1992, but I suspect that I am the only survivor of the committee, so at least I represent historical continuity. I am certainly familiar with some of the issues that are pleaded on behalf of the systematics community, and indeed with some of the criticisms, which should be acknowledged, that sometimes the taxonomic community does not always sell its wares as effectively as the user community would wish.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000002"></a>The 1992 report chaired by Lord Dainton was well timed. That was the year we signed the Convention on Biological Diversity at the Earth Summit at Rio. With that, we assumed responsibilities formally&#151;to which I hope we had already committed ourselves both nationally and internationally&#151;for conservation of the diversity of species and to put policies in place, both nationally and internationally, to achieve just that. We see that working through the system at the moment. We should give credit to the Government&#151;to successive Governments in fact&#151;for having led the way in many ways on national conservation policies. They have not always been effective&#151;that is the nature of things&#151;but at least a big subject has been addressed.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000003"></a>Since 1992 the agenda has changed. As we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, it has become more immediate. Climate change was obviously not the issue in 1992 that it is today. There was concern about deforestation, which has certainly increased; land-use change; overexploitation of natural resources; and the limited availability of water, not just for our own purposes but to sustain habitats, particularly those that rely on water for their nature. In all these areas systematic biology has a role, some would say a fundamental role. After all, you cannot conserve something unless you understand it. However, we have to acknowledge that taxonomy and systematics is only one of the scientific disciplines that has to be brought to bear on these issues, and it is there to complement, to provide underpinning and to provide the fundamental understanding of the contribution of other scientific approaches which are critical.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000004"></a>I must declare two interests: I chair the trustees at Kew and the partners board of the Living with Environmental Change programme. I mention that programme in particular because it is mentioned at paragraph 3.21 of the government response as one of the interdisciplinary programmes that will determine what issues taxonomy and systematics can contribute to. That is absolutely right. Living with Environmental Change is an umbrella programme straddling all the research councils and a number of government departments, including the Environment Agency and many others. It is all about collaboration on meeting these environmental changes, not just climate change. I suspect that taxonomy and systematics will indeed make a contribution to just about every programme, whether it is to do with the environment and human health, the depletion of natural resources, land-use change, and much else. It is one contribution alongside others.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000005"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, reminded us&#151;I am sure that this is absolutely correct&#151;whether we like it or not, we have inherited a historical obligation.  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC215"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We have these national collections. These are the type specimens, the voucher specimens, for countries, not just our colonies, all around the world. You have to refer to these specimens if you are to determine the nature of your diversity and the extent to which it is changing. Indeed, the astonishingly effective modern techniques of DNA sequencing and the like still ultimately rely on these voucher specimens to determine the type specimens. Whether we like it or not, the Natural History Museum, Kew and Edinburgh have not just a moral obligation but&#151;something rather stronger&#151;a duty to curate those specimens as well as add to them.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000006"></a>That is what is happening. With the increased interest arising from the Convention on Biological Diversity, most member states which have signed that agreement are progressing well on preparing their conservation plans and that obviously requires an inventory of the habitats they value most. That means that we get specimens coming back to the Natural History Museum, Kew or Edinburgh. The speed of accessions is increasing and it is actually a problem keeping up. It is a question not only of curation but of working on these specimens. Modern molecular morphological phylogenetics, which is determining the evolutionary relationship of these species, is advancing enormously fast with the new techniques to which I referred.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000007"></a>If we are to measure how successful taxonomy and systematics are in serving the user community, we have to ask not just whether we are continuing to collect and identify new specimens or curate existing specimens but, much more practically and more importantly, whether this information is useful. Can people access it? Is it relevant to the sort of studies that are arising from our obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international obligations?</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000008"></a>The measure of output is quite a challenge, and this is where I think we have to ensure that the taxonomic community&#151;led, one would hope, by a government department, but at least by a champion within government&#151;has a sort of checklist from time to time. What is the product of taxonomy and systematics? Is it helpful? Does the user community find it timely and relevant? Are we developing a better understanding of the role of individual species in ecosystems? From that, does a prediction flow of which habitats are vulnerable? It should. Is there a determination of which management policies would be most appropriate for these ecosystems, and a formulation of conservation policies and restoration policy programmes? I am delighted to say that, as a result of the seed bank programme that Kew introduced at the turn of the millennium, we are now seeing this part of the collection being used for restoration ecology around the world. It is a great success for those who had the vision 12 or more years ago to start that very ambitious programme.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000009"></a>I have referred to the great advances in recent years in phylogeny&#151;that is, determining how organisms are evolutionarily related. I do not think that there is any doubt that the integration of phylogeny into other areas of biological research has become standard. However, the area where there is continual debate&#151;and the written evidence is in the report&#151;is what is usually described as &#147;descriptive taxonomy&#148;. The problem, which causes people to throw their hands up in the air  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC216"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with horror, is that there is never an end to it. However, there has to be some determination of priorities. We can probably list all the plants and vertebrates. In 2010, we are due to do what Darwin asked for&#151;that is, to produce the definitive list of plants in the world. It will be a draft list, not a definitive one, but at last a list is coming out. However, no one is going to attempt to do that for invertebrates or nematodes and many other such species. Therefore, when you come to descriptive taxonomy, you clearly have to determine priorities and this is the difficult area.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000010"></a>The other problem, which is always being addressed by the taxonomic community, with perfect justification, is that taxonomy in universities has melted away, or at least there is very little left. Our three reports seem to suggest that the United Kingdom is particularly bad in this respect, but it is also true of Europe and other countries. Therefore, the obligation to do training and research in taxonomy falls more and more on the national centres of excellence: the Natural History Museum, Kew, Edinburgh and, indeed, regional universities. That, again, is an inescapable fact, although I should not give the impression that no systematics is going on in universities. The modern techniques to which I referred&#151;relying on DNA sequencing and  the like&#151;clearly does happen in universities and is a growth area.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000011"></a>So we need appropriately qualified specialists to carry out this inventory and these conservation assessments in areas to be agreed as priorities. Someone has to determine priorities. There is always an individual who determines for himself what he or she wants to work on, but that is not good enough. There has to be international collaboration; we cannot all duplicate, and we must certainly think of ourselves as Europeans, and perhaps as a much wider community. As has been said, it is essential to embrace these exciting new practices in the web-based environment. That is much easier for new accessions&#151;you can put them on to the web because you collect them in a form that is immediately available. It is much harder when 250 years or more of material has to be digitised, put on the web and made accessible. That is essential. The report says that the taxonomic community needs more money for this. In practice, there are charities around the world that we rely on&#151;American charities and one or two others. The sums are enormous and it will take a long time  for even the priority areas to be fully digitised, cross- referenced and accessible, but that must be determined as a priority.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000012"></a>The way in which these issues have shot up the agenda arises from the consequences of the Convention on Biological Diversity. I know that the Addison rules prevent me from speaking in any sense for Kew; therefore, I cannot thank the Government for their support on mycology, but were I allowed to do so I certainly would have wished to. I remind the Committee to what extent mycology has collapsed. In the 1992 report, we pointed out that plants and fungi go together in many communities; you really cannot study one without the other, certainly when it comes to restoration. But mycology is in dire straits, more or less, as it was in 1992, and I am delighted that there has been some temporary support.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000013"></a>Why does the Science and Technology Committee keep on returning to this issue? Some people must think that we are obsessed with it. The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, made it very clear how central it is to so many policies. If there remains a concern, it is that because this is an area which can and should contribute to any number of scientific endeavours to underpin policy, it is for the taxonomic community to demonstrate effectively what its role is, how it can contribute and how it can ensure that it is focused on the areas of greatest priority. It is reasonable for the Government and the research councils&#151;not just NERC&#151;to engage in a debate with the systematics community to make it clear what is expected and to measure the outputs so that some sort of clarity is achieved. At the moment it is fragmented and, as the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, pointed out, there seems to be a lack of adequate consultation between government departments in formulating the first response&#151;at least as far as the Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh, was concerned.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000014"></a>There is a live issue here: we keep on challenging the taxonomic community to make itself relevant, to be focused and to underpin. It points out that because of a lack of recruitment, training and research, some areas of its discipline is declining, although not all. That is why, ultimately, an overall review would be enormously helpful to that community.</p>

<p><a name="09032562000016"></a>I mention FRS because, as will emerge in my remarks, one of the problems we have encountered is a feeling that much of descriptive taxonomy is not a sexy subject. On the other hand, it is worth emphasising that the Royal Society, which is often thought of as a rather stuffy institution, has elected in recent years quite a few taxonomists and systematists, not all molecular people but many classical people who would be at home in a 19th-century institution. We need to recognise that.</p>

<p><a name="09032562000017"></a>I begin with a digression that will circle back to relevance. On a personal note, I find one of the extraordinarily interesting features of the House of Lords Select Committees&#151;no other country&#146;s upper house can say this&#151;is the way we can put together, partly but by no means exclusively through the Cross Benches, individuals with the highest levels of expertise, authority and standing in the subject under study. At its best, this leads to a harmonious engagement between civil servants and Ministers, who can take advantage of constructive reviews to reinforce strengths and to address weaknesses. It is like the visiting committees that well run universities bring in every couple of years to take a critical view of departments. At its best, I have had the pleasure and privilege of being involved in some things; on the other hand, at its worst, you tend to get a clash between independent expert opinion&#151;which, admittedly, can sometimes shade into independent expert opinionatedness, but which is

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000018"></a>The saga that has already been sketched a couple of times about the taxonomy and systematics Select Committee 1 in 1992, Select Committee 2 in 2002 and Select Committee 3 in 2008 has interesting examples of the best and the worst. That brings me to the wonder and hope that the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, will still be around for taxonomy and systematics Select Committee 4 in four years&#146; time.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000019"></a>Amusingly, my noble friend Lord Krebs and I appeared together as a duo on the 1992 committee. Lord Dainton&#146;s inquiry had good outcomes, partly, but by no means wholly, because my noble friend Lord Krebs shortly afterwards took over as the chief executive of the Natural Environmental Research Council. The 2002 inquiry of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, also revisited many of the things that had been promised but had not been done and had another go at things that had not been accepted. There has again been some progress. From what we have heard and what has been described&#151;I shall not revisit this in any detail&#151;there have been some good things and some bad things, and I shall speak to two particular bad things.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000020"></a>However, before I do so, let me reinforce some of the good things, but in a shaded way for one of them. The NERC is to commission a study of the state of taxonomy, including the number of taxonomists, trends, job openings and so on. This goes back to 1992, when it was called for but not done. This prompted me at the time to get together with Kevin Gaston in the Natural History Museum to produce a paper in <I>Nature</I> on the taxonomy of taxonomists. Part of the fault is that the taxonomy community is not as introspective as it could perhaps productively be and, shamelessly to digress, it is a community where roughly one-third of it works on vertebrates, particularly birds and mammals; roughly one-third of it works on plants of all kinds; and roughly one third of it works on invertebrates, the small things that arguably run the world. In fact, if you use the number of species, both known and probably there but not yet known, in relation to the workforce, the workforce is out of whack with its proper job description by a factor of 10 vertebrates to plants and a factor of 100 invertebrates to vertebrates. I digress, but that is a very welcome study.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000021"></a>The conjunction between the Natural Environmental Research Council and the Natural History Museum to convene a dialogue on priorities for the UK systematics community is praiseworthy, as is Defra&#146;s recognition of its proper obligation to bring the fungal collection from CABI into Kew. The commitment by NERC and SERC to web-based taxonomy has been welcomed, but, even here is a foreshadowing of the negative points on which I shall now dwell, because absent in those plans is a commitment to the associated taxonomy qua taxonomy; as, for example, simply in online identification tools.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000022"></a>The first of the two hobbyhorses that I wish to ride, I shall ride briefly, and it pertains to the Department for International Development. Our committee recommended in its report,</p>
<ul><a name="09032562000120"></a>&#147;digitisation projects that focus on the biodiversity conservation and sustainability needs of developing countries&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC219"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC219</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09032562000109"></a>This was sent to DfID&#146;s address. The recommendation is a paraphrase of DfID&#146;s stated priorities; that is, the sustainability needs of developing countries. In a tour de force of cognitive dissonance, DfID&#146;s response was to reject that recommendation on the ground that it did not match its priorities. I would ask the luckless Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, whose fault it is not, whether that is one of the things that he would undertake to address in connection with DfID. The response was a little puzzling, although&#151;I shamelessly and probably improperly digress again&#151;I half suspect that it might be a hangover from agitated interaction between DfID and the Royal Society five years ago, when I was its president and Clare Short was the Secretary of State, over the department&#146;s plans essentially to dismantle long-standing research collaboration with developing countries in Africa, partly on the ridiculous grounds that such tertiary education projects in countries that were in crying need of primary education were elitist and therefore taboo. That disappeared with Clare Short&#146;s tenancy of that office, and Hilary Benn quickly righted it, but I suspect that in some dark corner of DfID is the person who rejected that recommendation.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000023"></a>There are two more serious, overarching themes. One of them has been referred to already, although it will not prevent me revisiting it; namely, the lack of a lead department to co-ordinate addressing issues which involve in various combinations, at the very least, six government departments: DIUS, DfID, Defra, DCMS, which funds the research in the Natural History Museum, the FCO, which is responsible for overseas territories&#151;I could speak also about those, but I shall let them go&#151;and Research Councils UK, which, when I had tenancy of the Office of Science and Technology, was effectively a ring-fenced entity, separate from the DTI.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000024"></a>The second of my concerns is the seeming lack of awareness of the nature of the subject of taxonomy and systematics, much less of its current health, within Research Councils UK more generally. Our worry about that is expressed quite trenchantly in the report. Particular emphasis was laid on the Natural Environment Research Council, whose approach we found &#147;confused&#148;, but there is a more general failure of co-ordination in Research Councils UK.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000025"></a>I return to the theme with which Professor Sutherland began by quoting from an article written by Dr Sandy Knapp in the magazine of the Linnean Society of London, in which she pointed out that the scientific world was different in the day of Charles Darwin. In those days, it was natural history. Observation and description were very much a part of mainstream science, whereas today there is often a feeling that biology means work in laboratories and testing hypotheses. We encountered that in an explicit quote from the Natural Environment Research Council, which said in response to our worries:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032562000115"></a>&#147;Research proposals including classical taxonomic approaches may have the best chance of success if they take account of ... the hypothesis testing science that typifies responsive mode grants&#148;.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000026"></a>In more detail, NERC spends only about a quarter of its money on responsive mode, responding to the best proposal&#151;blue skies; about a quarter on proposals directed in particular areas, not one of which encompasses taxonomy and systematics; and half on national  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC220"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC220</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>capabilities, which are mainly its own institutions. That is a bit of a change from when John Cadogan was head of the Office of Science and Technology. Our aim then was that half the money should go on responsive mode. That means asking the best people to say what the best proposals are. The notion that they have to be judged against some simple-minded notion of how you do science by testing hypotheses is just plain batty. It is ignorant and it is stupid. I have lived four decades of lucky life in a variety of areas, and there is no recipe for doing science. Certainly an important ingredient is just doing descriptive things.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000027"></a>In conclusion, I seriously hope that the rejection of the idea of a lead department responsible for co-ordinating the various needs that we will hear more about will be yet one more time revisited and that abrupt rejection overturned.</p>

<p><a name="09032562000031"></a>I join with others to congratulate the chairman of the committee, the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, and the supporting staff, whom I found particularly helpful. I was very pleased to be invited by the chairman to serve as a co-opted member of a committee on systematics and taxonomy, as in my early scientific days, I started off as a systematist interested in taxonomy. My particular interest was in metazoan invertebrates and their role in disease, particularly nematodes and transmitting arthropods.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000032"></a>The committee concluded that systematics and taxonomy are of fundamental importance to our understanding of the natural world and, I would add, to a full understanding of the threats of pathogens, their transmission and their control. These pathogens are at the periphery of our country and will come out in the tropics we know not when.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000033"></a>The committee also concluded that disciplines such as sequencing and taxonomy were in decline in the United Kingdom and that if that decline were allowed to continue, there would be serious consequences for the country&#146;s ability to deliver a host of policy aims, including disease identification and surveillance of exotic threats, and an effective response to climate change, wildlife biology, and so on. We said that the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills should take a lead role, a recommendation which was not accepted. In particular, the report identified fungal taxonomic problems. Fortunately, that has now been attended to, at least partially. My noble friend Lord Selborne has a strong association with Kew and, no doubt, will be guiding the work there.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000034"></a>Another area where taxonomic development is hard hit is entomology. An excellent article in the February issue of <I>Biologist</I> by Dr Simon Leather of Imperial College London gives a succinct analysis of the future  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC221"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC221</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of entomology, while one of his colleagues has written bluntly that British entomology may be on the verge of extinction. The decline has been progressive since the 1970s. Although there was only one entomological department in the United Kingdom at that time and one BSc entomology degree, at Imperial College, seven UK universities offered a degree in agricultural zoology, essentially specialising in entomology and parasitology, including plant nemotology. Now there are no entomology departments, no undergraduate entomology degrees and only one Master of Science degree in entomology, which is at Imperial College. Typically, students registered for zoology or biology degrees will cover the whole of invertebrates in 12 lectures.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000035"></a>Hitherto, much of the enthusiasm for entomology has been taken up by amateurs, who have often been parsons and other men of the cloth who have studied part time. Some of us will be familiar with the natural philosophy or natural biology of so-and-so in so-and-so village. Here, too, there has been a marked 35 per cent decline in membership of the Amateur Entomological Society.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000036"></a>When exotic disease strikes this country, as it has quite recently with bluetongue, there is a scramble for experts who can identify the transmitting insects&#151;the Culicoides, or midges, as they are often called&#151;to assess the vector potential of the various strains of the midge. Although we do a reasonable job, we have to rely somewhat on people on the continent of Europe to help us out. The number of species in the phylum Arthropodium is massive. Many of them are still unknown and likely to remain so until we have many more people looking at them in detail. The dearth of entomologists and the lack of entomological training are an important issue. That should be compared with the vertebrate situation where, with few exceptions, the fauna is well known, well studied and well written up.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000037"></a>How do we compare with other countries? The country that I know best is the United States, where I worked for 15 years. Now, with homeland security developments, it is keen to develop science across the board, including invertebrate science. For example, in the United States there are 16 universities with departments of entomology, offering Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in entomology, and an additional 22 universities that offer entomological minors.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000038"></a>In the United States, the major funding agencies&#151;the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation&#151;are aware of the importance of entomology, and grant applications to these bodies in entomology, for example, are given the same scrutiny as other proposals via the section on tropical medicine and parasitology, of which I declare an interest, having been the chairman of that study group several years ago. Additionally, the US army and US navy have their funded research programmes, although I understand that the navy is closing down its research facilities.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000039"></a>The problems in the United Kingdom are not unique in Europe. For example, in France concern has been expressed about the shortage of medical and veterinary entomologists. At present, there are approximately 100 such people, of whom half are over 50. That indicates that recruitment is not as good as it should be.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC222"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000040"></a>In my opening comments, I mentioned my interest in nematodes, which includes parasitic as well as free-living and soil parasitic nematodes. Often, soil nematodes are included with arthropods&#151;wrongly, of course; nevertheless one has to put up with it. However, as with arthropods, little is known about the free-living nematodes, except where they cause plant diseases, such as the genus Caenorhabditis, which has been used at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge in the development of a vast understanding of cell biology. As with many other invertebrates, their importance could be crucial, especially where climate change may cause changes in their populations and also in relation to their vector potential for viruses and other pathogens.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000041"></a>I have pointed out on more than one occasion that with parasitic nematodes, which cause disease in man and animals, the free-living stages that occur in the soil vastly outnumber the parasitic forms that occur inside animals or humans. We know so little about them but suspect much of them. An example of this suspicion, although we do not know it for certain, is their role in the genetic exchange of anti-parasitic resistance between the parasitic stages that occur in the soil.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000042"></a>Having been somewhat negative about science and the support for science, I am pleased to acknowledge what I consider to be an innovative project on the gene sequencing of Caenorhabditis in California, USA, in relation to these free-living forms of parasitic nematodes. It will provide a strong base for diagnosis, surveillance, the development of anti-parasitic compounds and a better understanding of drug resistance and vaccine production. As I said, much basic information has been gleaned on cell replication biology by the study of these free-living nematodes at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000043"></a>The downstream application of the genome sequence data will provide a powerful tool for the way in which we do science in the field. Especially, it will provide enhanced preparedness for potential exotic invaders. I have often said that the price of freedom from exotic infections, which is likely to increase with climate change, is constant vigilance with regard to what is going on. For constant vigilance, a stronger base of systematics and taxonomy than we have at present is needed.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000045"></a>Following the 1992 Dainton report, I prepared a separate report for the Natural Environment Research Council on taxonomy. I then became the chief executive of NERC and had the pleasure of implementing my own recommendations, which included the introduction

I should also mention an interest as chairman of the Natural History Museum in Oxford.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000046"></a>I re-read my 1992 report just before the debate and the questions that we are raising now have a depressing ring of familiarity about them. It is almost as though there has been a dialogue of the deaf between the Select Committee and the taxonomy community on the one hand, and the Government on the other. I hope that the Government&#146;s ears are open and listening today.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000047"></a>In my contribution I will refer to three topics, some of which have been covered but bear repeating. First, I will make a brief comment on why taxonomy matters; secondly, I will refer to the current lack of strategic vision in the UK; and, thirdly, I will speak about the role of regional museums.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000048"></a>In his novel <I>The Magic Mountain</I>, Thomas Mann wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032562000116"></a>&#147;You ask what is the use of classification, arrangement, systematization. I answer you: order and simplification are the first steps toward the mastery of a subject&#151;the actual enemy is the unknown&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032562000110"></a>Taxonomy is the science of bringing order and simplification to the bewildering diversity of the natural world. Indeed, Carl Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist and father of taxonomy, liked to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032562000117"></a>&#147;Deus creavit, Linnaeus disposuit&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09032562000111"></a>which translates as,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032562000118"></a>&#147;God created, Linnaeus organized&#148;.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000049"></a>Linnaeus based his classification on observable anatomical characteristics of plants and animals. While many present day taxonomists still rely on such features, molecular taxonomy, which relies on gene sequences, has, to a substantial degree, eclipsed the more traditional methods of determining the relationships among living organisms. Increasingly in the future, taxonomy will be based on gene sequences and be internet-based. This reality should be recognised in any future strategy for this country.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000050"></a>As we heard in the introductory speech of the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, classification reflects the evolutionary tree of life. This was famously enunciated in the debate in Oxford on 30 June 1860 between Bishop Wilberforce and Thomas Henry Huxley when the Bishop&#151;described on another occasion by Disraeli as &#147;unctuous, oleaginous and saponaceous&#148;&#151;asked Huxley whether he was descended from a monkey on his grandmother&#146;s or his grandfather&#146;s side. In the oft-quoted reply, Huxley said that he was not ashamed to have a monkey for his ancestor but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth. One member of the audience, a certain Lady Brewster, is said to have fainted.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000051"></a>Thanks to modern molecular taxonomy, things have moved on. Lady Brewster would surely have fainted all over again had she read the <I>Sun</I> headline on 20 June 2007, &#147;Grandad was an anchovy&#148;. It is pretty unusual for the <I>Sun</I> to carry major stories about taxonomy, but this one was a blockbuster. Gene sequences have shown that an eldritch and unprepossessing fish-like sand-dwelling marine animal called amphioxus is close to the 550 million year-old common ancestor of all  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC224"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC224</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>vertebrates, including you and me. It has many blocks of genes in common with humans, a phenomenon known as synteny.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000052"></a>As we have heard, taxonomy is not only intellectually exciting, it has many practical applications. Let me provide just one instance. We know from taxonomic and phylogenetic studies based on gene sequences that the virus that causes AIDS, HIV, has been transmitted to man more than once from chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys, and first became established in humans in Kinshasa in the middle of the last century. Taxonomy of the AIDS virus today provides essential information for public health issues such as the spread of drug-resistant mutations and the introduction of new strains by immigration. Taxonomy of the AIDS virus also proved the innocence of Bulgarian nurses who were under a death sentence in Libya for allegedly transmitting the virus in a children&#146;s hospital.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000053"></a>If taxonomy is so interesting and so important, what is the problem that has led the Select Committee to hold three inquiries in the past 17 years? The problem with taxonomy, in my view, is that it is an underpinning science for a whole host of other branches of biology. Indeed, no experimental or observational scientific paper in biology can be published without reference to taxonomy, since the author must refer to the species that he or she has studied. The fact that taxonomy is underpinning means that too many of the funders of research take it for granted or believe that it has all been done. However, as we have heard, taxonomy is by no means a completed task but a rapidly changing branch of biology. In my research career, the group of species that I have spent many decades of my life studying, the Paridae or titmice, are now designated as belonging to different genera, whereas 30 years ago when I started out on my research they all belonged to one genus.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000054"></a>I repeat, taxonomy is part of the infrastructure that enables biologists, whatever their field of interest, to carry out and report their work. However, while in areas such as space science, particle physics, oceanography and molecular biology the research councils and the Government accept the need to invest substantial sums in underpinning infrastructure, this is, sadly, not true of taxonomy. There simply has been and is no strategic programme of investment in research or training in taxonomy. Nor did we detect in our inquiry any associated strategic direction for the subject, although we hope that as a result of our recommendations that strategic direction should appear. All the funders of taxonomy from whom we took evidence said that they were users of taxonomy, not funders of the underpinning scientific knowledge.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000055"></a>We are all users of the roads and the trains, but someone has to take responsibility for building and maintaining them. The same is true of taxonomy. As we have heard, the situation is exacerbated by the lack of leadership among government departments. Although we heard claims of co-ordination, a more honest  and accurate claim would be one of confusion. I hope that in his response the Minister will assure us that  if we come back to this in five years the situation  will have changed, there will be a strategic vision for the future of taxonomy and there will be a lead government department.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000056"></a>I turn now to the national and regional taxonomic collections. The major centres in the UK for taxonomic work are the natural history museums and botanical gardens. As we have heard, for historical reasons the UK has some of the world&#146;s most important, indeed astounding, taxonomic collections, which serve as reference material for researchers all over the world and as places for taxonomic research and education. They also have&#151;this has not yet been mentioned and I shall elaborate on it in a moment&#151;a major role in public outreach. I shall give noble Lords some figures. The Natural History Museum in London houses an estimated 70 million specimens, the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew well over 6 million, and the national museums and gardens of the devolved countries collectively also well over 6 million specimens. However, the English regional collections are also of great importance. The second largest collection in England is in Oxford, with more than 6 million specimens in the Natural History Museum and the Fielding-Druce Herbarium, and Cambridge and Manchester also have very large and important collections.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000057"></a>How are these institutions in England funded? Kew and the Natural History Museum in London, as we have already heard, receive grants-in-aid from Defra and DCMS, but the regional museums do not. Our recommendation 3.29 was that the Government provide continuity of funding for regional museums but the response from DCMS, in my view, was disappointingly vague. I hope that the Minister will confirm to us that DCMS will indeed provide a guaranteed continuity of funding for the regional museums in England and for the important work that they do.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000058"></a>I return, finally, to the role of museums and collections in education. Our recommendation 3.28 referred to the disappearance of taxonomy and biodiversity from the school curriculum. In their positive reply, the Government recognised this issue and, among other things, referred to the role of the Natural History Museum in London in providing high quality out-of-classroom learning.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90325-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000059"></a>I emphasise that, in addition to the Natural History Museum in London, which does a superb job, the regional museums also play a key role. I have some illustrative figures for the Natural History Museum in Oxford. It is visited by 72 per cent of the primary schools and 94 per cent of the secondary schools in the local education authority area, and the majority of these visiting groups receive a taught session from an education officer. More than 400,000 visitors arrived at the museum last year, many of them children, and more than 1 million visitors went to the website, yet the funding for this important work is very precarious. I am sure that similar figures could be produced for the other major regional museums. Again, I hope that the Minister will confirm that the Government are committed to continuing their funding for educational and outreach work in regional, as well as national, museums and collections.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000060"></a>I end with a quotation from the late American biologist and writer, Stephen Jay Gould. In his book <I>Wonderful Life</I> he writes:</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC226"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC226</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032562000119"></a>&#147;Taxonomy (the science of classification) is often undervalued as a glorified form of filing, with each species in its folder, like a stamp in its prescribed place in an album: but taxonomy is a fundamental and dynamic science, dedicated to exploring the causes of relationships and similarities among organisms. Classifications are theories about the basis of natural order, not dull catalogues compiled only to avoid chaos&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032562000112"></a>I hope that the Minister&#146;s reply will both be more than a dull catalogue and show how the Government intend to avoid future chaos in their approach to taxonomy.</p>

As I listened, it occurred to me that, had the Minister not had such an eminent background, he might have been slightly intimidated by the galaxy of scientific talent ranged against him today, of which I count myself as very much the most junior. However,  I am sure that none of them would dream of using their great gifts to obscure the truth, to quote the noble Lord, Lord Krebs.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000062"></a>The committee was very well served by its scientific adviser, Professor Boxshall, its Clerk, Christine Salmon Percival, and her team, and its chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, who today has given me a unique experience, as I never expected to hear Andy Capp debated in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000063"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, and others have said, the Science and Technology Committee seems to return to the issue of systematic and taxonomy with monotonous regularity. However, one should not confuse the word &#147;monotonous&#148; with the word &#147;boring&#148;. The subject matter of the report and this debate is far from boring; indeed, it relates to one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines affecting our ability to survive the threat of climate change and to mitigate the effects of man&#146;s activities on the biodiversity of the planet. That is why we keep returning to it. The noble Lord, Lord Krebs, underlined its underpinning role in many scientific disciplines, and the subtitle of my 2002 report made reference to the fact that it is the science underpinning conservation.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000064"></a>Maintaining the biodiversity that this generation has inherited on our blue and green planet is one of our most serious responsibilities. There are those who think it is easy and we just have to stop doing a lot of the things we are doing; there are those who think it is impossible; and there are those in the middle ground, like me, who believe that we can tackle the threat of climate change by making sensible adjustments to our lifestyle that will not cause us too much grief nor hinder the development of less developed countries, which have a right to strive to live as comfortably as we do.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000065"></a>We must take action to reduce emissions, of course, but at the same time we must protect the living things of this planet, living within their carefully balanced ecosystems which are so easily upset. During the past 200 to 300 years, man has upset numerous ecosystems to the extent that plants and animals living in them have suffered and even died out because we have either destroyed their habitat or modified their climate so much that they cannot survive. Unlike animals, plants cannot get up on their legs or their wings and walk or

Here I declare an interest as chairman of the board of Botanic Gardens Conservation International, an international charity that co-ordinates the expertise available within botanic gardens to secure plant diversity according to internationally agreed priorities. By the way, I was invited to take up that post as a result of chairing the committee&#146;s previous report on this subject in 2002.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000066"></a>When we talk about the conservation of any species, plant or animal, it is vital that we know what we are talking about. Scientists must be confident when they note reductions in populations that they are all talking about the same thing. The only way they can do that is by having clear, internationally agreed identification and naming criteria. Here I declare another interest as patron of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Both my interests are unpaid.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000067"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, talked about the importance of type specimens, many of which the UK holds on behalf of the world because of our rich heritage of collecting over hundreds of years.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000068"></a>Despite two previous reports, the report that we are discussing highlights two key matters that are still outstanding: first, the lack of awareness of the state of health of the discipline among the relevant research councils, and, secondly, the lack of a lead government department, leading to the danger of poor co-ordination. As our specialist adviser, Professor Geoffrey Boxshall, has pointed out, these two issues interact to give a compound negative effect.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000069"></a>I am pleased to welcome the Government&#146;s acceptance of the first issue and the announcement that NERC will commission a study this year of the current number of taxonomists and trends. However, once we have that report to hand, it is unclear who will act upon it if there is no lead department. The Government seem to believe that diffuse responsibility would be better than the transfer of the lead responsibility to DIUS, as the committee recommended. In my view, that will lead only to numerous interdepartmental meetings in an attempt to co-ordinate action, whereas it could be done much more efficiently by one department&#151;that is, the department that has the responsibility for the initial and ongoing training of taxonomists through universities and other institutions. If the Government want endless meetings, so be it. A life of endless meetings seems to suit some people but I am afraid it does not suit me if there is a better way.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000070"></a>We are not suggesting that there should be no responsibility in any other department&#151;that would be nonsense. Defra, for example, should have a great interest in the matter as well as the Department of Energy and Climate Change, and we have made recommendations to DfID. But we note that, in co-ordinating the Government&#146;s response to our report, DIUS did not even consult the Scottish Government, who fund the RBG Edinburgh, the third largest taxonomic institution in the UK, as mentioned by our noble Scottish chairman. So it is no wonder that we view diffuse responsibility with some suspicion.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000071"></a>However, if the Government are adamant that they will not designate DIUS as the lead department, they will not be surprised when this Committee keeps a

Can the Minister say how it will be decided which department will have the responsibility of ensuring that any recommendations by NERC are carried out? Indeed, will NERC be making any recommendations, or will it simply present the Government with the facts of the decline of the discipline, which this Committee has already done three times?</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000072"></a>I turn now to the serious matter of stimulating the recruitment taxonomists, of which there is a serious shortage. We must not be misled by some of the figures that appeared during our investigations. For example, of the PhDs under way at RBG Kew, their evidence showed that only 15 of the 80 projects included a substantial amount of descriptive taxonomy. The Government&#146;s response to our report stated that from 2002 to 2006, 83 of the PhD studentships funded by NERC included elements of systematics and taxonomy. I strongly suspect that these were very small elements and that very few of them helped to produce expert taxonomists. The noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, gave examples of the negative consequences of this among entomologists.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000073"></a>One of the Committee&#146;s most serious complaints was about the lack of awareness at research council level of the problems of taxonomy, and I make no apology for returning to this issue. We welcome the forthcoming NERC study but it is vital that it makes an effort to not only count taxonomists but to understand how they work. As the noble Lord, Lord May, pointed out, the lack of proportionality between taxonomists and the living things they study is outstanding.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000074"></a>As an illustration of the lack of understanding with which taxonomists have been dealing, I should like to quote from an e-mail received yesterday by the Committee&#146;s clerk from Dr Henry Disney of the University of Cambridge. He complained that,</p>
<ul><a name="09032562000121"></a>&#147;NERC still fails to understand the way a leading specialist in alpha taxonomy works. This remains a major reason for the current decline in fundamental alpha taxonomy. As a recognized leading specialist on a large family of flies ... I am representative of those who are unable to procure funding from NERC because of their inappropriate criteria&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09032562000113"></a>a point mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord May. The e-mail continues:</p>
<ul><a name="09032562000122"></a>&#147;The demand for the PRIOR specification of hypotheses to be tested when one applies for funding to revise a taxon means one has to do much research first in order to generate the hypotheses to be tested. Who funds this prior research? Furthermore, part of being recognized as a leading specialist is that the unexpected constantly arrives in the post ... In practice I am obliged to routinely reject most requests which lack novel biological data or are not specimens of applied significance. Even so I have a 20-year backlog of randomly collected specimens. I concentrate on the processing of specimens with novel biological material. Since 1984 I have been funded entirely by private trusts ... as NERC routinely rejects applications for undertaking fundamental alpha taxonomy. My current funding for 2008/2009 is &#163;500 only! Despite this I have the highest publication rate and the largest number of co-authors ... from the largest number of countries overseas, of anyone in my Department&#151;the Leading Department of Zoology in the country&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000075"></a>Dr Disney&#146;s funding came from the Leverhulme and the Isaac Newton trusts, and the Wingate Foundation&#151;all charitable organisations, like my  own BGCI. So I am surprised and dismayed that the

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000076"></a>In other respects, the Government response paints too rosy a picture. For example, the committee recommended that more resources should go into web-based taxonomy and that a road map should be developed to ensure correct priorities. In their response, the Government refer to NERC&#146;s extensive use of internet resources for biodiversity. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, pointed out, most of this relates to biodiversity data, geographical data, lists of species, and so on&#151;it does not relate to taxonomy per se. Without the development of online identification tools, which was the committee&#146;s point, such data cannot be collected or relied upon, so the Government must be realistic about this.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000077"></a>I share the regret of the noble Lord, Lord May, that DfID does not regard it as part of its responsibility to the less developed countries, many of which are biodiversity-rich but cash-poor, to support online resources. That would help them to develop their home-grown capacity and expertise, and their ability to identify, monitor and conserve their own rich biodiversity. Many of the plants most in danger are used for food, medicine, shelter and warmth, so they must be protected from overharvesting and habitat destruction.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000078"></a>DfID no doubt believes that human beings are its major responsibility. If that is the case, it should remember that human beings live in habitats and ecosystems too. If we, by our actions or neglect, destroy our habitat and other living participants in our ecosystem, we sign our own death warrant. As the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, said, our enemy is the unknown.</p>

He took it from a finite science to one which recognised the evolution of species. My noble friend Lord Selborne spoke of the ongoing importance of the collection and classification of specimens which evolution, among other things, makes so important.

<p><a name="09032562000081"></a>I am sure that Members of the Committee will join me in paying tribute to those people who work tirelessly in the fields of taxonomy and systematics, too often for inadequate recognition. It is because of that that we welcome the Government&#146;s response to a number of the committee&#146;s conclusions and recommendations.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000082"></a>In large part, the Government have said that they agree with the committee&#146;s recommendations. For example, they recognise, as do we, that a decline in taxonomy and systematics in the United Kingdom has an adverse knock-on effect on related research in policy areas such as conservation, the monitoring of climate change, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and others have said, and food security.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000083"></a>The report recommends&#151;I think all noble Lords will support the proposal&#151;that importance is attached to field trips and other practical exercises in schools, to which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Sutherland, referred, which raise awareness, understanding and early enthusiasm for taxonomy. I hope that the Minister will agree that schools and schoolchildren should be encouraged, for many reasons, to participate in this kind of activity. What steps are the Government taking to remove the fear of the compensation culture which, by frustrating efforts to organise outdoor field trips, may well stifle enthusiasm for science and the development of an early interest in taxonomy? As the report rightly points out, it is the school pupils who gain an interest in these fields who will go on to be future volunteers, creating invaluable involvement in biological recording. My noble friend Lord Soulsby, and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, have lamented the state of university-level study in this area too.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000084"></a>While I accept that the Government have a point when they say that responsibility for encouraging volunteering in a sector lies primarily with that sector itself, I fear that they are being a touch disingenuous in distancing themselves so fully from the report&#146;s recommendation that they should show leadership in encouraging volunteers. The Government have a role to play here and, as the noble Lords, Lord May and Lord Krebs, and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, among others, have said with some force, what is currently lacking is any sense that the Government are co-ordinating their own departments properly.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000085"></a>This brings me to the Government&#146;s response to the recommendation that the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills should take the lead in co-ordinating matters relating to systematic biology. I accept that there will be a need for different departments to be involved but, like the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, I fear that the Government&#146;s response is a trifle unhelpful. The committee&#146;s recommendation would not preclude the involvement of different government departments but it would allow for one department to co-ordinate  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC231"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>activity, investment and information exchange among the others. A reduction in lost or duplicated material would surely be almost inevitable in such a scenario. Like the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, I wonder if the Minister could not reflect again on his Government&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000086"></a>Having said that, I urge some caution in promoting the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills as it is currently configured as the lead department. The Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee report, published in January and based on DIUS&#146;s first departmental report, was somewhat less than glowing. The opinion of the committee was that the department,</p>
<ul><a name="09032562000123"></a>&#147;has not yet found its feet&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032562000114"></a>I hope it was not government embarrassment over this that led to their rejection of the Science Committee&#146;s recommendation for departmental leadership.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000087"></a>While my noble friend Lord Selborne referred to it in his contribution today when he talked about the prioritisation of effort, I noticed no reference to Europe in the Government&#146;s response. What effort, if any, are they making to co-ordinate work on taxonomy and systematics with our fellow members of the EU? Other noble Lords have referred to co-ordination with Scotland and my noble friend Lord Soulsby mentioned the importance of the United States in this field, particularly in entomology. Again, it would be interesting to know what co-operation was going on across the Atlantic.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000088"></a>We on these Benches realise that the critical importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics to our economy and our society means that improvement in our national performance in those subjects must be central to a future Conservative Government&#146;s policies. The report indicates that we have some form on this, in that it refers back to its own predecessor, <I>Systematic Biology Research</I>, published in 1992, to which the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, referred and which my noble friend Lord Selborne said he was jointly responsible for. That report served to stimulate several measures that were implemented during the term of office of a Conservative Government, including the Natural Environment Research Council&#146;s taxonomy initiative and the Wellcome Trust biodiversity initiative. The report acknowledges that those initiatives of the early 1990s were successful and that their contribution is still felt today. I recognise and welcome the resources that the present Government have made available in past years for the promotion of science, but it would be encouraging indeed if they were to use the current report as a springboard for fresh initiatives which would secure the United Kingdom&#146;s standing in this area for another generation.</p>

<p><a name="09032562000089"></a><b><a name="90325-gc0005.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09032562000140"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Lord Drayson):</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, for securing this debate and for leading the committee in producing this report. I am grateful to him and to his colleagues for their recommendations. The report has not only focused the Government&#146;s attention on this vital scientific discipline&#151;an underpinning infrastructure, as the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, described it&#151;but given me a chance to hear further the committee&#146;s insights into, and  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC232"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC232</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>views on, systematics and taxonomy. I recognise, as my noble friend Lord Haskel said, that there is no stone which can resist the constant drip-drip-drip of its constructive advice. I am certainly listening to the committee&#146;s concerns and I shall take action.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000090"></a>It is the Government&#146;s aim to ensure that this country maintains its position as a leading science nation. Systematics and taxonomy are important to the research base, and we are committed to protecting and strengthening them. They are, as the noble Lords, Lord Soulsby and Lord Krebs, said, essential underpinnings to work on biodiversity, understanding ecosystem services and climate change. I was struck by the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, about the value of sheer intellectual curiosity. In our efforts to develop a wider understanding of science in our community and a scientifically literate society, the communication of the power within science&#151;of the power of curiosity about things, asking why they are as they are and going further to try to understand them&#151;is vital.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000091"></a>This science has important economic aspects, too, of which I give just one example. UK taxonomists helped to identify the mealy bug attacking cassava in Africa and its natural enemy in South America. Their discovery led to savings of up to $20 billion.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000092"></a>The impact of this area on public attitudes to science is also vital. I have in mind the great public interest in the national collections. I agree wholeheartedly with the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, about the importance of field trips in science education, which we are actively encouraging within the Government. I share his concern about the development of the compensation culture in our society, which make such trips more difficult to organise than they would otherwise be.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000093"></a>We accept that the Government have an important role in encouraging volunteering in this area, and we are pursuing it. I am happy to answer the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, about DCMS funding of regional museums. DCMS allocates &#163;45 million to regional museums through the Renaissance in the Regions programme. That funding is committed for the remainder of the current spending period. The DCMS is also committed to funding the strategic commissioning education programme for this period, which I hope gives the reassurance that the noble Lord sought.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000094"></a>I listened carefully to the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord May, about the cognitive dissonance between the stated priorities of DfID. I shall look at the matter again and discuss it with my colleagues from that department.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000095"></a>I also accept the concerns expressed by a number of noble Lords relating to the failure to consult fully, particularly on the collection in Scotland. Scotland has an excellent research record in taxonomy and the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh has a high international standing. We were originally confident in the preparation of our response to the committee&#146;s report that the state of the discipline in Scotland was covered, but we have taken the point on board.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000096"></a>We have accepted 20 of the 25 recommendations produced by the committee. We agree that within these recommendations the internet will play an important  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC233"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC233</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>role in the evolution of taxonomy. I have noted in the debate today the concern about whether or not we have missed an important point on the full potential of web-based resources, in particular in relation to taxonomy tools. I will take this back to the department and look into it further. Most importantly, we note the concerns that have been expressed by the committee around the lines of communication between the taxonomy community and the research councils. The committee has helpfully highlighted the concern in this area and I shall explore it further.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0005.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000097"></a>I am also grateful that the committee has given credit where it is due and has noted the progress that we have made. I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, for highlighting the cross-research council programme of living with environmental change. This is an example of the excellent work which the research councils are doing in working across disciplines. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, made a point about international collaboration. That programme has been looked at very closely by the American Administration as a model for the way in which this area should  be addressed.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90325-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="90325-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000098"></a>The committee voiced serious concerns about the health and sustainability of the discipline, and this is of concern to the Government. That is why the forthcoming review being carried out by NERC is extremely important. It will give us the data that we need for a stronger evidence base upon which to make future decisions. It will be led by an expert committee and the review will seek a better understanding of the responsibilities among the various UK institutions which cover taxonomy. The committee will examine which aspects of NERC&#146;s four-year strategy will require new taxonomic knowledge and skills and will make recommendations on how these needs will be met. It will also look at the key issues in taxonomic research which could attract research council funding and which could make a fundamental contribution to both UK science and our society. It will be a thorough review.  I hope that reassures the Committee about the Government&#146;s commitment to sustaining systematic biology and taxonomy in this country. The review  will include the recommendation of mechanisms  for collaborative operations across departments and disciplines.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000099"></a>Following completion of the review, we will look again at whether there is a compelling case for there to be a lead department for this discipline. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked how this would be delivered. I would point to the recent innovation of the creation of the new Science and Innovation Sub-Committee. My role as Science Minister and a seat in the Cabinet provide an opportunity for cross-departmental issues to be addressed and for decisions to be taken. That is the mechanism by which it will be done. At this point, I am unsure as to whether locating responsibility in a single department such as DIUS would be an appropriate solution. However, I am prepared to look at the matter again, based on the data which come out of the NERC review.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000100"></a>It is important to recognise, as Members of the Committee do, that DIUS does not have overall responsibility for particular areas of science. Funding  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC234"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column GC234</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>specific activities in the research base through the science and research budget is the responsibility of the department. However, it is important to stress our belief in the crucial centrality of the Haldane principle&#151;that decisions relating to funding are made by the scientific community&#151;and the importance of the independence of the research council.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000101"></a>I noted that the committee regards the concerns around this underpinning infrastructure of the science of taxonomy to be of fundamental strategic importance. I accept that DIUS has a clear role in providing strategic guidance, and therefore I can see the argument that, where there are problems, this may be one of those areas where, in DIUS&#146;s role as championing UK science and in my role as Science Minister, it is DIUS&#146;s responsibility to take action.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000102"></a>In conclusion, I remind noble Lords that in the great majority of recommendations the Government and the committee are in agreement. We have accepted them in large part and are busy implanting them. We both want to ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of this discipline internationally, and I am grateful for the committee&#146;s assessment that, as the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, described it, significant progress has been made. However, I take the point that over the 17-year period in which a number of reviews have taken place in this discipline, there are areas where, as the noble Lord said, we could do better.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000103"></a>Further work is now needed to establish the structures that will support that ambition, based on data which will be generated from the review. I am clear that, with continued prompting from this committee, we can expect further developments from the Government in this area.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000104"></a>I shall read <I>Hansard</I> to see whether there are any questions that noble Lords have raised this afternoon that I have not answered. In particular, I think that it would be useful for me to give a full description of the international collaborations that the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked for, both transatlantically and within Europe, and I shall ensure that that is done by the department.</p>

The quality of the debate demonstrates very well what a rare privilege it is to be chairman of such a committee and such a group in preparing this kind of report. Perhaps it is going too far to say that the expertise and interest around the table is matchless, but I can say for sure that they would be pretty hard to match.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000106"></a>I also thank the Minister for his sympathetic and informed reply. It was, dare I say, of the kind that we might hope for from a former member of the Select Committee. We appreciate his comments and will study them in <I>Hansard</I>.</p>

<a name="90325-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09032562000107"></a>The message is very clear: these disciplines are of fundamental importance for science, for the nation and for the Government. We have national strengths in these areas&#151;talented people and outstanding collections&#151;but both might be at risk if we do not take action on a systematic and long-term basis. We do not need a knee-jerk reaction.</p>

<p><a name="09032562000108"></a>In conclusion, I do not know whether the Minister ever saw the film &#147;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&#148; but in that film Butch and Sundance&#151;Paul Newman and Robert Redford&#151;were bank robbers fleeing the forces of law and order. I do not press the analogy too closely but they are fleeing the forces of law and order over desert and mountain. However, the forces of law and order continue to pursue them. At

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09032543000003"></a><b><a name="90325-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09032543000060"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09032543000004"></a>In my role as the Government&#146;s anti-corruption champion I am pleased to inform the House that I have today laid before Parliament the draft Bribery Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny (Bribery&#151;Draft Legislation Cm 7570). This is in accordance with the Government&#146;s legislative programme as set out in the Written Statement by my right honourable friend the Leader of the House of Commons on 4 December 2008 (<I>Official Report,</I> Col.12WS). </p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09032543000005"></a>The Bill describes a modern, clear and consolidated law that will support our commitment to high ethical standards generally and will equip our courts and prosecutors to deal effectively with bribery of all kinds whether it occurs at home or abroad.  I believe these provisions strike the right balance between clarity and detail, so as to allow for both legal certainty and the effective differentiation between bribery and the legitimate giving and receiving of advantages. </p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09032543000006"></a>Our current criminal law of bribery is old and anachronistic and can be difficult for prosecutors, courts and members of the public. Statutory law is fragmented and dates back to around the turn of the 20th century. It is unconsolidated, resulting in inconsistencies of language and concepts between the various provisions and one or two small but potentially significant gaps in the law. The scope of the common law offence is unclear, adding to inconsistency and overall complexity. These issues have been noted at home and abroad, most notably by the OECD Bribery Working Group.  It is clear that, from a purely legal perspective, the case for reform is strong.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09032543000007"></a>This is, however, much more than a desire for an orderly statute book. While the United Kingdom is recognised as one of the least corrupt countries in the world we do not underestimate the threat posed by bribery. If it is not kept in check, bribery can destroy the integrity, accountability and honesty that underpin ethical standards in public and commercial life. By its very nature insidious and difficult to root out, bribery worldwide weakens democracy, impedes sustainable development and can undermine respect for human rights by supporting corrupt regimes. </p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09032543000008"></a>As advances in technology and communication enable ever more sophisticated means of committing and concealing crimes, we must ensure that our law provides our courts and prosecutors with the tools they need to combat such crime effectively.  Over the years it has become clear that a law that has narrow national focus will not fulfil this role. The global economy is a reality.  Modernisation of the law is therefore a priority, not only to deal effectively with those who offer or accept  


<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS42"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column WS42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bribes in our business or public sectors, but also  to reinforce transparency and accountability in our international business transactions.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09032543000009"></a>Law reform is one of the key elements of the UK&#146;s strategy against foreign bribery, which I am co-coordinating in my role as government anti-corruption champion as announced in my Statement of 2 October 2008. Concerted multilateral action is essential to tackle the global impact of bribery and related issues such as money laundering. Co-operation with our international partners is producing significant progress in areas such as the tracing, recovery and repatriation of money laundered misappropriated assets. In addition, we are supporting effective implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption, the OECD Bribery Convention and the Council of Europe&#146;s Criminal Law Convention on Corruption. </p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09032543000010"></a>The Bill builds on the Law Commission proposals set out in its report <I>Reforming Bribery</I> in November 2008. I should like to express my gratitude to the Law Commission for its excellent report. The Bill&#146;s principal provisions create two general offences; one dealing with the giving, promising, and offering of a bribe and the other with agreeing to receive or acceptance of a bribe. It provides a new discrete offence of bribery of a foreign public official and a new corporate liability offence of negligently failing to prevent bribery.  The detail of these and the other remaining provisions of the Bill are explained in full in the Explanatory Notes published along side the Bill. My officials have shared details of our proposed legislation with colleagues in Scotland. It will be for the Scottish Ministers to consider whether any similar changes will be necessary to Scots law.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09032543000014"></a>In addition to these two substantive items, there are four further items for which BERR has responsibility listed under any other business. The first of these will be an update from the council presidency on negotiations on a decision of the European Parliament and of the council on interoperability solutions for European public administrations (ISA Programme). The UK supports the proposed programme as its predecessors have proved successful in delivering guidelines, common frameworks, studies on cross-border communication and IT-enabled service platforms for the delivery of Community policies and activities.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09032543000015"></a>The presidency will then provide information on the recent 112 Day. To mark 112 Day in the UK, I wrote to other government departments that could play a role in raising awareness of the pan-European emergency number. We are currently undertaking follow up work on this with the Foreign Office and Identity and Passport Service (IPS).</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09032543000016"></a>The Commission will then present its communication on mobilising information and communication technologies to facilitate the transition to an energy-efficient, low-carbon economy. The UK agrees with the aims of this communication which seeks to raise awareness of the potential ICT has to improve efficiency of European enterprises, including public sector, systems and processes.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09032543000017"></a>Lastly, the presidency will provide an update on the review of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services. On the same day as the council, the European Parliament is voting in Committee stage on this review package, followed by their plenary vote on the 22 April. I will shortly be writing to you with Explanatory Memoranda on the Commission's response to the Council common position, and will take the opportunity to update you on the progress of negotiations.</p>

Commissioner Reding will present the forthcoming communication on communication and information infrastructure protection. I understand the communication will recommend broad standards on the resilience of critical ICT infrastructure and on member states' national response capacity to ensure the provision of telecoms services.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09032543000021"></a>There will be a progress report and policy debate on the latest situation on the proposed amendment to Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (the Eurovignette directive). We support the principle of the polluter pays and therefore the broad aims of the directive.  However, we have concerns with some of the proposals, including a requirement to introduce earmarking.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09032543000022"></a>The council will aim to reach a general approach on a proposed amendment to the directive on the organisation of working time in road transport. The amending directive aims to permanently exclude the genuinely self-employed from the scope of the working time rules for mobile workers and provide additional flexibility to industry on night work limits. I expect to be able to agree to the general approach.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09032543000023"></a>Following the recent Commission communication &#147;Action Plan for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe&#148;, the council will be asked to adopt conclusions. The Government support the objectives of the ITS action plan to reduce congestion, tackle environmental issues, provide reliable travel information and improve safety. We welcome the recognition in the conclusions of the contribution that technology can make to meet those objectives.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09032543000024"></a>Within the SESAR project for single sky implementation, the Commission has recently produced a master plan for air traffic management in Europe. The council will be asked to adopt a decision endorsing the master plan and a council resolution on it. The UK has been a firm supporter of the SESAR project from the outset. We recognise the contribution the project can make to improvement of the European air traffic management system, while helping to mitigate the impacts of aviation on the environment. In order for the project to begin its second phase (development), we should endorse this resolution and request the SESAR joint undertaking to complete membership agreements with industry at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09032543000025"></a>Under AOB, the presidency will report on progress of the legislative proposals of the single European sky (SES) package<b>.</b> It is expected that the European Parliament in plenary session will by then have voted on these proposals. The first of them is a regulation amending the four regulations adopted in 2004 which established the single European sky. The amending regulation aims to improve the efficiency of air traffic management (ATM) across the EU by introducing targets that ensure all member states contribute to an overall improvement in the performance of the ATM system. The second is an amending regulation extending the responsibilities of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to the safety of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services. The UK has been a firm supporter of the single European sky since its inception in 2004. We are content with progress in negotiations and look forward to these proposals being adopted as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09032543000026"></a>Finally in aviation, the presidency will seek political endorsement for a future council decision to sign a comprehensive air transport agreement with Canada. The UK is supportive of this agreement, which would

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09032543000027"></a>In maritime transport, there will be a progress report and policy debate on a draft regulation on the rights of passengers when travelling by sea and inland waterway. We support the aim of the regulation, following provisions already agreed for other transport modes, and we will continue to work closely with the Commission and member states on the details.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09032543000028"></a>Also in maritime transport, the council will be asked to adopt conclusions arising from two recent Commission communications. The first, strategic goals and recommendations for the EU&#146;s maritime transport policy until 2018, has as its aims, acceptable to us  in principle, the promotion of European shipping  and related industries, which are safe, secure and environmentally friendly, while remaining efficient, adaptable and globally competitive. The second communication is an action plan with a view to establishing a European maritime space without barriers. This is a concept which we can support in principle. It is designed to extend the Community&#146;s internal market by simplifying administrative procedures for intra-EU maritime transport, particularly short sea shipping, in order to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of this sector, as well as to deliver environmental benefits. I expect to be able to agree to both sets of conclusions.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09032543000029"></a>Under AOB, the council will report on the draft regulation establishing the second Marco Polo programme, following recent negotiations with the European Parliament. The Marco Polo programme provides Community financial assistance to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system. This proposal intends to stimulate more applications for funding by increasing participation by small enterprises, simplifying administrative procedures, increasing funding intensities and redefining and lowering the eligibility thresholds for project proposals. The Government believe that these amendments should allow the Marco Polo II programme fully to deploy its potential, so we strongly support the proposed revision. </p>

The final report of the review, with detailed recommendations, was published in July 2008. The review identified the specific challenges facing rural areas but recognises that, &#147;contrary to an often outdated view of the countryside, the economies of rural and urban England are much more alike than many people might imagine&#148;. The Government will therefore give local authorities more flexibility to tackle the issues their communities face.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09032543000034"></a>Our response sets out our proposals to take forward most of the review&#146;s 48 recommendations to continue to encourage a prosperous rural economies and improve the delivery of affordable rural homes. This will help businesses, councils and the wider community, particularly in the current challenging economic conditions, and will assist rural communities in becoming more sustainable.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09032543000035"></a>We welcome the review as giving important emphasis to what it takes to develop and sustain a strong rural economy, and improve access to a range of housing. In response to the review&#146;s recommendations, we are announcing new approaches which local planning authorities and rural communities should adopt to improve the rural economy and encourage more affordable housing to be built in the countryside in appropriate places.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09032543000036"></a>This includes:</p>
ensuring that masterplanning is properly understood, and widely used, and running a competition to encourage good practice. In this context, masterplanning primarily means spatial masterplanning, as an approach to achieve the sustainable expansion of small or medium-sized settlements in particular;setting up a practitioners&#146; working group to explore ways to incentivise landowners to use the existing rural exception sites policy, where local planning authorities can grant permission for small scale housing development as an exception to their normal policies of countryside protection;bringing together a number of existing planning policy statements covering economic development topics into a single new planning policy statement on planning for prosperity. This will be published for consultation shortly; and publishing proposals for taking forward the use of community land trusts which can enable local communities to work together to meet their own housing needs, alongside details to create protected areas where shared ownership homes need to be retained for future purchasers. These proposals too will be published for consultation shortly.

<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS47"></a><b>25 Mar 2009 : Column WS47</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09032543000039"></a>On 25 March, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) published a report setting out its findings on the effectiveness of the Payments Council in meeting its objectives. The Payments Council started work in March 2007, following an agreement in November 2006 by the OFT-chaired Payment Systems Task Force that a new body be created to provide strategic direction for the UK's payment industry. The task force set three key objectives for the Payments Council:</p>
to lead the future development of co-operative payment services in the United Kingdom;to ensure that the payment system is open and accountable; andto ensure the operational efficiency, effectiveness and integrity of payment services in the United Kingdom, through a focus on issues which cross schemes.
<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09032543000040"></a>The task force agreed that the OFT would carry out a review of the effectiveness of the new governance body (subsequently named the Payments Council), after two years of its operation. This was to ensure that the objectives of the new body were being met and delivered on in practice. This Statement highlights the key findings and recommendations in the OFT review of the operations of the Payments Council.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09032543000041"></a>The OFT report concludes that the Payments Council is a definite improvement on what prevailed before its creation. The Payments Council's consultation on a national payments plan, setting out the strategic direction it should pursue over the next five to 10 years, was widely welcomed by stakeholders, and contributed to its objective on openness and accountability. The introduction of the faster payments scheme (FPS) in May 2007 represented a substantial innovation. Users of the system will be able to make telephone and internet payments within a matter of hours, rather than over three working days as under the BACS system.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="09032543000042"></a>While the introduction of the faster payment scheme was a real achievement, the rolling out of faster payment services by many banks to their customers has been relatively slow. The report finds that the Payments Council should be more pro-active in following up its initiatives with members and should also consider widening its membership and making more effective use of user groups, to ensure that end-users get the benefits envisaged.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="09032543000043"></a>The OFT report recommends that the Payments Council increases the emphasis on its integrity objective in future. Although the safety and security of payment systems have not been compromised, the Payments Council has not added value quickly enough, and this is an area where it needs to improve. The OFT considers that the Payments Council should commission an accountancy firm to report in two years on how well it has performed against its integrity objective. The report (or the executive summary of it) should be published in the Payments Council's annual review, and the Payments Council should outline how it intends to address any action points identified in it. Following the review from the accountancy firm, the Payments Council should self-assess against its integrity objective using the same procedure described below for its other objectives.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09032543000044"></a>The OFT also recommends that the Payments Council provides a self-assessment against progress every two years on:</p>
its strategic direction and openness and accountability objectives;recommendations of the task force where these have not been met; andrecommendations coming out of this OFT report.
<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09032543000045"></a>This self-assessment should contain the results of an open consultation with stakeholders on progress against objectives. The OFT may still choose to look into specific aspects of the Payments Council's performance against objectives, if it considers there to be sufficient reason.</p>

<a name="90325-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09032543000046"></a>The Government welcome the OFT work to review the effectiveness of the Payments Council, and welcome the recommendations made. I am writing today to the chair of the Payments Council to note the Government's continued interest in the future work of the Payments Council.</p>

This will provide a streamlined, more efficient service and better value for money to the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="09032543000056"></a>Over the past three years, Defra has invested &#163;650 million in a range of programmes that help organisations and the public use resources more efficiently.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="09032543000057"></a>The review identified that a single delivery body was the most efficient way of providing resource efficiency services to businesses, the public sector and households; and that such a single point of contact would also ensure greater ease of access for customers. WRAP was identified as the natural focus for this effort, providing the widest range of relevant services, and having the necessary management capability.</p>

On the basis that the clinical viewpoint tends to be that a client should not be counted as a 'failure' if he/she has smoked in the difficult first days after the quit date, a client is counted as having successfully quit smoking if he/she has not smoked at all since two weeks after the quit date. The four-week follow-up (and Carbon Monoxide (CO) validation, if appropriate) must be completed within six weeks of the quit date. Persons not contacted within this time are treated as lost to follow-up for evaluation purposes.</ul><ul><a name="09032551000024"></a>3. Only people who set a quit date through the NHS Stop Smoking Services are included in the quarterly monitoring returns; those who attend the service but do not set a quit date are therefore excluded.</ul><h2 align="center"><a name="09032540000430"></a>Taxation</h2>

This is incorrect. Following the judgment by the House of Lords on 22 October 2008, all visitors to the territory require a permit. The BIOT Administration have asked the British consulate-general to amend its list.</p>
