This process has taken time. It has been complex and sometimes difficult, but we have good relations with the Argentinians. We have no problem, and no uncertainty whatever, about sovereignty; sovereignty is clear as far as we are concerned. There will be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless and until such time as the Falklanders wish there to be. That has been made clear to the Argentinian Government; they are well aware of that. Like the noble Lord, I would not wish any convention, such as the Ottawa convention, to be used to underline any claim to the Falklands other than our own.</p>

Does she agree that it is unfortunate that some 12,000 students have not claimed bursaries of &#163;300 or more that they are eligible to claim? Does she further agree that one of the reasons for this is the sheer complexity of the system, with each university running a separate scheme? Does she also agree that this is an indication that the scheme run in her own country, Wales, which has a single national bursary scheme, might be preferable to the scheme that we have at the moment in England?</p>

Yes, we do share Martin Harris&#146;s concern about the 12,000 students who have not received their bursaries. We are concerned that there appears to be a lack of connection in getting information to these students. All they have to do in many cases is to pass on to the institution their permission for their details to be sent on so that they can get these bursaries. An awful lot more can be done; we are certainly not complacent about the system that we have. We have committed ourselves to reviewing the system in time.</p>

However, one of the interesting things about the report is that it shows that in institutions where bursaries were rewarded regardless of the application process to all applying students, a number of students still chose not to apply for a bursary and not to accept one. We have to understand much more about why, in a small number of cases, students do not agree to have their personal details handed on to institutions so that they can receive more money.

It was unsatisfactory because although I had given the Minister&#146;s office advance notice of the issues that I wanted to raise, it quickly became clear that his briefing was wholly inadequate to deal with that debate. Indeed, when the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, had to offer profuse apologies for Defra&#146;s failure to deal effectively and swiftly with the issues, I began to feel a bit sorry for him.</p>

<a name="80129-0002.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="080129102000135">The issue that concerns me about this order can be simply stated: the order requires energy suppliers&#151;that is, the electricity and gas companies&#151;to secure large reductions in carbon emissions from the household sector, and particularly from vulnerable consumers. The companies have to make sure that 40 per cent of their emission reduction targets are met from the fuel-poor, through households where someone is on any of a specific list of benefits or tax credits, or where someone is aged over 70. The lists are set out in Schedule 2 to the order, and as I am over 70 I should declare an interest. The problem arises because the right to privacy, human rights legislation and data protection legislation prevent energy companies from being told the names and addresses of their customers to whom the 40 per cent obligation applies.</p>

<a name="80129-0002.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="080129102000136">Defra has calculated the number of households with listed benefits or tax credits at 8.8 million; and BERR&#151;I am not quite sure why it is involved&#151;has calculated that households with pensioners over  70 will add another 1.4 million. That makes a total of 11.2 million households, so we are dealing with very large numbers.</p>

<a name="80129-0002.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="080129102000137">The problem of identifying the number of vulnerable households is not new. The Government have run energy savings schemes for some years under the banner of the Energy Efficiency Commitment. They have imposed similar obligations on companies to secure part of their energy savings by targeting vulnerable households. These are assumed to include many of the fuel-poor.</p>

<a name="80129-0002.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="080129102000138">It must by now be clear to the House that imposing these targets on the companies without being free to tell them which of the households they must target creates great difficulties. Indeed, without exception, all the companies and other bodies with which I have spoken have described the problem as extremely difficult. The process is also very expensive. The cost must be added to fuel bills, including those of the fuel-poor, and the procedures that firms must adopt are very wasteful. One local authority has said that it is not at all sure that the system operates for the benefit of the fuel-poor.</p>

<a name="80129-0002.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="080129102000139">The companies have tried to build partnerships with local authorities and housing and social services; have tried to work with the voluntary sector; and have aimed their leafleting at postcode areas believed to contain a high proportion of target households. But without names and addresses, it is all very hit and miss. In Committee, I called it &#147;hide and seek&#148;; on reflection, perhaps a better name would have been &#147;hunt the thimble&#148;. It is to the great credit of the industry and its partners that I have listed that under the original EEC rules most of the companies have been able to hit their targets. The regulator Ofgem&#151;

<a name="80129-0002.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="080129102000140">However, this order makes very big changes. First, the target is no longer on energy saving; it is on emissions reduction, which adds greatly to the complexity. If anyone doubts that, let them read through the Explanatory Memorandum. Secondly, the overall target is doubled for the next three years&#151;over that of the past three years. Thirdly, the cost to customers will be greatly increased. That was made very clear to me by one of the major companies. The industry has been categorical in its comment on the consultation for this order. According to the Explanatory Memorandum, the new priority group target is &#147;not achievable&#148;. One has to accept that. The industry states that it cannot possibly be met.</p>

<a name="80129-0002.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="080129102000141">How has this situation arisen? There are two reasons. First, the industry has been slow to recognise that data-sharing, for which it has consistently asked, is not going to happen. It has been hoping that it will be given the names and addresses of the target customers. However, for the reasons I have outlined&#151;data protection and so forth&#151;that has never been on the cards. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, made that clear last week in Grand Committee. A much more potent cause is that Defra seems consistently to have refused to admit that identifying the target households is a problem, despite much intensive lobbying on this issue by the industry. In all the 79 pages of the Explanatory Memorandum, the problem of identification is not mentioned. It is not in the summary of the consultation responses on pages 24 and 25; and it is not in the list of barriers described on pages 9 and 10. So until last year, there was no help at all from departments on identifying target customers.</p>

<a name="80129-0002.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="080129102000142">However, last year, for the first time, a pilot scheme began. The industry pays for the leaflets with reply coupons and a telephone help number; the Department for Work and Pensions distributes them to named target households with listed benefits. It is then up to the householder to respond. That covers one in 5,000 of the 11.2 million target households. The Minister told us that there is to be a second pilot this year, this time aimed at pension credit claimants covering a further one in 5,000 of the 11.2 million target households. One has to ask: when are we going to get a system that reaches out to the 11.2 million target households? Is this not going to take years?</p>

<a name="80129-0002.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="080129102000143">Ofgem has now realised the problem. Last month, paragraph 6.6 of its corporate strategy and plan said this, which is quite significant:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"><a name="080129102000320">&#147;The challenge remains getting the message across to those who most need the help and ensuring that once identified they can benefit from the full range of help [...] This requires a joined-up approach from Government, industry and other agencies&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80129-0002.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="080129102000144">This is the final sentence:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"><a name="080129102000321">&#147;It is also dependent on the Government using its sources of information to improve the targeting of the help available&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080129102000310">Noble Lords may recognise that that last sentence forms part of the first part of my amendment, and that I draw on the key words of that paragraph, &#147;the Government using its sources&#148;. It is far too late.  The three-year period of this order starts next April.

It is bewildering when the money is available that people do not make a claim. In this case, it is somewhat more difficult. Last year 1,000 households were targeted by post&#151;so obviously it was done on a fairly small scale&#151;to test the system whereby the Government get the addresses and take the material from the companies. This year, the mail shot targeted 250,000 households specifically in receipt of pension credit. It is not just any 250,000 households, but single-person households in urban areas and two-person households in rural areas. Again, the Government got the information for the addresses and the industry supplied the necessary leaflets. That was organised in partnership with the DWP, the department that I still call Trade and Industry and eaga, the Warm Front campaign manager. We will work closely with the energy suppliers over the next few months on the feedback from that targeted mail shot because that may be a way for the future.</p>

Having had much experience of this in relation to the claims resolution tribunal for dormant accounts in Switzerland, I argued that if one really wished to find the owners there was a strong case for publishing the names of the dormant accounts, thereby enabling anyone who thought that they might relate to themselves or to a relative&#151;particularly heirs, of course&#151;to make a claim. It was argued against that that there were problems of banking confidentiality and we had a considerable exchange on this issue. I have made further inquiries about the situation that existed in Switzerland vis- -vis dormant accounts and it is clear that it was closely prescribed under Swiss law to a specific period; notably, that when the depositors may have been victims of the Holocaust, although we dealt with many other accounts. None the less, there is a strong case for trying to find the owners of dormant accounts in  that way.</p>

<a name="80129-0003.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="080129102000170">As regards Amendment No. 1, I suggest that it is crucial that the bank or building society concerned should provide the reclaim fund with the details. If the function of the reclaim fund is to deal with claims made after assets have been transferred, that seems sensible. I suggest in Amendment No. 2 that the reclaim fund rather than the banks should publish the names. Be that as it may, I think that is the right way to approach the matter. But in any case it is important that the details of the dormant bank accounts should be transferred to the reclaim fund.</p>

<a name="80129-0003.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="080129102000171">The situation envisaged in the Bill is very strange. If I understand correctly what the Government are proposing&#151;no doubt the Minister will confirm whether I am right&#151;the assets will be transferred from the banks to the reclaim fund but they will not tell the reclaim fund who the owners are. Instead, if someone subsequently wants to make a claim against the reclaim fund, an agency agreement will be set up between the banks and the reclaim fund. So although the assets have been transferred, the responsibility for any subsequent claim will still rest with the banks. They will have the data. That seems to me an extraordinarily roundabout way of doing it. The obvious thing to do is to transfer the data to the reclaim fund, and for that fund to deal with any claims. As the measure stands, the reclaim fund does not act as a reclaim fund; that function is still being performed by the banks.</p>

<a name="80129-0003.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="080129102000172">There is a further point about Amendment No. 9. The activities of the reclaim fund are closely circumscribed by the Bill&#151;it can do only what is mentioned. Strangely enough&#151;perhaps the Minister will address this point&#151;it does not appear to be empowered to ascertain the owners of the dormant accounts. Therefore, Amendment No. 9 says that it should be able, when dealing with claims, to ascertain the owners of the dormant accounts transferred to it. Here again, it would seem that the obvious thing to do is to transfer the data to the reclaim fund rather than for them to remain, rather like the smile on the Cheshire Cat&#146;s face after the Cheshire Cat has disappeared, with the banks.</p>

I am increasingly conscious that if a Bill is structured in a strange way it is virtually impossible for your Lordships&#146; House to make fundamental changes. We go into a procedure in the Moses Room, where there are no votes and amendments cannot be made. We can vote at Report stage but increasingly there is pressure not to pursue matters further at Third Reading. So the number of votes that one can have on a Bill in your Lordships&#146; House is very limited. Consequently, if one wants to restructure a Bill, however defective its structure, it is extremely difficult. None the less, I hope that the Government will accept these amendments, which will do something to resolve the problem of the initial transfer of funds to the reclaim fund. No doubt on later amendments we will come to issues about how the funds are distributed, but those are separate issues. I beg to move.</p>

That is not what the Government, banks or building societies appear to intend, so it is difficult to get that into this Bill. I say in support of my noble friend that the incentives for properly effecting repayments, if they are to be handled by the banks, are very weak&#151;in fact, they are non-existent. Once the bank has handed over the dormant account money to the reclaim fund, the bank has no obligation in respect of repayment. We discussed that point in Committee. That would mean that when the banks handle repayments, they have no incentive to minimise them or calculate them correctly. My noble friend&#146;s idea of transferring this responsibility to the reclaim fund has genuine merit in terms of getting the incentive structure right within the Bill.

To my simple mind, it seems that, once the bank decides that surplus funds are available and it has made every effort to trace the owners, it then writes a cheque for, say, &#163;5 million and sends it to the reclaim fund saying, &#147;This is in respect of these 10,000 deposit holders&#148;. I assume that they will be listed somewhere, because if someone else turns up and the bank says, &#147;Well, we sent your money on&#148;, the person will say, &#147;I did not deal with the reclaim fund, I dealt with you&#148;. Therefore I should have thought that the bank would go to the reclaim fund and say, &#147;Look, here is the proof. That is the name on the list that corresponds to the cheque that we sent.

We have sought to satisfy ourselves as to whether it would be right and appropriate under the terms of the scheme to make available the names of individual account holders whose money is transferred to the scheme after 15 years. We consulted a great deal on the level of publicity that there would be about the scheme and the steps that would be taken to reunite customers with their accounts. It will be appreciated on all sides that the concept of the scheme&#151;even before it comes into legislative existence&#151;has prompted very considerable activity. We welcome all constructive suggestions on how banks and building societies can be more proactive in reuniting customers with their assets. The one thing that unites us on all sides of the House is that the money belongs to someone and that it should be transferred only when that claim cannot be substantiated. Therefore, every reasonable effort should be made to reunite dormant accounts with their proper holders. However, our view remains, as we set out in the consultation in March 2007 and in our response to that consultation subsequently, that a publicly available register of dormant account holders&#146; names does carry inherent risks. There is the risk of identity theft and fraud. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton&#151;I am sorry he is not in his place today&#151;expressed anxiety about the potential risk of identity theft and fraud if account holders&#146; names were publicly available. He felt that there would be the risk of the list being exploited leading to false claims for repayment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="080129102000182">We are wary of that risk, and we think that we are right to be so. Consumer protection is an important principle for the Government. We owe it to dormant account holders not to place them at a potential disadvantage compared with customers whose accounts have not been transferred to the fund and whose names would not be made public in this way. We need to be fair to customers of banks and building societies and treat them equitably.</p>

The one-stop shop offering this facility to the public will be launched tomorrow.

We have made provision for that information to be available at that point. As a normal matter of course, however, we do not think that all names associated with dormant accounts should be made public in quite the way suggested by the noble

But of course there could be others who may not wish that information to be made public and who will have deposited their money on the assumption that it could not be made public. A requirement to publish personal details without their consent raises real issues of confidentiality. It might also raise human rights issues.</p>

There appears to be little advantage in seeing one&#146;s name or the names of one&#146;s relatives in a list and then speculating whether this means that the money is owed or whether the name is a coincidence. It might lead to a wide range of speculative inquiries, a phenomenon which is not unknown when money has been unclaimed in other circumstances. It will also involve additional administrative costs; noble Lords opposite are always rightly concerned that we should keep administrative costs down. The Government are committed to a scheme that is cost-effective, which will help to ensure that there is public confidence in the scheme, that banks and building societies will participate fully and that resources are targeted where they are most needed, maximising the amount that is available for good causes.</p>

However, I hope that he recognises that the Government have reached their position on rational grounds. We have taken into account his proposals; we fully understand the motive behind his amendments.

The period of 15 years triggers the transfer of resources to the reclaim fund; it does not bury the rights of the individual to regain their proper resources after the reclaim fund has obtained them. I cannot emphasise this point enough. To substantiate that their claim is justified, the individual will first go to the bank or building society where the account was held. They will be told that it has gone to the reclaim fund because the account has been dormant for 15 years or more. If the claim has some justification, it will then be necessary for the bank or building society to address the issue to the reclaim fund and for the reclaim fund to reach a judgment.

If one is going to have a one-stop shop, it would seem sensible for that stop to be the reclaim fund rather than any other organisation. The noble Lord did not answer the point that I made at the end in my intervention. As the Bill stands, the reclaim fund seems to be precluded from ascertaining the owners of dormant accounts transferred to it. I do not ask him to respond now, but that is, as I understand it, the way in which the Bill is drafted. I believe that the fund needs to have the authority to do that. I find what is proposed an extraordinarily convoluted way of proceeding. The data are never transferred to the reclaim fund. The noble Lord suggested that, when there is a dispute, the reclaim fund will have to go back to the banks as well, instead of acting as what it is supposed to be&#151;namely, a reclaim fund.

Quite clearly, a charity may believe that someone has died and left it some money but it is not sure with which bank the deceased had an account. In that case it would be better if, as the noble Lord said, there was a one-stop shop approach. None the less, given that there is this division of opinion between different types of charities, such a charity should have the right, if it believes the circumstances are such that it has a legitimate claim against a particular account, to go to the reclaim fund about that claim.

The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that charities may reclaim directly from the reclaim fund money that they are owed as a result of charitable legacies. We do not believe that it is appropriate to give charities the right to claim repayment of an account independently of the original executors of the deceased person&#146;s estate. Where an estate has been administered but other assets such as a bank account subsequently come to light, perhaps several years later, we believe that the proper process is for the original executors of the will to take responsibility for collecting and distributing the assets in accordance with the terms of the will.</p>

Different law and terminology apply in Scotland. The executors or administrators are responsible for claiming the money from the bank and subsequently distributing it to the deceased person&#146;s heirs.

In many cases the bank will simply not know whether the customer is still alive. I would like to clear up any confusion. I would like to make it clear that the legal right to repayment of a deceased individual&#146;s account passes directly to the executor of the will. It does not pass directly to third parties, such as the relatives, friends or charities who stand to inherit according to the terms of a will. It is the responsibility of the executor to collect in the assets and to make payments in accordance with the terms of an individual&#146;s will.

First, as the NCVO has argued in its briefing which has been circulated to all Peers, should a voluntary scheme prove unsuccessful there must be mechanisms in place to enable the Government to make mandatory the transfer of unclaimed assets from banks and building societies to the reclaim fund. This would ensure that the amount of money available for reinvestment in society is maximised&#151;which, after all, is the Government&#146;s stated motivation behind the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="080129102000208">The inclusion of reserve powers would not mean that the Government would have to make use of them, but would give them that option, should it prove necessary, without recourse to further primary legislation. This was a recommendation in the Treasury Select Committee&#146;s report and, while there are merits in the suggested light-touch voluntary scheme, we must be sure that there is enough take-up of the scheme by the banks. My concern is that the removal of unclaimed assets from a bank&#146;s balance sheet may mean that there is little incentive for them to participate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="080129102000211">Having listened to noble Lords in Grand Committee, I got the firm impression that a reserve power amendment would be put forward on Report, but as no amendment was tabled, I have tabled this amendment. It is vital that we include provisions in the Bill that ensure that we maximise the incentives for banks and building societies to reunite people, including the beneficiaries of wills, many of which are charities, with what is rightfully theirs&#151;their assets&#151;while also ensuring that where reunification efforts prove fruitless as much as possible is available for reinvestment in society. While a triennial report to Parliament, as proposed in an amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, would enable government to monitor the scheme&#146;s progress and make recommendations for improvement, there would be no mechanism in place to enable Parliament to implement its wishes should it then decide that a voluntary scheme was not working. That is a significant gap, and I hope the amendment will plug it.</p>

I struggle to reconcile that statement with the simple fact that it might save parliamentary time to include it on the face of this Bill, rather than having to return later. In fact, if a reserve power is not included and the voluntary approach fails, Parliament would have to pass primary legislation, and thus go through the whole debate again before the mandatory register could be established. That was why I thought we should have something in the Bill. The Government have included reserve powers in previous legalisation, such as in the Charities  Act 2006 in relation to the regulation of fundraising standards, so there is a precedent.</p>

<a name="80129-0004.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="080129102000213">I wonder whether we risk losing sight of what is at stake here. This is a technical Bill, but surely a simple principle also applies: it is that these are not our assets, they are not the Government&#146;s assets, they are not Parliament&#146;s and they are certainly not the industry&#146;s, however much it might profit from them. They are unclaimed assets that belong to individuals and which in many cases have been bequeathed to charity as a proportion of a deceased&#146;s estate. Of course, in cases where reunification efforts prove fruitless, such unclaimed assets would be to the public good and should be available to channel back into society. However, where it is possible to reunite people with what is rightfully theirs, that would seem to be the right thing to do. That is why the 54 charities that I referred to in my opening remarks are asking for help. One in seven people who dies leaves a valid will including legacy gifts to charity. On average, those gifts total 5 per cent of the total estate, so there are potentially large sums of legacy income that have yet to reach the charities named in the wills.</p>

<a name="80129-0004.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="080129102000214">As many of us know, legacies are a key part of the income stream of the voluntary sector. For example, 46 per cent of the British Heart Foundation&#146;s voluntary income comes from legacies, which came to over  &#163;47 million last year. One third of Cancer Research UK&#146;s voluntary income comes from legacies, which was more than &#163;135 million last year. In all, legacy income to the sector amounted to &#163;1.5 billion last year.</p>

<a name="80129-0004.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="080129102000215">The sad truth, however, is that as drafted, the Bill&#151;as the Minister knows&#151;does not compel financial institutions to make data on unclaimed assets more easily accessible to the general public and to charities. Instead, banks and building societies will be asked to publicise the fact that they hold unclaimed assets, which will be of no help to people who do not know which institution is holding a lost asset and, crucially, it will be of no help to charities trying to trace lost assets belonging to deceased people&#146;s estates. That is why it is important that we strengthen the Bill by ensuring a mandatory register is included in its provisions, whether that be by reserve power or by a provision that a mandatory register be created on the commencement of this Act. I urge the Government use the unique opportunity of the Bill to get the system right for the charitable sector. I beg to move.</p>

This amendment is designed to keep the parliamentary spotlight focused on dormant account schemes, and it specifically refers to reuniting schemes including those where wills are involved. It is designed to respond to the concerns that the noble Baroness raised. We felt that if the banks dragged their feet it would be possible for the parliamentary spotlight to be put on those unsatisfactory arrangements. The Government, whose powers of persuasion are capable of being very powerful in those situations, would then have a target to go for. It is not always necessary to have reserve powers. If there is a voluntary scheme which is not working, the Government&#151;certainly under pressure from Parliament&#151;could help to make it work better.</p>

<ul><a name="080129102000346">&#147;the establishment of a register of dormant accounts&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080129102000312">It is my understanding that the charities want to search for accounts long before they have become dormant. An account does not become dormant under this Bill until at least 15 years has passed, possibly longer. The charities want access to accounts earlier. That is what I understand the banks and building societies are going to deliver. We want to focus on what they are going to deliver, and to ensuring that works well. I also gulped a bit at the sweeping powers being given to the Secretary of State by the noble Baroness&#146;s arrangement. We often criticise the Government when they seek to take such powers. We are trying to achieve the same things as the noble Baroness but without the heavy hand of an unrestricted power. We believe in giving voluntarism, which underpins this Bill, a chance to work. For those reasons, we cannot support the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment.</p>

I again declare an interest as a member of the Commission on Unclaimed Assets. In discussions with banks and building societies showed that they were extremely reluctant at the beginning to come into a scheme&#151;and in some cases even to admit the existence of these assets. That is why it has remained a voluntary scheme.</p>

<a name="80129-0004.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="080129102000221">Secondly, we should remember how the money is going to be distributed. If, as I hope, some of the money&#151;perhaps quite a large amount&#151;is going to go to the wholesaler, who will distribute that money further? Again, the focus is on making the capacity of the third greater than it currently is. We should not assume that if we do not pass this amendment the charitable sector will be forgotten&#151;on the contrary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="080129102000223">I also pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, who moved the amendment. I am not going to accept it on behalf of the Government, and I will try to explain why. I shall deal first with the point about the central register. It is an important point but not as important as her point about whether this is a voluntary or perhaps eventually compulsory scheme. She pointed out that there had already been some discussion about the central register in the brief time that we have already spent on Report.</p>

<a name="80129-0004.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="080129102000224">We have concerns. We welcome the constructive suggestions as to how the industry&#146;s reuniting arrangements might be further improved, but a central register would be expensive and would place a large and unnecessary administrative burden on the scheme. More importantly, perhaps, there are concerns that financial institutions respect the confidentiality of the information that they hold about their customers. We would genuinely have to look carefully at the human rights implications of any power to issue regulations that in effect required banks to breach that confidentiality. Reuniting is important, however, and we welcome the banks&#146; and the building societies&#146; commitment to a major reunification exercise in the run-up to this scheme becoming operational. In particular, we welcome the BBA, the BSA and the NS&amp;I proposals for a single one-stop shop for reuniting, and their commitment to help hard-to-reach, disadvantaged customers. These proposals will allow people to be reunited with their lost money, and should, we hope and believe, make a register unnecessary.</p>

<a name="80129-0004.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="080129102000225">Participation in the scheme will be voluntary for individual banks and building societies. This has rightly been a focus of our debates. I say &#147;rightly&#148; because I would be the first to accept on behalf of the Government that these proposals are innovative. The unclaimed assets scheme will not be like other mandatory schemes in countries such as Ireland, which the noble Baroness mentioned, or even the United States. Our approach is based on clear and firm commitments on the part of the sector to participate in a voluntary scheme and to make it a success. We welcome those commitments, which are one of the reasons why we believe that we can implement a voluntary scheme with some confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="080129102000226">I draw noble Lords&#146; attention again to the public commitments set out in the joint foreword to the Treasury&#146;s consultation document on the scheme last year, which was jointly signed by the BBA and the BSA. I also draw the House&#146;s attention to the press notice that the industry released on 8 November 2007, which confirmed its continuing commitment to the scheme and illustrated that commitment to the major banking groups that have participated in discussions with the Government to date. Banking groups are fully committed to the scheme, and it is estimated that they represent about 90 per cent of all retail and saving balances held by those institutions in the UK. This is an illustration of the level of support that we believe we have for the scheme.</p>

<a name="80129-0005.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="080129102000227">If a voluntary scheme can be a success, it is not necessary to consider a compulsory scheme now or in the future. There are advantages to a voluntary scheme, and downsides to a compulsory one. A voluntary approach brings some flexibility; I hope that we agree on that. Our legislation provides a minimum definition of dormancy, but will allow individual institutions to refer to a range of indicators that suit their own capabilities and customer needs best in order to determine whether an account is genuinely dormant. This means that not all accounts that technically meet the legal definition of dormancy must be transferred, and enables only genuinely unclaimed accounts to be transferred into the scheme. As a result, the UK scheme will be less rigid than many other international schemes. It has been based on existing industry systems, helping to reduce what can easily run out of hand and add unnecessary administrative costs. It can also be kept up to date, in line with the latest technology. A voluntary scheme allows us to take account of better regulation principles, ensuring a low regulatory burden on business and helping to maximise the money available for reinvestment in the community. I see some noble Lords in the Chamber who are, like me, lucky enough to be involved in another Bill going through Committee, so I hope that this argument rings some bells with them. We believe that if there is an opportunity to maximise money for good causes with the sector&#146;s support, we should clearly take it. Let us be frank: a voluntary approach enables the use of private-sector expertise to manage liabilities to account holders. It is right that the private sector, which has the expertise to manage reclaim risk, should take on that function. As I have said, the sector is committed.</p>

<a name="80129-0005.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="080129102000228">I will look more carefully at the arguments put forward by some noble Lords that banks and building societies might renege on the commitments that they have entered into. We expect institutions to join the scheme in order to play a positive role in reuniting customers with their assets and making money available for community reinvestment. We believe that prestige is likely to be attached to participation, and we do not accept that the industry&#146;s profits really provide incentives not to participate in the scheme. The banking industry estimates that dormant accounts in the UK account for only 0.047 to  0.065 per cent of the totals in retail banking and savings balances held by the nine largest banking groups alone. The industry itself rejects the argument   


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_569"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column 569</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that retaining this money on its balance sheets is a disincentive to participation&#151;not, I repeat, a significant motivation for them. Yet, when we consider its potential to be used for good causes, we see that it is a significant amount to us and to the charities that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, so proudly praises&#151;and rightly so.</p>

<a name="80129-0005.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="080129102000229">Of course, the scheme must be highly transparent, to demonstrate that the banks and building societies are delivering on their commitments, to maintain public confidence in the scheme and to strengthen further the incentives for institutions both to reunite customers with their own money and to transfer genuinely dormant accounts to the scheme. Later, we will discuss the disclosure requirements in the Bill, which will result in details being published about which institutions are participating in the scheme, how they will participate and the value of assets transferred into the scheme and of those reunited with account holders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="080129102000230">We hear sympathetically what the noble Baroness says; indeed, we understand some of the scepticism.

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="080129102000231">I shall deal briefly with the reasons why a compulsory scheme is not the best option. In the light of the sector&#146;s ongoing support, we see no reason to take a reserve power to establish one. We may not agree again all afternoon, but on this occasion I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that the reserve power that the amendment would give to a Secretary of State is very great. We have fundamental concerns about the appropriateness of such a power, as a compulsory scheme would look completely different to a voluntary one. It would not be able to rely on the industry&#146;s willingness to establish a reclaim fund. In effect, the Bill would have to establish that fund as a public body and set out in detail an enforcement mechanism so that it was clear which sanctions would apply to institutions that failed to comply with the scheme. That would have to be monitored and regulated. I could go on, but the point is that a compulsory scheme would require extensive further legislation. I am sure that your Lordships will be delighted to hear that we do not believe that it would be appropriate to deal with such extensive legislation in secondary legislation. Fundamentally, it is not our intention to take substantial reserve powers that we do not believe to be necessary.</p>

<a name="80129-0005.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="080129102000232">In short, we have a lot of confidence in the scheme; let us see whether we are proved right. We do not expect our voluntary scheme to fail.

I do not believe that anybody has decreed that there should be no more mergers. It would be wrong for this Bill somehow to get in the way of what building societies naturally wish to do. I am suggesting neither that there should be further mergers, nor that there should not be further mergers. If, for reasons of their own, which might have something to do with cash machines or computers, the societies believed that there should be a merger, it would be very strange if, under this Bill, that merger meant that, in future, dormant accounts had to join the general scheme, rather than the two local schemes.</p>

Certainly, given the choice between the building societies&#146; own charities&#151;which all have independent trustees and are geared to what the society is interested in, by way of helping a community or the environment or whatever&#151;and the Big Lottery, I do not believe that a single member of a building society would vote for the Big Lottery.

In addition, cost efficiency is a criterion. This is money brought forward from a dormant situation. The existing charities, controlled by the charity commissioners, are very cost effective.

I want to address the issues he has brought to the House. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, has spoken to the point and with her usual succinctness; she said that she agrees with the noble Lord, Lord Shutt.

The Government&#146;s contention is that that is just not so. We recognise that&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, confessed&#151;of the 59 building societies, 51 are small enough, local enough and limited in their ambition enough to play their full part in local areas. We know which local areas would benefit from their work, and rightly so, because they have built themselves up on the basis of the community, as indicated by the noble Lord, Lord Naseby.</p>

As the noble Baroness indicated, the eight represent a substantial proportion of the resources that are likely to emerge from dormant accounts. It is reasonable therefore for the Government to say that local societies can do an enormous job in their localities and should be encouraged to do so, and that we want to encourage that local activity by such

It is a different matter altogether with the eight that are truly nationwide&#151;if not all by name; a relationship between location and point of origin has long been departed from because of the sheer size of the operation.</p>

<a name="80129-0005.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="080129102000261">The noble Lord, Lord Naseby, has to face up to facts. Of course I enjoyed his exemplar of the best assets and virtues of mutualisation, but anybody would think that no building society had ever demutualised, that there had never been an occasion when people vested with these virtues had ever taken a different view about the role of the building society and its transformation. We have seen that occur; and the noble Lord knows a great deal more about it than I do.</p>

<a name="80129-0005.htm_para29">
<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="080129102000262">All I am indicating is that there is a difference between the commitment of a local building society and that of the large institutions. During consultation we were challenged to define the credible threshold. We defined it as assets of about &#163;7 billion. Under the Bill, 51 out of the 59 building societies are defined as local. Only eight will be concerned with the wider distribution of resources. This is surely a perfectly reasonable position for the Government to adopt. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, was right to say that the Government were concerned about equity across the nation and about there being less money available for wider projects across the nation if all building societies were allowed to follow the local path and look to their local areas, if that could be defined in certain circumstances. Of course, she is right about that. That is the basis of the Government&#146;s case. There is a difference between resources that ought properly to be determined locally and resources from nationwide institutions whose dormant account money could properly be directed towards the benefit of local communities, but be defined in terms of national priorities. We have been clear about the basis on which we think those resources should be allocated.</p>

<a name="80129-0005.htm_para30">
<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="080129102000263">We shall debate these issues later. I hope that the House will forgive me if I have delved too far into issues concerning the Big Lottery Fund and its distribution role. Later amendments will require the Government to address themselves from the Dispatch Box to the pertinent points that will be made from the Opposition Benches in that regard. However, there is great advantage and fairness in distributing huge resources for the benefit of communities right across the nation as opposed to the arbitrariness that would flow from the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Shutt. The small building societies are concerned and knowledgeable about their localities. They are constantly in contact with them and are able to distribute resources to them accurately and effectively, in ways which the Government and the whole House commend. The eight big institutions will generate a huge percentage of the dormant account resources, as we see from the figures, and therefore a different distribution mechanism will be necessary. I know that there will be criticism of the distribution mechanism the Government have chosen, but suffice to say that we have chosen one which is involved in nationwide distribution but has regional and local branches and, of course, understands the separateness of the nations of the United Kingdom in this regard. That is the basis of the role of Big with regard to distribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="080129102000264">I cannot go any further at this stage because there is an issue of principle between us. The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, made it clear right from the beginning that a building society is a building society, that is has strong local links and should be allowed to deploy whatever resources come out of its dormant accounts as it sees fit. We seek a clear differentiation between resources that would benefit discrete localities and bigger resources that could more effectively be distributed through another route. That is the bone of contention between us. I see that I have not persuaded the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, but I give way to the noble Lord, Lord Naseby.</p>

Does he not understand that the Coventry Building Society is involved in an area round Coventry? I do not think that there is a branch of the Coventry Building Society in London. I do not think that the Chelsea Building Society has a branch in Coventry. These are primarily local societies. The one example the Minister gave was Nationwide. Nationwide did a marketing exercise. It is the old Co-op movement. If one analyses what happens to its charitable money, one sees that it is all geared to local former Co-op areas. It is time that the Minister recognised the history of that society.</p>

That might be the case with other big building societies. Is the noble Lord saying that because London does not have a local building society, it has no local communities? I refer not just to London&#151;it may be the case that other significant cities do not have building societies with his mutualisation philosophy. For the Government, the process of mutualisation and the existence of the institutions are not sufficient guarantees of fairness to the people and communities of the United Kingdom. That is why we added an additional mechanism to the one favoured by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt.</p>

I would like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, for their comments. In an idle moment this morning, I looked at those building society websites that I could find. Without access to the registers, I do not know where the members live; but one way of looking at this is to find where the branches are. I looked at the websites of the Skipton Building Society and the West Bromwich Building Society. Most branches of the Skipton are in Yorkshire and most branches of the West Bromwich are in the West Midlands. Most branches of the Chelsea are in London and most branches of the Leeds Building Society and the Yorkshire Building Society are in Yorkshire. I did accept at the outset that the Nationwide was just that. But as the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, indicated, it was based on the old Co-operative Permanent Building Society, which decided in 1970 to cheer itself up with a new name. I would venture that the reason that it did not demutualise was because of its co-operative

I would submit that since that wave of demutualisations, the mutuals&#151;I have seen this on the websites&#151;have said, &#147;Look, we have got to be proud about being mutual, we have got to say there is something special about being mutual&#148;. They say that their generosity is special&#151;I refer, for example, to the percentages of profits that they put into charitable foundations and the fact that they bring in independent people to disburse these funds.</p>

On that basis, I believe that this is the time to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"><a name="080129102000339">&#147;A reclaim fund must send to the Treasury as soon as possible ... annual accounts and&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080129102000315">other information. It continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"><a name="080129102000340">&#147;The Treasury must lay before ... Parliament ... any directions&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080129102000316">that it has given to the reclaim fund, as well as accounts and other information. As I said, if we are not to have a statutory scheme, it is important that we make certain that there is real accountability to Parliament.</p>

<a name="80129-0006.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="080129102000281">Amendment No. 17 is about the accountability of the general scheme. It was interesting that, in Committee, my noble friend Lord Newby and I were berated by the Minister for not enthusing about the devolution elements. I put that right, right now: I enthuse. Looking at Clause 18 for the Welsh, Clause 19 for the Scots and Clause 20 for Northern Irish, one finds that after some Barnett formula-type split, the devolved Ministers can put an order to those devolved Assemblies, after consultation with the Big Lottery Fund and others, and the orders then have to be approved by resolution of the devolved Assemblies on how the money is spent. But what about England? What we know about the Bill is that the resources that go via the Big Lottery Fund have to be used for young people or for financial inclusion or for the social investment bank. However, there is no order to come back to Parliament; there is no consultation; and there is no suggestion about the disposition of resources between the three types of expenditure. Is it any wonder that some people here think that there is something called &#147;the English question&#148;?</p>

Parliamentary oversight and transparency are ingredients that are largely missing from the Bill. These amendments, together with amendments that I shall move later, are essential to underpin the dormant-account scheme. In Committee, we were repeatedly told that it was to be a voluntary scheme and that the Bill merely facilitated that. However, there is huge public interest in the success or otherwise of the scheme, and Parliament is being asked to set up the structure without being given any way of tracking the scheme as it goes forward&#151;it is just written out of the script.</p>

<a name="80129-0006.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="080129102000284">The reclaim fund will publish important information about the work of the scheme in  its annual report and in the list required by  Schedule 1. Do the Government expect individual parliamentarians to search out that information all the time in case they miss something? It seems to me to be a no-brainer that the information should be laid before Parliament as soon as it is available. The reclaim fund is being set up as a statutory body; it could as easily have been a public body because it is channelling money towards the Big Lottery Fund. If it were a public body, it would have had accountability arrangements set out for it. In truth, because of the involvement of the Treasury  and the oversight of the FSA, this is a hybrid body, and we need to reflect Parliament's natural interest  in that.</p>

<a name="80129-0006.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="080129102000285">I fully support what the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, said on Clause 21 with regard to spending, the involvement of Parliament in that, and in particular the social investment fund, which the Government have told us is not one of their favoured spending priorities. There are many, including the Commission on Unclaimed Assets, which the Government charged with looking at how dormant account money should be spent, who believe that it is essential to set up a social investment fund. It needs a significant critical mass of money to get it going.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="080129102000286">One of the most disappointing things that we heard in Committee was that the Secretary of State mentioned throughout the Bill, who will be responsible for giving directions to the Big Lottery Fund in connection with how the money is to be spent, is to be Mr Ed Balls. He is the Secretary of State with responsibility for schools; he does not have responsibility for social investment. The chances of any money going to social investment without any parliamentary involvement at all seems to us to be very small, which is why we need to keep Parliament involved.</p>

Their arguments have not changed a great deal.</p>

<a name="80129-0006.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="080129102000289">We have thought about the issue carefully, and I will demonstrate more effectively than I was perhaps able to in Committee why the Government think that these two amendments are unnecessary. However, we are of course not against the objectives behind the amendments. Because the operation of this scheme&#151;which I hasten to add is a private one&#151;is directed towards public purposes and Ministers have a role to play in it, it must be accountable and transparent. We want to meet the objectives which noble Lords opposite have identified, but have gone about it in a different way. I shall explain why, and why our system and proposals will work.</p>

<a name="80129-0006.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="080129102000290">I first make it absolutely clear that the reclaim fund is not a government body. The legislation defines the reclaim fund and sets out a clearly defined set of conditions to which the fund is subject, including matters that it must include in its articles of association, but it is a private institution. The issues of parliamentary scrutiny and accountability for a private body are different from those for a public one, which would be directly answerable in the public domain. Of course we have a different approach  from any non-departmental public body or other institution which the Government have set up. This is a private scheme.</p>

<a name="80129-0006.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="080129102000291">In this private scheme, banks and building societies may cancel their liabilities to customers only if they transfer their assets to the reclaim fund. Of course, the reclaim fund will be established in compliance with the conditions set out in this legislation, and will be authorised and supervised by the Financial Services Authority. The industry, which will set up the reclaim fund, published on 8 November a timetable for selecting candidates and having interviews later this year. We await further updates on the running of the reclaim fund and how it will be constituted, but it will operate within the constraints of this legislation. I therefore cannot say now who will be running the reclaim fund. That will depend on the selection process of these private institutions for this private body. Of course, if a suitable candidate does not come forward to apply for FSA authorisation at the end of the process, the industry representatives will have to establish a reclaim fund themselves. They have made a public commitment to that action of last resort.</p>

<a name="80129-0006.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="080129102000292">Once it is established under the provisions of the Bill, the reclaim fund will be entirely independent of government. The Government will not make appointments to the board or membership; nor do we feel it necessary or appropriate to do so. The expertise for managing the reclaim fund lies within the private sector, not government. We do not want to place controls over the reclaim fund in this way. Rather, we set out in legislation what we regard as sufficient checks and balances on a private institution to ensure that it will have a clear purpose from which it will not depart and that the requirements in legislation are  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_582"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column 582</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>enforceable in the highly unlikely circumstances that it would be necessary to take any action. However, the reclaim fund is not a public body. I maintain that the Opposition are putting forward proposals for parliamentary scrutiny that are applicable only to a public body. This is manifestly not one. In other circumstances, they would be only too eager to emphasise how government should regulate with a light hand. If I have stood at this Dispatch Box once, I have stood here a hundred times, and heard of the bonfire of regulations that is necessary for a light touch with all sorts of institutions. The reclaim fund is a private institution and we are proposing to regulate it with a light touch. The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, are seeking the heavy hand of parliamentary regulation as if the reclaim fund were some kind of direct public body. I ask them to consider whether they really have a commitment to dealing with this body in this form. Have they in mind a precedent for a private company or institution being required to report directly to government or to Parliament in the way that their amendment contends?</p>

<a name="80129-0007.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="080129102000293">We have taken an innovative approach in the Bill to this interesting&#151;I shall not say unique&#151;institution, the reclaim fund. That is the nature of our task because we are introducing an unclaimed assets scheme that is about private property being reclaimed at best by those who have the right to own it, with the reclaim fund being only the residual position when attempts to restore funds to private citizens have failed. Then the money goes to the reclaim fund. The reclaim fund is a product of the work of the private institutions which are committed to this legislation. The other factor we must bear in mind is that these commitments are made by private institutions&#151;the banks and building societies&#151;to tackle the problem of moneys that have been placed with them for keeping which they cannot return to the proper owners. Those moneys will go to a reclaim fund that they will institute and be responsible for. That could not be further from a regulated public body.</p>

<a name="80129-0007.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="080129102000294">Clause 5 sets out the three purposes that the reclaim fund must have: it must meet repayment claims; it must manage money prudently; and it must transfer surplus funds to the Big Lottery Fund for distribution. Those are the three constraints on it. That is where public policy comes into play. The law defines this private institution, but the Bill sets out clear ways in which the fund fulfils the obligation. First, with regard to customer repayment, let me make the obvious point: the banks and building societies are making strenuous efforts to ensure, as best they can, that they reacquaint customers with their resources. A customer has a statutory right to repayment. If the money has gone to the fund because the account has been dormant for 15 years or more, the individual&#146;s right to claim that money is still there, and the fund must have a process for how it can be claimed. That is public policy and is a constraint built into this legislation. However, that is not the same thing as parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80129-0007.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="080129102000295">Secondly, the reclaim fund has to manage its money prudently. It will take control of significant assets, and we would all want to be absolutely assured  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_583"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column 583</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that it maintains sufficient resources to meet any future claims from customers. Otherwise it will miss the principle on which we are operating. Individual customers have the right to their assets if they can establish a claim, even after 15 years or a multiple of 15 years. If the money is in the reclaim fund and it is theirs, the reclaim fund must repay it. That is specified in the Bill. The body will be subject to the Financial Services Authority&#151;prudential regulation of such an institution.</p>

<a name="80129-0007.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="080129102000296">Thirdly, the reclaim fund is obliged to transfer its surplus to Big. It must on the one hand calculate how much money it needs to protect its undeniable duty to meet future claims, and on the other transfer the surplus money so that distribution can occur. We cannot specify these amounts of money. We do not know the original totals which will occur, let alone what this fund will look like as times goes on. Yet Schedule 1 to the Bill is absolutely clear on how the reclaim fund will operate. The legislation also states clearly that the reclaim fund may use the money it receives to defray its operating expenses as long as they are reasonable. Again, the body is prescribed in law&#151;if this Bill becomes an Act.</p>

<a name="80129-0007.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="080129102000297">I emphasise that the reclaim fund has to be transparent. That is absolutely crucial to this dormant account scheme. The scheme will not work if it is not operating with full public awareness of what it is doing. We are all united in this House on this necessity for transparency. Schedule 1 requires the reclaim fund to publish annually a list of institutions participating in the scheme, the amount of money transferred into the scheme at individual institution level, the amount of money reclaimed by consumers also at individual institution level, and the aggregate amount of money that they pass on to Big. This information will be available for public scrutiny. It will be in the public domain, so this body has to be accountable.</p>

<a name="80129-0007.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="080129102000298">The issue identified by the noble Lord and the noble Baroness with their amendment is that this is not good enough and that we need parliamentary scrutiny of its operations. Of course if Parliament wishes to scrutinise or debate any specific figure or point of detail in any work of the reclaim fund, among us in this place we have the expertise to subject to public scrutiny a body which is fulfilling a public purpose but is a private institution. If there is any doubt that we might lack the expertise to do that, I do not doubt our capacity for that for one instant. The other place is scarcely going to let any malpractice occur without Members of Parliament finding many conceivable ways of drawing public attention to any misuse of that body&#146;s rights and powers.</p>

<a name="80129-0007.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="080129102000299">I appreciate the intentions behind Amendment No. 17&#151;that parliamentary scrutiny of the directions to Big is required. But we have clear transparency of operations. Establishing a role for Parliament in the issuing of directions regarding Big&#146;s expenditure in England is a pretty heavy-handed way of controlling this position. Of course the Government are bound to say that this is excessively heavy handed, but the Delegated Powers Committee, which reported last November, noted that the approach set out in the Bill follows the model that functions under the National

I believe it said, as he rightly stated, that it was a finely balanced affair. This was following the scheme in the lottery Acts, but if it had not been for that, the powers taken were wide enough to be described as having a legislative purpose.

On the question of scrutiny, however&#151;I believe that the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, would concede this point&#151;the committee regarded the Government&#146;s position as being well within the confines of the way in which the provisions of the National Lottery Act already operate. Indeed, this House considered that Act, as did the other place, to a very great extent a few short years ago.</p>

<a name="80129-0007.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="080129102000302">The amendment deals with the powers of the Secretary of State. The noble Baroness is distressed that one particular Secretary of State is vested with the responsibility of exercising these powers. I make the obvious point that there must always be one. In circumstances in which it is clear that a number of Ministries have a real interest in this issue, I assure the House that the work will be the product of interdepartmental work by civil servants. However, there must be ministerial responsibility, and the appropriate Ministry here is the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

The suggestion is that Big should operate under the National Lottery Act without excessive constraints, but that in its operation of this particular issue, there should be additional parliamentary scrutiny of the direction. Let me say that the affirmative procedure&#151;in other words, if the Secretary of State had to table approval for the decisions that he has to take&#151;would exaggerate the necessity. It was not thought necessary with the National Lottery Act, which set up a public body. This is a private body; yet it is being suggested that the parliamentary scrutiny of that body should be at that level of intensity.</p>

This body will be accountable, transparent and answerable. There is no question that it will not be subject to public scrutiny as envisaged in the Bill.

<p><a name="080129102000317">If that is not the Treasury saying to this private company, &#147;You shall do something&#148;, what is? That is so clear. All Amendment No. 10 says is that these people who are required to do things had better be required to send some accounts. The Treasury should then lay those accounts before Parliament and tell us about the directions. That is simple and straightforward; I see no great problem in that. The dilemma for the Minister is his concern that this is a sort of private affair. The main thing is that this is primarily about something that is being done for the public good. Lots of people want to see the right thing being done for the public good. It therefore seems to me that this very simple matter should be acceptable.</p>

There is all this talk of this being voluntary, but only one volunteer decides how the Big Lottery Fund shall spend the money. There has been tremendous concern about the disposition of the money. Many people could think of all sorts of bright ideas for the use of this money, but by and large people have thought, &#147;Fair enough: youth, yes&#151;bearing in mind where the money is coming from; financial inclusion, yes; social investment bank, not quite certain but we&#146;ll give it a go&#148;. However, this one volunteer will say, &#147;&#163;300 million for that, &#163;50 million for that, and &#163;50 million for that&#148;. Surely the people who have had such great concern about the disposition of these resources and who represent people in various places should have a say in this, rather than it being at the whim of one Minister at the particular moment when the penny drops, the money is available and Parliament is not involved.

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="080129116000006">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Clause 10 contains some technical rules on what is dormant. Subsection (1) defines what is dormant and subsection (2) defines what is not. In Grand Committee we probed the definitions with many examples of real-life situations where the technical rules may have been met. For instance, we raised the case of an account that would have been classified as dormant within the terms of Clause 10 although in reality it was not dormant. This includes cases where the customer has told the bank not to treat the account as dormant or where the customer does not want communications from the bank. If the noble Lord, Lord Monson, had been in his place, he would have explained that in the context of Amendment No. 11A. We also talked about family disputes where agreement cannot be reached on how trustees or executives can access accounts, so that although those accounts apparently remain dormant, they are not dormant. Some accounts exist merely to pay interest to another person but the capital is left untouched. I went through many other examples in Committee. The Government said that the banks would not treat those accounts as dormant, but the Bill would allow them to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="080129116000007">As we are dealing with accounts that do not belong to the banks, it should not be for the banks to determine whether an account is dormant. We are concerned with the property rights of individuals who would be entitled to tell banks how they want to be treated; for example, if they never want their accounts to be treated as dormant within the context of the Bill. We have a fear that the banks will write computer programs to identify dormant accounts in accordance with Clause 10 or with other defined mechanical criteria. That is how computers work. This algorithm would be used to identify dormant accounts which

As I explained in Committee, the covenant of the reclaim fund could well be considerably weaker than the covenant of the bank with which the account was held. So there is a very good reason why individuals may not want their accounts to be transferred for repayment purposes to the reclaim fund.</p>

However, as Amendment  No. 12 is in many ways an alternative to it, perhaps I may speak to them both.</p>

<a name="80129-0007.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="080129116000011">Amendment No. 11A was based on the presumption that it is not unreasonable for an individual to decide to put few hundred or a few thousand pounds into a bank or building society for the proverbial rainy day, and to leave that sum wholly undisturbed for 15, 20 or even 25 years if such a day never arrives. If that is accepted, the account holder should not have to stay awake at night worrying whether his account might be declared dormant against his wishes, nor should he be put to any other form of inconvenience. However, as the Bill is drafted, the only other way in which he can be 100 per cent confident of not having to worry is by formally declaring that he does not want to receive any communication whatever from the bank or building society concerning the account. Who but the most extreme eccentric would in practice want to opt for such a course? I suppose that the only exception would be someone who does not want other members of his family to know that he has a large amount of money stashed away in an account. But such people cannot amount to more than one depositor in 1,000, at the outside.</p>

It does not alter the position of account holders potentially affected by the scheme. Instead, the amendment mirrors how the scheme is intended to operate: that banks and building societies will transfer only genuinely dormant accounts to the scheme.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="080129116000015">The Bill&#146;s provisions set a clear minimum requirement that an account must meet for it to be eligible for transfer to the scheme. First, there must have been no customer-initiated transaction in the account for 15 years. The scheme is voluntary for financial institutions, and we believe that one of its key advantages is that banks and building societies will have the flexibility to refer to other forms of customer-initiated activity before deciding whether an account is truly dormant. That includes correspondence, e-mails, telephone calls and activity on other accounts. Institutions may differ in the approach that they take to recording such activity, but we fully expect banks and building societies not to transfer these accounts where they are aware that an account is active.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="080129116000016">Noble Lords have occasionally in our debates seemed sceptical of banks&#146; and building societies&#146; intention to act on their knowledge of customer activity under the definition provided in the Bill. However, the scheme has been designed to give both banks and building societies the ability to act on whatever knowledge they may have about the account or the account holder. This will allow individual institutions to take a more sophisticated approach, suited to their particular capabilities, to identifying dormant accounts. This approach will be more sophisticated than would be permitted under similar international schemes which commonly focus only on customer-initiated transactions.</p>

With great respect, this amendment is out of step with those intentions and goes no further in protecting consumers. The <I>Banking Code</I> already refers to dormant accounts, and, in section 9.16, explains that if a customer has money in a dormant account, it will always belong to that account holder.  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_591"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column 591</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Once the scheme is operational, banks and building societies will be required to follow the <I>Banking Code</I> provisions relating to the scheme.

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="080129116000018">On 8 November, the BBA made an announcement confirming that the banking industry itself is in the process of amending the <I>Banking Code</I> to reflect just this. The BBA and the Building Societies Association also have 10 core pledges underpinning their existing tracing schemes for dormant-account holders. These set out how banks and building societies, in addition to the BBA and the BSA, should treat dormant-account holders. The pledges will be updated to reflect our new scheme. They will continue to require a bank or building society to try to re-establish contact with a customer before making their account dormant; to inform customers about their policy and when an account may be deemed dormant; and to inform them about the process for reclaiming money in a transferred dormant account.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="080129116000019">Should the customer seek repayment when the balance in an account is transferred to the scheme, they will be able to contact their bank or building society. It is envisaged that the process for these customers to reclaim what is their own money should be no different from the process to reclaim an account which an institution has deemed dormant for internal purposes but where the institution has not transferred the money to the scheme. The Bill gives affected account holders a right to repayment. The scheme has been designed so that banks and building societies will be able to refer to a range of consumer activities in deciding whether an account is dormant.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="080129116000020">As the noble Lord, Lord Monson, spoke to his amendment I shall out of courtesy deal briefly with what he said. It is quite similar to what I said in response to the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. It is intended to base the scheme on genuinely dormant bank and building society accounts which have been forgotten or lost by the account holder. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would extend the exclusion from the scheme of no-mail accounts to accounts where the holder has instructed their bank or building society to send periodic only statements but no other mail.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="080129116000021">Generally, no-mail accounts are those where, as the House will know, the account holder has requested that their bank does not contact them. If the bank or building society has not had a statement returned to them indicating that the account holder is no longer at that address, then it is possible that the account holder is still aware of their account. However, in some circumstances a bank may wish to clarify to clarify with the account holder&#151;not only for the purposes of the scheme, but for its own operational purposes&#151;whether the account holder is aware of the account. If the account is operating under strict no-mail conditions then it follows that the bank simply cannot contact the account holder to establish that. However, if the account is operating under more usual arrangements, the bank will be able to contact the account holder to establish whether the account is dormant or merely rarely used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="080129116000022">The voluntary nature of this scheme will allow banks and building societies the flexibility to refer to customer-initiated activities that may indicate that an account is, in fact, not dormant even if there have been no transactions on the account. If the institution understands the account holder to be aware of their account&#151;for example, by requesting periodic statements&#151;we fully expect institutions to take note of the relevant circumstances and not transfer such accounts.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="080129116000023">Ultimately, carving the accounts to which the noble Lord refers out of the scope of the Bill could remove a large amount of possible dormant account money that could go to good causes. This step is unnecessary because the scheme&#146;s flexibility allows banks and building societies to make a judgment and to take a sophisticated approach to determining whether accounts are dormant. That is why, although we understand exactly the intention behind the two amendments, neither is necessary. If this were a compulsory scheme then there may well be a need for such provision in the Bill. However, because the scheme is voluntary&#151;a scheme which I think is supported by most noble Lords on all sides of the House&#151;neither amendment is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="080129116000031">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendment inserts a new clause after Clause 10 requiring a triennial report to Parliament on the operation of the dormant account arrangements. As the Minister will recall, we had long discussions in Committee about the arrangements to transfer dormant account money. Very broadly, we argued for more specificity in this Bill, but the Minister&#146;s consistent response was that these arrangements constituted a private scheme undertaken voluntarily. He said that the reclaim fund was a private fund and that Part 1 merely facilitated private arrangements. That was the Government&#146;s main reason for resisting a large number of amendments.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="080129116000032">We simply do not buy the approach of little involvement from the Government but, importantly, almost no involvement from Parliament. The Government have reached an agreement with the British Bankers&#146; Association and the Building Societies Association that they will hand over the dormant money; and that  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_596"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column 596</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is good. But the Government have been so keen to get their hands on the money that they have agreed to leave the banks and building societies almost entirely in the driving seat for the detailed arrangements. We do not believe that the Government&#146;s approach is responsible.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="080129116000033">Instead of tabling a raft of detailed amendments, we have decided to propose this amendment to give the Treasury and Parliament more insight into various aspects of the arrangements. We have chosen a pragmatic path, which involves reporting to Parliament on the scheme as it starts to work. My amendment requires a report by the Treasury to be published and laid before both Houses of Parliament every three years. It has to cover many of the things that we have already discussed today, and I hope it meets the concerns of the charities behind the Unclaimed Assets Charities Coalition, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, who is no longer in her place, spoke.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="080129116000034">New subsection (2)(a) deals with the issue of the register. We debated that matter earlier today. We firmly believe that it is important that there is continuing scrutiny about how well those arrangements are working in practice. We recognise that many in the charity sector doubt whether they will do so. Parliament needs to keep that under review.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="080129116000035">Paragraphs (b) and (c) focus on how much is actually being transferred to the scheme and how much could be transferred. Again, there are doubts about whether this voluntary scheme will be fully complied with. This will allow an ongoing review. That was one of the concerns outlined by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and it is an alternative approach to compulsion. Paragraph (e) focuses on whether the repayment arrangements work in practice. They have to work well if consumers are to have confidence in a scheme that transfers their money ultimately to the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="080129116000036">I have already spoken this afternoon about how banks identify accounts as dormant. The Bill&#146;s minimalist approach may or may not cause problems in practice. The Bill says that dormancy will start only after 15 years, which is way in excess of any other international scheme. We need to keep under review the evidence of the relationship between the expiry of time and dormancy. This and other issues in relation to dormancy are covered by paragraph (e).</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="080129116000037">As we debated in Committee, the Bill modestly confines itself to the accounts held in banks and building societies. We were unable to table amendments to cover the wider range of other assets that are similarly lying unclaimed. We want to keep public focus on expanding the range of assets to be liberated from dormancy and put to good use. That concern is also shared by the Unclaimed Assets Charities Coalition. This is provided by paragraph (f); and paragraph (b) will allow any other matters to be addressed.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="080129116000038">The report will require the Treasury to identify unsatisfactory arrangements and say how improvements could be made and whether legislation is required. We do not believe that legislation is automatically required where deficiencies are identified. The nature of a

What better way to promote change than a debate sparked by a report prepared by the Treasury and laid before Parliament?</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="080129116000039">I do not rule out further legislation. Sometimes that is required, but we hope that when something can be done voluntarily it will be, because volunteerism is always our first port of call.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="080129116000040">In Committee, the Minister told us that the Treasury would review the scheme at some time and in some way. It was not clear whether such a review would be published. That is not good enough. We believe that parliamentary involvement should be hard-wired into this Bill on the basis of a regular report. I beg to move.</p>

I would call this &#147;accountability and action&#148;. As the Minister said earlier, this is a novel way of going forward; if so, it had better be right. The triennial report would be a very good way to consider that and to see whether reuniting is going fine, whether the reclaim fund is working well and whether we have confidence in the voluntary scheme.</p>

<a name="80129-0008.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="080129116000042">I am particularly attracted to the paragraph that says we need to raise the horizons and look at other orphan assets. We know that in other places, such as Ireland, other assets have been brought in. If this report is brought forward, it will enable people watching the scheme to look at international comparisons. I hope that the scheme is a great success. As the Minister indicated, I am an enthusiast for the scheme. I hope that insurance, unclaimed dividends, shares and betting slips&#151;you name it&#151;can be brought into the scheme.</p>

We agree in principle with the concepts that lie behind the amendment. This is a good opportunity to look to a time when the scheme is up and running. We need to consider such matters because this is an innovative scheme. I emphasise the fact that the transfer of money into the scheme will be managed by a reclaim fund run by the private sector, under private arrangements put in place by the reclaim fund of the banks. That will be in compliance with the legislation, the <I>B</I><I>anking </I><I>C</I><I>ode</I> and the FSA regulations.</p>

I listened to the questions today and in Committee about the scope of the Bill. I remind the House that this Bill is restricted only to bank and building society accounts and that other assets and other schemes are outside the scope of the legislation. Therefore, when we look at the review we will be looking at that. I also do not see any great merit in the amendment which suggests that there should be regular reviews every three years. I cannot see the logic behind that.</p>

<a name="80129-0009.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="080129116000047">I can see the necessity for the Government to respond to the principle of review, and so at Third Reading we will come back with a statement on how we think that review should be carried out. We will consider carefully when an appropriate time for the implementation of the review will be, in line with better regulation practice and we will take into account the available data on participation levels and the amount transferred to Big for distribution. The noble Baroness may be right that after three years we will be in a position to make those judgments. We do not think that we are in a position at this stage, and certainly it would be wrong to place in the legislation an amendment which ties us down on the matter.

I hope that I will at least be given credit for the fact that I am not indicating straightforward disagreement with the amendment; far from it. I accept the principle behind it. The Government have the right to indicate that they will try to solve this problem in their own way. It will then be for the House to judge whether that way is satisfactory.</p>

When the Minister started to speak I thought that we were getting somewhere but, as he pointed out, we considered a very similar amendment in Committee. He said very similar things in response; that is, there would be some kind of review at some time, but gave no indication of what would be in it, when it would take place, whether Parliament would be involved or a lot of other things. The only advance we have made concerns the things that the Minister does not want. He does not want there to be a regular report to Parliament and he certainly does not want it to include other assets. We think that those two aspects are very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="080129116000061">The noble Lord said: My Lords, we return to territory that is familiar to those of us who have been in Grand Committee&#151;the name of the dormant account money that is in the hands of the Big Lottery Fund. I suggest that this should be called &#147;the Reawakened Fund&#148;.</p>

<a name="80129-0009.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="080129116000062">The Minister made some helpful comments in Committee. It is clear that the fund will be kept separate, that it will be marketed separately and that it will be accounted for separately. I want to be certain that it will be labelled separately. In a sense, there is a lot of &#147;re&#148; about this Bill&#151;there is reference to reuniting and reclaiming, so it is appropriate that these dormant funds are being &#147;reawakened&#148;. I indicated in Committee that there are people&#151;perhaps they are a minority, even a small minority, but they are there&#151;who do not want to apply for, or use, funds that they believe are from the National Lottery. They believe that their causes should not benefit from the proceeds of gambling. Therefore it is very important that the fund is properly named. We have had a week or two to think about it. I have not come up with anything else and neither have the Government. So let us have another try and use the word &#147;reawakened&#148;. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="080129116000063"><b><a name="80129-0009.htm_spnew7"><a name="080129116000699">Lord Bach:</b> My Lords, we on this side appreciate and admire the noble Lord&#146;s spirited attempt to ensure that the investment of dormant account funds in communities across the UK is properly recognised. It is our intention that the distribution of dormant account funds should be appropriately publicised, reflecting the unique opportunity they present to make a real difference to communities across the UK. However, the effect of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is to impose a UK-wide brand. I hope that the House will appreciate that, just as it is important that the devolved Administrations set their own spending areas, so it is important that the use of dormant account resources is branded in a way appropriate to each of their communities. At this early stage, it is not appropriate to take decisions about the branding and publicising of dormant account fund investments that would then stand, whether they were right or wrong. I hope that when the appropriate time comes, expert and public opinion will contribute to the consideration. There may well be a degree of consultation, particularly among young people, about what the brand should be in Scotland, Wales and England.</p>

<a name="80129-0009.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="080129116000064">With the greatest respect, these are matters that should be properly beyond the House. This does not need to be in the legislation. If the amendment was prompted by a desire for government reassurance yet again about the ways in which dormant account funding would be delineated from other funds distributed by Big, which I know in large measure it is, let me once again try to reassure the noble Lord and the House. Big is clear that any non-lottery funding will be accounted for and promoted independently from lottery funding. The Bill requires Big to report annually on any grants made with dormant account money, and Big has committed regularly to update its website with grant details. This will be clearly branded as distinct and separate from lottery funding.</p>

<a name="80129-0009.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="080129116000065">The Big Lottery Fund is fully accountable to the Secretary of State and Parliament for lottery distribution.

I remind the noble Lord, as I am sure he knows, that Big already runs a non-lottery funding programme, the Community Assets programme, on behalf of the Office of the Third Sector. This is an example of a programme that is clearly branded as distinct and separate from lottery funding. Big&#146;s work on the Community Assets programme is accompanied by the following statement:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"><a name="080129116000086">&#147;The Big Lottery Fund is delivering the Community Assets programme on behalf of the Office of the Third Sector. This is not lottery funding&#148;.</p>

<a name="80129-0009.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="080129116000066">That is one example of how Big already manages a clear separation of its funds. The Government expect that Big will similarly manage to ensure that dormant account funding remains publicly and operationally distinct. While we have great sympathy and more with the noble Lord&#146;s intention, we think that it is too early to give a definitive name to this fund. I repeat that those who run it in other parts of the country will want to brand it in their own ways. I ask the noble Lord rhetorically, &#147;Is it really for us, today, while the Bill is going through Parliament, to give it a name that, once given, cannot easily be changed?&#148;. I thank him very warmly for dealing with this issue, but I invite him to think again and perhaps to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="080129116000071">I regard the Minister&#146;s words as very important, and so I come back with another amendment today taking account of them. The amendment allows the Big Lottery Fund to distribute money to other lottery distributors for meeting expenditure on exactly the same terms, so that it has a &#147;social or environmental purpose&#148; as is written into the Bill. It gives the Big Lottery Fund that power.</p>

<a name="80129-0009.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="080129116000072">One of the problems with the Big Lottery Fund, as my noble friend Lord Eccles said at Second Reading, is that in effect it has become the arm of government. We can see from its annual report that it is seriously oversubscribed. Last year alone, it received applications of &#163;8 billion for an income of &#163;600 million. I am afraid that it has lost its way, and it is giving money all over the place. In the accounts, one can see that it gave nearly &#163;900 million to statutory bodies, including  &#163;112,000 to Wakefield Council to spend on a traffic calming scheme, &#163;315,000 to Blyth Valley Borough Council for the enhancement of footpaths and &#163;27,000 to Exeter Council for a new walking route network. I am sure that those walking route networks and paths are important, but do we really think that they are a matter for lottery spending? Can they possibly be additional or anything to do with the principles of the lottery and how it was set up? They really are part of government expenditure, whether that be national or local government.</p>

<a name="80129-0009.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="080129116000073">The Big Lottery Fund has become huge. It has about 1,100 employees, which is about the same number of employees as the Treasury. Some 12 per cent of its budget is spent on administration, which costs &#163;77 million a year. It has become too big and too cumbersome. The most important thing is that it is getting all this extra money when we know that, because of the Olympics, &#163;675 million is being diverted from the lottery to the Olympics, which is mainly falling on the other distributing bodies. They are not getting any of that money and they are under pressure. My amendment does not force the Big Lottery Fund to give money to the other distributing bodies, but it allows it to do so. To come back for a moment to additionality, when the previous lottery Bill was passing through Parliament, we tabled an amendment requiring the Big Lottery Fund to report on additionality. We await that report with mounting excitement. It might win this year&#146;s prize for fiction; or it might be honest with the facts. We wait to see.</p>

<a name="80129-0009.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="080129116000074">The central point is that the distributing bodies that have suffered most because of the Olympics, such as the arts and the sporting bodies that are not involved in the Olympics, are very short of funds. This is an opportunity for the Government to say to the Big Lottery Fund that they can help it to make up the deficit that those bodies have suffered. Can the Minister tell me whether the Government can do that under the Bill anyway? It may be that they have the power already. This amendment gives the Minister an opportunity to tell noble Lords whether that is the case. I beg to move.</p>

Indeed, that would be a cheap and effective way of distributing funds. The Big Lottery Fund should be not only permitted but encouraged to make use of that pool of talent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="080129122000007">The amendment possibly had a modest objective. The noble Viscount may have been seeking the assistance of other agents among the lottery distributors in distributing the resources in accordance with the priorities identified in Clauses 17 to 20. The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, asked me whether Big could ask other lottery distributors to hit certain targets within the framework of Clauses 17 to 20. The answer is yes; Big currently does that outside the scheme. Big does, from time to time, hit the objectives that it wants to achieve in partnership with other lottery distributors. The case that the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, mentioned is an illustration. The delivery of the Parks for People programme is run with the Heritage Lottery Fund. Big has got that experience and I cannot see anything that would inhibit Big from following that objective within the provisions of Clauses 17 to 20. However, I fear that what the amendment would&#151;and what in fact the noble Viscount intended it to do&#151;enable Big to operate outside the priorities in Clauses 17 to  20 and to follow other priorities that obtain in relation to lottery funds and spending. What, otherwise, would be the point of his reference to the pressures on other expenditures and schemes within the Lottery if they did not need supplementation from this fund? I cannot accept that. He will appreciate that we would expect Big to work separately; this account is separate. Big has got to be accountable for the separateness of that account&#151;all our processes of accountability require that. As to the use of agents for the distribution of the money for the purposes defined in the Clauses 17 to 20, we expect that to happen&#151;not to a huge extent but where it is felicitous for it to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="080129122000008">However, the amendment opens up the wider field; namely, that the dormant account proceeds might fill the gaps in funding denied to the lottery through other decisions. We cannot accept that because that would be putting this fund into the framework of lottery priorities. We have built into the Bill priorities for expenditure. If the amendment had referred to the use of agencies and involved felicitous interchange, I would have been able to give it the warmest of welcomes because it would have been consonant with present practice. Unfortunately, the noble Viscount indicated, as we had anticipated, that the amendment is a bit more strategic than that and we do not accept that strategic objective. I hope that he feels that he has pushed this as far as it can go and that he will withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80129-0010.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="080129122000018">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is similar to the one moved in Committee, and many of the arguments are similar.</p>

<a name="80129-0010.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="080129122000019">The Big Lottery Fund has lobbied for and&#151;because of its experience working with grant applications and its existing infrastructure throughout the United Kingdom&#151;been awarded the job of distributing dormant resources. Therefore, it is not inappropriate to expect the Big Lottery Fund to fulfil its promised economies of scale. This amendment stops the Big Lottery Fund spending more than 10 per cent of the funds it receives on administration. Your Lordships will no doubt remember that during the debate in Committee, many considered the original cost ceiling of 5 per cent to be unreasonably low, although I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Eccles for defending the original percentage as being perfectly feasible for a well run organisation to achieve.</p>

<a name="80129-0010.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="080129122000020">The Big Lottery Fund currently spends about  12 per cent of its money on distributing lottery funds. Given that it has an existing structure, distributing  the extra funds for well below the suggested limit of 10 per cent should be well within its capabilities. Indeed, a 10 per cent limit would give substantial headroom. The Minister also made it clear that he expects the Big Lottery to be able to reduce its administrative costs as it settles into its role; noble Lords may recall that he mentioned more than once bearing down on these overheads. This, and the Big Lottery Fund&#146;s commitment to delivering economies of scale, makes the 10 per cent target extremely realistic. I hope that the Government will be sympathetic to the amendment.</p>

<a name="80129-0010.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="080129122000021">In response to previous criticisms that limiting the Big Lottery Fund in this way would be unreasonable because it would impose a requirement that would never be imposed on a private organisation, I point out that private organisations are subject to the disciplines of the marketplace and are therefore compelled to keep administrative costs down if they wish to prosper and survive. The amendment would not impose an undue lack of flexibility on the Big Lottery Fund. On a conservative view, even if the reclaim fund retains up to half the money expected from dormant bank accounts for possible claims, the Big Lottery Fund must be expecting to receive something in the region of &#163;200 million. Surely the Big Lottery Fund can distribute this money effectively without spending more than &#163;20 million on extra administration. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment with the attention that it deserves. It would encourage efficiency and do much to reassure the public that these funds are being well managed. I beg to move.</p>

I have no idea whether 10 per cent is the right figure, although it sounds reasonable. However, I am a member of a charitable trust for which the figure would be higher. It depends how you describe the 10 per cent and what funds come within it. Monitoring grants&#151;seeing that things are going well and stopping problems&#151;is all part of the business of grant making. Some people

Timing may be also an issue if there were to be such monitoring, as the figure might be 9 per cent one year and 11 per cent another.

I am happy that he has produced an encore so that I can offer my applause again. In fact, I shall quote what the noble Lord said in Committee.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"><a name="080129122000050">&#147;If one spends 12 per cent in giving away 88 per cent well and doing a proper and thorough job of it, it is far better than giving away 100 per cent and being clueless about it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/1/08; col.

</ul>
<p><a name="080129122000045">That is graphically put; I could not express it as well myself, which is why I indulged in the quotation. I am grateful to the noble Lord for his contribution today, too.</p>

<a name="80129-0010.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="080129122000024">The necessity of bearing down on administrative costs is, of course, continually with us. We share that objective with the noble Lord, Lord Howard. Like the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, we do not think that Big&#146;s current spending is outrageously large, given that Big is involved in complex disbursements of money.</p>

<a name="80129-0010.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="080129122000025">That brings me to whether an annual cap would make any sense. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, has vast business experience, so I shall not venture down any road in trying to enlighten the House on areas that he knows inside out and far better than I do. However, for a body that operates, as Big does, a portfolio of operations over time&#151;commitments are for more than three years and payments are made over five years or more&#151;an annual cap would be the most extraordinary and arbitrary intrusion. I do not think that it would fit within the framework of any business that operated in quite the way that Big does. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="080129122000026">Let me take the most obvious example. When Big deals with issues in this account, such as providing support services for young people, we would expect it to consult not only those who can provide the services but young people themselves, so that young people are actively engaged in shaping the bids for community resources. That kind of activity can be prolonged; it is not the kind of thing on which one strikes a deal overnight with a handshake. One is not dealing with these groups on those terms, nor is one meeting needs expressed in those terms. We want to give Big the flexibility to meet its distinct and often difficult objectives, which it has experience of doing through the lottery. It currently operates with a degree of flexibility that the amendment would come close to destroying.</p>

<a name="80129-0010.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="080129122000027">I assure the House and the noble Lord that we are concerned about the accountability of the distribution costs of lottery funds. The Big Lottery Fund is legally required under the National Lottery Act to comply  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_609"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column 609</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with a statement of financial requirements issued by the Government, which makes clear the fund&#146;s responsibility to ensure that its finances are managed appropriately. We also have the accounting officers for the departments in which the fund is spending money. As far as this account is concerned, that would be the Department for Children, Schools and Families&#151;I know that that department has not found too much favour on the Benches opposite&#151;and the Secretary of State would sign off the accounts. Big&#146;s administrative costs will be subject to the accounting officers of the departments and of the devolved Administrations. There is a clear accountability framework. We have had considerable experience of this with the operation of the National Lottery. I hear the criticisms of Big&#146;s expenses, but the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, is right in principle. Big is involved in difficult community and local work and you cannot expect it to hit the same target levels as might occur with those much simpler operations&#151;even those involved with such resources&#151;with which it is sometimes compared.</p>

<a name="80129-0010.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="080129122000028">The amendment is also worried about the defrayment of the Government&#146;s expenses. Aren&#146;t we all? It is our job to make sure that Governments keep their own administrative costs down. I put this basic point to the House: for the administration of the distribution of lottery funds, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport charges the National Lottery Distribution Fund about &#163;250,000 a year, which is less than 0.02 per cent of what is raised for good causes each year. The Government estimate that the costs in relation to the reclaim fund will be less in cash terms, because it will be a smaller fund. I do not think that there is great cause for anxiety on that score with regard to government accounts and I hope that the noble Lord will feel satisfied enough to withdraw his amendment.</p>

It will not surprise him to hear that I do not agree with him. Given that the fund already has more than 1,000 employees and an existing structure, that it has pitched to get this, and that it has briefed us on how its existing administrative overhead can easily absorb this new money, I think that it has massive flexibility within a 10 per cent ceiling on its expenses. It should have some discipline over what it spends. I know that that is not customary, but then it would be nice to think that at least some government organisations cannot spend whatever they feel like spending. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Noble Lords will recall that the issue of the free mailshot was a topic of some controversy in the run-up to the first GLA elections in May 2000.

The Greater London Authority Elections (Election Addresses) Order 2003 was enacted in exercise of that power. The 2003 order made provision for the free delivery to electors of an election booklet containing election addresses of candidates at ordinary elections for the Mayor of London. The order also made miscellaneous provisions concerning the addresses and the election booklet, including provisions for deciding the order of the election addresses in the booklet and the candidates&#146; contribution towards the cost of printing and free delivery, using a universal service provider.

The draft order will come into force the day after it is made, and when it comes into force it will give all interested parties including political parties, candidates, election agents and electorate administrators certainty about the arrangements that will apply for contents and distribution of election booklets in 2008.</p>

The 2006 Act also made amendments to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 which enabled two or more parties to register joint descriptions for use by candidates of those parties.

<p><a name="080129113000010">I am advised that I have to declare that I no longer have any personal, financial, residual or other interest in the proceedings of the Bill. Those colleagues who were present at Second Reading know that I made an application to seek to join the board of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission. The bad news is that the application was rejected; the good news is that was done very quickly. The application was treated well within the 12-week response time for applications to the Child Support Agency; indeed, I think that it was done in about 12 minutes, rather than 12 weeks. I therefore look forward to the publication of the quarterly statistics tomorrow, and hope that all applications to the Child Support Agency in future are dealt with with such dispatch. For the avoidance of doubt, I say that I have no other pecuniary interest in the proceedings of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="080129113000011">Being a little obsessive about this subject, I may stray into making long contributions that try your Lordships&#146; patience, but I shall try not to do. I am pleased that we have been allowed to give slightly wider consideration than Second Reading allows not of what the commission is set up to achieve, because that is what Clauses 1 and 2 are about, but, having regard to the background of this troubled public policy area during 17 years&#151;I have been involved in most of it&#151;of where we have been, how we got here and what Parliament is trying to do. The Bill is clear: it is using as a template the Child Support Act 1991, which was configured for an entirely different time. As parliamentarians, we should at the outset make the important point to the department that this is a pretty rotten way to generate legislation. Pouring 38 clauses back into an Act that was in gestation in the department in the mid- or late-1980s to deal with entirely different circumstances and trying to back-amend it and ignore the 1995 and 2000 legislation do not add up to transparency in the legislation-making process and make it harder for people, unless they are specialist lawyers, to follow exactly what is going on in this important area of public policy.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para5">
<p><a name="080129113000012">We are left with that as a device. It is a shame, because we have had plenty of time to anticipate this legislation. I would have much preferred, as I think would all of us as parliamentarians, a free-standing Act which made sense in its own right. However, this is what we have; we have to make sense of the shape of the legislation that faces us in this Committee; and we will try our best.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="080129113000013">The past 17 years have been a demonstration of policy failure. It is irrelevant whose fault that is, but I have not recently come across anyone interested in this area who thinks it has been anything other than a pretty abject failure. This is the third time of asking; we are trying to do the same thing in 2008 that we did unsuccessfully in 2000. We are focusing almost exclusively on the operational side of what is being done and the services that are available to parents with care and non-resident parents. I ask myself&#151;as should the Committee, before it goes any further&#151;whether that is sensible.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="080129113000014">The Bill is about maintenance and enforcement and it sets up a commission, but is it about children? There are some amendments from colleagues in other  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC277"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column GC277</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>parts of the Committee, and there is a sense that we should be thinking more about children and less about operational efficiency&#151;not that operational efficiency is not the key to getting some of this policy right. We do not think enough about children. The new clause seeks to redress that by saying what Parliament wants. Clauses 1 and 2 state clearly the objectives of the commission we are creating, but there is a step before that, which is about what public policy should be and what we as parliamentarians want the commission to do as a policy objective, not just as operational requirements.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="080129113000015">I have had this argument with Ministers before, and they always say, &#147;We don&#146;t do policy in statutes in our system&#148;. I do not think that is true. There is evidence in the child support legislation that there are circumstances where policies are set out, and discretion and administrative decisions are made on that basis. It is necessary to have a policy statement at the beginning of the Bill to make it more effective in the future. The department may say that it is too late to change now, but that is not the Committee&#146;s fault; the Bill has been knocking around the department for two or three years in one form or another. It is a carryover Bill and has had twice the amount of time that is normally allocated to Bills in the parliamentary process, so there is no excuse&#151;there has been time to look at other ways of doing this. The department will say that it is about securing operational efficiency and I agree, but it should not be about efficiency to the exclusion of the policy and everything else.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para9">
<p><a name="080129113000016">I shall start by quoting an important article by Professor Nick Wikeley entitled <I>Child support reform&#151;</I><I>throwing the baby out with the bathwater?</I>. He came to this conclusion about the failure of the policy to date and the potential failure that may be in the Bill we are considering:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080129113000080">&#147;The failure of the Bill to engage with the real task of hammering out &#145;basic principles&#146; disguises a reluctance on the part of politicians and policy makers to grapple with the underlying purpose of child maintenance&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080129113000065">That is my case in this amendment, and it needs to be addressed. There is a real risk that the statistics, the bureaucratic objectives and the Secretary of State&#146;s tasks and targets will dictate the policy in the Bill, particularly with regard to the abolition of Section 6. </p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para10">
<p><a name="080129113000017">Colleagues who have studied the Bill will know that we are going to take the policy forward by encouraging people to make their own decision about whether they stay in the system and use the services of the new commission. The sum and substance of the weight of the backlog will almost certainly lead the commissioner designate and his new board to think very carefully about how many people they want to admit to the new system because they are struggling to deal with the numbers already in it.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para11">
<p><a name="080129113000018">There are lots of statistics around and I could go on at length, but when I was reading up on all this over Christmas, one or two figures struck me as ones that we should bear in mind all through our proceedings in Committee. A Commons Answer given on 1 October 2007 obviously took its figures from the quarterly statistics issued last September. They show that currently some 881,300 non-resident  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC278"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column GC278</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>parents are in arrears. Of those, 91,470 owe more than &#163;10,000, while 5,440 owe &#163;50,000 or more. We have more than 800,000 non-resident parents in arrears. If we look at that number the other way around, it means that an awful lot of parents with care are suffering from non-payment. That is the backlog which the new commission is being invited to take on in addition to a new system of assessment and calculation. It will be a good trick if the commission can manage it and I wish the staff well in their work. But if the Committee does not understand, in the course of our proceedings, that the risk of a third public policy failure is high, we are being less than honest about the reality of the situation.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para12">
<p><a name="080129113000019">The 1991 Act is not an appropriate platform and the suggestion set out in Amendment No. 1 would help in a number of ways. In plain English, it imports a clear instruction to the commission, seeks to demonstrate what Parliament thinks should happen and sets out both the primary and subsidiary objectives behind it. It is not original as it comes from the New Zealand template; I have amended it as best I can in my amateurish way to try to fit this legislation. I do not argue for a moment that it is technically competent as it stands, but the inference and clear purpose are there for all to see. I think it would help to implement this policy in a better way in the future.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="080129113000020">I have come to the conclusion that the new clause points in the direction of a different way of administering the commission; I do not think that the Department for Work and Pensions is the right one any more. I hope that the new clause leads to serious consideration being given to the Ministry of Justice, where a lot of important mediation work is going on, some of which is working and some not. Mediation is an important part of this policy area. However, since we now have a Department for Children, Schools and Families, there is an unanswerable case that child maintenance should be delivered via that route in the future. I certainly do not think that the Department for Work and Pensions has dealt with this area particularly well. I exonerate the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, from that charge; I am not just being nice to her because she is sitting across from me. If I provoke her, she will attack me, and I would be unlikely to survive. But leadership in that department has been virtually incoherent for the simple reason that since 1997, we have had eight or nine Secretaries of State&#151;a new head of department roughly every 15 months. Each one has had to deal with a big department in which child maintenance represents the outer extreme. That is not the fault of the professionals or the agency, but it is a matter of fact. In my political opinion, that that has not had the attention it deserves. There is a worry, too, reflected in my new clause, that this will be even more arm&#146;s length than being at the back end of a big department that changes its leadership every 15 months.</p>

<p><a name="080129113000021">There is a strong case for taking a new look and for Parliament to say that there are other ways of doing this and of brigading the policy-makers and the commission. If anyone ever had any doubt about that,  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC279"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column GC279</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they should read the National Audit Office report in 2006 (House of Commons Paper 1174), <I>Child Support Agency&#151;Implementation of the Child Support Reforms</I>&#151;which was Christmas reading for me. It is a terrible document. I do not know what it looked like before the department agreed it with the National Audit Office, but it is an indictment of the CS2 reforms. One may say that this is looking backwards, but I have an American friend who often uses the phrase &#147;it&#146;s d&#233;j  vu all over again&#148;&#151;that&#146;s the Americans for you. What will send me to my grave a very unhappy person would be ignoring what is in this report and doing the same all over again. We will get another NAO report after the operational improvement programme is finished in 2009 and there will be a Public Accounts Committee report in 2010. The objective of all this, I hope we are all agreed, is to try to get out of the place we are in and where we have been and try to make the situation better.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para15">
<p><a name="080129113000022">The Child Support Agency annual report, which was six months late because of technical difficulties with its client fund account&#151;again for the 14th or 15th year&#151;makes sobering reading regarding the extent of the problems. We should think again carefully about the policy and look at how in a modern sense children&#146;s rights are much more to the fore. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child has come on stream since 1991 when we first started to think about this. We are not doing the job properly in responding to these circumstances.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para16">
<p><a name="080129113000023">I do not want to tax the Committee but I feel strongly about this. We in the Committee would not be doing our job properly if we did not look at what is going on around us in relation to the principles in my new clause. A report was published in the <I>Guardian</I> on 23 January on the British Social Attitudes Survey. I commend it to colleagues. There is nothing new in it, but it is a sobering reassessment of just how volatile and chaotic&#151;in the non-pejorative sense&#151;family life is these days. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, who made a powerful Second Reading speech, made a feature of this and made me think about it. Everything she said is reflected in the survey, which takes an annual sample of 3,000 interviews conducted at length across the country by respected researchers. The report states that the survey,</p>
<ul><a name="080129113000086">&#147;offers a picture of a fast-changing landscape of relationships and living arrangements, including partners who do not live together, unmarried, long-term cohabitees, &#147;reconstituted families&#148; made up of previously divorced parents and their stepchildren, and a rise in solo living&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080129113000066">That is the kind of thing talked about at length. The social trends are against us. It will be harder to keep up with this churn. The hamster wheel will run faster. </p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para17">
<p><a name="080129113000024">The original architects of the 1991 legislation&#151;it is easy to say this with hindsight and I was there, so I am as much to blame as anyone else&#151;misunderstood the difficulty not just of doing the calculation but of maintaining the calculation. Coming from a benefit background, as the legislation does&#151;wrongly, I now think&#151;we are trying to keep that up week by week as families change week by week, so we never catch up. The 881,300 non-resident parents who are in arrears will take 16 years, according to my pocket calculator, to be reduced to zero.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC280"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column GC280</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para18">
<p><a name="080129113000025">That is where Amendment No. 3 comes in. It is a pretty amateur effort; it was meant to provide a sunset clause; it is not, but it will be by the next stage. The Minister helpfully sent us a letter about the amount that it was costing to raise &#163;1 of income maintenance and projected that to 2016. It will take until then, if nothing else happens, if the new rules come in and if the operational improvement plan works&#151;a very important qualification&#151;to clear the backlog. We are ignoring David Henshaw&#146;s sensible advice to draw a line and get a residual body to bear down on the debt as a separate and freestanding enterprise. That completely destroys the realistic chance of the new body ever getting off the bit.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para19">
<p><a name="080129113000026">I have two other references to recent newspaper reports. One was in the <I>Guardian</I> on Friday 7 December about a report done by the Liverpool Victoria&#151;I may have referred to it at Second Reading&#151;about the cost of bringing up children. The cooker pressure is increasing intensely in the cost of raising families. The researchers were quite taken aback by the extent to which an average family had to pay more: they reckoned, at today's prices, it cost &#163;24.30 a day to look after a modern child accurately and well. They forecast that costs could rise by 42 per cent between now and 2012 to an average of &#163;12,500 per year for each child. So the financial pressures under which the clients whom the Bill seeks to serve are increasing.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para20">
<p><a name="080129113000027">The third press report to which I refer is a report in the <I>Guardian</I> on 10 December which talked about some important work commissioned by the Ministry of Justice. The University of East Anglia researched conciliation in the courtroom. It found that it helped quite a lot with getting fathers to stay in touch with their children, but it did nothing to reconcile the parents. The researchers suggest that even more cases would have gone back to court, but for the fact that many parents were,</p>
<ul><a name="080129113000087">&#147;too battle-weary to face the emotional and financial costs of further proceedings&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080129113000067">There is a lot of work being done in the Ministry of Justice, and I wonder whether we are taking proper advantage of it.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para21">
<p><a name="080129113000028">This is a very important part of our proceedings. I want to make a case, as Amendment No. 1 does, for looking at a much wider objective. I want to enshrine a right that goes beyond what we are asking the commission to do, which merely continues the rights to maintenance. I want to put rights and entitlements in the hands of children and parents in the way set out in the new clause. If we do, that will give the new commission, which will be an arm's length administrator and much less amenable to future parliamentary scrutiny, a clear idea. If the Bill is to be successful, it needs to be much more focused on the interests, rights and entitlements of children. I beg to move.</p>

He is not the first and he will not be the last. I hesitate to say that because I know that he does not like his job to be referred to as temporary. In his closing remarks, the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, did not

Of course, he will not be responsible for day-to-day operations but then he never has been. However, he will be responsible for direction and guidance and for seeing that things go as the policy directs.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0001.htm_para22">
<p><a name="080129113000030">The other reason why the House is in for a treat is that over the past few years the Minister has shown himself in my presence to be very careful to listen and, once he has made up his mind that the arguments are correct, to act upon them. Until now, he has had to go through two other Ministers: the Secretary of State of the time and the Minister responsible for the Bill, who, in the two cases that I am thinking of, as he will remember, were Members of another place. Here, we have direct access and I look forward to it. The Minister says from a sitting position that he is not sure that he is, but I do not know why not. He is, for once, in a position of great power and I am all for it.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="080129113000068">The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, almost started like that because in his opening paragraphs he referred to what we are all talking about&#151;that is, children. I shall come to the fact that children and their maintenance in the widest terms already exist in the legislation. However, it seems that the noble Lord has sought to go one better and put down a shopping list not only of what subjects are in the Bill but of what he would like to see in it. He described this as a &#147;policy framework&#148;, if I may use shorthand&#151;I see him nodding. Not being very familiar with my thought processes, the noble Lord probably does not know that I am on record more than once as saying that I do not believe in shopping lists, nor purpose or objective clauses, even if they are basically correct. That may or may not be because many years ago I was, with different responsibilities, in the Minister&#146;s position. I am sure that this first debate will help our discussion on the Bill, not least because it behoves us to remember some basic facts on child maintenance that get totally forgotten, or at least ignored,.</p>

<p><a name="080129113000032">We are not really starting from here. However, we are, as they say, where we are. The Bill is legislation by reference, and I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, that it would be helpful to our debates to remember that this is an amending Bill. It amends the Child Support Act 1991 and, in part, the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000.</p>

<p><a name="080129113000037">Going on with my guiding philosophy of an amending Bill, I fail to see the need for subsection (1)(c) in the amendment, which is a repetition of Section 1(3) of the 1991 Act. I do not understand what the noble Lord is getting at with subsection (1)(d). Even after listening to him quite carefully, I still do not understand. For example, what position would he like to see in regard to adopted children or children in care? It seems that neither group is to be covered by CMEC, although the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.</p>

The obligations to birth children may not be extinguished but, under Schedule 4, they can be reduced quite substantially, as we will be discussing later. Paragraph (d) fails to take into account divorce proceedings. I do not know what proportion of children qualify as a result of divorce because, as I understand it, the CSA does not collect such figures&#151;again, if I am wrong, I am sure the Minister will correct me&#151;but it must be a fair number. In any event, the Bill currently anticipates that child maintenance as a result of a divorce settlement will be binding for at least one year. As later amendments

<p><a name="080129113000039">With this amendment is grouped Amendment No. 3, which, as the noble Lord said, is an attempt at a sunset clause. It is not yet right but he assures us that, come the next stage of the Bill, he will put it right and be very firm on the subject. Sunset clauses are all very well if used judiciously. If, however, one is setting up a new organisation, as we are here, I do not believe that giving it only four or five years of life is the least bit sensible. Even with the transfer of staff, which we shall discuss in a moment, it will take a couple of years to bed down. That is inevitable with a new organisation, but it will give very little time before new legislation is required under this amendment.</p>

A slot in the programme has to be fought for against competition from all other departments of state, and there is no guarantee of getting one in any particular year. What, then, is the noble Lord&#146;s solution to continuing child maintenance after 2015 if the Government of the day cannot find time for replacement legislation? I do not want to be unduly alarmist but all sorts of things might need to be enacted in 2014. Then, come the following 1 January, there will be no modern system of child maintenance by absent parents and, presumably, as the CSA is killed off by this Bill, we will not even be able to go back to the old system under the CSA.</p>

We have normally failed to get them into a Bill but, where they have been put in, such as in the Education Act, they are enormously useful. I am not sure that the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, has this one entirely right, and I do not suggest that it is, but he asked why the previous two Child Support Acts have failed and why this one is going to fail, as I suspect it will. Perhaps we are not looking in the right place. The commission or its predecessors are effectively debt collectors. We all hate debts but we hate them much more if we think that they are unjust&#151;that is, if we do not believe that they are based on a reasonable obligation. I suggest that the Government have to go right back to the beginning and make up their mind about what they, and the nation, believe to be the duties of parenthood and then start to educate people so that they understand that, if they have a child, whether carelessly or otherwise, they have certain relatively clearly defined responsibilities.</p>

In focusing only on the mechanisms of child maintenance, surely it deals with only one part of the package which is needed to help parents to work together to help children to flourish. I would support a move to put the needs of the child right at the start of the Bill to remind parents and agencies what this is trying to achieve.

<p><a name="080129113000047">Let me try to deal with why we have structured the Bill as we have. As the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, will be aware, the amendments are unlikely to have a significant practical effect.

Of course it is about children; it is all about children; it is all about making sure that we have more effective maintenance arrangements in place so that more money can be garnered for more children. That is exactly what the Bill is about. That is very clear from the objectives of the commission set down in Clause 2(1):</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080129113000085">&#147;The Commission's main objective is to maximise the number of those children who live apart from one or both of their parents for whom effective maintenance arrangements are in place&#148;.</p>

In a sense, the Bill is only one part of the package, but we will debate later how those wider issues are being picked up and addressed.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0002.htm_para11">
<p><a name="080129113000051">Our primary focus, building on experience from the past under different Administrations, has been to find practical solutions to getting maintenance flowing. Whatever the Bill&#146;s philosophical wraparound, if it does not work in practice, it will not deliver for children. That is what we are about. We are, for example, establishing a new body to administer the child maintenance system and building a new information and support service. I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, that the fact that it will be a Crown NDPB does not fundamentally change the distance of the arm&#146;s-length arrangement with government, but I know that we will debate that under later amendments. We are about delivering a simplified assessment process and strengthening our enforcement powers.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0002.htm_para12">
<p><a name="080129113000052">That approach is in line with the comprehensive review of the child maintenance system by Sir David Henshaw. He did not consider the structure of the legislation a problem and made no recommendations about the rights of children. The two key policy issues that he identified were the difficulties created by compulsion&#151;that is, the link with benefit to which the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, referred&#151;and the lack of an incentive to comply. We are dealing directly with both of those by removing the compulsory link with the benefits system and dramatically increasing the level of the maintenance disregard.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0002.htm_para13">
<p><a name="080129113000053">However, I can assure the noble Lord that we are working with colleagues across government on joining up both policy and delivery. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, was interested in that point and I will say a little more about it later. One option that we can consider is the consolidation of child maintenance legislation, and with that a fresh look at the interventions with other provisions, such as the Children&#146;s Act. Of course we will need to be an integrated part of the crucial work of the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0002.htm_para14">
<p><a name="080129113000054">Let me deal specifically with the challenge that we were wrong to start by amending the 1991 Act. Again, that was a practical decision. Two schemes are embodied in that Act, the current scheme and the old scheme. Most of the new measures in the Bill will apply to both schemes and will come into force in stages, so they will continue to run for a period. This makes it technically very difficult to introduce a new Act. Indeed, we have learnt the lessons of the past about big bang reform. However, we are planning to consolidate legislation for transparency once a single scheme is in force, and I believe that that is the right approach.</p>

<p><a name="080129113000055">Returning to the Bill, I hope that the noble Lord recognises that now is not the right time to attempt a more radical redrafting of the legislation. His Amendment No. 3 proposes terminating the existing arrangements, specifically the existence of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, in 2015. The noble

This would leave the child maintenance system with no delivery organisation. Given that we have yet to see the reforms outlined in this Bill implemented and that the Government have no proposals for a successor body, I do not believe it would be right to include such a provision in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0002.htm_para16">
<p><a name="080129113000056">I want to say a few words about the rights of children. Making legislation which is expressed in terms of children having a right to maintenance would not make the law clearer or more effective. Certainty, I suggest, comes from the law creating a statutory scheme that sets out how the duty of ensuring that non-resident parents pay maintenance is calculated and enforced, and from the creation of a new body with clear objectives and duties. Since 2002, the Government have put in place a substantial body of legislation that serves to promote the well-being of children. This reflects the principles of the UNCRC and creates an effective national framework to support positive outcomes, the Children Act 2004 being the most important of these. Further, the Children&#146;s Plan, published in December last year, builds on those reforms and sets out the Government&#146;s ambition for improving the lives of children and young people over the next decade. But this Bill is about effective maintenance arrangements, making sure that the cash flows to children.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0002.htm_para17">
<p><a name="080129113000057">The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, ranged over a number of issues around arrears, residuary bodies and so forth. We shall pick each of those up in the course of our deliberations so I will not deal with them more specifically now. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, asked why the previous schemes have failed and was a little pessimistic about the prospects for this one. I disagree with him on the latter point. There are a number of reasons which we could debate at length, such as the complexity of the IT systems, which were not up to scratch, and the effectiveness or otherwise of the enforcement powers, but in essence the agency was originally set up to draw back benefits for the Government. The lack of justice in that was perceived and people did not want to comply. This is different because it focuses on getting more children out of poverty, which I think will make a real difference.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0002.htm_para18">
<p><a name="080129113000058">I have spoken for long enough on this amendment, and I ask the noble Lord to withdraw it.</p>

But as I said earlier, we are where we are. The noble Lord gave that as the reason why absent parents in particular have taken against the CSA and the formulas it operates. But he has also said that this scheme is new and different. How is he going to persuade those recalcitrant absent parents that that is indeed the case?</p>

That will be a significant incentive for parents to comply and engage with the process. However, there are other reasons as well. There is an obligation in the Bill for the commission actively to promote the taking up of financial responsibilities to children. That is part of the process, as is making sure that people who are still not prepared to comply pay&#151;there are assessment issues about getting data directly from HMRC rather than having to rely on the non-resident parent, which has in the past made it very difficult for the system to work. At the end of the day, we must make it very clear that if people will not comply there will be robust enforcement powers. Effective systems in place will make the situation better and we will be more able to ensure that the enforcement powers are used to the full. That was a collection of reasons, many of which we will deliberate on further.</p>

As we all know this is a scandal&#151;an absolute disgrace and a complete failure of all of us.</p>

<p><a name="080129113000062">Are the Government and my noble friend right&#151;after all he was in government and sees the problems as the Minister sees them&#151;to turn down the idea of a more detailed declaratory clause at the beginning of the Bill? It would make the point that the Bill is about children and their welfare, not just about money getting to children, and the fact that they must share in the standard of living of both parents, whether they are present or not. Is that not a good idea? We should not close our minds to that. I have always had a great respect for the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood&#151;he was an MP in the Borders of Scotland. He knows a lot about this subject in detail. A bit of imagination in the Bill would remind us that it is about children as a whole, not just about money flowing to them.

I am not confident that the flow and quality of the management information available to the commission will enable Parliament, looking just at quarterly statistics, to be sure that the consideration of children as a priority of the commission will be able to be monitored effectively or guaranteed. The amendment, inadequately drafted as it may be, seeks merely to give weight to the objectives and the importance attached to the people who run the commission, who will be under enormous operational pressure to reduce the case load at every conceivable turn, which is not the object of the exercise.

An information and support service, which does not exist at the moment, will be built. There will be a framework agreement which the DWP as the sponsoring department will impose on the commission. It will contain targets with which the commission will have to comply.

I am grateful for the response; I will look carefully at what the Minister has said and think more on it. We have had a good debate; I am grateful for colleagues&#146; contributions. I will go away to reflect on that and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Some of the other amendments, which I shall touch on briefly, deal with the operational improvement plan, the residuary body idea, staffing levels in the commission in future and professional staff rights to transfer.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0002.htm_para25">
<p><a name="080129134000011">I will try to make this as expeditious as I can. The first question that needs to be asked is: are we are treating a clean break? If he said anything, David Henshaw argued a compelling case that child support should be delivered by a very different business. He also considered that, given the existing agency&#146;s operating model and organisational culture, which we have seen since it was set up, it would be impossible for it to,</p>
<ul><a name="080129134000046">&#147;morph successfully into that new way of working&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080129134000044">I was attracted by that and interested in his view.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para0">
<p><a name="080129134000012">He advocated a clean-break approach. We talked under the previous amendment about the importance of the drag factor and legacy issues. He considered that there were two areas of activity. One was engaged in making a rebranded new organisation efficient and fit for purpose, dealing with customers who could be dealt with where cases could be kept up to date in real time from day one. That was a very different operation and organisation; it required different skills, organisational cultures and performance management from a residuary body that did nothing but chase down debts with the resolve, rigour and professionalism necessary to deal with the big backlogs.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para1">
<p><a name="080129134000013">The Government quietly dropped Sir David's plans for two separate good-book, bad-book organisations. Instead, as I understand it, CMEC will have responsibility for legacy issues as well as new arrangements. Some questions arise about that. What is the Minister's answer to the charge that this is not a fresh start but a makeover? It will be impossible to argue anything else. The computers are the same; the contracts are the same; the chief executive is the same; the locations of business will be the same. Where is that fresh start, if that is what the Government claim it is?</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para2">
<p><a name="080129134000014">What considerations will the new commission inherit in terms of the agency's debt book? We know that &#163;1.5 billion is regarded as collectable to date. That is a lot of money and could make a lot of difference to a lot of families. What is the commission&#146;s priority in terms of its objectives on chasing that debt? What is the new operating model? There is some concern that a lot of decisions seem to be being made before the board has even been put together. I noticed last week that Mr Plaskitt has ordered a new computer system for resource management at a cost of &#163;1 million. The new board and commission will not have looked at any of that, so my fear is that when the new board meets for the first time, there will be nothing much left for it to decide in terms of the shape and scope of the business&#146;s operating model.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para3">
<p><a name="080129134000015">Another point raised by Henshaw in connection with the new operating model concerns contracting out. Although I am not advocating this, Henshaw was very clear that the new commission would head towards what is essentially a commissioning body. We understand that the commission will make up its own  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC291"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column GC291</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mind on how to proceed once it is in place but we know that the current agency has been trialling the use of private debt collectors. I think that a target under the operational improvement plan was to collect &#163;100 million of debt over three years. I have looked at the statistics but may not have understood them properly. However, looking at page 12 of the Child Support Agency report, I see that to date the debt collected via private collection vehicles has amounted to only &#163;1.6 million, which is a long way short of &#163;100 million. I also have some concerns about Vertex and how it is managing to deal with the clerical cases at CSA Bolton. Again, the Henshaw report had something to say about that, but I wonder how the new commission will deal with them.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para4">
<p><a name="080129134000016">Other questions also arise in relation to cost. I believe that the government amendments in this group will be moved by the Minister, but the only thing that I have seen is the Second Reading speech. If I understand it correctly, the idea is now to move back to a Crown non-departmental public body. Is that just because we forgot about the VAT? I understand that a Crown NDPB does not pay VAT but, left to its own devices, an NDPB would. There was no provision for the &#163;140 million of VAT, so the Government had to change their plans at the last minute and turn it into a Crown organisation. However, that is only a rumour and I have nothing more than that to go on. I shall be very pleased to be corrected but, if that was even a factor in making a change at the last minute, it shows a worrying level of incompetence. It would be very good to have that rumour squashed, and I expect the Minister will do so.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para5">
<p><a name="080129134000017">There are other questions of cost relating to NDPBs and so on. I know that the commission will have to work within its budget but it is very difficult to work out exactly how much more expensive a commission of this kind will be. Because it is at arm&#146;s length, there will obviously be location costs and new contract costs. We tried to work out the differences between a variety of models and the Government eventually decided to go for a Crown NDPB. I think that the Committee is entitled to be given some idea, plus or minus &#163;50 million, of what its effect will be in the long run on the Budget and the public purse.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para6">
<p><a name="080129134000018">Finally, in relation to Amendment No. 2, I have a whole list of concerns about the commission operating at arm&#146;s length from the Government. We will come to this later in Clause 10 but I am particularly interested in how the Government will use the directions and guidance powers to keep the commission in line. I do not know whether there have been any discussions about how the powers will be used but they certainly mean that ministerial control over how the commission decides to fulfil its main objectives will be lessened in the future.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para7">
<p><a name="080129134000019">I also have concerns about child poverty&#151;a matter that we will come to later. It has to be acknowledged that the Government have done an enormous amount of work in that respect. Child poverty is to be a number one priority in things such as the public service agreements that have just been published in the Pre-Budget Statement. If the body is to operate at arm&#146;s length, I would like an assurance that child

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para8">
<p><a name="080129134000020">As to the operational improvement plan, it is a pity that we are not having this debate on Thursday. We will receive the quarterly statistics tomorrow and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and I will fall on them with great relish over breakfast and look at some of the targets. The operational improvement plan is flat. There have been some successes, which you would expect with &#163;120 million being spent on developing the policy. It will come to an end in 2009 and I am worried that it will fail or be only partially successful. This relates to Amendment No. 4.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para9">
<p><a name="080129134000021">I give credit to the Ministers. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, was a key player in this and she was right to make the decision in 2000-01 not to take CSCS cases on to CS2 because the system would not have coped with it. There is an analogy here in taking a  new system into operation without the operational improvement plan being completed over its programme timeline, but it had achieved the ambitious targets set out for it in the original document. I do not believe it will be complete by March 2009, although I think we will make progress. I hope we do.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para10">
<p><a name="080129134000022">There may be a case for delaying the implementation of the commission until the operational improvement plan has delivered every last one of its objectives. Apart from anything else, that will deal with some of the legacy issues and give the new organisation a fighting chance of survival once it starts up. However, the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and I will use our ingenuity to make sure that the quarterly statistics are made available to the Committee, in whatever guise, within the rules of order in future amendments.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para11">
<p><a name="080129134000023">The residuary body was a Henshaw idea and, from the way he argued for it, it certainly has some merit. I do not understand why one minute he was deep in the department getting advice from people who know what they are doing and being left to make a clear report on a residuary body, and then, a few short months later, the department turns its face against any such thing. It puzzles me why there should be such a change in such a short space of time.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para12">
<p><a name="080129134000024">Amendments Nos. 14 and 70 concern staffing levels. The professional staff within the agency do a first-class job. They have been messed around a great deal&#151;the uncertainty has not helped them&#151;and they will welcome the move to a Crown NDPB. But if the move is only to get the VAT fixed in the first three years and we then go back to being a non-Crown NDPB, they will be less enamoured with that. I beg to move.</p>

As I made clear at Second Reading, it is the Government&#146;s intention that the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission be given Crown status. This group of amendments will give effect to this. The staff of the Child Support Agency are essential to the success of our reforms and are supportive of the changes we are introducing. However, it has become increasingly clear that they have deep-seated concerns about the loss of their Civil Service status. Under the current draft of the Bill this would be lost as, on transfer to the new commission, they would become public servants.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para13">
<p><a name="080129134000030">As I made clear at Second Reading, we want the agency&#146;s staff to look forward to, not to worry about, the launch of the commission. As a result, we have decided to make a relatively simple change and turn CMEC into a Crown NDPB, ensuring that staff will continue to be civil servants. There are also some accounting and financial advantages to that move. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about VAT. It is certainly true that a Crown NDPB has the prospect of VAT recoveries, which an executive NDPB would not. For government, it is a net nil, if one looks at it in aggregate.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para14">
<p><a name="080129134000031">I make it clear that this is not a substantive change to the governance arrangements for the commission. The new organisation remains a non-departmental public body led by an independent board and operating at arm&#146;s length from Ministers. The new status is provided for by the amendment to paragraph 22 of Schedule 1. The amendment stipulates that the functions of the commission are to be carried out on behalf of the Crown. It is similar to legislation for other Crown bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para15">
<p><a name="080129134000032">A number of other amendments are consequential to this change. For example, as staff will remain civil servants and their employer remains the Crown, there is no need to apply the TUPE regulations to protect terms and conditions and continuity of employment. As a result, we no longer need Clause 13 and propose its removal, which matches the proposal from the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and the noble Baroness, Lady Verma. Instead, we have brought forward a minor amendment to Clause 14, which will enable any employment rights and liabilities that need to transfer to the commission as the body with day-to-day responsibility for the staff to do so under a transfer scheme.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para16">
<p><a name="080129134000033">Amendment 70, also to Clause 13 and tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Kirkwood and Lord Addington, would ensure that professional staff in

As the commission&#146;s staff will now be civil servants, I hope that noble Lords will agree that the amendment is unnecessary: staff will continue to have the same rights as now.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para17">
<p><a name="080129134000034">I return to the government amendments. We have also made a number of consequential changes to Schedule 1, which are needed to recognise that staff of the commission will now be civil servants and that there is a role for the Minister responsible for the Civil Service in approving future terms and conditions. We have also removed the paragraph that provides staff with exemption from liability. As is standard practice in Crown bodies, including the CSA, staff will be indemnified by the Crown.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para18">
<p><a name="080129134000035">It is possible that, after a period of time, the advantages of Crown status will begin to recede. Given this, we intend to review the status of the commission after three years. Government amendments contain a new clause that would make it a legislative requirement. If such a review concludes that Crown status is no longer necessary, the clause provides an order-making power to make this change, including any necessary consequential amendments. We also make the relevant consequential amendments to Clause 52, making it clear that this will be subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para19">
<p><a name="080129134000036">I urge noble Lords to accept the amendments that would introduce Crown status and those that are consequential. I was about to turn to the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, but I think that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, may want to speak before I respond to them.</p>

<p><a name="080129134000038">The Minister has just explained a large group of amendments which I find extremely difficult to disentangle and debate. The noble Lord gives the impression&#151;I hope it is no more and that this is not fact&#151;that Her Majesty&#146;s Government have a time agenda and have attempted to speed up the Committee stage of this Bill. As the debate on the last amendment showed, this Committee will not allow scrutiny to be sacrificed in the apparent hurry to get this Bill passed and on to the statute book. With such a large grouping, I can only hypothesise that these amendments have been scrambled together so that we may talk about the structure and composition of the commission.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para21">
<p><a name="080129134000039">Many of the amendments could almost be described as drafting amendments, although clearly they have the effect he has set out, which is that the staff of the commission will remain civil servants for the foreseeable future. One rather wonders why the noble Lord has taken a power in the Bill to get away with that and take the staff outside the Civil Service, which he has just said that he has done.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0003.htm_para22">
<p><a name="080129134000040">On whether Clause 13 should stand part of the Bill, I was rather nonplussed to discover that I had been pre-empted by the Minister, who got his name in

But I am well aware that that is the form in this House, so I do not complain particularly about it; I just comment. I originally proposed that Clause 13 should no longer stand part of the Bill because I wanted the noble Lord to respond to my concern that if the Bill makes provision for CSA employees to be transferred lock, stock and barrel, how will CMEC have a hope of being different from the CSA? The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, would probably agree with me on that point. Surely the same employees will inevitably bring with them the baggage of their former employment roles and duties, and thus the new CMEC, no matter what its new structure and intentions, will&#151;to use the word of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood&#151;morph back into that which came before it, and that which this Bill is expressly attempting to replace.</p>

<p><a name="080129134000041">On Amendment No. 2, not only will CMEC have the staff, it will have the same computer system and the same CEO as the CSA. In private discussion over the past three weeks or so the Minister has assured me that the computer system is now up and running to a standard that he and I would expect. It would be extremely helpful if he could now confirm that publicly.</p>

From what I have been reading as background to the Bill, Stephen Geraghty believes that is unlikely to happen, as he told the Select Committee of another place recently. Is it right that a body with net operating costs of more than &#163;500 million in public money, dealing with around 2 million customers in a very sensitive area of policy, currently handling more than &#163;6 billion in annual receipts and likely to be engaged in robust enforcement action, should have considerable autonomy from Ministers in its operating practice and policy? I heard the Minister, in response to one of the questions I put under the previous amendment, saying that in effect there was no difference between a non-departmental public agency and the procedure originally proposed in the Bill.

It will be under the commission banner&#151;obviously there are branding issues around that&#151;and will take forward both the current issues and the development of the new system.</p>

<p><a name="080129135000010">The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, produced a couple of amendments that I have great difficulty with. Amendment No. 4 appears to mean that the Bill cannot be commenced until the operational improvement plan for the CSA has been completed, or, as the amendment says, &#147;achieved&#148;. When I first saw it I thought it was a probing amendment to ascertain

We know already that the staff are due to be transferred from the CSA to CMEC, but I cannot at this moment see that the Bill will require any more or any fewer of them. &#147;Will the staff level complement go up or down?&#148; is a rough, rapid translation of what I have just said. Were we to end up with more tribunals, for example, that would probably mean extra staff. However, I anticipate that they would be extra-curricular with regard to CMEC, so would not fit into the amendment.</p>

I am grateful to the Minister for advising me of that latter arrangement. It makes sense, but it has not been explained exactly what Ventura is to do. It would not be fair to ask exactly what is in the contract, but I hope that by the time we finish Committee we will know at least what the intentions are of using Ventura. I hope that how to maintain the tripartite relationship between separated parents and children will be part of its remit. Indeed, I have an amendment later on to that effect.</p>

His Amendment No. 2 would see the commission operating as an executive agency under the control of the Secretary of State. Effectively, that would mean the continuation of the Child Support Agency. We believe that a more fundamental change is needed. There have already been several attempts to reform the CSA, which have failed. We believe that the move to a new organisation, operating under a new governance structure, will help provide a break with the past and build a platform for the future.</p>

<p><a name="080129135000016">As an NDPB, the commission will have its own legal status, distinct from its sponsor department, and be led by an independent board. The board will be focused entirely on delivering a successful child maintenance system and will have the operational autonomy to make the changes it thinks appropriate. Within an executive agency there is not as great an opportunity for that single-minded focus. The most senior leaders of an executive agency are part of the leadership team of the entire department. They cannot always be focused on one key area of delivery, such as child maintenance.</p>

<p><a name="080129135000017">Amendment No. 4 proposes that we do not move to the new governance structure until the Child Support Agency&#146;s operational improvement plan has met its targets and objectives. I agree that the successful delivery of the plan is crucial to the success of our reforms, providing a stable platform on which the commission can build. I understand why it may seem beneficial to wait until the plan&#151;in particular, the forthcoming IT changes&#151;has been fully delivered before handing responsibility for the child maintenance system to the new commission. However, we believe that that would not be the right approach.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para3">
<p><a name="080129135000018">I shall answer the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, about the IT system. I think that the discussion we had was about the delivery of a major upgrade to the system called PR1. As I understand it, that is still on track to be put in place towards the end of March. That is quite key to helping the business model under which the CSA and, at least initially, CMEC will operate. It is still being tested extensively.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para4">
<p><a name="080129135000019">It is important to recognise that the operational improvement plan was designed prior to the comprehensive reforms that will be brought in by the Bill. Although the benefits that the plan will bring remain relevant, it does not incorporate the key building blocks of the new child maintenance system, such as the removal of compulsion, new enforcement powers and, ultimately, the new approach to assessment. If we were to delay a handover to the commission, we would risk delaying those changes.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para5">
<p><a name="080129135000020">We believe that it is right to establish the commission and to give it responsibility for the remainder of the plan as soon as possible. That will allow for the development of an integrated change programme that includes the new measures enabled by the Bill. We believe that will facilitate the fundamental reforms we want and will help us maximise the number of effective arrangements as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para6">
<p><a name="080129135000021">Amendment No. 5 proposes that the Child Support Agency continues to manage cases under the existing schemes and to have responsibility for  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC299"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column GC299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>outstanding debt. The amendment suggests that that arrangement continues until 2010. That approach has certain attractions; in particular, it would have provided the new commissioning body with the opportunity of a completely clean break from the legacy of the Child Support Agency.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para7">
<p><a name="080129135000022">We have two principal concerns, however. First, we do not believe that that approach would be the best use of resources. Instead of the new organisation building on the existing Child Support Agency, it would have to start from scratch. That would no doubt lead to significant duplication: a strong leadership team, for example, would be needed in both organisations. We would also be in the difficult position of having two organisations, with potentially different goals, competing for the same limited finances, and we could not flexibly deploy resources according to overall need, resulting in staff, IT and contracts in two chimneys.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para8">
<p><a name="080129135000023">Secondly, we want to introduce changes to the child maintenance system as quickly as possible, and our reforms will do that. By the end of the next financial year, for example, we will have removed compulsion, extended the maintenance disregard and introduced new enforcement powers, and those changes are all powers of the existing schemes. If a residuary body were managing the existing schemes, the new organisation would have no part in the implementation of those crucial reforms, and we did not think that that would be right. Linked to that, we were concerned that two organisations would lead to an incoherent experience for clients. The interplay between the different child maintenance schemes is complicated enough without adding organisational barriers.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para9">
<p><a name="080129135000024">After careful consideration, therefore, we decided to give responsibility for all aspects of the child maintenance system to the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission. The commission will work to a single set of objectives, allowing the process of change to be as seamless as possible for clients and enabling existing skills, knowledge and experience to be utilised to best effect.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para10">
<p><a name="080129135000025">Amendment No. 14 proposes that the commission must ensure that an appropriate level of staff is maintained to fulfil its functions. I recognise the underlying concern behind the amendment. Appropriate staffing levels are crucial to the delivery of an effective service, and decisions on headcount should be taken only on the basis of the strongest possible evidence and the most rigorous business planning. The Bill already requires the Commission to act in that way. Clause 3 requires the commission to exercise its functions in a way that is both efficient and effective. The commission could not exercise its functions effectively with insufficient staff and would be failing in its duty if it did not secure the resources necessary to maintain appropriate staffing levels.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para11">
<p><a name="080129135000026">I shall try to pick up on some of the points that have been raised. If I do not cover them all, I will happily have another go. Both noble Lords were eagerly awaiting the QSS. I am sure there will be a chance to debate the consequences of what those statistics contain later in our deliberations.</p>

<p><a name="080129135000027">The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about Vertex and how that was all going. He will be aware that the contract with Vertex was to cover clerical cases, which were driven by failures in the IT systems of cases that could not readily migrate from one system to another. One of the consequences of the changes to the IT systems currently proposed is that the impact of those situations should be reduced, and therefore reliance on some clerical cases being contracted out should diminish.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para13">
<p><a name="080129135000028">The noble Lord asked about the new operating model. That is down to the commission to develop; it will start with an operating model, but we want the commission&#146;s expertise in developing that model. That touches on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, about staffing levels. Where those levels end up will depend very much on what that model is, particularly what happens on commissioning. Again, it is for the commission to develop those proposals through transition and at the end of transition.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para14">
<p><a name="080129135000029">Both noble Lords raised the point of why the new arrangements are different, and I have touched on that in part. They are genuinely different for a number of reasons. The first is that they uncouple the arrangements from the benefits system. People will no longer be compelled to use a statutory system. As part of that, parents will be encouraged to enter into voluntary arrangements but to be aware of, have access to and be supported in accessing the statutory system if they do not. That is a significant change. There are major changes around enforcement powers, and we have an information and support service, which we will debate and discuss later on, that is simply not in place at the moment. We have arm&#146;s-length governance arrangements, which is a change; that allows the expertise of a separate board to develop the business model and to address the challenges and objectives that we are imposing upon it.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para15">
<p><a name="080129135000030">The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said that the system will be dealing with significant sums of money and commitments in an important policy area but will be entirely free from government. As the Bill identifies and the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said, there are opportunities for guidance and directions to be given by the Secretary of State to the commission. We consider that directions would be few and far between; they are not necessarily the nuclear option, but they would not be a routine occurrence. We have provided in the Bill that directions would be subject to commercial confidentiality and would be tabled in Parliament. Guidance could cover a range of operational issues, small and large.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para16">
<p><a name="080129135000031">At the end of the day, the commission will secure its funding from the department and therefore the normal sort of arrangements will be in place: there will be a framework, a business plan will need to be developed and targets will be imposed on the commission so that there is a link and accountability to the Secretary of State and to Parliament. Again, we are discussing the issues of the report that has to be made in due course.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para17">
<p><a name="080129135000032">I hope that that has convinced the Committee that there is a distinction. This is a new start, although there is a prolonged transition to achieve it because

We need to build that future over a few years. Having said that, I urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The first of them, though, appeared to be&#151;if I may paraphrase&#151;that the lack of compulsion will encourage parents to use the new system. I find that very difficult to believe. I wonder what evidence he has of that.</p>

<p><a name="080129135000034"><b><a name="80129-gc0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="080129135000066">Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I said that it was one of the key differences. I cited three. There are others that one could cite, particularly around the commissioning arrangements of the commission. Issues around compulsion are to do with not forcing parents with care on benefit to use the statutory system so that they will have the same choices as everyone else and be encouraged, if it is appropriate for their circumstances, to enter into voluntary arrangements. It is part of the dialogue to encourage parental responsibility. That is a significant change in approach and marks a difference with the past.</p>

<p><a name="080129135000035"><b><a name="80129-gc0004.htm_spnew2"><a name="080129135000067">Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Yes. I obviously did not explain myself very well. Of course it marks a change from the past. What evidence does the Minister have that the fact that people do not have to use the new organisation will make it any more acceptable? There will still be a vast number of people who use it&#151;and, if he is right, who choose to use it. That has to happen fairly and with a level of acceptance. The fact that people do not have to use it makes no difference to those who are using it, and indeed who have been using the CSA until now and will be carried on through the system.</p>

I suggest, however, that what would make the system more acceptable for those who use it would be better assessment arrangements that did not rely upon income details from people who did not want to engage with the commission and sought to avoid their responsibilities&#151;so reliance on HMRC data will help the assessment process. The ability to update those assessments on an annual basis is a change that people will recognise makes assessments more current.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0004.htm_para18">
<p><a name="080129135000037">The increase in the benefit disregard, where both non-residents and parents with care will readily recognise the opportunity for more money being available to children without the state clawing it back, is another strengthened enforcement power so that, when an assessment is in place, parents with care can have the confidence that it will be properly enforced and collected. It is the collection arrangements that I think will build confidence in the new system. That sits alongside the encouragement for people to enter voluntary arrangements, underpinned by an information and support service.</p>

I am not sure that I entirely share it, but that is a debate for another day. Given that most, or many, non-resident parents who have not lived in cohabitation with their children&#151;in other words, they have a more casual relationship with them&#151;have an unrealistically low estimate of what it costs to bring up a child, as all the research says they do, how confident is the Minister that by going for a voluntary arrangement one will increase the degree of responsibility between parents to come to mutually satisfactory arrangements for their children that do not translate into the non-resident parent paying far too little for what the child realistically needs?</p>

Maintenance arrangements come into play in a variety of circumstances. People may have divorced or separated after living together for a long time and therefore would have a greater understanding of the resources of both partners. But with a casual relationship, I accept entirely that it would be much more difficult for the parent with care to make an assessment. A calculator or a ready reckoner will be part of the information and support service. But, in circumstances where it is clear that the parent with care has no idea of the income of the non-resident parent, an obvious choice would be to use the statutory system. An assessment would be undertaken and the arrangements that the commission would have to access HMRC data would kick in. It is a real issue and it is important that we build the information and support service on a robust basis and ensure that there is good information for parents with care around these issues.</p>

I do not think he has convinced any of the people I have talked to who work within the professional staffing agency that this is a clean break. The test of that will be whether there is a big rebranding relaunch. If we are so confident that what we have got adds up to a fresh start, when is the launch party? Who will run it?

My spies, who are everywhere, tell me that this involves &#163;140 million of VAT. The Minister may be right, these may be internal transactions within government, but I understand that somebody cocked up the budget. I am perfectly prepared to accept that that is not the case, if he says so, but I would expect him also to tell the truth and say whether there is a factor in financing this organisation.

Given the level of change expected in the commission as the reforms are introduced and take effect, the commission itself will be best placed to determine the most effective board size&#151;in other words, the members of the board&#151;to meet the statutory responsibilities for which it is accountable to Parliament. Similarly, the decision whether to have committees and sub-committees, and what the membership of such committees should be, should be a decision for the board alone.</p>

<p><a name="080129138000010">The commission remains responsible for ensuring that its statutory functions are exercised in the manner prescribed in legislation. To support the commission in its ability to delegate functions as it sees best, we have provided that the board may form a committee for any purpose and that, if it chooses, it may delegate any of its functions to it in addition to any member of the board or member of staff. In giving the board the ability to create committees for any purpose, we also believe that it is important that it is given the ability to determine the membership of such committees. We have therefore provided that committees can include individuals who are not members of staff, which enables the commission to draw on as wide a body of expertise as possible. For example, it is possible to envisage a committee with responsibility for policy development that might include stakeholders such as one-parent families, or that the audit committee might include an employee of the NAO.</p>

All that is entirely appropriate. The noble Baroness is absolutely right to say that if that happens, there should be processes for reporting back and thus ensuring continuity of information about the deliberations about a particular sub-committee.

Obviously it will have clear reporting lines about its immediate objectives back to the Secretary of State and it will want to make sure that it has the mix of skills that it needs.

<p><a name="080129138000028">I shall detain the Committee briefly on the question of the importance of adding debt to its core objectives as we set up the new commission. I refer directly to the evidence given by the noble Lord, Lord Mackenzie, to the Public Bill Committee in the House of Commons on 17 July at Question 83. He was asked about write-off of historic debt. I shall quote three sentences of his reply, which really stimulates the amendment. The Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080129138000152">&#147;We would like as many of those old debts to be cleared as possible. Obviously, that is quite resource-intensive, and Stephen&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="080129138000129">as he does later.</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080129138000153">&#147;One of things that it is proposed we do is, rather than write off debt, create a provision for reflecting the effect of inflated or uncollectable debt in the account. However, those debts would remain in being and would not be written off until there is consent from the parent with care&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para14">
<p><a name="080129138000029">I would like better to understand what that relates to. It was reinforced later by Mr Geraghty at Question 84, when he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080129138000154">&#147;There comes a point in any debt collection exercise where it is a question of how much we can get. I think that we are a long way from that, but presumably the commission and Parliament will, at some point, want to consider whether they want to keep the debts going&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill Committee, 17/7/07; cols. 34-5.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para15">
<p><a name="080129138000030">That is the background to the amendment, and it raises some rather obvious questions. They are not easy questions because, for reasons to which we alluded earlier, there is a lot of uncollected debt, some of it allegedly recoverable and some not. In tabling the amendment, I noticed&#151;this made me even more concerned&#151;that the Child Support Agency annual report already has a footnote, which I confess that I do not fully understand, that suggests that some of that debt is already parked. That is not to say that it is not on the books; it remains on the books, but it is in a different part, in a footnote, and it is harder for people who are not accountants to find.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para16">
<p><a name="080129138000031">Net debt balance is obviously a bookkeeping exercise; I understand that. What I want the new commission to take to its heart as a core objective is to comb through individual cases. That is what parents with care who are owed substantial sums of money are expecting. It is only because of the lack of computer facility and compliance that we are unable to do that with the expedition that people would  like.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para17">
<p><a name="080129138000032">In other clauses, the Bill certainly gives new, useful powers to the agency. That will give the commission, by the end of 2009, at the end of the operational improvement programme, a much more realistic handle on what is the debt book and what is collectable. However, the proposals are very cautious,

That is probably right because, as Mr Geraghty said in his evidence to the Public Bill Committee, the agency is a long way from knowing how much it can get. I think that the estimates are best guesses rather than anything more robust.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para18">
<p><a name="080129138000033">Arguably, at some stage, the commission will have to come clean and write to the parents with care involved to say that it does not intend to take any more steps to try to effect recovery of some of those debts. I do not know how that can be done in bulk, but I know that the parents with care I talk to expect nothing less than that their cases will be addressed individually, that some day they will have a day of reckoning and that they will be told what is realistic to be recovered and what is not.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para19">
<p><a name="080129138000034">If we do not have a clear set of guidelines in Clause 2 that are core principles, the suspicion will be that the commission will quietly turn its back and tiptoe away from those parents. That would be unconscionable, because some of that debt has been accrued because of the incompetence of the agency, which failed to take, or delayed, appropriate action by not using the powers it had had since 1991. As a result, people have lost money&#151;some of them substantial sums. They ask me, why should the Government simply gallop away to a shiny new future and leave all those people behind? That is a perfectly valid question. Amendment No. 23 is only way that I can think of trying to give them some comfort that in the future this new commission will be held to account in terms of collecting arrears.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para20">
<p><a name="080129138000035">Finally&#151;we will come on to these matters in later clauses&#151;if it turns out that large proportions of these historic legacy debts are to be written off, we need a compensation scheme to deal with it. Where it can be demonstrated that the fault lies in the past incompetence of the agency, expecting people to ask the independent case assessor to take action and go through the formal compensation process would be completely inadequate for the task. A special new compensation package would be needed that could deal sensibly with the numbers we would be talking about. Where the debt was uncollectable on cause shown because the agency did not do its job, there would be some accounting and some money would flow. But none of that can happen until we see what kind of effort the commission makes with these huge residual legacy debts. I could weary the Committee with the statistics; I will not, but I strongly recommend that if we do not put something in the core objectives of this commission on collection of debt, it will be part-forgotten and people will suffer as a result.

I am somewhat confused because the Government seem keen to reduce this. I do not know whether there is a statutory age for the end of childhood because it appears to differ depending on the circumstances. At certain moments, it appears to be 18. If you are adopted, you need the court&#146;s approval to marry at 16 but this requirement ceases at 18. Proposals are afoot to reduce the voting age but I do not know whether that has any bearing on the age of majority. The Government are being somewhat schizophrenic. They propose that the legal age for youngsters to leave education shall be raised to 18; until just the other day you could buy cigarettes&#151;of which I was guilty&#151;at 16 but alcohol at 18; you can join the Army at 16 but not be sent to a theatre of operations until you are 18. So I am not to blame for being confused about the legal age for the end of childhood. I hope the Minister can clear that up for me.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para23">
<p><a name="080129138000041">Whether or not he does so, and whether childhood ends at 16 or 18, or even in between, I must return specifically to the amendment. The fact that the qualifying child is now grown up and may well not be living with his or her former parent with care makes no difference to the outstanding debt which may have arisen when he or she was younger. The question that does not seem to be answered by the legislation is: who does the money belong to? To my mind, it should be clear that the money is for the good of the child. So whilst he&#151;this is not sexist, the Interpretation Act applies&#151;is living with the parent with care the money is to be in the control of that parent, as it would be for any minor. When he becomes an adult or moves out or both, the money should go directly to him. Not only that, but the backlog that was not paid by the absent parent when he was a child should still be paid and, again, to him. There should be no age cut off point for this.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para24">
<p><a name="080129138000042">I have a sneaking suspicion that the Minister agrees with me&#151;in principle anyway. However, the question that he must answer is whether he agrees that this issue is important enough to be included as a main objective in the Bill, which is what the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, seeks. Perhaps I may gently suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, that it should be a secondary consideration and therefore would be more appropriate in subsection (2).</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para25">
<p><a name="080129138000043">Amendment No. 27 is a probing amendment to explore why there seems to be a get-out clause in the stated objectives of CMEC. Clause 2 sets out the commission&#146;s objectives, one of which is to support  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC311"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column GC311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>applications for child support maintenance under the 1991 Act and to ensure that there is compliance with the parental obligations set out in that Act. However, as the Bill stands, CMEC must secure compliance only &#147;when appropriate&#148;. I certainly understand that there may be situations when securing compliance may not be appropriate, or indeed there may be individual scenarios in which it is impossible, but, as the Bill stands, this judgment rests entirely with CMEC. Essentially, CMEC has the power to be judge and jury over whether it may or may not pursue maintenance arrears.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para26">
<p><a name="080129138000044">I feel that that proviso lacks precision. Although that might not be intended in the drafting, it could be interpreted as a loophole. Does the Minister agree that it is unacceptable for the commission to decide for itself when it is appropriate to require a non-resident parent to meet his obligation and when this can be simply ignored? What standards of appropriateness does the Minister have in mind? Surely the priority should be the potential benefit of the maintenance arrangements, and that is what should determine whether the commission seeks to ensure compliance. However, with the commission as the final arbiter of what is appropriate, there is no guarantee that any other potentially unrelated reason is used to shirk the responsibility of ensuring compliance. Can the noble Lord explain the need for the commission to decide for itself when it does its job and when it does not have to?</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para27">
<p><a name="080129138000045">Arguably, the commission should be under a legal duty to secure compliance in all cases. I understand that there may well be practical difficulties with this. I offer the example of the non-resident parent having no money, which might make compliance impossible in some individual cases. I want to be able to take account of difficult exceptions because I do not want to pass an unenforceable Bill but, as it is currently phrased, the scope for avoiding compliance with the law is simply too loose and too wide. Can the Minister give examples of when he thinks it would be appropriate for the commission to ignore the requirement for non-resident parents to meet their statutory obligations?</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para28">
<p><a name="080129138000046">Amendment No. 36 is an attempt to tighten and strengthen the link between the work of CMEC and its objectives. I am forced to promise yet another amendment, one to put in the Bill a precise and exact proviso. With such wishy-washy phrases as &#147;aim to pursue&#148; and &#147;have regard to&#148; the Bill can make a claim towards its grand and good objective of improving child maintenance arrangements for those children living apart from one or both parents&#151;or can it? Those phrases, perhaps conveniently, do not bind the Bill to its objectives and therefore create room for the possibility of under-achievement. I am sure the Minister would agree that there is simply no point in passing the Bill unless noble Lords and Members of another place are confident that it will realise what it promises. Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s record on child maintenance so far has not been exemplary and it is our duty to the children who rely on financial assistance that it should become so.</p>

I am convinced, of course, that the Minister would wish for that too, and thus I cannot imagine that he will have any objection to my speaking and adding my name to the last amendment in this group tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood.</p>

<p><a name="080129138000048"><b><a name="80129-gc0005.htm_spnew8"><a name="080129138000177">Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords for tabling the proposed amendments, each of which I shall address in turn. Amendment No. 23 proposes that the main objective of the commission should be extended to include a subsection requiring the commission to secure the payment of arrears owed under the Act. I understand these concerns but I believe that the amendment is unnecessary. The commission will already be required to pursue all arrears, regardless of when they arose, under the objective which requires it to secure parental compliance with the Child Support Act 1991 where appropriate. Indeed, the Bill brings in new enforcement and debt management powers to prevent new debt building up and to enable accumulated debt to be recovered.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para30">
<p><a name="080129138000049">I should also like to take the opportunity to reassure noble Lords that a range of targets will be published in the commission&#146;s business plan that will underpin each of the commission&#146;s objectives, and these targets will be agreed between the department and the commission in a process which has not yet begun. While we cannot commit to anything at this stage, we would expect the collection of outstanding debt to be part of the range of targets.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0005.htm_para31">
<p><a name="080129138000050">Returning to the current drafting of the subsidiary objective, the words &#147;when appropriate&#148; are needed because Section 2 of the 1991 Act requires the commission to,</p>
<ul><a name="080129138000158">&#147;have regard to the welfare of any child&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080129138000130">when exercising discretionary powers. Indeed, this is a provision to which the noble Lord himself referred at the start of our deliberations. This must take precedence over other considerations. If we removed the words &#147;when appropriate&#148; as suggested in Amendment No. 27, the commission would be caught between two absolute requirements: always to secure compliance under the Act and always to have regard to the welfare of any child. The current drafting of Clause 2 prevents that situation arising, thus ensuring that the commission can always have regard to the welfare of the child.</p>

<p><a name="080129138000051">The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, pressed me on specific examples. There could be situations where pressing a non-resident parent could have a particularly difficult impact on the welfare of a child in his new family; or there could be issues of violence around the potential family situation which could be exacerbated by the pursuit of debts. If the noble Lord presses on why it should be the commission that makes that judgment, it is because the commission would generally be possessed of the information best to make that judgment.</p>

The proposed amendment to ensure that the commission is bound by its objectives when exercising a relevant function would do nothing to change or strengthen this. Furthermore, the current wording reflects standard drafting for such matters rather than any weakness in the link between objectives and functions. There is, for example, a similar approach in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. In the light of that explanation, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0006.htm_para2">
<p><a name="080129138000053">I turn to some of the additional points that were raised. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, mentioned my appearance before the committee in another place and made reference to provisions in accounts. We were then reinforcing the point that the commission should be dealing on a case-by-case basis with individual debtor situations. Obviously, when accounts are drawn up, a judgment is always made about the extent to which a debt book is collectable. It would be normal in those accounts to make a provision against the gross total. It does not mean that any particular debt has been written off and will not be pursued; it merely makes an aggregate judgment about the extent to which, ultimately, that debt will be recovered.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0006.htm_para3">
<p><a name="080129138000054">I should make it clear that any write-off of debt would require the consent of the parent with care. A qualification might be where the non-resident parent is deceased and the estate is not in a position to deal with the amount due. At the moment, it cannot be, but there is a provision in the Bill which will enable the estates of deceased persons to be pursued. That is why that provision is there.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0006.htm_para4">
<p><a name="080129138000055">The Bill includes a range of new powers which the commission will be able to use for the collection and management of historic debt. However, we have listened to concerns raised throughout the Bill&#146;s progress and we have decided to introduce an amendment which we will discuss later in Committee. The amendment will ensure that all new and existing enforcement mechanisms, including liability orders, can be applied to debt at any age, in particular debt which accrued before July 2000 and which we had not previously been able to use court-based enforcement tools to collect. I stress that there are no plans to write off debt where a parent with care wants it collected.</p>

<p><a name="080129138000056">The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked about the definition of &#147;child&#148;. For child maintenance purposes it broadly follows the child benefit qualifications.

While there will be no bulk treatment, will people get a reckoning?

However, there is the important concept that both parents have responsibility for their child and that part of sharing that responsibility is to pay. There is no question but that the mother, as the primary carer, will pay, because usually the money given by a father is not enough to support a child.

If there are lawyers or mediators in the case, they could say, &#147;You are expected to be responsible, as is shown in the legislation&#148;. My noble friend Lord Northbourne and I are hoping to include this in the Children and Young Persons Bill. We want it to be set out clearly across the board that there is responsibility in payment and responsibility in the care of children. Perhaps more importantly, many of these fathers&#151;they are generally fathers&#151;do not have lawyers and will not be in discussion with the mother&#146;s lawyer, if she has one. However, almost certainly a court will be dealing with the separated couple and, after they have separated, will pick up the pieces for them in relation to the rented flat or the owned house and the contact arrangements and so on. Whether it is someone in the magistrates&#146; court, the district judge or occasionally the circuit judge, he can point to this legislation and say that it really matters. He will say not simply, &#147;You&#146;ve got to pay because the legislation says so&#148;, but, &#147;You have got to be responsible for your children&#148;. The meaning of &#147;responsibility&#148; is set out in Amendment No. 35. We need Parliament to make a statement in primary legislation that responsible parenting matters a great deal in relation to money, children and everything that goes with the breakdown of the relationship between parents.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0006.htm_para18">
<p><a name="080129138000083">Even in a case such as my noble friend Lord Northbourne described, where a father says that he did not intend to have children, he has a responsibility under the Child Support Act and this legislation and he needs to be told as well as anyone else that it is not just a money matter. The child is born and the grown-ups have to be responsible for that child. It is the issue of responsibility that my noble friends Lord Northbourne, Lady Finlay and I are extremely keen to push forward.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0006.htm_para19">
<p><a name="080129138000084">Although one may think that this is all a bit of a concept and rather vague, I have to tell noble Lords that, having been a lawyer and a judge, I would have been helped, as other judges will be helped, by having this in primary legislation.</p>

I suspect that all of us want to see responsible parenting, and anything which can be done to encourage it should be done. But, again, I have a real hesitation about putting what I regard as rhetorical statements in the Bill in the hope that somehow they will affect behaviour. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said that this would be a great help to judges. However, most of the children we are talking about do not come out of divorce arrangements, so their cases do not go before the courts. They come out of informal or cohabitation relationships&#151;</p>

<p><a name="080129138000086"><b><a name="80129-gc0006.htm_spnew13"><a name="080129138000192">Baroness Butler-Sloss:</b> Forgive me, but I did say specifically that I was referring to either the separation of a couple or the situation after a marriage breakdown. I am well aware that 40 per cent of children are born in a relationship outside of marriage and I was careful not to limit this to marital breakdown.</p>

<p><a name="080129138000087"><b><a name="80129-gc0006.htm_spnew14"><a name="080129138000193">Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I accept that, but the point is that most of the children whom the agency will be working with will not come from a divorce situation because usually the parent with care will not be on benefits and therefore the children will already be within the voluntary system. The children whom the CSA, and eventually CMEC, largely deal with are those where the parent with care is on benefit and the man is either on benefit as well or is a fairly low earner, and the relationship is generally casual or one of cohabitation. This is not a matter to which lawyers may usefully point because those are not the children whom we are dealing with.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0006.htm_para20">
<p><a name="080129138000088">My second point is that the proposal may be helpful for lawyers in the relatively rare cases where a divorced non-resident parent is being irresponsible, although, in my experience, those fathers who need to pay most do so because they are coming out of marriages in which they have bonded with and become attached to their children. They know how much it costs to bring them up and so they will pay. It is the group that does not come within the ambit of lawyers that presents the problems. Therefore, my concern is that this proposal seems to suggest that those who work to ensure the flow of maintenance&#151;the CSA and then CMEC staff&#151;are being asked to become social workers. We have been careful at every stage of these Bills&#151;in 1991, 2000 and today&#151;to separate the question of child maintenance from contact and all the other issues that can arise. A number of fathers&#146; organisations would like to see it attached, but I do not think it is reasonable to expect CSA or CMEC staff to take on the responsibility of trying to act as social workers between warring parents. Their job is to ensure the flow of money.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0006.htm_para21">
<p><a name="080129138000089">Although I sympathise with the objectives and do not disagree with them, I really do not believe that such wording is appropriate in this legislation, as it is in other Bills such as the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, where we have also been arguing whether a similar form of words should be included.  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC319"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column GC319</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>No doubt the same applies to other Bills related to children. There is a place for such words, but not in a Bill to establish an appropriate mechanism to deliver adequate child maintenance.</p>

<p><a name="080129138000090"><b><a name="80129-gc0006.htm_spnew15"><a name="080129138000194">Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Earlier, I signalled that I was in general agreement with this set of amendments. I most certainly shall not renege on that. However, unlike the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, with all her experience of these matters, I feel that it is important to include something similar to these amendments in the Bill. The noble Baroness made an objection, saying that, although the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, felt that it would be helpful for the courts, the mediation service, solicitors and, I suspect, the judges to be able to point to words such as these, it would be equally helpful, for example, to Ventura or to a member of the staff of the commission when seeking to persuade someone that, notwithstanding the extra enforcement powers mentioned by the Minister, this is a duty on both parents. When I spoke earlier about a wider interpretation of &#147;maintenance&#148;, I meant exactly that. The noble Lord and the noble Baroness have been talking about how to define that wider interpretation of &#147;maintenance&#148;, which is not just money.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0006.htm_para22">
<p><a name="080129138000091">I have no doubt that, like the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, the Minister will object to these amendments by arguing that the CMEC cannot perform all roles and therefore stretch its resources. I can allow the Minister to anticipate my argument against this. It is that the encouragement of a relationship between the absent parent and their child is not just a case of emotional welfare. If the non-resident parent develops a relationship with their child, they will mostly develop a feeling of responsibility towards him and therefore be more inclined to support him financially. In fact, it promises to be a better enforcement of duty than any commission, court or sanction. I certainly support the idea behind these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="080129138000092"><b><a name="80129-gc0006.htm_spnew16"><a name="080129138000195">Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> I am reluctant to get involved in this legal argument that is raging over my head. Australians have found a way to fix some of these problems and Professor Patrick Parkinson came over here. Andrew Selous and Paul Rowen in the Public Bill Committee identified some important policy moves and developments along these lines. The Australian model is simple. It has a system of family relationship centres in shopping malls. They are a mile away from benefit offices, Jobcentre Plus offices or HMRC offices: they are where people need to find them.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0006.htm_para23">
<p><a name="080129138000093">Professor Parkinson said that the success of these centres is that fathers come into them. I am accustomed to mothers beating a path to one&#146;s door and looking for help. Perhaps it is the function of Australia, but it is having a lot of success in keeping fathers attached to their children simply by the development of these ideas but through a system that is different and separate from a commission. The commission will not have time on its hands. I was certainly persuaded by the plea of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, on that. The commission will have enough to do and, if it does what it is asked to do, it will be a good trick and it will be extremely lucky.</p>

<p><a name="080129138000094">At the same time, this sentiment is a powerful part of getting an effective service to families. In an ideal world, you would not need to put it in the Bill. The case being powerfully made is that it may have to be in the Bill so that something gets done, even if it is just the commission saying to the Ministry of Justice or the Department for Children, Schools and Families, &#147;We&#146;ve got to get together and replicate the kind of thing that is done in Australia&#148;. I am not saying that it is perfect there and I do not know that much about it, but it is done on the basis of serving one in 300,000 individuals. That scheme is in its early days of rollout and implementation, but it seems to be working and is doing the kind of things that these important amendments refer to. There is something there that is important to the future success of this policy. If I were pressed, I would have to say that I would support the amendments, but with an important proviso that you are asking a lot of people in the commission who are not looking for extra things to do.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para1">
<p><a name="080129138000095">I have put my name to three amendments in this group. Amendment No. 28, which I do not want to spend a lot of time on, talks about maintenance from both parents based on the right of each child, and I exhausted that argument earlier. Amendment No. 33 is what I like to think of as my &#147;granny amendment&#148;, because when in a previous incarnation I was a solicitor doing consistorial work dealing with broken families in a part of the world that is slightly more matriarchal, it was always the granny who fixed the problem. This was a long time ago when extended families were more extant. Responsible grandparents, or parties like them, can play a role, particularly in relation to Clause 6, where the wife, mother or parent with care is frightened to refer under the new system. Someone needs to be able to shoulder the blame for that and deal with the non-resident parent&#146;s anger and distress when that happens. There is a powerful role for grannies. My granny was certainly a powerful figure in my life. There is a case for looking at third-party involvement in this.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para2">
<p><a name="080129138000096">On Amendment No. 34, I made the point in passing that children aged 12 can make full applications in their own right to the organisation in Scotland. It has never been clear to me why that is restricted to Scotland; but no doubt family lawyers will tell me that it is to do with the age of majority or minority or something. Children aged 12 are perfectly capable of being asked sensible questions about effective parenting, about what they want done, about how they see the relationship with their father being continued somehow, but we do not ask any questions of 12 year-olds or anyone of a minority age. We should think about that in relation to some of the more general arguments that I have been making.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para3">
<p><a name="080129138000097">In so far as they go, these amendments have added a lot to our debates and I would support holding on to these thoughts when considering the rest of the amendments. I hope that the noble Lord will get some satisfaction that, however they are delivered, he will get where he wants to be, whether it is by putting these requirements in the Bill or not.</p>

<p><a name="080129138000099">Of course I have some sympathy with the noble Lord&#146;s intentions, which fit well with overall government policy towards children and their parents.

That is what the Bill is about.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para5">
<p><a name="080129138000100">Noble Lords will recognise the enormous challenges facing the commission. At present, for example, there are no large-scale services providing information on child maintenance options and no support to put in place suitable maintenance arrangements. With the removal of compulsion, it is therefore essential that the commission concentrates on putting in place effective and easily accessible services to ensure that, when compulsion is removed, parents have access to support that will help them move into appropriate and effective maintenance arrangements.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para6">
<p><a name="080129138000101">As we touched on earlier, the Department for Children, Schools and Families has lead responsibility across government for family policy. Supporting parents in supporting their children is a strong theme throughout its recently published Children&#146;s Plan. The commitments in the Children&#146;s Plan have a number of synergies with the work of the commission. In particular, it outlines the DCSF&#146;s commitment to,</p>
<ul><a name="080129138000161">&#147;work across government and with other organisations to launch work on how better to support parents (including non-resident parents) and their children during and after family breakdown&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para7">
<p><a name="080129138000102">In the light of that, we are already working with officials in the DCSF who have responsibility for the commitments in the Children&#146;s Plan to ensure that the commission feeds into the development of policies in this area and that information and support are seen as part of the overall provision of services for separating parents. This is because we want to ensure that lessons learnt from the commission are utilised across government. We also want to ensure that parents can be effectively linked to appropriate support at whatever point they access government-funded services. We are keen to ensure that, where possible, government-funded services are effectively joined up to prevent parents becoming confused by the system or failing to engage with services. The Children&#146;s Plan sets out a vision for more co-location of services to support this joining up. The Government also recognise that services will be more effective if the people using them are involved in the design and delivery planning of the service, and the Children&#146;s Plan sets out proposals for parents to be involved in this at a local and national level.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para8">
<p><a name="080129138000103">The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, referred to the debate on the Children and Young Persons Bill.  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC322"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column GC322</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Noble Lords may be aware that, because of this debate, my noble friend Lord Adonis has agreed to consider whether there is a case for amending the Children Act 1989 to include a more substantive definition of &#147;parental responsibility&#148;. However, he has made it clear that at this stage the Government are not committed to such a change. If that were to come about, I suggest that that Act would be a more appropriate place for such a definition.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para9">
<p><a name="080129138000104">In any event, as I understand it, the amendments are not seeking to define parental responsibility in a broad way; rather, I believe that they focus on promoting responsibility. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, who is hugely experienced in this area, said that it would be helpful to the courts, to the extent that they are involved, to have something that they could point to when encouraging arrangements to be put in place. I am not sure that the amendment provides the required definition but, in any event, if you wanted something to point to, is there not already a definition in the 1989 Act? It may be inadequate but there is a definition there which makes reference to parental responsibility, as expanded by case law. If you want something to point to so as to help and encourage engagement in maintenance arrangements, I question whether there is not already something there for the courts to use.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para10">
<p><a name="080129138000105">Under Clause 4, there is a requirement to promote child maintenance. The commission must take such steps as it thinks appropriate for the purpose of raising awareness among parents of the importance of taking responsibility for the maintenance of their children and making appropriate arrangements for the maintenance of children who live apart from them. That is the proper role of the commission set in the context of the wider policy in which the Department for Children, Schools and Families is engaged.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para11">
<p><a name="080129138000106">I believe that we have a shared agenda here. The question is how best we can move it forward, but I honestly do not think that this Bill provides the right mechanism.</p>

<p><a name="080129138000107">I hope that I have provided noble Lords with the reassurance that we are part of a wider government agenda for focusing on parents and their needs. However, I cannot accept these amendments because they significantly extend the remit and responsibility of the commission beyond the central objective on which we need it to focus.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para13">
<p><a name="080129138000108">Amendment No. 28, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, links back to our earlier discussion on the proposal for a new approach to child maintenance legislation. The amendment would make it an objective of the commission to prepare a scheme of child maintenance based on this new approach. Our earlier discussions set out our position on these changes. The Bill focuses on solving the immediate problems facing the child maintenance system. Furthermore, the noble Lord&#146;s proposals would require fundamental changes and, while the commission would almost certainly have a role, central government is best placed to lead on such changes, especially in view of the work of DCSF.</p>

<p><a name="080129138000109">Amendment No. 33 would enable third parties to make a statutory maintenance claim on behalf of a child when a voluntary arrangement can be shown to be harmful to the child&#146;s long-term interests. This would negate one of the key things we are trying achieve with the repeal of Section 6 by reintroducing a form of compulsion and state intervention for some cases. It would therefore undermine our aim of encouraging parents to make their own decisions about maintenance for their children and raise again the potential for a state-imposed solution regardless of their wishes.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para15">
<p><a name="080129138000110">The commission will introduce a high-quality information and support service to enable parents to make informed choices about the maintenance arrangements that suit them and their children best. This may be a voluntary arrangement, a court consent order or a statutory maintenance arrangement. The amendment will allow anyone to make an application regardless of their relationship to the child, and there is no indication of what tests would be applied to determine whether a voluntary arrangement by the parents would be harmful to the child&#146;s long-term interests, or, indeed, who would be responsible for applying that test.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para16">
<p><a name="080129138000111">Amendment No. 34 seeks to extend to children aged 12 and over in England and Wales the right to make an application for a maintenance calculation. As has been noted, this provision already exists in respect of such children in Scotland. As the Committee will be aware, in Scotland children have different rights to children in England and Wales and different legal systems exist. Under Scots law it is presumed that children aged 12 and over have the capacity to make informed decisions about legal proceedings which affect them and the ability to instruct a solicitor to raise court proceedings, which could, for example, include suing a parent for aliment, the obligation on a parent to maintain a child. When we replaced a court-based system for child maintenance with the CSA scheme, we wanted to ensure that provision was included that enabled Scottish children of 12 and over to retain the ability to apply for maintenance.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para17">
<p><a name="080129138000112">In England and Wales there is no such tradition of children being allowed to seek maintenance from the courts on their own behalf. This has always been done by their parent or guardian. We believe there is no case for changing the laws of England and Wales to match those of Scotland in this respect. In any event, we understand that this right is rarely utilised in Scotland. We do not believe that extending it to children in England and Wales would meet a real need. We would not want to disrupt the structures of family law simply to take account of the different legal framework in Scotland.</p>

<a name="80129-gc0007.htm_para18">

Once you have got to raise awareness of the need for taking responsibility for maintenance, it is a very short step for an employee of the commission to get to the stage that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and I require. It is already in the Bill that the commission has got to do counselling. I ask the Minister why this would not slot in very neatly under Clause 4, not under Clause 2.</p>

What the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, are after is to have a very much wider definition of maintenance, and I remain convinced that they are right.</p>

But I come back to the point that Clause 4 is about taking responsibility for maintenance, not the wider issue, important though it is. It may well be that in some circumstances it is quite a small step, but I am sure that with her great experience, the noble and learned Baroness would acknowledge that there can be other circumstances where it is quite a big step. That is why we believe that the balance struck here to promote maintenance is right. The broader issue is something for part of a broader government agenda.</p>

However, one point did strike me. The noble Lord said that all this stuff is not really for us because our job is just to process the claims that come in. We are already inundated with claims that we cannot handle, so we certainly cannot do anything else. But if you are in a boat which is filling with water and you cannot bail it out fast enough, what about trying to mend the hole so that less water can get in?

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"><a name="080129110000008">I am grateful to the Intelligence and Security Committee for its valuable work and its latest annual report (Cm 7299). Following consultation with the committee over matters that could not be published without prejudicing the work of the intelligence and security agencies, I have today laid the report before the House. I have also laid before the House today the Government&#146;s response to this report (Cm7300).</p>

<a name="80129-wms0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"><a name="080129110000012">I am today announcing a new structure for the Ministry of Justice which will help to deliver further improvements in our core aims: reducing reoffending and creating more efficient, effective offender management services in custody and the community, improving access to justice and the effective administration of the justice system, building an effective relationship with the judiciary and delivering constitutional reform and working for a just and democratic society. The changes underline our commitment to public protection, strengthening closer working between prisons and probation and making the most of public funds while creating the right conditions for the delivery of the whole of the Ministry of Justice&#146;s wide agenda.</p>

<a name="80129-wms0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"><a name="080129110000013">The Ministry of Justice was established on 9 May 2007.  It brought together the former responsibilities of the Department for Constitutional Affairs with the National Offender Management Service from the Home Office and the trilateral Office for Criminal Justice Reform.  The new department has a wide-ranging remit with major delivery responsibilities for prisons and probation, the courts and tribunals, legal  


<notus-date day="29" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS28"><b>29 Jan 2008 : Column WS28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>aid and more, as well as important policy responsibilities ranging from constitutional reform and devolution, democracy and human rights to the justice system.  When the department was set up, the then Permanent Secretary commissioned a review to develop proposals for a new structure and ways of working to equip the department better to deliver on its aims and priorities.</p>

<a name="80129-wms0001.htm_para5">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"><a name="080129110000014">Two further important pieces of work have fed into this review&#151;Lord Carter&#146;s report on prisons, on which I reported to the House on 5 December 2007<I> (Official Report, </I>Commons, col<I>. </I>827) and the work to develop a partnership relationship with the judiciary, which I reported to the House on 23 January 2008<I> (Official Report, </I>Commons, col. 54WS). The changes to the structure of the Ministry of Justice which I am announcing today are the fruit of all of this work.  The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Justice will be providing further detail to staff about the changes.</p>

<a name="80129-wms0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"><a name="080129110000015">The new top structure of the department will come into place on 1 April with the more detailed changes being implemented over the next few months to provide a coherent structure for managing the department&#146;s key challenges&#151;on public protection and reducing reoffending, constitutional reform, and access to justice.  This streamlined top structure and new ways of working will help the department to implement Lord Carter&#146;s recommendations on offender management services, to take forward the new partnership relationship with the judiciary and to focus more clearly on its key policy and delivery challenges.  We have taken a robust approach to removing duplication and improving efficiency.</p>

<a name="80129-wms0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"><a name="080129110000016">A key element of these changes is to drive forward the next stage in offender management.  The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) was created in 2004 and has already brought a greater degree of coherence to offender management.  Reoffending rates are down, successful drug treatments and offending behaviour programmes are up, community payback is thriving, and prolific offenders and those posing a high risk of harm are now subject to end-to-end offender management.  The structure I am announcing today will allow NOMS to build on this success and take forward Lord Carter&#146;s proposals for streamlining management structures and reducing overhead costs.  We will bring NOMS and the Prison Service together, and streamline the headquarters so as to improve the focus on frontline delivery of prisons and probation and improve efficiency.  The chief executive of the restructured NOMS will run public prisons and manage performance across the sector, through service-level agreements and formal contracts with probation boards and trusts, private prisons and other service providers.  Having commissioning and performance management for both prisons and probation in a single organisational structure will further drive forward joined-up offender management and deliver essential savings.</p>

<a name="80129-wms0001.htm_para9">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"><a name="080129110000018">The chief executive of the Office for Criminal Justice Reform will report to this director-general, which will enable OCJR to strengthen joint working between the police, Crown Prosecution Service and HMCS together with prison, probation and youth justice services.  My right honourable friend the Home Secretary, my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General and I have reaffirmed our commitment to OCJR continuing as a distinct trilateral team, supporting the three criminal justice departments and the National Criminal Justice Board as well as local criminal justice boards. </p>

<a name="80129-wms0001.htm_para10">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"><a name="080129110000019">Changes to the regional organisation of offender management will be implemented on a phased basis to merge the roles of area manager in the Prison Service and regional offender managers in NOMS.  A new, single regional manager will commission prison and probation services, from public, private and third-sector providers.  These individuals will have authority to deliver national policies in ways that meet the needs of their regional contexts.  And, in turn, individual prison governors and probation boards and trusts will have the authority they need to determine how best to deliver what is required of them.  We plan to introduce this structure in London and in Wales from April and complete these changes in all regions over the next 12 to 24 months.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"><a name="080129110000020">A new democracy, constitution and law director-general will bring together work on the governance of Britain agenda for constitutional reform, launched by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister in a Green Paper last July, including a possible new British Bill of rights and responsibilities, leading work on constitutional reform, democratic engagement, devolution and information management for government.  It will also provide legal services to the department and lead work on law reform policy. </p>

<a name="80129-wms0001.htm_para12">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"><a name="080129110000021">Responsibilities for justice issues will be under a new access to justice director-general, who will lead a group that brings together the courts and tribunals with legal aid and regulation of the legal profession.</p>

<a name="80129-wms0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"><a name="080129110000022">Under the new partnership model, which the Lord Chief Justice and I announced on 23 January a new board for HMCS with an independent, non-executive chair will hold the chief executive to account and facilitate the working of the new partnership relationship with the judiciary.  HMCS staff will have a joint duty to the Lord Chief Justice and to me as Lord Chancellor for the effective and efficient operation of the courts.  The access to justice director-general will ensure that the excellent work on streamlining the courts is linked more effectively with modernisation elsewhere in the justice system, including in legal aid and regulation of the legal profession.</p>

<a name="80129-wms0001.htm_para14">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"><a name="080129110000023">Finally, a new corporate performance director-general will bring together the key cross-cutting functions in the MoJ to ensure that one of the largest departments in Whitehall has cost-effective shared services and professional support.</p>

The new structure will ensure a more joined-up approach to issues of justice and constitutional reform and with a clearer focus on efficiency through the removal of duplication and overlapping responsibilities.  There is much work to be done on the detail of these changes before the top structure comes into effect in April.  I know that our key partners will want to contribute their thoughts on how this should be done and the department has set up an e-mail address for comments over the next four weeks (communications@justice.gsi.gov.uk).  I should, of course, be very happy to have comments from honourable and right honourable Members and noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"><a name="080129110000030">The research found that:</p>
advertising women for sex is widespread in local and regional newspapers. Three-quarters of the papers examined for the research carried advertisements for women or services offered by women. Local papers in every region in England carried advertisements for sex with women. Typically, these advertisements are sandwiched between innocuous advertisements for other services and goods; and almost half of the papers examined for the research carried classified advertisements specifying the nationalities or origins of women. There was a particular focus on highlighting women from Asia, including South-East Asia. Women were most likely to be described as &#147;Oriental&#148;, &#147;Chinese&#148;, &#147;Japanese&#148; or &#147;&#145;Thai&#148; but a large range of nationalities (for example &#147;Indian&#148;, &#147;Pakistani&#148;, &#147;Italian&#148;, &#147;Spanish&#148;) and origins (such as &#147;East European&#148;, &#147;South American&#148;) are used. British nationality is usually not specified.

This meant that the Competition Commission was required to undertake an investigation and to provide a report on the effects of the transaction on competition and also on its effects on the public interest consideration specified in the reference. This was the consideration set out in Section 58(2C)(a) of the Enterprise Act relating to the need, in relation to every different audience in the United Kingdom, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience.</p>

whether a relevant merger situation has been created;whether the creation of that situation has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition within any market of the United Kingdom; andwhether, taking account only of any substantial lessening of competition and any admissible public interest consideration, that situation operates, or may be expected to operate, against the public interest.

The Competition Commission has concluded that the transaction is not likely to result in effects adverse to the public interest as it relates to the public interest consideration specified in the reference. Accordingly, the Competition Commission has concluded that, overall, the transaction may be expected to operate against the public interest.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"><a name="080129110000040">The Competition Commission has concluded that two remedies would be effective in addressing the substantial lessening of competition arising from this merger.

In reaching this decision, it may be noted that under Section 55(3) of the Enterprise Act, I am required in particular, to have regard to the Competition Commission's report and its recommendations on appropriate remedies.
