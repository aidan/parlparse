Dr David Colin-Thomé, national clinical director of primary care, and Professor Steve Field, chairman of the council of the Royal College of General Practitioners, were asked to report on how best to strengthen this service. Their report was published on 4 February and the Government have accepted their recommendations in full.</p>

Why has it taken five critical reports-one from the Public Accounts Committee, two from the Health Select Committee, one from the two gentlemen to whom she referred and, above all, one from the coroner from Cambridgeshire-for this Government to take at least some action in this important area? Will she give a specific commitment on the three areas highlighted by the coroner? They are, first, to tighten up the clinical training of the out-of-hours doctors; secondly, to double-check that every doctor who does out-of-hours work speaks and understands English; and, finally, to instruct every primary care trust that they must work together to improve out-of-hours services for NHS patients.</p>

We have instigated a top-level investigation to deal with that. We are carefully considering the coroner's recommendations. It seems clear that all the recommendations, including those mentioned by the noble Lord, have already been taken into account and are part of the recommendations brought forward in the report by Dr Colin-Thomé and Professor Field. While the current system has safeguards, we recognise that these are not always carried out to the same high standard across the country. That is our priority and the challenge that we have.</p>

It was recognised that that was not sustainable or in the best interests of the patients. As for the system that we have now, the National Audit Office has said that we are in "the forefront of thinking" about out-of-hours care and that we compare well in terms of cost and quality with the rest of Europe.</p>

I am aware of a very serious case where, because it was the weekend, there was no communication from one hospital to another about a particular patient. That is not acceptable.</p>

One of the recommendations that the coroner made in the recent case was about having a national system for communications that would operate out of hours. We are working with the medical organisations to develop that national database and to consider what data should be placed on it.</p>

Indeed, our out-of-hours GP services are meeting the needs of patients, by and large, extremely well. We know that there are some problems around the country, as my noble friend has mentioned, but they will be tackled. This is an improved and improving service.</p>

That issue can be tackled by subjecting to assessment all doctors coming for their first employment in the NHS, even though they may have been British trained.</p>

That is one of the main recommendations in the Thomé report. The noble Lord will also be aware that we are addressing the issue of how we can guarantee language testing as soon as possible, including raising this with European partners when the time comes to review the arrangements.</p>

Indeed, 2010 is five years before the deadline for meeting the millennium development goals. The global development plan which we are seeking in partnership-starting with the DfID conference tomorrow which will move on from the European Union position towards an international view-is an attempt to identify where we are deficient. The EU is off track in meeting its interim ODA target of 0.56 per cent of gross national income by 2010 although the United Kingdom is on track. There is failure to meet a number of the millennium development goals and 1 billion people in the world are still hungry. There is a lot of work to do. However, I agree entirely with my noble friend that it can only be done in collaboration with our European partners and our international partners as well.</p>

We certainly regard the Development Commissioner as extremely important. Of course we ensure that our money is spent on issues and in areas where we believe it will do the most to eradicate poverty. We have a strong record in this area. We have been at the forefront in seeking efficiency reforms within the European Union to aid that task, and we will continue to do so.</p>

I can give a breakdown on the proportions of the money spent. I know that the noble Lord's enthusiasm for Europe is less than total, but international development is one area in which even he could not find much to criticise Europe. He makes the point about fraud, but the truth is that the amount of fraud is very small. The auditors have made a point about inadequate reporting by member states, and in 2009 they named Spain, Italy and Portugal as responsible for 80 per cent of the financial errors. However, actual fraud was found in only two cases among all the irregularities considered in 2008. Methinks that the noble Lord doth protest too much.</p>

We, as people involved in politics, may sometimes despair at the willingness of young people to take a more serious attitude to the domestic political agenda, but I have found that when you talk to them about the international agenda, issues of climate change and poverty in Africa, there is a very ready understanding. The right reverend Prelate is absolutely right: we must continue and extend our efforts to ensure that all our young people are aware of the world in which they live, and the important part that they play not just in the United Kingdom and in Europe but in developing a better world for all of us.</p>

They were not the former colonial power and they were not people who came in with a particular nationality; they were seen as a European responsibility and as a European response to world problems.

That would seem to be within the mandate of UNSCR 1590. Is the Minister doing anything to promote enhanced assistance to the Government of south Sudan for security sector reform, particularly for the enhancement of the capacity of the south Sudan police service?</p>

There will be that hiatus between the election and the referendum, when it will be very important for UNMIS to be very active.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="10031069000037"></a>In the UN Security Council consultations and in meeting the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Haile Menkerios, the UK has emphasised and will continue to emphasise the importance of UNMIS in protecting civilians during this crucial time. Of course, the noble Lord is correct in drawing attention to the need for security at this time, as people need to feel confident that they can go about their business and that peace can be protected, as well as being able to be sure that their right to vote will take place in a peaceful way, without the beginning of any more conflict or tension in the south, where it is always possible that that may occur.</p>

Is the Minister aware that southern Sudan suffers from a humanitarian crisis, with one in seven children dying before the age of five and one in seven mothers dying in childbirth and with only 20 per cent immunisation? Could DfID take an overview of the distribution of aid to ensure that it reaches all those in need, both to save lives and promote stability before the elections and referendum in the south?</p>

She makes the very important point that support for south Sudan and its Government is very important. We will provide approximately half of our £140 million development assistance for 2010-11 to south Sudan. UK funding will cover basic services, primary education, support for health infrastructure, along with efforts that will be made with water and sanitation. When I was in south Sudan recently, I was able to see the enormous needs that people have there. After the conflict, with the suffering that they have experienced in that country, they will expect to see a peace dividend. We all have to work together to ensure that we increase our staff in Juba and increase our support for the Government of south Sudan.</p>

In the longer term, looking to the more optimistic side, would she agree that if, and when, southern Sudan opts through a referendum to be an autonomous, separate country, as seems quite likely, there is a potential future that we should encourage of working very closely with neighbouring Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania in a sort of revived east African federation, which would really bring substantial prosperity and development to the whole region, where at present we just have bloodshed and war?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="10031069000043"></a>My honourable friend Gerry Sutcliffe, the Sports Minister, met the three football authorities-the Football Association, the Premier League and the Football League-on 8 February 2010 to discuss football regulation, governance and the national game.</p>

<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="10031069000044"></a><b><a name="100310-0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10031069000313"></a>Lord Dubs:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend for that Answer. Is he aware that Portsmouth and a number of other football clubs are currently in serious financial difficulties; that British fans pay among the highest admission charges in Europe; that the money that many clubs take at the gate is pretty well all absorbed by the weekly wage bill; that some owners treat the clubs like playthings; that the Glazer brothers bought Manchester United with borrowed money and may damage that famous club through their efforts to recoup; and that we do not even know who owns Leeds United? It is a mess. Does he agree that British fans and British players deserve better than this? Will he encourage the football authorities to introduce a better system of voluntary regulation? Failing that, maybe the statutory path is the way we should go?</p>

I certainly believe that the supporters of British football clubs deserve better. I also believe that it is the responsibility of the authorities to seek and provide better self-regulation. It is wrong to say that there have not been messages from government or, indeed, that there has been a lack of action. The football authorities have recently made significant moves to toughen regulations with early warning systems on tax debts, the introduction of transfer embargoes and help to monitor and curb club spending. I should like to pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, who is in his place, and to the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, both distinguished Members of your Lordships' House, who play a part in trying to bring that better self-regulation. We will continue to advise and assist, but it is not for the Government to regulate football. It is for the governing authorities and it is for the clubs to manage themselves.</p>

<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="10031069000046"></a><b><a name="100310-0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="10031069000315"></a>Lord Mawhinney:</b> I declare an interest, first, as chairman of the Football League and, secondly, as deputy chairman of England's 2018 World Cup bid. I thank the noble Lord for his kind words and for his recognition of the efforts that are being made to improve regulation in the world of football, on which I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. Is the Minister aware that, in pursuit of our campaign against indefensible debt, the Football League has recently entered into an arrangement with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs so that if, in any month, any of our clubs do not pay PAYE or national insurance, we apply sporting sanctions to them until they do pay?</p>

<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="10031069000047"></a><b><a name="100310-0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="10031069000316"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I was aware of the message that the noble Lord extends to the House. I am not sure that the whole House was aware of it. I am certainly not sure that the great British public are aware of it. The authorities are to be congratulated on that particular, and other, endeavours that they are making. Football is more than just another commodity. Football fans carry an allegiance. It is a community asset.</p>

<a name="100310-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="10031069000048"></a>In my lifetime I have lived through paternal ownership, vanity ownership and international financial ownership. The latter seems to me to carry some dangers and requires a much stronger self-regulation. In the absence of that, there will be continuing pressure on clubs from dissatisfied fans. Today three more clubs were in the High Court. Southend and Cardiff City were given extended periods of 35 and 56 days. We hope that they will escape from going out of existence. However, HMRC has a responsibility to collect money owed to the taxpayer. We cannot have clubs running on the avoidance of paying their obligations to the taxpayer.</p>

Does he agree that this is in no small part due to an excellent chairman, born and brought up locally and totally personally committed to the club, as well as a splendid manager and a very talented squad of players? Will he join me in wishing them all the best in tonight's match?</p>

Stoke City is indeed a good example, but there are others. We should not necessarily pray in aid solely British ownership; I happen to think that Aston Villa is also a well run club, and it has an American owner. It is not about physical ownership. I think it is astonishing, as does everyone else, that Leeds United fans cannot know who the directors of Leeds United are, but those are the vagaries of Swiss law. I hope that the endeavours of Ministers for Sport over a number of years, which will continue when the current Minister for Sport meets the football authorities again in June, mean that we will continue on the right path. In the mean time, we will do all that we can do. The Inland Revenue, or HMRC, as I should insist on calling it, looks to assist clubs. It does not seek to force them into liquidation-although one, Chester City, went into liquidation today-when there are other ways of finding means of providing the money and paying back debts within a reasonable period.</p>

The Minister will recall our Second Reading, only two weeks ago.

The fact that more than 330 amendments have been tabled so far shows how deep those concerns are.</p>

<a name="100310-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="10031069000060"></a>I move Amendment 1 and speak to Amendments 5, 20, 21 and 26, which are in this group. These amendments return to a question that has been asked about the tripartite arrangements, on and off, since 2007: who is in charge? The Treasury Select Committee in another place put that question formally to the Governor of the Bank of England when taking evidence for its report, <I>The </I><I>Run on the Rock</I>, published in 2008. The governor famously replied:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="10031069000229"></a>"What do you mean by 'in charge'?".</p>

<p><a name="10031069000212"></a>In his later evidence, the Chancellor got close to saying that he was in charge when he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="10031069000240"></a>"the Treasury is the backstop, if you like, in all these things-to be intimately involved".</ul>
<p><a name="10031069000213"></a>The Treasury Select Committee concluded, in paragraph 284 of its report, that,</p>
<ul><a name="10031069000241"></a>"we are concerned that, to outside observers, the Tripartite authorities did not seem to have a clear leadership structure. We recommend that the creation of such an authoritative structure must be part of the reforms for handling future financial crises".</ul>
<p><a name="10031069000061"></a>Here we are again, 18 months or so later, considering a Bill that still does not address with clarity who is in charge.</p>

<a name="100310-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="10031069000062"></a>Last summer, the Government announced in their White Paper, <I>Reforming </I><I>F</I><I>inancial </I><I>M</I><I>arkets</I>, that they would set up the Council for Financial Stability. The Treasury Select Committee's verdict is set out in its 14th report of 2008-09 as follows:</p>
<ul><a name="10031069000242"></a>"we view the change as one which is largely cosmetic. Merely rebranding the Tripartite Standing Committee will achieve little by itself; what is required is an improvement in cooperation amongst its members, and a simplification and clarification of responsibilities for each of its members".</ul>
<p><a name="10031069000214"></a>Legislation cannot achieve better co-operation between the three parties, but we can expect legislation to clarify responsibilities. I regret that the Bill does not do that. Under the arrangements that existed before the Northern Rock crisis, there was a Memorandum of Understanding between the three bits of the tripartite authorities. If this Bill becomes law, there will be formal terms of reference issued by the Treasury, a draft of which is already available, and a Memorandum of Understanding which is not available.</p>

<a name="100310-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="10031069000063"></a>The existing Memorandum of Understanding skirts around the issue of who is in charge. It says that a standing committee is a,</p>
<ul><a name="10031069000243"></a>"principal forum for agreeing policy",</ul>
<p><a name="10031069000215"></a>and for "coordinating or agreeing action". The draft terms of reference for the Council for Financial Stability, according to paragraph 15, are as a "monitoring and coordinating body"; the following paragraphs talk about considering things and discussing things. I do not expect the Memorandum of Understanding which will complement this to fill the gaping hole headed "Who is in charge?".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="10031069000064"></a>During the evidence sessions in the Public Bill Committee in another place, my honourable friend Mr Mark Hoban asked who was responsible for financial stability. The answer seemed to be that the Bank did a bit, the FSA did a bit and the Treasury does a bit. That is exactly the position that appeared to obtain before the Northern Rock crisis revealed so clearly that the tripartite arrangements did not work. When pressed, the representatives of the Bank of England and the

The FSA said that its role was secondary and the Bank, when asked whether there was a first among equals, said that that was obviously the Chancellor. Then the FSA muddied the waters a bit more by putting in a written memorandum which said it would give "considerable deference" to the others, and repeated that its role was "secondary". We are concerned about the lack of clarity in this new council, and that is why I have tabled the amendments in this group.</p>

<a name="100310-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="10031069000065"></a>Amendment 1 adds a new function for the council to those listed in Clause 1(3). As well as keeping financial stability under review and co-ordinating action, my amendment would add directing,</p>
<ul><a name="10031069000244"></a>"the relevant authorities to act in accordance",</ul>
<p><a name="10031069000216"></a>with their powers. Amendment 26 is a related definition amendment. It is nonsense to think that the council is worth having at all if all it does is discuss and co-ordinate. Also, the council seems to be predicated on unanimity at all times and on all issues. Suppose that having looked at an issue-increased leverage in the banking system, perhaps, or the emergence of a new way to slice and dice risk-the council wants the FSA to alter the way in which it regulates banks. If everyone agrees, there is no problem. But what if the FSA did not agree, or did not think it was a high priority compared with the other activities, which of course go way beyond prudential regulation and supervision? My amendment allows the council to direct the FSA to act in accordance with its powers.</p>

<a name="100310-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="10031069000066"></a>In another place, the Minister criticised this amendment because it did not go far enough in providing what he called,</p>
<ul><a name="10031069000245"></a>"the necessary legal architecture for such an institutional framework".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Financial Services Bill Committee, 5/1/10; col. 236.]</ul>
<p><a name="10031069000217"></a>However, he went on to say that this was about whether decisions would be made by majority vote, and how decisions would be enforced. I hope that the Minister today has a more incisive critique. A Government who can draft a Fiscal Responsibility Bill which had no enforcement mechanisms whatsoever for its fiscal targets cannot complain about an amendment which seeks to make plain how the decisions are to be transmitted to the relevant tripartite authorities.</p>

<a name="100310-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="10031069000067"></a>An alternative formulation for this concept is found in Amendment 21, which is based on the concept of the council actually making a decision-a notable absence from the current Bill. Amendment 21 is in the form of a new clause to be inserted after Clause 2; this is a sharper-edged version of Amendment 1. I can see no problem with the council telling the FSA or the Bank of England what to do, provided it was within its own statutory powers. However, there is a problem if the FSA and the Bank of England gang up on the Treasury: it would be pretty odd if two quangos could tell the Treasury what to do. It would certainly be undesirable, because those decisions could well involve taxpayers' money and we do not want unelected bodies having powers like that.</p>

<a name="100310-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="10031069000068"></a>Therefore, I have tabled Amendment 20, which says that if there is no agreement on the exercise of the council's functions the Chancellor should decide. This deals with the question that eluded the Governor of  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_248"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column 248</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Bank of England and the chairman of the FSA back in 2007. It fills a gap in this Bill; it says unambiguously who is in charge.</p>

<a name="100310-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="10031069000069"></a>Lastly, Amendment 5 in this group amends Clause 1(6). Subsection (5) refers to the Treasury preparing a statement about the exercise by the council of its functions, and subsection (6) says what the statement may contain, which includes,</p>
<ul><a name="10031069000246"></a>"the objectives to be met by the Council",</ul>
<p><a name="10031069000218"></a>the matters to which it must have regard, and its procedure. However, as in a lot of this Bill there is a great big hole where one would expect some substance. Amendment 5 adds to the list in subsection (6) by adding that it may,</p>
<ul><a name="10031069000247"></a>"specify the responsibilities of each relevant authority in protecting or enhancing the stability of the UK financial system".</ul>
<p><a name="10031069000219"></a>Since the council itself has no powers other than of reviewing or co-ordinating under the Bill, it has to work through the FSA, the Treasury and the Bank of England, and my amendment simply reflects that.</p>

<a name="100310-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="10031069000070"></a>The draft terms of reference to which I referred earlier do include reference to responsibilities-in fact, more than a page is spent on this-and the earlier Memorandum of Understanding did the same thing. Specifying the responsibilities is clearly important to those who drafted these documents, so it seems curious that the Bill remains silent on the matter. Is it conceivable that the terms of reference could ever be drafted under Clause 1(5) without specifying a responsibility?</p>

<a name="100310-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="10031069000071"></a>My party does not favour this Council for Financial Stability, as was made plain at Second Reading. We will come to that later. For the present, the Bill represents the Government's decision to create this new council and our task in Committee is to make sure that, however ill conceived it is, the drafting at least deals with very important issues of substance which have been around for a long time and have been ducked. I beg to move.</p>

Will the Minister kindly explain why the usual channels have not at least got together to see if there is a consensus on any parts of the Bill, so that they can go on the statute book? Why is he asking the Committee to bother looking at the Bill, knowing very well that there is no chance whatever of it appearing on the statute book?</p>

At one level it is highly amusing that we are wasting all our time today and on Monday debating the first few clauses of a Bill that is likely to collapse during the wash-up. However, there are, for example, 100 members of staff currently employed by the FSA who have been told that their employment will be transferred on 1 April to the new financial information body. They have been told this by the Treasury. They are now in considerable confusion as to what will happen to them. I took this, when I heard about it, to mean that

<a name="100310-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="10031069000074"></a>However, that is by no means clear, which is one reason why I support the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. It would be extremely helpful at this stage if we knew which parts of the Bill the Conservative Party will allow to go through wash-up and which parts it will kill. If we knew that, we would not waste our time debating the parts that will be killed, but we could at least attempt to improve those bits of the Bill which might survive.</p>

<a name="100310-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="10031069000075"></a>Moving on to the first group of amendments, it seems that the answer to the question posed by the noble Baroness about who is in charge is blatantly clear. The Chancellor is in charge. Whether the Bill is enacted in this form or with the noble Baroness's amendments, that is the fact. There is no real ambiguity about who calls the shots when things get difficult.</p>

<a name="100310-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="10031069000076"></a>My other problem with these amendments is that they seem to stem from what is, I think, a misunderstanding of the role of the Council for Financial Stability. It is not an executive body. It is a co-ordinating body. The Bank of England is not an arm of government in the same way that a department of state is. It is established under its own legislation. Although the Chancellor calls the shots, the Governor of the Bank of England has a statutory degree of independence, as does the head of the FSA. The principle established in the Bill codifies what already exists-namely that the three bodies which, between them, are responsible for financial stability meet under the chairmanship of the Chancellor and co-ordinate action. They all do what they do. The council does not have a staff of its own that will scurry around implementing things. The Government go away and implement those decisions that relate to them and the head of the FSA does the same for the FSA. Therefore, it seems to me that the phraseology in Clause 1(3) about reviewing and co-ordinating accurately reflects what the council is supposed to do.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Newby, has just put a torpedo straight into the whole central purpose of this Bill, because he has described this cornerstone of the Government's plan-the Council for Financial Stability-as being nothing more than a talking shop. It is there to co-ordinate. We do not need this elaborate structure in order to achieve the things that he is talking about. The issue is that we are trying to look at this problem while the storm is still raging, and we are too close to the events to be able to judge them dispassionately and to be able to see the light and shade in them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="10031069000079"></a>One of the lessons that could be drawn from the early part of the crisis-a crisis which is still continuing, as my noble friend has said-is that it was not clear what powers were available, who they were available to, whether and to what extent they were used, and how they interlinked. As I understood from what the Minister said in his Second Reading speech, the plan was for this new council to provide the overarch to this, and therefore this was the keystone, or cornerstone, of the new regulatory arch in the Government's vision.</p>

<a name="100310-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="10031069000080"></a>We all had concerns about the lack of consultation; several noble Lords from both sides of the Chamber raised this issue. Some of us pointed out that the Financial Services and Markets Act had been rushed in, and the lack of consultation about that had perhaps led to some weaknesses which were later discovered. We wondered whether the rush on this occasion might lead to similar mistakes being made. But, never mind: the Government were determined to bring this forward. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, has questioned the relevance of so doing, but they have done so. They have taken the Council for Financial Stability as the key body.</p>

<p><a name="10031069000222"></a>This is currently, at best, a divided command, and at worst-as the noble Lord, Lord Newby said-a talking shop. I therefore think my noble friend's amendment is entirely relevant to our debates.</p>

It went to wash-up, and lack of experience on my part definitely meant that I was not as clear-cut as I should have been on what I was trying to achieve in the discussion of the wash-up arrangements. We ended up leaving the situation with banks that could call themselves banks, and small banks which could only call themselves banks if they were based abroad. The ones in the UK were licensed deposit takers. It was because all this was done at great speed and with great complexity that we ended up with a system which did not work. We need to bear in mind the lessons from previous occasions of this kind.</p>

The Bill as drafted by the Government is extremely difficult to understand because it is full of statements about what people are expected to do and who should have responsibility for what. When I first looked through the Bill, I asked myself: could I readily determine how the behaviour of the parties concerned, if the Bill was enacted, would differ from their behaviour until now? I found that question difficult to answer. I tried to draw a grid to see who was losing functions and who was gaining them as a result of the Bill. I confess that

I did not take part precisely for the reason put to your Lordships by my noble friend Lord Barnett-namely, that it did not remotely seem to me that the Bill could go anywhere, and that therefore I should wait until we had won the election and could then reintroduce it. I am still very puzzled as to why we are putting in all this effort at this time-especially as my reading of the Bill is that it is an integrated whole. Rightly or wrongly, it is a Bill which fits together and therefore I am alarmed at the idea that any bit of it might be dealt with in the wash-up. It is the last thing that is needed.</p>

I think that she referred to the Bank of England as a quango. She is entirely right, but it had never occurred to me that the Bank of England should be spoken of in that way-indeed, I regard that as extraordinarily disrespectful. I am also worried because, given the Opposition's commitment to abolishing quangos, if by some mischance they got elected, the Bank of England might be top of their list.

I certainly understand the frustration of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, and, as regards the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, it is absolutely clear that this part of the Bill is not something that we on this side of the House believe we should support. In particular when we come to later stages, it is absolutely clear that it was a mistake to take responsibility for what is now called macroprudential regulation-I am not absolutely clear what that means-away from the Bank of England. Far better that it should reside where it used to, particularly as much of this macroprudential regulation is involved to some extent with general macroeconomic management, where the FSA has no useful function to perform whatever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="10031069000092"></a>My noble friend is right to ask who is in charge. I worked for Unilever many years ago. It had a tripartite management board and no one was quite clear who was in charge. The crucial thing was to find out which of the three had the resignation letters of the other two in their right-hand drawer. In this context, it is fairly clear who is in charge: it is the Chancellor of the Exchequer. At the end of the day, he must be in charge since he is the one who is accountable to Parliament. If that is so, it is not clear what this amendment will significantly add. All it effectively says is that the structure is the same but this council will ensure they do their jobs properly. That is in essence what it seeks to do in legislative form. As I say, the structure itself is wrong and simply having a co-ordinating arrangement of this kind does not get us any further forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="10031069000093"></a>Finally, as far as the structure is concerned, what is the position with regard to officials? Presumably the council is going to have some form of secretariat. As far as the operational decisions are concerned, are the Bank of England, the FSA and the Treasury going to have their own staff who all then put up briefs saying what ought to be put to the council, or are there going to be independent people in the council seeking to co-ordinate the representations which come up from the three bodies?</p>

After all, this is a significant and divisive matter. There are disputes and disagreements between the parties. I simply do not know how they can be resolved in a way that this House will agree to. When he comes to reply, the noble Lord must give us some assurance that Parliament is to continue to have an oversight of whatever is to be agreed by the Front Benches. Too often when the Front Benches agree the legislation becomes bad. Particularly on the question of financial controls of the institutions and banks, we need legislation which is seen to be good and which will work.</p>

If Parliament had been more involved in the financial problems we have had, and in the run-up to them, the outcome might have been different-and better for this country. From now on, as we are clearly going to enter a new era, we must make sure that Parliament becomes far more powerful and watchful than it has been over the past years.

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="10031069000098"></a>Like other noble Lords, I express surprise that so much is made of the Council for Financial Stability, because this tripartite council seems to be exactly the same as the standing committee that it replaces. There is an awful lot of print to read but if you are saying that three people on a standing committee, which means that they meet regularly, are going to meet in another format to do precisely the same things, that seems to be no change at all. Furthermore, I understand that each of them may delegate their representative power to attend the council to anyone else in their organisation, so it may be that, busy though they all are, they may not meet together as the council that often.</p>

<a name="100310-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="10031069000099"></a>I was very surprised to hear the noble Lord, Lord Peston, express the view that the Bill is an integrated whole. To me, it seems to be a complete hotchpotch of scarcely related topics. First, there is the change of the standing committee to a tripartite council; then there is a large part about consumer education and the creation, even now, of another quango; then you have a section about strengthening the powers of the FSA; and then there is a part introducing to English law, for the first time, collective proceedings. That does not seem to sit very easily with the Bill because it represents a complete break with the past, which I think was the reason that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, decided to intervene at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="100310-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="10031069000100"></a>I also agree with my noble friend Lord Higgins that the Bill utterly fails to put the macro-prudential back together with the micro-prudential. Clearly, you cannot effectively be responsible for the macro-prudential if you have no ultimate power to control the micro-prudential as well.</p>

<a name="100310-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="10031069000101"></a>For those reasons, I support the amendments in the name of my noble friend Lady Noakes, which seek to include some clarity in the situation.</p>

My question arises from the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and relates to a matter that causes me some little concern. Although they may have changed, I understood that the conventions in the run-up to a general election-this certainly applied in my day-were that Ministers did not take decisions that would have an impact on a future Government and that looking to make major policy or expenditure decisions was discouraged.</p>

It deals with an issue of great concern in our country, and one on which there is a great division of opinion between the parties. I believe that the electorate will pass the baton to my party, which will wish to take this forward. Why are we wasting taxpayers' money and resources? What are Ministers doing?

When the Council for Financial Stability was first discussed, it did not impress MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, who variously described it as totally underwhelming or rearranging three deck chairs on the "Titanic". As other speakers have said, the reality is that the heads of the tripartite authorities have already met in a standing committee. The main change seems to be that some of their deliberations, although not the market-sensitive ones, will be made public. As the financial crisis broke, the system was found totally wanting, and I cannot be impressed with what I see as tinkering with a broken system. Unless there is more clarity on its role, I cannot see how this is a good step forward.</p>

As was pointed at Second Reading, by more than one speaker, the tripartite system has not worked, and that was before it was torpedoed by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. I find it inconceivable that the Government, having produced a system which has failed so obviously and so dismally, should persevere with it. It is all very well trying to blame the worldwide banking crisis for the problems experienced by this country's financial sector-certainly events outside this country have played their part-but the blame for not seeing what was coming, for not having a regulatory system better able to understand banking and the market place and better able to cope with and foresee the problems which will inevitably occur from time to time, lies fairly and squarely with the tripartite arrangement set up by the Government. As the noble Lord, Lord Desai, reminded the House at Second Reading, no matter what you do, the system will have crises and cycles. Not all countries have suffered as badly as the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="10031069000106"></a>There is a saying that remarriage is a triumph of hope over experience and reinventing the tripartite system is an example not just of hope over experience, but of the most wildly misplaced optimism over experience. I am sure that during his very successful and distinguished career in business, a career of which anyone would be extremely proud, the Minister never divided into three the running of those companies in which he was involved. His Lordship would have run a mile rather than have an enterprise with three chief executives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="10031069000107"></a>Direct lines of authority are the choice of virtually every single organisation of any sort, everywhere in the world. There is a reason for this. That structure is used because, over the centuries, people have worked out that it is the most effective way for their affairs to be managed. That does not mean that you cannot have checks and balances, but such checks and balances do not mean dividing authority. It is beyond me why, when there is a matter as important as the British banking and financial system, there should suddenly be a departure from a proven and sensible method of managing things. I look forward to hearing from the Minister how it is possible to justify compounding failure in the way suggested in this Bill and how he came to believe in the concept of dividing authority three ways when all his experience and the foundation for his success has been using the conventional method of a single authority.</p>

<a name="100310-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="10031069000108"></a>If one is stuck with having a tripartite system then the amendments tabled by my noble friend Lady Noakes will go some way towards correcting the inbuilt defects of the system. Rather sensibly, these amendments will have the effect of defining more closely the obligations and responsibility of each member of the authority. This is not a perfect solution; it is like putting a dressing on a wound when it would be better if the limb were amputated; but at least it may contribute towards reducing the weakness of the system if those involved have a clearer idea of their responsibilities and powers.</p>

<a name="100310-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="10031069000109"></a>Directing the relevant authorities to act in accordance with their powers and to specify their responsibilities will, I hope, tease out from the Minister how it is envisaged that the relevant authorities will work together, how they will relate to each other and who will do exactly what. It will be difficult when dealing with such a complex subject where there will be overlapping areas of authority and grey areas where there is no authority, but that is the inherent weakness of the system. Doubtless, if the Minister is a true believer in the tripartite system, all will be revealed. I look forward to hearing his answers to the very good points made by my noble friend Lady Noakes.</p>

I disagree with him and with others who have asked a similar question. These are important measures. It is a good Bill that contains a number of important steps forward, such as consumer redress and steps to enlighten and inform shareholders on remuneration. I have today published guidelines for consultation on the publication of bank employees' remuneration. There are steps to provide a greater facility to control short selling and aggressive speculation, and the development of a new and empowered consumer education authority. These are all very important responses to the needs of our country and society, and the lessons that have emerged as a result of our experience of this global crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="10031069000125"></a>Amendment 1 would provide for the council to be able to direct each member of the tripartite authorities. This together with Amendment 20, which provides the Chancellor with the ultimate power to direct the council, represents a different model to that which is proposed in Clauses 1 to 4. To set the context of the debate, I remind the House of what we are proposing and why. In reforming financial markets, the Government took a considered analysis of the financial crisis and identified reforms that were needed to strengthen the financial system for the future. In evaluating the existing standing committee and the wider tripartite arrangements it was clear that, while many different institutional frameworks exist in different countries across the world, no one model of financial regulation was successful in fully insulating a country from the crisis.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="10031069000126"></a>The Government's position is that what the regulators do-their behaviours and the judgments they exercise-matters much more than the institutional framework within which they operate. However, we need an institutional framework which makes sense and has clarity. I fully agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, said about the need for clarity and structures and I shall address that point in a moment. Change to the institutional system-moving specific responsibilities from one body to another-will not by itself make any difference, other than to cause a significant disruption at a time when attention should surely be focused on practicable, workable improvements to regulatory performance and decision-making.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10031069000127"></a>The same institutional functions-central banks, financial regulators, finance and economic ministries-are central to the maintenance of financial stability in every major economy. The UK is no different in this respect. The Bank and the FSA, alongside the Treasury, have key but distinct roles in protecting the financial stability of this country, each within its own individual remit. The Government have concluded that the existing tripartite framework is the right model and remain committed to the approach of having a single independent financial services regulator in the form of the FSA. We should always remember the confusion that existed before the creation of the FSA, with multiple regulators and inconsistent rules and principles. The concept of a single regulator has proved to be absolutely critical to efficient regulation; we should not dispense with it lightly.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10031069000128"></a>"Who is in charge?", is the question put by the Treasury Select Committee to the Governor of the Bank of England. In his precise way, he quite correctly said, "What do you mean by who is in charge?". He meant, "In charge of what?". His answer was clear that there was an understanding of who was in charge of each approach. This issue was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, by the noble Baroness in her speech in support of the amendments and, in particular, by the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, who questioned whether one would ever support one organisation with three CEOs. I agree that that would be a highly unusual structure; it is not one that I have ever attempted to date in my business career. However, this is not a single organisation: it is a co-ordinating body for three separate organisations, each of which has a clear role and each of which has a CEO or someone in charge.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10031069000129"></a>Let me recap. The FSA as an independent financial regulator is responsible for authorising and supervising financial firms and markets. It triggers the special resolution regime. The Bank of England, of which I and the noble Baroness have served as members of court, is an independent central bank and is responsible for providing liquidity assistance to the banking system. It has oversight of the interbank payment system and it is the resolution authority under the special resolution regime. The Treasury, as the UK's finance and economics ministry, is responsible for the overall institutional structure of financial regulation and the legislation that governs it. It is ultimately accountable to Parliament and responsible for decisions that have an impact on public finances, which I think answers the question that my noble friend Lord Stoddart of Swindon raised. The Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority are also accountable to Parliament and can be, and are, called to give evidence in this respect to the Treasury Select Committee. Their annual reports are also subject to parliamentary and other scrutiny.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="10031069000130"></a>The key point is that these three entities, each of which has clear responsibility, are appropriately aligned and co-ordinated through the co-operative process proposed by the Council for Financial Stability. The council will be chaired by the Chancellor, who is ultimately accountable to Parliament and the taxpayer, but the council is not an executive body, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, observed. There will be no votes. The council will have secretarial support, which will be provided by the Treasury. Over time, it might be concluded that it requires its own secretariat, but we have had two meetings of the council in shadow form to date which have worked rather well in accordance with the terms of reference and with secretarial support provided by the Treasury in the preparation of the minutes. The papers presented to the council come from the Bank of England, the FSA and the Treasury, depending on the specific subject being addressed.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="10031069000131"></a>When it comes to clarity of how the model will work and who is in charge, we have clear answers; I do not believe that the Opposition have clear answers. They need to explain who in their model will be in charge. Will it be the Governor of the Bank of England? Will it be the Chancellor of the Exchequer? Simply proposing to move around the deckchairs by getting rid of the FSA and transferring its powers to the Bank of England, a step which fundamentally misunderstands the competency, structure and culture of the Bank of England, achieves no good purpose and certainly does not answer the question of who is in charge. If one achieves this move, I do not think that anyone believes for one moment that the current or any future Governor of the Bank of England would perform the role currently carried out by the chief executive of the Financial Services Authority. That role would still need to be performed. There is clarity under the current model as to who is in charge and what they are in charge of. If noble Lords reflect on what I say, I hope that they conclude that I have answered some of the doubts that they may have in this respect.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="10031069000132"></a>The Government believe that the co-operative framework can be enhanced, however, through a more formal structure, with regular meetings, greater transparency over proceedings and clear lines of

This, I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Stewartby, is where the Council for Financial Stability represents a further step forward in the tripartite process. There will be more formality around the agenda for the quarterly meetings; there will be publication of minutes, which will provide additional transparency; and those minutes will allow for accountable and attributable comments to be reported, so that if there is a disagreement of emphasis it will be faithfully reported in the minutes. The Council for Financial Stability will also receive, after their publication-I emphasise that; I shall explain why in a moment-the reports which the Bank of England and the FSA publish on financial stability and financial risk assessment. We will debate those reports and will note any actions or views that they have in terms of mitigation required in response to an emerging risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="10031069000133"></a>I emphasise that it is after the publication of the report because by ensuring that process is followed we do not fetter the independence of the Bank of England or the FSA to publish their own assessments of risk in the system and potential risks to stability in the future. Likewise, the Treasury will produce an annual report on the Council for Financial Stability which will review the operations of the council. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Stewartby, that this is a significant step forward in terms of transparency. It will ensure that if there are ever differences of opinion-and let us be frank, there will be circumstances in which the central bank might reach a different assessment of risk from the regulator or from the Treasury-they become public knowledge and become available for public discussion. I think that represents quite a material step forward.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="10031069000134"></a>I refer here to the quarterly meetings. There will be other meetings in between which deal with specific issues relating to individual corporations or sectors. These will not be subject to normal public minuting because of the confidentiality involved. The noble Baroness will be tabling amendments in due course relating to some of those provisions. However, the annual report will, to the extent that it is possible, ensure that we also have public insight into the matters that are discussed in the non-standard meetings. For the time being we are having meetings on a monthly basis and we have had two already in shadow form: one of which was a quarterly strategic meeting, if you like, and the other was a more regular monthly meeting. We have published the minutes. They did not receive a great deal of attention, but they actually were quite thorough and quite detailed and gave a very clear indication of what was discussed at the council.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="10031069000135"></a>The council will comprise the Chancellor as chair, the Governor of the Bank of England and the chairman of the FSA. As necessary it will be able to draw on external expertise. There is a facility where experts can be invited to come and present or give advice to the council and if the governor and the chairman of the FSA or the Chancellor are not available they can nominate deputies to attend. By ensuring that the date of meetings, particularly of the critical quarterly meetings, are set well in advance one would reasonably expect to have very high and consistent attendance.</p>

It will deal with both immediate and operational issues and longer-term strategic issues. It is essentially a forum to bring together leaders of authorities responsible for financial stability and enable them to monitor emerging risks, analyse assessments of those risks and co-ordinate appropriate responses without encroaching on independence. The council will do this in partnership. The Bank of England is the independent central bank. The FSA is the independent regulator. The proposals are not about the council or the Chancellor having direct authority over other members. They are about a mature partnership. I am therefore unable to accept the noble Baroness's amendment because it essentially addresses a very different model from the one which we have in mind.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="10031069000137"></a>Amendment 20 ploughs a similar furrow to Amendment 1. This time the amendment aims to make clear that where the council cannot reach agreement, the Chancellor is "in charge". This allied with Amendment 1 will provide the Chancellor with ultimate executive authority for financial stability and authority over the Bank and the Financial Services Authority. This is a very major step, and I really wonder whether the Conservative Party is minded to seek to exercise such authority over the Governor of the Bank of England. When I read comments from Mr Osborne about interest rates, I think that the Conservative Party is straying dangerously towards saying that it intends to take power away from the Bank of England or begin to direct it in respect of interest rates. I see shaking of heads from the opposition Front Bench; I am delighted to see that that is the case, as it would be a very dangerous move for the Conservative Party to contemplate. Certainly, it would not be consistent with the model that we propose for the Council for Financial Stability for the Chancellor to have the power to take ultimate executive decisions in respect of the FSA and the Bank of England.</p>

My noble friend Lord Higgins made the point as to how it will differ from what we have had before, and a number of other speeches have been made about that.

I became a Minister in the Treasury in October 2008 and it seemed to me that the tripartite was in almost constant session for the next four months. I am not aware of the frequency of meetings before, but there is also provision for meetings of deputies, at which routine matters are conducted. I know that the Chancellor of the day and his predecessor had very regular meetings with the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Sir Howard Davies, and with Mr Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="10031069000140"></a>As I said, Amendment 20 ploughs a similar furrow to Amendment 1. It proposes an approach that the Government do not support. The model of the council is that of an effective forum for monitoring risk and co-ordinating a shared response. It is a model that has operated effectively during the crisis but the Government recognise that it can be improved upon. That is why the proposals are brought before the Committee today. I cannot support the noble Baroness in her amendment.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10031069000141"></a>Amendment 21 will provide further elements for the model for the council that the noble Baroness has put before the Committee in her amendments. The clause would give teeth to the decisions of the council and provide that the authorities should comply with these decisions. This amendment, coupled with Amendments 1 and 20, would effectively constrain the discretion of the Bank and the FSA as to how they perform their functions, as conferred on them by Parliament. That is why I continue to ask whether the Conservative Party is minded-even if not in the area of monetary policy-to seek to take powers away from the FSA or the Bank of England. Perhaps the noble Baroness will answer that point in her closing speech. Such an approach would be likely to be detrimental to the performance of those functions, because the Bank and the FSA would always be at risk of being second-guessed by the council and, ultimately, the Chancellor. I do not consider either of those outcomes to be desirable or consistent with the model that I seek to articulate. As I set out previously, in discussing Amendments 1 and 20, this is not the model that the Government are proposing. Our intention is that the council monitors and co-ordinates in a spirit of partnership, and that the members of the council take action as agreed between the parties. That action would not be driven by a statutory requirement but would be done on the basis of a co-ordinated and agreed approach. I cannot support the noble Baroness in her proposed new clause.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="10031069000142"></a>I turn to Amendment 5. The draft of the statement provided for by Clause 1(5)-the council's terms of reference-is available on the Treasury website. It provides an overview of the authorities' financial stability responsibilities. This is intended to contextualise the detail on the council's objectives and procedures. The statement also sets out that the authorities intend to revise the Memorandum of Understanding between the authorities.</p>

<a name="100310-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10031069000143"></a>The MoU between the Bank of England, FSA and Treasury was first agreed between the authorities in 1997, and updated in 2006. It sets out the roles of each authority and how they work together to pursue financial stability. The Government made clear in another place that, as suggested in the draft terms of reference, the MoU would be updated with consolidated details of each authority's role for financial stability. The Government recognise that this approach has not swayed the views of the House and that there is still a desire for the detail on roles and responsibilities to be included in the terms of reference. On this basis the Government are willing to accept opposition Amendment 5 and include the necessary detail in the statement produced under Clause 1(5).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="10031069000144"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, referred to the fact that "the storm is still breaking". That is not how I see things. We must not be complacent

We have undoubtedly moved back to a position where the financial system and systemically important institutions are in a much stronger position in terms of funding, liquidity and capital than was the case. There is still scope to secure further improvement. I have answered the question of the noble Lord, Lord Stewartby, about where this council will be different from the previous arrangement. The difference will be in the transparency, the public minuting, the attribution of comments, the formal and open review of risk and the publication of an annual report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="10031069000145"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked about macro-prudential regulation. This is a very new concept to address an old problem. It is sometimes summarised in the press as taking away the punchbowl before the party has gone out of control or leaning against the wind. It will need a globally co-ordinated approach. It is high on the agenda for the G20 and the IMF. It raises some questions about whether monetary policy that targets consumer or retail inflation is necessarily appropriate as an instrument to address asset inflation, which was clearly at the heart of the crisis. Mr Greenspan has been very clear that this is something that was missed by the Federal Reserve. I am sure that other central bankers share a concern that they have yet to find the answer to that.</p>

<a name="100310-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="10031069000146"></a>I do not, however, agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, that you cannot support macro-regulation and supervision without also being responsible for the micro. They are very different. Micro is about the regulation of individual institutions and judgments about their capital adequacy, the competence of the management and the sustainability and achievability of their business plans. Systemic risk is where the micros of individual institutions come together. Macro is about the broader economic context. You cannot establish macro policy without micro awareness. Nor can you have good micro-regulation focus, particularly on interconnectivity and complexity, if you do not also have macro awareness. The Council for Financial Stability will provide that overarching co-ordination. Under our structure, it is not necessary for micro and macro to be performed necessarily by the same bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="10031069000147"></a>My noble friend Lord Stoddart of Swindon asked whether Parliament will have a role in scrutinising the results of the wash-up. As the Committee knows, I am still relatively inexperienced-I think I am now right at the borderline of being able to use that as an excuse for not being quick enough on my feet in saying the right things. There are a number of things in Parliament that I have yet to experience, although I am looking forward with great excitement to the experience and joy of being re-elected to government in the next couple of months. But that is some time off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="10031069000150"></a>I was going to say that I have even less experience of wash-up; in fact, it meant something very different to me until about a month ago when I began to hear the term being used. As I understand it, wash-up requires all Bills to go through their remaining stages in each House and therefore to be subject to whatever scrutiny Parliament is able to provide. At a certain point the usual channels will then address the issue of what is to be done with Bills that have not completed their full parliamentary process, but I suspect that almost everyone in the House knows more about the practice of wash-up than I do.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="10031069000235"></a>"In this Part of this Schedule 'the relevant costs' means ... the expenses incurred by the Authority in establishing the consumer financial education body",</p>

They know where they operate with their independent executive authority and where they co-ordinate their actions through the tripartite organisation or through the new Council for Financial Stability. Nothing in the noble Baroness's proposals would in any way lead to a superior response in a situation such as that of Northern Rock.</p>

<a name="100310-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="10031069000161"></a>I listened very carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Howard, said about the need for executive clarity and the avoidance of any confusion about lines of authority and accountability. Our structure delivers precisely that, whereas I believe that the noble Baroness's amendments, as I have suggested, obfuscate and confuse. They grant executive authorities and powers that the Council for Financial Stability is not designed to exercise.</p>

There is a kind of Alice in Wonderland feel to this debate. However, I am very surprised that the Minister does not know on how many occasions the tripartite group got together prior to the crisis. After all, that structure was put in place by the Prime Minister as Chancellor, and I suspect that the role that this Bill has to play is that of a fig leaf for the Prime Minister.</p>

I listened to his explanation of why my noble friend's amendments should not be accepted-it was very much based on the idea that those three parties working together and co-ordinating is essential to the proper conduct of affairs. If that is the Government's position, one is left to conclude that it is an open acknowledgement by the Government that they took their eye off the ball when they were not meeting as a tripartite group at principal level in the run-up to the crisis.</p>

<a name="100310-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="10031069000164"></a>My anxiety concerns the question of why setting up a formal structure-with all of the costs, paraphernalia, stationery and everything else-would make any difference. It was perfectly apparent at the time of the Northern Rock crisis that the Government were, as my noble friend said, at sixes and sevens, and that it was unclear who was in charge. The Treasury was forced to take control. I remember at the time that the governor's line was all about moral hazard, and we had great debates in this House about whether the governor was right to refuse the bid that was then made by Lloyds TSB to deal with Northern Rock. So, without going back over all that ground, it seems that the Minister is simply replicating a structure which failed and assuring us that by having some kind of formal structure it will be different. That is one point.</p>

<a name="100310-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="10031069000165"></a>My second point is that I am totally confused now about what the Minister said in response to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. Is he saying that no expenditure has been incurred and nothing has been done to pre-empt this legislation by the FSA or any other body-that nothing is being changed in anticipation of the Bill becoming law? If that is the case, can he state it clearly? I have not got the sharp eyes of my noble friend Lord Eccles, and I had not seen that clause. If not, is the Minister saying that this expenditure will be covered because there is a provision in the Bill which he hopes will be carried forward in the wash-up? We should know.</p>

<a name="100310-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="10031069000166"></a>Also-and I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, is correct-if there are people in the FSA who are being told their jobs are changing or may be at risk on the basis of the Bill getting on the statute book, that is called forward planning and I fear for the planning of the FSA. Can no one in the FSA see what the noble Lords, Lord Barnett and Lord Peston, see, that the Bill has no possibility of reaching the statute book as it exists? It would be very foolish indeed to make forward planning on the basis of what might happen to the Bill, and what might happen after 6 May.</p>

The number of meetings attended by principals may well have been two; the noble Lord advises me that that is the case and I have no reason to believe it is not. Perhaps it is not altogether surprising: it was during a period of extraordinary growth. The Governor of the Bank of England described it as the "nice" decade-non-inflationary consistent expansion. The deputies-that is the deputy governor, the chief executive and the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury; senior people leading their organisations-did meet very regularly.

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="10031069000168"></a>In answer to the question from the noble Lord, Lord Newby, about expense being incurred, I think I am on solid ground in saying that no material expense has been incurred in anticipation of legislation being passed. It is of course necessary for these bodies to contemplate a piece of legislation that is going through Parliament, and to plan for what that legislation would mean. It is an entirely good thing to communicate to the people involved in consumer affairs in the FSA, for instance, that if this Bill is passed this is what will happen, and it would be atrocious not to respect people by sharing that with them. However, no commitments have been made, no legal agreements entered into, no new leases written, software commissioned or computer boxes acquired in anticipation of this legislation. I do not even think we have printed any special paper for the minutes of the CFS meetings. This is a very low-cost response to an enhanced superior product.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="10031069000171"></a>The world experienced financial system structural failure. We have to learn the lessons, but we also have to ask how we can make the system work better. We published our reflections on the crisis and concluded that the structure that is embodied in the tripartite approach is fundamentally sound. Based on my experience of working for an organisation that was regulated by the FSA, of being on the board of one of the predecessor bodies of the FSA and of being a member of the Court of the Bank of England, the idea of giving the Bank of England responsibility for micro-regulation-as the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, would describe it-for 15,000 or so regulatory bodies, from the Tolpuddle building society or an independent financial adviser to the largest bank or insurance company, is a preposterous proposal. It is born out of the youthful enthusiasm of a shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer who has zero business experience. We need to get on with considering this legislation. I look forward to hearing the noble Baroness's response to my comments and those of the Committee on her amendments.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, said that Parliament would be dissolved shortly after Easter. This is the first time that I have heard this from the Benches opposite. Perhaps the Minister will confirm whether Parliament will be dissolved immediately after Easter, as his noble friend Lord Barnett suggested. Can the Minister help on that?</p>

We do not know for how many days we will be processing business. We, as the House of Lords, have to carry on as if the Bill will have the normal process of Committee, Report and Third Reading. That is what we seek to do. We cannot possibly work on any basis other than that a Bill that the Government choose to put before the House will be considered in the normal way. Noble Lords might want to anticipate both the timing of the election and the nature of the decisions that will be made by the parties in dealing with legislation that has not completed its passage before then, but it is not an appropriate topic for this Committee to debate. We have to take the Bill as we find it and scrutinise it in the way that we normally undertake our work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10031069000177"></a>It is of course disturbing, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, pointed out, that arrangements are apparently being made within the FSA as if the Bill will receive Royal Assent by 1 April. The Minister shakes his head, but I, too, have heard what the noble Lord, Lord Newby, appears to have heard about the preparations being made with a specific date in mind; it is more than a mere planning assumption. Indeed, they are incurring expenditure on recruiting somebody to head the new consumer financial education body. It has been clear for some time that this Bill could not receive Royal Assent by 1 April by any stretch of the imagination. So that clearly raises some questions which need to be answered, and I hope that at some point we will get proper answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10031069000182"></a>The heart of our debate is about the new Council for Financial Stability and whether that has any meaning at all. I tabled my amendments to probe whether this new body would have any impact on the real world. Clearly, a body which simply comes together to monitor and to co-ordinate is no different to what happened before-no different to the tripartite authorities. The Minister said, in response to the question of my noble friend Lord Stewartby about how it would behave differently, that there would be transparency and minutes. That has nothing to do with behaving differently at all. If this body does not have any powers, if it is a non-executive body where people come together to talk-a "talking shop", as my noble friend Lord Hodgson said-this Bill will not make any difference.</p>

<a name="100310-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="10031069000183"></a>My noble friend Lord Higgins said that, if this is just the tripartite authorities, then it is not worthwhile. That, in effect, is the critique we have of this part of the Bill. There is no significant difference from what existed before, other than fancy new titles and some structure around minutes. There is no improvement being made in the arrangements within Government, the FSA and the Bank of England. I remind noble Lords that the tripartite arrangements did fail, and since there is nothing evident about how they will operate differently in the future, there is no reason to believe that those arrangements will do any better when they deal with issues at a later stage.</p>

To my certain knowledge, not a single economist of any standing in the whole world predicted what happened in 2007. It is not in the least surprising, therefore, that the decision-makers in this country were somewhat taken aback. To the extent that they did not work optimally, it was not remotely because of the tripartite arrangements; it was to do with the fact that the event was a staggering event which, for the moment, some of us still do not fully understand. So I do not think the position of the noble Baroness has any logic or basis whatsoever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="10031069000188"></a>Some of the sources of what we had to cope with came from a shock from outside the UK, but the way that we dealt with it impacted hugely as a result of the way that arrangements had been set up by the current Prime Minister from 1997 onwards. That is the fundamental position of my party. My noble friends Lord Hodgson, Lord Stewartby, Lord Higgins, Lord Trenchard, Lord Forsyth, Lord Northbrook and Lord Howard approached this in much the same way. We cannot see what is in this new Council for Financial Stability. It does not appear to do anything to solve anything from the past. It does not represent an advance. It leaves many questions completely unanswered, as I said in my opening remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10031069000194"></a>The main point of these amendments is to discuss the whole question of being too big to fail. That means that I will address the question of Glass-Steagall, but I should like to take the debate rather wider than only talking about divorcing the clearing banks from their investment banks. I am sorry that I missed the Second Reading debate on 23 February when that topic was covered extensively, but I was abroad in the Far East.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10031069000195"></a>The amendments call for a report to be drawn up by the Council for Financial Stability. It is important to emphasise that. We are only asking for a report and are not saying that these things should be implemented. As this is an extremely controversial subject and opinions are very divided on what we should do about financial organisations that are too big to fail, a report is very necessary and I hope that, prior to the report, there will be opportunities for people with strong views on this to give evidence to the Council for Financial Stability and make their points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10031069000196"></a>I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Desai, is no longer in his place because during the Second Reading he described himself as "a Hayekian libertarian", which just about describes where I come from. I am a pretty ardent capitalist. I do not really mind how much money people make and do not worry too much if they pay themselves bonuses. I start to break with that when the taxpayer has to pick up the tab when it all goes wrong. There is much bitterness at the moment about the way that the City is behaving. Bankers are unpopular people. The view of people in this country is that they gambled, made a wrong call and now the taxpayer is left to pick up the tab.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10031069000197"></a>This financial crisis has brought down many viable businesses. It has led to repossession of people's homes and unemployment, and created great personal distress. Many of those who have survived have done so by taking pay cuts and working shorter hours. These people see the bankers who have failed being bailed out. For them, life goes on. They still earn enormous sums and pay themselves vast bonuses as well. A good example of this is the recent result from Northern Rock. It has clocked up serious losses but they have not stopped the employees paying themselves bonuses. If you get bonuses when your company is losing money, how much bigger must the bonuses be when your company is making it? That does not add up for most people.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="10031069000198"></a>What lessons have been learned from this? I think precious few, to judge from where the Government stand on all this. There is an extraordinary reluctance to look at bringing in the spirit of Glass-Steagall and separate those aspects of banking that involve taking significant risk from the more conventional form of banking that involves taking deposits and making loans. I know that things can never be that simple. Banks that lend mortgages and so forth often use financial instruments to offset their liabilities.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10031069000199"></a>What if we do not address this? To come back to a remark made in Second Reading by the noble Lord, Lord Desai, on 23 February, we have these cycles and there will be future financial crises. We must not think that this is the be-all and end-all of financial crises; there will be others. The normal evidence of financial  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_272"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column 272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>crises is that each is worse than the last. When you come to assess the financial damage you can normally add another two noughts to the end. Surely we must entertain the idea that the separation and breaking up of large organisations may be a way forward. This needs study and we need to carefully weigh up the consequences of going down that road. I totally accept that we must ensure that the western world moves together on this. We cannot see London being asked to unilaterally take measures if this is not copied by other financial centres in the world, otherwise businesses will merely move from our city to places with more favourable regimes of taxation and regulation.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10031069000200"></a>Critics of Glass-Steagall always argue that it would have done nothing for Northern Rock or Lehman Brothers. That argument has to be right but I do not regard it as much more than a debating point. It has to be true: Northern Rock did not have an investment banking arm and Lehman Brothers did not have a retail bank. Even if Glass-Steagall had been operating at that point it would not have affected either of those spectacular bankruptcies. Yet let us be honest: Northern Rock had a completely indefensible and unsustainable business plan. It borrowed overnight money and leant it in 20-year mortgages, often lending more than the value of the property on which it was secured. As has been pointed out by my noble friend Lady Noakes, the tripartite system completely failed.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10031069000201"></a>Many months ago on a Question in this House, I asked the noble Lord, Lord Myners, what was happening to the bank supervisors. He assured me that all the people who used to carry out bank supervision in the Bank of England had been transferred to the FSA. Therefore, in a way, nothing had really changed: the people were still there and life carried on. However, we have to ask what they got up to, what they spent their time doing and what form of inspection they made of Northern Rock. Did they ask any serious questions about how sustainable this way of doing business was or did they all fall asleep? One wonders what on earth happened. There is no doubt that, if there had been early intervention in Northern Rock, its bankruptcy might well have been prevented. Therefore, some very serious questions need to be answered regarding why Northern Rock was allowed to carry on in the way that it did for quite as long as it did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10031069000202"></a>Let us look at Lehman Brothers. Although the company was forced into liquidation, it is generally accepted that it was too big to fail. The collateral damage suffered as a result of Lehman Brothers going down was much too great. I think that if the United States Administration relived that time, they would bail out Lehman Brothers as well. However, if Lehman Brothers was too big to fail two or three years ago, how about Goldman Sachs today? Of course, as there is no Glass-Steagall in the United States as we speak, Goldman Sachs would currently be bailed out anyway because it has a retail banking side to the business and depositors would obviously have to be protected. However, I argue that, even if you separate the retail banking side from Goldman Sachs, you are still left with a financial organisation that is too big to fail. Everyone might say that the idea of Goldman Sachs going down

So far as I can see, that seems to be pretty speculative business.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10031069000203"></a>Therefore, the rationale is that we have to break up organisations that are too big to fail and form them into smaller bits which are small enough to fail. If we do not do that, we will find ourselves back in this whole situation all over again. Contrary to the view of people who defend enormous organisations, very often smaller units produce greater returns to shareholders than large ones. I have no doubt that Goldman Sachs, which is a partnership, would make even more money if it operated as a number of smaller businesses rather than the very large one that it is today. It must be right to try to get our financial organisations into a position where they are small enough to fail so that we do not constantly have to look to the taxpayer to bail them out when things go wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="10031069000204"></a>If we do not want to destroy the capitalist system, we must change the structures to minimise the risk of taxpayers being called on to bail out businesses. The noble Lord, Lord Myners, has made himself a fortune as a freewheeling capitalist in the City of London. That capitalism, which has enriched the noble Lord, must be preserved because, if it goes through periodic bouts of nationalisation, it certainly will not survive. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="10031069000206"></a>The Committee will be aware that from the start we on these Benches have been grappling with that issue and have been very sympathetic to the concept of breaking up the banks or separating the utility functions and the more risky functions. Therefore, I was extremely pleased when a succession of noble Lords with a tremendous amount of experience in the City discussed both the in-principle arguments for breaking up the banks and the feasibility of doing so. When this issue is being debated, one of the main arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Myners, and the Government is that it cannot be done and that it is all too complicated because the banks are all integrated and you cannot split them without the whole system collapsing. When we discussed this at Second Reading, the argument was not about that but it was between the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, who argued that you had to split them formally, and the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, who said that you could achieve the same principle by having two or more subsidiaries within the same holding company.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10031069000207"></a>It seems to us that all those issues are vital in determining the future of the banking system in this country. With the current Government, there is no appetite to discuss these issues. Therefore, it seems to us that to have in the Bill a requirement that these

Therefore, we support the amendment.</p>

Perhaps the Minister will let us know whether he disagrees with that view. If so, we can take an appropriate bet on the proceeds, in the spirit of general financial participation. Be that as it may.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="10031069000209"></a>Although it may seem pointless debating this matter, given that it is not likely to reach the statute book, there is a case for debating the points raised by my noble friend in moving his amendment. I am among those who did not speak at Second Reading. I think we should put a limit on how many times a week one speaks in your Lordships' House. None the less, I am glad to have an opportunity to take up the points which my noble friend made with regard to Glass-Steagall and to the phrase "too big to fail". Of course, the two are related.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="10031069000210"></a>In the Second Reading debate, my noble friend Lord Lawson set out all the arguments in favour of Glass-Steagall and he came down strongly in favour of some such replication in our system in the UK for the future. In reply, the Minister said that he was not persuaded by my noble friend Lord Lawson but that if he were to be persuaded by anyone, it would be my noble friend. The case put by my noble friend is very strong indeed on the question of dividing the less risky part of our banking system from the very risky part. These matters were put forward in a remarkable article by Mr Paul Volcker in the <I>New York Times</I> on 31 January and it is very important that people read it. He deals with the matter of being too big to fail. He says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="10031069000239"></a>"The phrase 'too big to fail' has entered into our everyday vocabulary. It carries the implication that really large, complex and highly interconnected financial institutions can count on public support at critical times. The sense of public outrage over seemingly unfair treatment is palpable. Beyond the emotion, the result is to provide those institutions with a competitive advantage in their financing, in their size and in their ability to take and absorb risks".</p>

<p><a name="10031069000227"></a>He then comes up with some specific proposals about how the problem might be dealt with in regard to those banks which are thought to be too big to fail. Quite apart from the usual provisions and suggestions with regard to liquidity ratios and so on, he makes the point that perhaps one should have some form of a new resolution authority-he suggests it should be international, so it is relevant to today's debate-which would wind up in an orderly manner banks that were too big to fail. That is certainly worth considering in the international negotiations that are taking place.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10031069000211"></a>There are some important issues with which the next Government, of whatever party, will need to deal. But they are not dealt with at all in this Bill unless perhaps it is possible for the co-ordinating committee in some way to implement Glass-Stegall without relying on legislation. That does not seem very likely. These are far more important issues in many ways than the structure that we are considering with regard to regulation. It is helpful that my noble friend has raised these matters this afternoon.</p>

<a name="10031080000001"></a><b><a name="100310-0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="10031080000046"></a>Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</b> I, too, am attracted by my noble friend's amendments, especially Amendment 11, as it would permit a degree of analysis to take place. It is said that distance lends enchantment; whether distance from the crisis that we have just had will lend enchantment is probably not likely, but it will probably lend perspective and maybe some clarity. Therefore, while Amendment 11 is attractive, Amendment 2, which requires it to happen in the next six months, is a little precipitant. Nevertheless the principle behind Amendment 11 holds good.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="10031080000002"></a>I did not react to the Minister's comments about the crisis being over, but his officials might slip into his red box the leading article from today's <I>Financial Times</I>, as a number of things said in it are relevant to the debates that we had on both the first group and on this group of amendments. There are two relevant sentences in particular. First:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="10031080000040"></a>"What the recovery really shows is the scale of the moral hazard problem the world still faces".</p>

<p><a name="10031080000036"></a>That is the too big to fail issue that my noble friend raised. Secondly:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="10031080000041"></a>"The second is a resolution regime that would allow losses to fall where they should without bringing down the system. This would prevent creditors from sheltering behind vital functions, such as the payments system, in a crisis and thus pushing losses onto the taxpayer".</p>

<p><a name="10031080000037"></a>These are the thoughts that are emerging, and my noble friend's suggestion that we need an investigation and a report to reflect that seems entirely appropriate.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10031080000003"></a>It is not all at the macro level either. If the Minister leaves the grandeur of his Great George Street office, returns to the City and-I declared an interest on Second Reading-comes to me to try to find financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, he would say that the banks will say that there is money available for good propositions. I am sure that he says that in absolute good faith, but trying to find bank finance for such companies remains exceptionally difficult on two levels. First, the credit process has become immeasurably lengthy and complicated and the minefield though which small companies must travel is very complex. Sometimes when emerging from one minefield unhurt, another lies ahead, as further bells and whistles are put on to the requirements for permission. Along the way in this process, if it becomes clear that the company needs the money it causes huge alarms and excursions. The process is long, and in many cases small and medium-sized companies require a reasonably speedy resolution of their credit needs.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10031080000004"></a>So there are macro issues and micro issues which need to be considered. These could usefully be looked into and considered by a report of the sort that my noble friend has in mind. Certainly, if the Government, with or without wash-up or wash-out, are determined to proceed with this type of Bill, we need the facility to draw lessons from what has been going on. We are too close to the crisis now to be able to draw all those lessons. The sort of investigation and considered response that my noble friend has in mind under Amendment 11 seem to be entirely appropriate.</p>

I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to an interesting report prepared by the Congressional Research Service in 1987, which explored the cases for and against preserving the Glass-Steagall Act.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10031080000006"></a>The arguments for preserving Glass-Steagall, as written in 1987, are, first, that conflicts of interest characterise the granting of credit-lending-and the use of credit-investing-by the same entity, which led to the abuses that originally produced the Act. Secondly, depository institutions possess normal financial powers by virtue of their control of other people's money. Its extent must be limited to ensure soundness and competition in the market for funds-whether loans or investment. Thirdly, securities activities can be risky, leading to enormous losses, which could threaten the integrity of deposits. In turn, the US Government insure deposits and could be required to pay large sums if depository institutions were to collapse as a result of securities losses. Fourthly, depository institutions are supposed to be managed to limit risk. Their managers thus may not be conditioned to operate prudently in more speculative securities business. An example of that is the crash of real estate investment trusts sponsored by bank holding companies in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10031080000007"></a>The Congressional Research Service report continued with the arguments against preserving the Act. It said that, first, depository institutions will now operate in deregulated financial markets in which distinctions between loans, securities and deposits are not well drawn. They are losing market shares to securities firms that are not so strictly regulated and to foreign financial institutions operating without much restriction from the Act. Secondly, conflicts of interest can be prevented by enforcing legislation against them and by separating the lending and credit functions through forming distinctly separate subsidiaries of financial firms.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10031080000008"></a>Thirdly, the securities activities that depository institutions are seeking are both low risk by their very nature and would reduce the total risk of organisations offering them, by diversification. Lastly, in much of the rest of the world, depository institutions operate simultaneously and successfully in both banking and securities markets. Lessons learnt from their experience can be applied to our national financial structure and regulation.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10031080000009"></a>We have moved on 20 years since then. Sadly, I was abroad at Second Reading. I read the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, very carefully. I also noted the Minister's comments. He said that he was not,</p>
<ul><a name="10031080000042"></a>"persuaded that the issue of size was fundamental to failure, nor that the combination of utility, retail, commercial and investment banking activities in one organisation is in itself a cause of weakness".</ul>
<p><a name="10031080000038"></a>He preferred,</p>
<ul><a name="10031080000043"></a>"the combination of much more capital behind the riskier activities, much more stringent liquidity requirements and better governance".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/2/10; col. 1002.]</ul>
<p><a name="10031080000039"></a>Twenty years later some circumstances have changed, so I look forward to reading a report which is applicable to the UK.</p>

We are slightly barking up the wrong tree when we talk about "too big to fail". It seems to me that we are talking about "too big to manage" and that the shareholders are the ones who have got to be in the first instance more active in looking at their now virtually worthless investments. They should be asking whether these large organisations are too big and too complicated to manage, and could dissolve themselves out of existence.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="10031080000011"></a>There is a precedent for that. The conglomerates in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s all grew in such a way that they became so complicated that eventually the late Lord Hanson had to keep buying businesses in order to stop the bicycle from falling over. When the bicycle eventually did fall over and he failed to buy ICI, everything had to be dissolved, and it was dissolved in quite an orderly way.</p>

<a name="100310-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10031080000012"></a>In the Royal Bank of Scotland, Sir Fred Goodwin was showing signs of acting like Lord Hanson in that he had to keep buying to get bigger and bigger, and eventually the shareholders had to say enough is enough. That is happening now with the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is trying to get out of insurance and simplify itself. The route forward in the first instance must be for these large organisations to account to their shareholders for their activities, make them smaller and less complicated, and probably create shareholder value in the process.</p>

It has become apparent in recent years that not only large conglomerates but many financial companies and banks that have gone global have not necessarily always faced up to the different cultures and regulatory requirements in other countries. They have become physically too big to manage, and this is a dangerous area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10031080000014"></a>On the idea of splitting the banking system into two parts under some kind of revived Glass-Steagall, this issue will come to a head when regulatory authorities reach the stage where they will define and require higher capital to support racier activities. It is not an immediate issue but it will become critical. As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, mentioned, we discussed the practicalities of this at Second Reading. I was interested in what my noble friend Lord Blackwell said about having joint subsidiaries of a bank holding company, but I do not know whether that would give the security of separation that is needed in this situation. The issue of having a firewall between two separately managed businesses-which is basically what it would be-has not been addressed and I have yet to hear anyone make a convincing argument about how you could put a firewall between the two. This may come, but the timing of it will be influenced by the regulatory background and when the regulators reach the point where they have identified the levels of the capital backing needed in the separated part of the business which contains the more adventurous activities.</p>

It is quite clear that in the Royal Bank of Scotland, and in all other banks, the board has a definite responsibility for curbing the greed of people within the bank who want it to get bigger and bigger-and then it all fails. If a bank's board was doing its job properly, the management of the bank would be good. When it becomes poor, that is when the troubles we have seen, particularly in two Scottish banks, arise.</p>

The problem is not that banks fail; it is that they have to be rescued. This Bill allows for a living will, so we will not have to rescue banks like we did in the past. The Glass-Steagall discussion is not relevant to the Bill. No matter how large or how small banks are, and no matter what they do, they will not be rescued; they will have to make a living will; and the whole question of Glass-Steagall does not arise.</p>

Having worked for 27 years for two British banks and for two years for a Japanese-owned bank, I have some experience of that. In my experience, where separate subsidiaries conducting different businesses were incorporated under one holding company, it was actually extremely difficult to co-operate with the other co-owned part of your group. If I was working for the investment banking part of Kleinwort Benson, for example, I could work much better with the asset management division of SG Warburg than with Kleinwort Benson's own asset management division. The separation of investment banking and commercial banking businesses can be achieved under common ownership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10031080000018"></a>I agree that there must be much increased capital backing for the deposit-taking and retail business, and for the proprietary trading businesses which will take the margin out of it. I also welcome any opportunity to investigate whether structural changes are needed, which I have no doubt various institutions are doing all the time. However, I would hesitate to require any change in our structure in this country without securing agreement with other major countries with major financial markets. I worry that we anyway no longer have the power to do so as a result of the Government's having surrendered to the three new European super-regulators our ability to set regulatory policy. However, even if we had such authority, we would be very foolish to proceed in that direction without securing agreement at G20 level with the SEC, Japan, Singapore and Dubai as well as with our principal European partners.</p>

My noble friend Lord Lawson, whom I am pleased to see in his place, made a very strong case for the Glass-Steagall kind of separation.

However, if we are going to look at the possibility in the context of the Bill, and if we have to have one, we might as well make sure that it does something useful, which is why my noble friend's suggestion of a report on the structure of the UK financial system is an excellent topic. Our debate in the past 30 minutes or so has shown that there is an appetite for such a report and such a public debate. As has been said, this topic will not go away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10031080000021"></a>Last summer, when the Government issued their White Paper, <I>Reforming </I><I>F</I><I>inancial </I><I>M</I><I>arkets</I>, they set out a number of changes, many of which have found their way into the Bill. However, the White Paper had an element of complacency about it: it did not contain a critique of the structure of the UK financial system, and there was no reference to even considering structural changes to banks. Broadly, the Government's view seemed to be that they could go forward with more regulation, which would make everything all right.</p>

<a name="100310-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="10031080000022"></a>The topic has arisen in your Lordships' House on many occasions, often during Oral Questions. The Minister's response has generally been that structural change is not necessary because more capital and more regulation-and sometimes more governance, which today I think is coming out as more management-are capable of solving practically any problem in the banking system. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, gave us another one-that living wills are capable of solving practically any problem that can arise, which shows touching faith in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10031080000027"></a>I feel that doing nothing is probably not an option. The UK now has a particular concentration of banking which makes us particularly vulnerable to not being able to solve the too big to fail problem. In the UK three banks own 75 per cent of domestically-owned assets. It seems to me that we need to look beyond more regulation, more capital and more governance if we are to protect the UK from the impact of another bailout. I agree with my noble friend Lord Trenchard that we need to move in tandem with developments in other major countries. We have always said that that is what we would do if there were any changes.

However, there is no substitute for the Government working with their new creation, the Council for Financial Stability, to bring the collective wisdom of the Bank of England, the Treasury and the FSA to bear on this issue. I support my noble friend's amendment and I hope that the Minister will do so as well.</p>

I agree that vigilant monitoring, effective analysis and evaluation of all the risks to the financial stability of the United Kingdom is desirable; indeed it is essential. I include in this the risks inherent in the system itself. However, where I differ from the noble Lord is in the belief that a statutory and specific report should be required by this legislation.</p>

<a name="100310-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10031080000031"></a>Under the current arrangements, the Bank of England twice a year produces its considered analysis of financial risk through its financial stability report. The FSA similarly produces a report on the financial risk outlook, with its well thought out appraisal of risk. Additionally, the annual report of the Council for Financial Stability, which we will debate later, provides a further vehicle for reviewing and reporting on the actions of the council and more widely on financial stability. The Council for Financial Stability will formally consider each of these reports, discuss the identified risks and agree the required actions in response. The formal and structured approach of the council can ensure that thorough analysis of financial stability is properly evaluated on an ongoing basis. As such, I do not believe that an additional one-off report is desirable or necessary. What matters more is the quality of regular and ongoing monitoring of risk and the effective co-ordination of actions to mitigate those challenges, challenges which could theoretically cause significant damage to the stability of the financial system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10031080000032"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hamilton of Epsom, described himself as a Hayekian liberal, as my noble friend Lord Desai had described himself. It is very encouraging to see a meeting of minds on that description-and in  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_281"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column 281</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some respects I could also join that group, though not, perhaps, in a totally unqualified way. I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, put his finger on one of the issues when he went on to talk about bankers paying themselves bonuses. I think that it is the paying themselves that is the issue. It is not the bonuses. The noble Lord mentioned Northern Rock. In parenthesis, I should say that the figures that Northern Rock announced today showed a very strong second half recovery to profitability. Mr Hoffman, who was recruited from Barclays to run Northern Rock, is doing a first class job in stabilising that business and had no part to play in its failure. However, it is the paying themselves bonuses that was the critical failure, at least in some of these processes. That is one of the reasons why we have placed so much reliance on strengthening governance and shareholder stewardship, including the new disclosure provisions which I announced today. The noble Lord, Lord Sanderson of Bowden, was right as well in saying that much of this also was a manifestation of greed.</p>

<a name="100310-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10031080000033"></a>There has been much talk today about Glass-Steagall, which we discussed at some length on Second Reading. I again pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Lawson of Blaby, who produced a very thoughtful and considered speech. It was clear that a great deal of work had gone into the preparation of his speech and I think that we all benefited from listening to his views. Of course, Glass-Steagall is really rather different from what I think several noble Lords have in mind. Glass-Steagall was about separating the securities issuance and trading aspects of a business from banking. That was not at the core of the problem. The global financial system was brought to its knees not by the interface between securities activity and banking but by poor credit decisions-often within the context of a complex derivative-based structure-backed up by a funding structure that was not sustainable. There was nothing in Glass-Steagall per se-had it been in force-that would have avoided some of the outcomes which we saw with Lehman and Bear Stearns or, in this country, with Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley and the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>

<a name="100310-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10031080000034"></a>So the too big to fail issue is actually a more critical one, and the language which is sometimes used about "casino banking" and "utility banking" gets us closer to the heart of where the intellectual debate lies here than referring back to Glass-Steagall. I do not think that the elements of Glass-Steagall are truly relevant to the issue that we are addressing. That has some bearing on the interesting contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, who today cited a different source. We usually get Mr Michael Saunders of Citibank. He will be very annoyed that we have gone on for close to three hours without any reference to him at all, but no doubt that will come in the next batch of amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10031080000035"></a>There is nothing in the Volcker rule that President Obama has announced that proposes Glass-Steagall, although Volcker's article in the <I>New York Times</I>, to which the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, refers, does talk to Glass-Steagall. I cited that article myself in the Second Reading debate as being a considered review of some of the issues. The Volcker rule, as President Obama described it, does not propose anything close to Glass-Steagall. In fact, there seems to be quite a lot

But more of that in a moment.</p>

<a name="10031089000001"></a><b><a name="100310-0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="10031089000312"></a>Lord Higgins:</b> The Minister is of course right to distinguish between the article and the so-called Volcker rule, but I am not clear from his speech at Second Reading and this afternoon what his attitude is towards separating risky banking from less risky banking. That is, in essence, what we mean when we say Glass-Steagall. He turned it down but did not say why.</p>

I hope that I shall continue to evidence the consistency that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, observed in her comments on my views in these matters.</p>

<a name="100310-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10031089000003"></a>I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that the separation was not something that I and the Government reject because we believe that it cannot be done. We believe that it can be done but do not believe that it is necessary that it should be done. We believe that the appropriate response, as the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, reminded the Committee, is through much strengthened capital. In particular, there is now clear acknowledgment that Basel II, which was not even adopted by the Americans, encouraged banks to transfer risk on to their trading books and hold wholly inadequate capital against the risks. We are talking about much greater calibration of capital against risk, although I note-I come back to a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Sanderson-that no amount of capital will be sufficient for incompetent management not to be able to burn their way through it. Strengthened capital, proportionate to risk, is critical, as is much more balance sheet liquidity, which the FSA has taken the lead in promoting, as well as much more secure funding, which the Bank of England is now obliging our major banks to adopt. That, in turn, needs to be supported by enhanced governance, better quality management and superior shareholder or owner engagement. That speaks to the very significant points that the noble Lord, Lord Sanderson, made in his brief intervention.</p>

<a name="100310-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10031089000004"></a>A number of these issues are not ones on which we can go it alone, to use the wording that the noble Baroness used. It is not that we could not choose to do some of these things on our own if we wanted to, but there are a number of issues on which it is better to have a globally co-ordinated process, so we do not disadvantage our fine institutions or place at risk the million or so jobs in the banking and financial sector.</p>

<a name="100310-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10031089000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, talked about Northern Rock and Lehmann Brothers. He introduced the concept of "too big to fail" and even gave some free advice to Goldman Sachs that it should break itself up into smaller firms and that it would then be even more profitable. I could not help notice the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, pick up quite quickly on that point; no doubt Evercore, a firm with which he is associated, will now push this forward to Goldman Sachs as a way in which to enhance shareholder value-and I hope that he will pay a modest retainer to the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, for bringing the idea to his attention.</p>

I have to correct the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, on the issue of Greece. It was not an issue of Goldman Sachs buying Greek bonds but selling credit default swaps and complex optional derivative contracts, which apparently made a contribution to helping Greece meet its indebtedness targets before joining the EU. Perhaps it is now buying Greek bonds; we will have to see.</p>

<a name="100310-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10031089000012"></a>On the points made by the noble Lords, Lord Higgins and Lord Stewartby, as well as the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, at Second Reading, we must ensure that banks can fail. I spoke on this matter at a Smith Institute lecture earlier this week. A system in which banks cannot fail is a poorly performing system that will produce sub-optimal outcomes, because the consequences of failure, salutary as they should be, will not be there, so the incentive effects to avoid failure will not be in place. That is the role of recovery and resolution plans, or living wills. They will address, together with other mechanisms, the issue that my noble friend Lord Desai raised of ensuring that the taxpayer never again has to step in and support failing banks or place capital at risk.</p>

<a name="100310-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10031089000013"></a>Recovery and resolution plans are an area on which the UK leads and on which the FSA is already doing significant work with some of our leading banks. I was talking to the CEO of one of our largest banks last Friday about how they are progressing with preparing the recovery and resolution plan and was much encouraged by what I heard. The plans need to be complemented by some form of price to pay for the implicit support that the taxpayer ultimately provides against any possibility of bank failure. I suggested earlier this week that the banking industry through this implicit guarantee, which it has enjoyed for many decades and for which it has paid no premium, has actually enjoyed greater state aid than any industry in Britain, including the defence industry and agriculture,  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_284"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column 284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to which we normally refer when we talk about state support for industry. So the combination of recovery and resolution plans and some form of internationally agreed levy to cover the cost of failure is a necessary action to strengthen the system in future.</p>

<a name="100310-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10031089000014"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Stewartby, and my noble friend Lord Haskins that it is not simply an issue of too big to fail but also too big to manage. I remember being seated at dinner with the chief executive of one of America's largest banks, in San Francisco in August 2008, before the crisis really hit. I spent an hour asking him what he did. It was quite clear to me in the end that, because of its size and complexity, it was not a business he was able to manage. Therefore, I should be very surprised if the Council for Financial Stability did not regularly address some of the issues of complexity, interconnectedness, size and management challenge which lie at the heart of the points that have been raised by noble Lords today.</p>

<a name="100310-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10031089000015"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, referred to subsidiary structures within a group. My experience has been that it is sometimes easier to deal with another company's subsidiary than your own, although that had quite a lot to do with a deontology of separating conflicts of interest. In the future we will see much more use of subsidiarity rather than branch structures. That in itself will be within the necessary requirements of a viable resolution approach.</p>

<a name="100310-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10031089000016"></a>Finally, in response to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, I look forward with great interest to reading the <I>Financial Times</I> editorial today.</p>

<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="10031089000017"></a><b><a name="100310-0007.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="10031089000320"></a>Lord Gilbert:</b> Before my noble friend sits down at the end of his very interesting speech, I suggest that he draws the attention of the Council for Financial Stability to the operations of what are nominally called the Edge Acts in the United States, with which my noble friend may or may not be familiar. It is an amendment to the Federal Reserve named after Senator Edge of New Jersey, which specifically allowed joint-stock banks-commercial banks-to have up to two subsidiaries in different states so long as the one that accepted deposits did not make investments and the one that made investments did not accept deposits. It worked and as far as I know it is still working extremely well.</p>

But you need to respect the firewalls between the different parts of the group. The firewall between Lehman Brothers and Lehman Brothers International Europe in London was not of two companies with separate capitalisation, separate management and a separate sense of who obligations lay to. There was a fungibility within the group which undoubtedly has contributed to some of the challenges in resolving both Lehman Brothers and Lehman Brothers International Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10031089000019"></a>As I was saying to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, in some ways the noble Lord is right. We are still too close to the crisis to see all the implications of what has happened. We have here an architecture for building a safer system built around the Council for Financial Stability. I do not know what to say in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, saying that the Conservative Party does not

I can only assume that that is some euphemism to cover the various volte-faces that we have seen in past thinking. There are those on the Conservative Benches, including the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, who have no doubt about having a view on this. Perhaps Mr Osborne should take some time out to listen to the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, on these points.</p>

Let the Committee be in no doubt that we have spent a great deal of time considering the issues of size, interconnectivity, complexity and whether one organisation should include insurance, banking and securities. We have spent considerable time in reviewing the matter and we have reached our conclusions. However, for a party that is about to offer itself to the nation as being prepared for Government to say that its members have individual views but that it does not have a view as a party is absolutely extraordinary. However, looking at the faces of some the noble Baroness's supporters sitting behind her, my surprise is no greater than theirs. With that, I thank the noble Lord for stimulating this debate and discussion but I urge him to withdraw his amendment on the basis that the purpose that he seeks to achieve will be delivered by the model and the legislation as currently drafted.</p>

I do not accept the premise of the Minister that somehow this is all going to emerge from these constant reports that have been coming out of the Bank of England and the FSA and will come out of the new bodies in the future. I do not think that a regular monitoring of risk is a suitable way of addressing the question as to whether we have organisations that are too big to fail. Although everybody is frightfully keen on addressing this as if it is nothing to do with anything other than Glass-Steegall, it is not, as I hope I have indicated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10031089000023"></a>All enormous organisations-I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, would support me on this-are very reluctant to break themselves up voluntarily. In terms of shareholder value, there are very often obvious benefits in big organisations breaking themselves up. They never do, however, because the people who run very large organisations enjoy running very large organisations. They do not want suddenly to find themselves running a much smaller organisation because they have split their business in half. Let us be absolutely clear. Goldman Sachs, or indeed any other large organisation, is not going voluntarily to split itself up into smaller bits. That is why somebody has got to do it for them.</p>

If, at the end of the day, by some miracle, this report is instigated-I take all the worries that noble Lords have that we probably will not see this legalisation on the statute book-it would be obviously easier for my party to come to a clear decision as to what should happen. What we want is the facts and for the debate to go on, as my noble friend Lord Lawson has indicated. There are pros and cons on this issue. It is not altogether straightforward. I am the first to accept that. On the other hand, we have suffered desperately from organisations that are too big to fail and from big banks that have speculated with depositors' money. When they go down, the taxpayer has to move in to bail them out; otherwise an awful lot of ordinary people would lose money. I give way to the Minister.</p>

I do not know why we have to answer them all here now. It did not matter how big or small the Dunfermline Building Society was. It had a very amount number of depositors' money. Therefore, those people had to be bailed out by the taxpayer. There is, anyway, an undertaking from the taxpayer that he will actually bail out deposits-it used to be £35,000; I think we are up to £50,000.

I advocate that this issue be debated in a way that there is absolutely no chance that it will be debated under this new structure if it ever comes into being.

Throughout the stages of this Bill in another place, the Government have been very clear that they intend to produce a statement under Clause 1(5). The Economic Secretary to the Treasury was clear about our intentions; the production of a full draft statement to enable proper scrutiny of the Bill also clearly indicated the Government's intention in that respect. However, seeing as we are continuing to debate this point, the Government are happy in addition to make it explicit in the Bill. Our amendment therefore makes it a requirement for the Treasury to lay a statement under Clause 1(5). However, we consider "must" preferable to "shall", as it is more consistent with the remainder of Clause 1, where "must" is used to connote an obligation. I beg to move.</p>

The interesting thing about this amendment is: what is the further provision that the Government have in mind in respect of this statement? It is a joint statement, because it cannot be made without consulting the other parties concerned. Going back to Clause 1(4)(a), there is an obligation to,</p>
<ul><a name="10031089000067"></a>"keep under review the impact (if any) on the stability of the UK financial system of events or circumstances outside the United Kingdom (as well as in the United Kingdom)".</ul>
<p><a name="10031089000061"></a>It seems extraordinary to me that those words are in that clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10031089000031"></a>The sub-prime market-in the derivatives of the same, which started in the United States-had some effect upon the stability of the United Kingdom. I hope, then, that this move to "must" means that we shall stop looking entirely inwards and start to remember that it might have been good to have had some idea about what was happening in Iceland before the crisis-and that it might now be good to have some idea about what is happening in China. Indeed, the Chinese are beginning to make considerable investments in the United Kingdom. No doubt, they can finance those without recourse to any British bank because they have a great pile of United States Treasury bills with which to pay.</p>

<a name="100310-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="10031089000032"></a>I feel strongly that the Bill-in this part, at least-has a certain irrelevance or out-of-date thinking in it. It is said by the Prime Minister that we live in a global economy, and that he thinks he is the first Prime Minister to have been in that office when the world became truly global. Yet the Bill, and this part of it, seems to indicate that we can draw a line around the UK financial system without regard to whether it is possible to do that. My contention would be that that is not possible.</p>

<a name="100310-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10031089000033"></a>It is possible to see part of the financial system as an enabling mechanism for making our economy grow either at one pace or another. Indeed, that is the most important issue facing us in the near future; how fast will our economy grow? However, it is not possible to look at the UK financial system as though it was just ours, with no impact being provided by our system and our banks on the rest of the world or by other people's banks on what happens here. We deserve a much better explanation of why the Government have moved from a permissive to a Hegelian position by using "must".</p>

My Amendment 4 in this group is, as the Minister pointed out, the may/shall amendment. I had hoped that we would have one of those debates where the Minister would talk about the necessity of having flexibility and I would say how important it was to have certainty, but the Government have come along and trumped my amendment with their may/must amendment.

I particularly thank the noble Baroness for accepting the government amendment. I am grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles; while I have not been in the House for as long as him, this is the first sign that I have heard from the Conservative Benches of a venture into Hegelian philosophy. We might even at some stage move on to the derivative from Hegel, who learned so much from him; then I shall be listening to Conservative Back-Benchers commenting on Marxism. That day has not dawned yet, but if we wait long enough we may yet go into those realms of philosophy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10031089000036"></a>I want to emphasise, realistically, that the noble Viscount sought to widen the debate when the issue is in fact narrow. It is about a requirement only to lay a statement, not the wider objectives of financial control. It is about making a statement on the process; therefore I hope that the noble Viscount will recognise that I understand his point. I was quite delighted when the noble Baroness suggested that I could have made a longer introduction to the government amendment, but its virtue stands in its brevity and, as she knows, I am a Lord of few words. Therefore I am grateful for her agreement.</p>

These amendments concern the financial stability powers of the FSA, the Bank of England and the Treasury. In the first group of amendments this afternoon, which seems rather a long time ago now, I focused on the responsibilities of the tripartite authorities. These amendments are the flipside of that, namely the powers that can be used to fulfil those responsibilities. Amendment 6 adds a further item which the statement issued by the Treasury under Clause 1(5) should cover, namely the powers of the relevant authorities to protect or enhance financial stability. Since my very similar Amendment 5 found favour with the Government this afternoon, I have some hope that Amendment 6 will, perhaps, similarly find favour. It is fair to say that requiring the statement to set out the powers is not an onerous requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10031089000038"></a>The current draft of the statement says what the objectives and responsibilities of the three parties are. It goes on to talk about the discussion and co-ordination functions we debated earlier, but it does not say how one gets from discussion and co-ordination to action-that has to be by way of the powers of the individual bodies. The Government's position is that the council itself should not have any powers-that was established during our earlier debates-but that makes it all the more important that the powers exist to deliver financial stability and to establish who holds them. Ignoring the powers, as the draft statement currently does, leaves questions dangling in the air about whether there are indeed sufficient powers to deliver financial stability.</p>

<a name="100310-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10031089000039"></a>That leads me to the second amendment in this group, Amendment 27, which requires the Treasury to prepare a report on the powers needed by the tripartite authorities to fulfil their financial stability responsibilities. If the existing powers are found to be insufficient, my amendment says that the report should identify that and set out recommendations for remedying them. Proposed new subsection (3) gives the Treasury one year to deliver this report.</p>

<a name="100310-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10031089000040"></a>The Banking Act which we processed last year gave the Bank and the Treasury a suite of powers which could be used to deal with a threat to financial stability from a bank which was in financial difficulties. Those powers are necessary, but they are not sufficient to deliver financial stability. The Act also gave the Bank of England an explicit financial stability objective, but did not add any further tools or powers. The Governor of the Bank of England was quoted by the Treasury Select Committee in another place last year as saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="10031089000068"></a>"it is not entirely clear how the Bank will be able to discharge its new statutory responsibility if we can do no more than issue sermons".</ul>
<p><a name="10031089000062"></a>There is nothing in the Bill which gives the Bank an ability to do more than issue sermons.</p>

<a name="100310-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="10031089000041"></a>In the evidence sessions to the Public Bill Committee in another place, the Bank of England's representative said,</p>
<ul><a name="10031089000069"></a>"we are still at the stage of thinking about the kinds of tools that would be used".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Financial Services Bill Committee, 8/12/09; col. 30.]</ul>
<p><a name="10031089000063"></a>In other words, this Bill does not settle the question of what tools are needed. The Bank of England's discussion paper of last November and its financial stability review earlier this year outlined its thinking on the macro-prudential tools needed for financial stability. The Bill does not progress that. The Bank and the governor have been clear that they do not see their monetary policy responsibility as extending to asset prices and asset bubbles.</p>

<a name="100310-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="10031089000042"></a>My honourable friend George Osborne demonstrated in his recent Mais lecture that financial crises are always linked to a major increase in debt, one of the consequences of which is often rapidly rising asset prices. There is a pressing need to identify what tools will be used when debt and asset prices rise to alarming levels. The Bill does not deal with that. At a more mundane level, the Bank of England representative made it clear in his evidence to the Public Bill Committee that the Bank lacks an information power to underpin its role in the special resolution regime. The Bill does

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="10031089000043"></a>At Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, referred to the need for a radical agenda which included pro-cyclical provisions and leverage collars. He noted that the Bill does not set out powers and responsibilities for putting this sort of agenda into action. There is not even a whisper of them in the Bill.</p>

<a name="100310-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="10031089000044"></a>Amendment 27 does not seek to provide any answer to the question of what powers are necessary to underpin financial stability, or who should exercise them. It does however give the Treasury responsibility for pulling together the various strands of work, identifying what powers are needed and recommending what should happen if they do not already exist or are held by the wrong people. It allows one year for the task. There has been a prodigious amount of work done in this country and under the auspices of the G20. This talking shop has to result in some action, and importantly Parliament must be involved in the decisions, which is why my amendment allows for the laying of the report before Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="10031089000045"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, was firmly of the view at Second Reading that in the UK we do not need to await full global agreement before pressing ahead. I broadly support that position, with the caveat that while the UK can front-run on issues-and given the size and importance of our financial services industry it would be natural to do so-we must not allow ourselves to end up out of step competitively with the rest of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10031089000046"></a>I must also mention Europe, which my noble friend Lord Trenchard has mentioned this afternoon. This may be the source of problems-more than usual for Europe. The Government have been devising their policy for financial stability while our neighbours in Europe have also been moving with unaccustomed speed to set up a new European supervisory architecture which is trying to accumulate as many powers as possible to trump national powers. The Minister will be aware that every time the Council of Ministers determines what national protections should exist, the Commission and the Parliament pull in the other direction. We want the UK Government to be able to chart the UK's own course, and to frame financial stability measures and powers in a UK context, while also achieving convergence with global standards. Will the Minister say how the Government see developments in Europe? Will we in the UK be setting the agenda for ourselves next year, or will it be laid down for us by the new European Systemic Risk Board and the European supervisory authorities? If that is the case, what influence will the UK have given that qualified majority voting is involved? Once Europe has had its say, what, if any, scope will there be for national action? Put another way, is my amendment on powers completely unnecessary because Europe will be dictating the answer? I beg to move.</p>

I did not mean to suggest that the same people who supervise the smallest building society should carry out macro-prudential supervision, or the "big picture" stuff. However, if you are responsible for the big picture, which we have come to call "macro-prudential supervision", you must also have the ability to supervise the major players in the financial markets. Macro-prudential and micro-prudential supervision are part of the same supervisory function. I did not mean to say that the same people should do it; obviously they cannot. However, prudential supervision should ultimately be the responsibility of the Bank of England. Therefore, the FSA-in whatever form it may continue-should either be a part of the Bank of England or report to it so that the governor has the ultimate power to supervise those major financial institutions which are major players in financial markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="10031089000050"></a>My noble friend Lady Noakes also touched on the question that I referred to earlier. My understanding, from the chief executive of the FSA shortly before he resigned, is that it is no longer possible for the United Kingdom to set regulatory policy, and that we have already surrendered to the three new regulatory bodies and are right to do that. This is quite extraordinary, considering the role that our financial markets play in global financial markets as a whole. We have the leading international financial centre here. The Minister also commented that having a single regulator was the right thing to do, and that we were right to have put the previous nine financial regulators together in one. I agree with him, but why are we going to subordinate our regulatory system to the new European regulatory architecture, which has three bodies-that is, separate bodies for banking, securities and insurance and pensions? If you read this Bill you would have no idea about the European regulatory framework against which it is being formulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="10031089000052"></a>I have a couple of questions for the Conservatives about the European regulatory bodies. Are they saying that they do not think there should be any? Is the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, saying that he would prefer one to three?</p>

Financial regulation should be harmonised and co-ordinated on a global level, not a European level. Financial markets are definitely global. They are not national and they are not European. Within the European Union there is only one major wholesale financial market and that is London. Of course, every country has its own retail market, so every country needs its own body to supervise its retail financial market. As far as wholesale financial markets are concerned, London is the only market. London is also the principal global financial market, or one of them. Our regulator, be it the Bank of England or the FSA, should be able to sit at the table with the American SEC, Japan's FSA and other principal financial regulators around the world to co-ordinate regulatory policy. To attempt to do so at a European level is unnecessary and potentially destructive to London's competitiveness.</p>

They cover two different but important areas. Amendment 6 specifies the powers that each relevant authority is able to exercise in protecting or enhancing the stability of the system. Amendment 27 identifies additional powers needed to field responsibility for financial stability. These amendments seem entirely necessary. As it stands, the Bill is far too vague on these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="10031089000055"></a>I also support my noble friend Lord Trenchard in his worries about the powers of the European regulators making much of this legislation redundant.

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="10031089000057"></a>On Amendment 27, we do not believe that there are gaps in the responsibilities and powers of the authorities to deal with financial stability. We looked at this very carefully when we produced <I>Reforming Financial Markets</I>. We concluded that, beyond the sensible measures in the Bill, no further powers or responsibilities were necessary. We do not believe that there is a gap, but if the work of the council proved that there were problems, the Government would of course act. However, to ask for a specific report to be produced appears somewhat bureaucratic and unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="10031089000058"></a>As I have indicated, I see more merit in Amendment 6.

The draft of the statement provided for by Clause 1(5)-the council's terms of reference-is available on the Treasury website. It provides an overview of the authority's financial stability responsibilities. This is intended to put the detail of the council's objectives and procedures into context.</p>

<a name="100310-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="10031089000059"></a>The statement also sets out that the authorities intend to revise the Memorandum of Understanding between them. As previously mentioned, the memorandum between the Bank of England, the FSA and the Treasury was first agreed in 1997 and updated in 2006. It sets out the roles of each authority and how they work together to pursue financial stability. We made clear in another place that, as suggested in the draft terms of reference, the Memorandum of Understanding would be updated with consolidated detail of each authority's roles for financial stability.</p>

<a name="100310-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="10031089000060"></a>We thought that that was a convincing position to take. In the other place, reservations were entered about this. These have been reflected in the speeches of the noble Baroness and others in Committee today. Clearly, we have not convinced the House on this point. There is still a desire for the detail of roles and responsibilities to be included in the terms of reference. In light of those representations and their force, we are willing to accept Amendment 6 and we will include the necessary detail in the statement produced under Clause 1(5). I hope, therefore, that the noble Baroness will feel that she has persuaded the Government of the merits of her first amendment, and will perhaps be indulgent enough not to press Amendment 27.</p>

We believe that the most appropriate forums are the international ones, under the G20. We are very concerned about the powers being taken by Europe, which will fundamentally affect the financial services industry in the UK much more than anywhere else. If anyone wants to see how dreadful European involvement in financial regulation is, they only have to look at the alternative investment fund management directive. It shows a lack of understanding of the subject matter and can be extremely harmful to the UK. We sign up to European involvement only to the extent that it does not prohibit our developing proper solutions via the G20, and does not tie our hands unnecessarily in respect of British interests, which are different.</p>

I obviously thank the noble Lord, Lord Davies, for agreeing to Amendment 6; that is most gratifying and I thank him for it. However, I was disappointed that the Minister said that having a report would be bureaucratic and unnecessary. The point is not that it would be bureaucratic for the Treasury-the Treasury may well regard it as yet another task that it has to do, and therefore as bureaucratic-but that the report was to be laid before Parliament.

As we have discussed in our debates today, Clause 1 allows the Treasury to prepare a statement about the functions of the Council for Financial Stability. Under subsection (7), the Treasury must keep the statement under review. My Amendment 8 says that if the statement has not been revised for two years, the Treasury must consult on whether it should be revised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="10031091000006"></a>This amendment was suggested to us by the Law Society of Scotland and seems to make perfect sense. It would be easy for a statement to lie neglected in the files somewhere in the Treasury, and for it to become out of date. Where is the stimulus for the Treasury to keep it up to date? There is a parallel in the commercial world, where it is normal practice for committees-such as remuneration committees or audit committees-to formally review their terms of reference once a year, because if they do not do so, they get out of touch with the things that should be in there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="10031091000007"></a>I am reminded that the memorandum of understanding between the Bank of England, the Treasury and the FSA was first published in October 1997, when the Bank of England Act was first published as a Bill, and long before the FSA took legal form as a result of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. As the noble Lord, Lord Myners, told us, that memorandum of understanding was not updated until March 2006, eight and a half years later. In between was a period during which the landscape of the financial services sector changed very considerably. So it is very easy for these sorts of documents-terms of reference and memoranda of understanding-to get stale and to fail to be reviewed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="10031091000009"></a>Going forward, we clearly have to have some in-built mechanism for the new statement to be reviewed, and simply giving the Treasury the responsibility to keep it under review does not go far enough.

She also says that she cannot derive from that any particular lessons of weakness with regard to the position. The simple fact is that the Government do not expect the statement to require updating on a regular basis. However, the Bill as drafted is quite clear that it is the duty of the Treasury to keep the statement under review, and that is exactly what the Government intend to do. It is important that the terms of reference are fit for purpose in undertaking this requirement for ongoing review, and the Government of course will remain open to any concerns raised over the scope of the council's terms of reference by the FSA or the Bank of England or even more widely-perhaps points raised in a parliamentary debate on the council's annual report. However, a formal requirement to consult every two years on whether to revise the terms of reference does seem excessive. We believe that it is more sensible for any review of the statement to be driven by evidence of need and not by an arbitrary, statutory trigger.</p>

Both amendments concern a consultation on the statement of the Council for Financial Stability's functions required by Clause 1(5). Amendment 9 was also suggested to us by the Law Society of Scotland. Under subsection (8), the Treasury is required to consult, and the Minister has referred to that. However, the consultation extends only to the FSA and the Bank of England. My amendment widens the consultees to include,</p>

<a name="100310-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="10031091000014"></a>There is a certain inwardness about the Council for Financial Stability: its three members are the top men in the Treasury, the FSA and the Bank of England; and the things that the council has to consider are reports written by the three bodies, as set out in Clause 2. A statement about the council's functions is to be prepared by the Treasury in consultation only with the other two.</p>

<a name="100310-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="10031091000015"></a>The matters referred to in subsection (6) as candidates for inclusion in the published statement in fact fall into two categories. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (6) deal with the council's procedures and things that would facilitate the exercise of its functions. I do not think that anyone outside the threesome would have an interest in that. However, paragraph (a) allows the Treasury to specify particular objectives for the council to meet, and paragraph (b) deals with specific matters to which the council must have regard in exercising its functions.</p>

<a name="100310-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="10031091000016"></a>On the assumption that the council will in practice do a bit more than the monitoring and co-ordinating that the draft statement refers to, I can think of a lot of people who would have an interest in how those issues would be dealt with in the statement. Many people and firms have direct and indirect interests in how the actions that could result from the deliberations of the council would impact on them. The statement would benefit from scrutiny by people other than the inner circle of the Treasury, the FSA and the Bank of England.</p>

<a name="100310-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="10031091000017"></a>Amendment 10 is also eminently reasonable, with transparency in mind. Earlier, the noble Lord, Lord Myners, told us a lot about how these new arrangements would be transparent. My amendment requires the Treasury to publish responses to its consultation under subsection (8). The Minister will be aware that it is good practice to publish consultation responses, although I am sure that he is also aware that the degree of enthusiasm with which the Government embrace that tends to vary with the degree of support shown for the Government's line.</p>

<a name="100310-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="10031091000018"></a>Amendment 10 would be valid regardless of whether the Government accepted my Amendment 9. Even if only the Treasury and the FSA were consulted, their responses would be of interest to the outside world; but if Amendment 9 were accepted, it would be even more important that the Treasury published the views expressed. It is normal for the Government to set out their response to consultation responses, and that is often interesting in its own right and can of course trigger parliamentary involvement, more usually through a Select Committee in another place.</p>

It must be absolutely right to make sure that any consultation that takes place is published, because we all believe in transparency and openness. It must be right that people can access deliberations which have taken place and can take a view on what is going on. What worries me about Amendment 9 is its provision for the Treasury to consider which other persons have an interest in the statement. I get the impression that that leaves the Treasury with a veto. It may not ask any extra persons to become involved in the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="10031091000021"></a>I do not know why, but I have suspicions that it might be rather attractive to the Treasury to ensure that a minimal number of people are asked. If the decision is to lie with it, perhaps no one else will be asked to take part in the consultation, because that will be what the Treasury decided. I am not an overenthusiastic supporter of the amendment, but perhaps my noble friend Lady Noakes can spell out for us how she sees it working.

The amendment considers who the Treasury formally consults when revising the statement. The Bill requires the Treasury to consider the other organisations that provide members of the council-namely the Bank of England and the FSA. What is being suggested here is that there should be much wider consultation, even approaching a full public consultation, on the matter. We do not consider that either necessary or appropriate.</p>

It is obvious that those high-level objectives are part of public concern and should be for public debate, but we do not consider that the details of how the council goes about its work to deliver these overarching objectives is a matter for wider public consultation.

I do not think that my noble friend's amendment goes far enough, because it leaves the Treasury with a veto on who is asked to get involved in this consultation. I do not accept that a complete repository of wisdom is held on all these matters by the FSA and the Bank of England. People such as the noble Lord, Lord Desai, may well have something to contribute to the whole question of financial stability and he should have the opportunity to make his views known. It is a mistake merely to restrict the consultation to this small number of people. The reason why I do not think that my noble friend's amendment has gone far enough is that the Treasury would be under no compulsion to ask anyone else to be involved in the consultation, and I think that they should be.</p>

Perhaps I should not have prayed him in aid in relation to the Government's position, and I withdraw my remarks that might have given that indication. However, he will fully accept the burden of the Government's position. Of course we regard the high-level objectives as a matter of considerable public concern, and they should be open to full debate. However, we are talking about the mechanics and the process of the three parties, and we are against the concept of those being put out to wider consultation. Therefore, by definition, if we are against the principle of Amendment 9, we are obviously against Amendment 10. I hope the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment and not move Amendment 10.</p>

There was no public consultation so there was nothing to publish. I made the point when I introduced my amendments that Amendment 10 would exist independently of Amendment 9 because there is already a consultation provided for in the Bill. There would be responses to the Treasury on this consultation. I suggest that those at least should be made plain and transparent. If the Government are serious about transparency in these new arrangements, why do they go to the trouble of setting out that there is a process and then get secretive about the outcome? Why is the minimalist consultation required in the Bill not to be transparent?</p>

There is no substance whatever behind these clauses. It is just puff.

I shall confine my remarks to Richmond Park in the main, but other noble Lords will no doubt talk about Bushy Park. Both parks lie in the London Borough of Richmond but are a pleasure for people in Richmond, Twickenham, Putney and Kingston. Both are of great concern to MPs in the House of Commons, most notably Susan Kramer and Vince Cable. The London Borough of Richmond upon Thames has always had as its motto:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="10031091000052"></a>"Where the countryside comes to town".</p>

<p><a name="10031091000049"></a>Richmond Park and Bushy Park are our lungs and our countryside. Besides being areas of great natural beauty, Richmond Park in particular hosts many rare species of plants and insects as well as fine herds of red and fallow deer.</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="10031091000036"></a>Richmond Park was formed when Charles I decided he wanted a private hunting park. Noble Lords will remember that Charles I had a fine opinion of himself and his powers. He built a high, red-brick wall all around the park, created by the compulsory purchase of a great deal of farmland-to the consternation of local residents who regarded it as a theft of their countryside. Charles was persuaded to put ladders at certain points around the circumference of the park to allow pedestrian access and was forced by public opinion to allow poor people into the park to collect wood for fuel. This permission still exists today. Over 20 years ago, just for fun, I applied to the then Department of the Environment for a permit to collect wood in Richmond Park and was duly issued one. If any noble Lords are desperate in this cold weather, you can only take out as much as you can carry. Do not get too excited about it.</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="10031091000037"></a>The park carried on as a hunting park for the Royal Family and the aristocracy. Public access became more and more difficult until finally challenged by John Lewis-not of the partnership but a brewer in Richmond. After three years, in 1758 he finally won free access into the park for local people. The park has been open and there has been free access ever since.</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="10031091000038"></a>The main reason for the changes to the regulations for Richmond Park and Bushy Park is to raise revenue to rebuild the roads in them. These were originally sandy tracks, which have in recent years been covered in tarmac. They have never been properly metalled or constructed. This means that pollutants from the traffic drain into the park, destroying the special grasslands and thus the whole ecology of the park. Traffic has increased hugely over the years. Motorists use the park as a short cut on their journeys in and out of London. Visitors to the park use the car parks.</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="10031091000039"></a>Sadly, the Royal Parks Agency has presented only one option for consultation, and that is a substantial charge for parking. It did no surveys of the quantity of commuter traffic and counted only the cars that are parked and whose occupants stay in the park for long periods to enjoy the countryside with their families. It even assessed the socio-economic class and ethnicity of the people who use the park to try to justify the imposition of charges. It was a huge, expensive survey giving us only half the story.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_303"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column 303</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100310-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="10031091000040"></a>Why did it not consider other proposals? It has been suggested in the local press and elsewhere, including by local people, that it is the rat-runners through the park who should pay a charge towards the upkeep of the roads, not the people who drive a short distance from their nearest gate to a car park and walk or picnic in the park for long periods. Tens of thousands of people use the park as a short cut every week, never stopping at all. A scheme has been suggested using modern scanning technology to charge motorists who stay, say, less than half an hour in the park. It is used elsewhere and it could be used in the parks-a toll charge in other words. We pay one quite happily to cross the Severn Bridge. Why was this not considered and why was the survey not completed?</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="10031091000041"></a>It has also been suggested that a special fundraising committee be set up to raise money for the park. The Government do not allow museums to charge for entry, so why allow the Royal Parks to do so? Museums have always raised funds by public subscription, as, for that matter, have universities. Why not the Royal Parks?</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="10031091000042"></a>There is little or no public transport to Richmond Park, in particular, so people have no alternative but to use their cars, and charges would disproportionately affect those on low incomes and of course the elderly and disabled. Over many years, we have been promised transport to the park and, indeed, within the park by the Royal Parks Agency but it has never happened. Even if we had a bus, it would still be difficult to take several small children and the dog to the park for the day. I repeat: it is our countryside.</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="10031091000043"></a>I wish to make one final point. As pointed out by my noble friend Lady Hamwee, who cannot be here today because of family illness, car-parking charges would have an unneighbourly effect-indeed, it is mentioned in the consultation-as people find out that they can avoid the charge by using the streets around the park. Residents' parking schemes would have to be extended to weekends and holidays, and even to Christmas Day and Boxing Day, when residents make maximum use of the park. That would cause maximum disruption for the residents living around the park.</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="10031091000044"></a>The Tory Motion expresses unhappiness with the parking charges. It regrets the measure and asks the Government to withdraw it, but wishes to retain the other changes in the regulations enabling a reduction in speed limits and other improvements to the public amenity in the Royal Parks. Let us take a brief look at some of these. They include prohibiting the sailing of model boats in any pond except the model boating pond. That does not sound too crucial or urgent to me, unless of course noble Lords on the Conservative Benches spend their entire weekends sailing model boats on forbidden waters in the Royal Parks.</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="10031091000045"></a>Another new regulation exempts horse owners riding in the park from the obligation to clear up their horses' manure. In the 35 years that I have walked in Richmond Park, I have never seen a rider dismount to collect the horse manure. My husband, who has an allotment, would do it like a shot but he does not ride horses in Richmond Park and horse riders are not lobbying urgently on this issue. I have not had a single letter about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="10031091000047"></a>The Conservative Motion will do nothing except enshrine car-parking charges in Richmond Park and the Royal Parks, and Bushy Park in particular. The Government will not withdraw anything. If the Conservatives win the general election-it is quite a big if nowadays-I cannot see this piece of legislation about car-parking charges in Richmond and Bushy parks being top of David Cameron's list the day after the election. I cannot imagine him saying, "What must we do first? Yes, we must go for those parking charges". He will have many more problems to deal with than that one. We read in Conservative leaflets that they will "review" the charges, but that is hardly a commitment to get rid of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="10031091000048"></a>It is said that fatal amendments have been won on only three occasions. So what? With your Lordships' support we can make it four times and force, not ask, the Royal Parks Agency and the Government to think again and look at better and fairer options. I understand the Official Opposition's reluctance to support a fatal amendment lest we get into the habit of tabling them when and if they gain power, but this is something called democracy. We are able to do this; it is on the Order Paper. I urge the House to support our fatal Motion and ask the Royal Parks Agency to prove that it is fit for purpose by taking a fresh look at methods of raising revenue for the Royal Parks. Let us have a bit of imagination and lateral thinking for a change, instead of going for the easiest and most unjust solution. I beg to move.</p>

They symbolise all that is wrong with the hole in the heart where new Labour's sense of tradition and fairness should be found. They are proposed by Mrs Hodge, whose base is on the other side of London in Barking. There are two visitors' car parks in Barking Park and I am told that there is no parking charge. Mrs Hodge spoke last weekend about the need to hear and respond to local people's concerns. What a pity that she was speaking only about Barking. Why will her Government not listen to local concerns when they come from Twickenham, Putney, Richmond and Kingston?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="10031095000002"></a>I hope that the House will reach a common resolve tonight to ask the Government to withdraw these regulations but, first, I shall speak briefly to the Motion moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge. This asks your Lordships-the unelected House-to reject a statutory instrument for only the fourth time in their history. The Liberal Democrat website rants about "betrayal" if your Lordships do not take this extreme step. Mr Cable, a local Member of Parliament-he must have escaped from the green room at BBC's "Newsnight"-says that it will be "silly politics" if we do not veto the elected House's regulations tonight. Mrs Kramer says that she is "utterly shocked" at the idea that your Lordships should not throw out secondary legislation. "Silly", "shock", "betrayal"-the Liberal Democrats never knowingly underegg a pudding; they

Insults have never won arguments in your Lordships' House. I do not remember Mr Asquith or Mr Lloyd George saying that it would be betrayal or silly politics for this House not to veto a money-raising order from another place. In 1908, long before the People's Budget, Mr Asquith told cheering Liberal MPs:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="10031095000054"></a>"I invite the Liberal Party tonight to treat the veto of the House of Lords as the dominating issue in politics-because in the long run it overshadows and absorbs every other".</p>

<p><a name="10031095000047"></a>No doubt Mr Cable would have been tut-tutting behind Mr Asquith's back, rather as he does now behind Mr Clegg.</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="10031095000003"></a>However, I think this House should ask the Government to think again. That is why I have tabled a second Motion tonight, which I ask my noble friends to support. There are some good things in the regulations. Unlike the Liberal Democrats, we have no wish to deprive children of the pleasure of sailing boats on the model pond in Bushy Park-children doing so is actually rather a charming thought-we have no wish to stop private-hire vehicles driving in Richmond Park; and we have no wish to stop a 20-mile-an-hour speed limit in Greenwich Park. All those things would be killed by the Motion of the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge. We ask the Government to re-lay the statutory instrument without charges on access to Bushy and Richmond parks. My party has always opposed such charges, unlike the Liberal Democrat Richmond Council, which astonishingly wrote to the parks agency offering to send officers to help to design the charges. In consultation, 84 per cent of local people were against charges. Only a fatally arrogant Government would ignore such a majority.</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="10031095000004"></a>Ministers have two arguments: first, the Royal Parks Agency needs cash to do up its car parks and roads; and secondly, west London people are rich and can afford to pay. Neither stands up. Few things exemplify waste more than the slow urbanisation of our great London parks. Richmond and Bushy parks are beautiful because they are open and wild. Who wants tarmacked car parks, uniformed traffic wardens, bright spotlights and surveillance cameras? If we are looking for spending cuts, surely this is where to begin.</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="10031095000005"></a>On the upkeep of roads, why place a burden on local people who love the parks? If you really want someone to pay, why not the commuters, as the noble Baroness has suggested, who stream across the park daily without ever stopping? A simple toll could be operated with a sticker, from which the residents of neighbouring boroughs could be exempt. Such charges would raise just £345,000. A good proportion of that could be raised by voluntary contributions. If money must be found, let us have a more imaginative policy than dumping railway station-style car parks in our parks.</p>

<a name="100310-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="10031095000006"></a>The second argument is that people can afford it. Middle England has heard plenty of that kind of argument in the past 13 years. Look where it has got us: we are taxed to the gills and £187,000 million a year deeper in debt. Mrs Hodge says that 88 per cent of car park users are ABC1. What kind of argument is that? A bad tax is no better because those who pay it work hard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="10031095000007"></a>Look at the facts: 50 per cent of visitors driving into Richmond Park stay for one to two hours; 66 per cent come at least once a week; and a quarter-dog walkers, nature lovers, people who just like open space-come almost every day. Under these proposals they would pay over £450 a year. An analysis by my honourable friend Justine Greening MP suggests that two-thirds of park visitors would pay more than £100 a year. The average cost would be £213. One of the last free pleasures would suddenly cost a great deal. "Find out what they are doing and tax it", I am afraid, will be Gordon Brown's sad epitaph.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="10031095000008"></a>This pointless measure is also an affront to an old, hard-fought-for privilege of the many, not the few. The Minister lists walking as his recreation. I wonder whether, as a walker, the Minister has the independence of mind to set aside his brief and say, "Yes, we will think again". We have only eight more weeks of this Government, so there is nothing to lose and a lot of personal respect to win.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="10031095000009"></a>Bushy Park is 10 times the size of the Vatican City state and Richmond Park is five times the size of Monaco. If you are old, frail or ill or a woman with a child in a buggy there are parts of the park to which you cannot have access without a car. Such people should not be denied free access. Free access was won in the 18th century by two people, John Lewis and Timothy Bennet, who would once have been the heroes of Labour but whose legacy new Labour wants to set aside. John Lewis, already referred to by the noble Baroness, was a local resident who, in 1758, won a case against a Richmond Park ranger who tried to keep him out. The court ordered entry to the park to be free for all people. The judge said of the entrance:</p>

<p><a name="10031095000050"></a>Free access was duly restored. Now, 250 years later, a Labour Government should not be trying to deny free access again.</p>

The Minister should make himself popular with walkers in these great parks and stay the Government's hand. The parks agency would be well advised to stay its own hand before incurring costs and inflicting hurt on the many thousands who wish to enjoy the rights of free access, which were won by John Lewis and Timothy Bennet long ago. Tonight, as Timothy Bennet said, let us show ourselves unwilling to leave the world a worse place than we find it.</p>

Teddington lies to the north of Bushy Park in the borough of Richmond. For the past several months, we have been campaigning in association with the Friends of Bushy and Home Parks, the Hampton Wick Association and the Hampton Hill Association and with local MPs, such as Vince Cable, and parliamentary candidates, such as the Zac Goldsmith, against the introduction of parking charges in Bushy and Richmond Parks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="10031095000012"></a>Bushy Park does not have the same high profile as Richmond, but is much prized by the people of Teddington and the surrounding areas as, in effect, our local countryside. For noble Lords who are not familiar with the area, Bushy Park lies to the north of Hampton Court Palace and was originally part of its deer park and hunting grounds. It has some attractive 18th century features, including a recently restored cataract, various ponds and a woodland with a meandering stream. However, it is largely used as a source of recreation by local families who wish to bring their children to feed the ducks, to picnic, to fish in the ponds, to run about, or to play on the swings and see-saws in the playground.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="10031095000013"></a>As a nation, we constantly express concern about obese children and the lack of opportunities for children to take exercise informally. Bushy Park goes a long way to counter those problems. To have those open-ended activities constrained by concerns about parking meters would alter the whole nature of the experience and relationship with the park.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="10031095000014"></a>The Minister in another place has argued that there are good public transport links to Bushy Park. These consist of one bus an hour on the north side of the park and would then require a parent with small children to walk the mile to the south side of the park to the children's playground. I understand the financial difficulties of the royal parks but spending nearly £3 million on an unpopular scheme of parking meters and supervision is not the only possible solution. Bushy Park is bisected by a commuter route that is a short cut to Hampton Court Bridge. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of car drivers use this route every day. As the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, suggested, it would be possible to introduce a charge using modern technology such as the congestion charge which would surely enable a toll to be placed on all cars entering the park and would not jeopardise the relationship between local residents and the park. I hope that my noble friend will give further thought to the need to introduce this statutory instrument.</p>

For more than 70 years I have enjoyed Richmond Park-as a small child, as I grew older and indeed, today, well not today exactly but recently. I have been a regular visitor to Richmond Park. I have walked, walked the dog, and had picnics. I have cycled, ridden horses from the local stables and I even skated on Penn Pond and tried to ski, but not very effectively, along with many others who took advantage of the snow in that year.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="10031095000016"></a>It is not only people who live in the west of London who use the park. I now live in the City and I still go there, so I would be slightly sad if only local residents had a right to go and enjoy the park without having to pay a toll. As has already been said, Richmond Park and, indeed, Bushy Park, which I do not know so well, are wonderful places. But more importantly, they fulfil a need for the public to have recreation and exercise. That is one of the things that governments support, for goodness' sake. To have a toll on it is sad. As a former resident and going back now, I cannot remember a single bus that goes anywhere near any of the gates. I am thinking of Kingston, Richmond, Roehampton, Robin Hood and Sheen. There is a long walk. In Richmond, for example, there is no bus to take you up the hill to the Richmond gate. It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest, as the Explanatory Memorandum says in paragraph 7.1 that,</p>
<ul><a name="10031095000060"></a>"introducing parking charges in Richmond and Bushy Park is intended to encourage visitors to consider means of travelling to the parks other than by private car".</ul>
<a name="100310-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="10031095000017"></a>Even if you ride you have to park your car beforehand, and, unless you are a cyclist, how do you take your picnic, dog, children and grandchildren to spend half a day in the park? There is no reasonable way to get there. The suggestion in paragraph 8.5 that discussions on improving bus services are being reopened is pie in the sky. That has been tried before and has never happened. This is not about the land train to go once round the park, which might be nice, but which would take up space, but the facilities to get to the park. As it happens the only way to get there to enjoy it is to go by car.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="10031095000018"></a>It is extraordinarily sad, as other speakers have said, that this Government should want to deprive people of free access to one of the great amenities of west London. It is absolutely extraordinary that this Government would want to do that, and to take no notice of the 84 per cent of the respondents to the consultation who objected. Generally, cars are full of families, dogs and children, out for a happy day for picnics. It is a delightful and utterly respectable outing for families, so it is inappropriate and very unfair to have these regulations. I urge the Government to withdraw and reconsider them.</p>

First, I have been a resident of Richmond for 45 years and have gained tremendous pleasure from Richmond Park as has my family as they grew up. I know Richmond Park much better than Bushy Park, but for those who have not visited Richmond Park it is an astonishing place and a discovery. It is an extraordinary space in the heart of Greater London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="10031095000020"></a>I have a second interest to declare which is that I am chairman of Arcadia, which is the project implementing the Thames Landscape Strategy from Hampton Court to Kew. It is a project that has raised more than £4 million and has involved 105,000 volunteer hours, and it has been a tremendous success. Our report on the Arcadia project states that that reach of the River Thames flows through one of the largest open public spaces in London, which is an area that is unique in its combination of landscaped gardens, habitats, parks and vistas. Richmond Park and Bushy Park are integral to both the project and concept of Arcadia. It has been said of this English landscape and its environmental significance that it is one of the most important and influential gifts that England has given the world, along with the English language and democratic parliamentary government. I am pretty keen on the English language and pretty keen on parliamentary government, and this is the third part of the trilogy.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="10031095000021"></a>It is entirely appropriate and proper that Parliament has a chance tonight to stop this proposal to impose car parking charges in the parks. The environment and the views of Arcadia were first protected by an Act of Parliament just over 100 years ago-indeed, it was a measure introduced in the House of Lords. It was partly to mark the 100th anniversary that we started the Arcadia project in 2002. That Act of Parliament specifically safeguarded the view from Richmond Hill-the view from the terrace and gardens that abut the park. Richmond Park is the great space that lines and protects the Thames landscape. It covers 2,500 acres, which is arguably the biggest park in London, with vistas unmatched and treasured by every generation since Charles I was first challenged to open it to the public. The thrust of Arcadia has been to restore the vistas that link the area, including incidentally the view from the park to St. Paul's Cathedral, and to enhance access. This has happened with astonishing speed and success. Yet-I address particularly the Government Front Bench-tonight we have a move to impose via the Royal Parks Agency substantial charges for parking, which would put a price on access. It is a proposal which can and should be stopped unequivocally tonight.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="10031095000022"></a>Why? The aim of this proposal is to raise money for a number of purposes, but arguably the most important would be to improve the roads that criss-cross the parks, which are of course already heavy with passing traffic. In effect, these motorists are taking a short cut through the park. Yet, those who come to visit, to view and to enjoy the park will be penalised, but not the motorists who are passing through.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="10031095000023"></a>This is a quite extraordinary proposal. What would be the result if this happens? Hundreds of thousands of people visit the parks. If they are deterred by the charges, which will be substantial, as has already been quoted, they will either not come, which would be a terrible pity, or they will park in neighbouring streets, greatly add to congestion in those streets and inconvenience the residents. There is huge concern about this issue among these residents. The figure of 84 per cent has already been quoted today. There is well nigh universal opposition to this proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="10031095000024"></a>Now we come to the strange business of the Conservative Motion. Why are the Conservatives not joining us tonight in support of this fatal Motion? There is a clue in the fact that thousands of households in the Richmond Park constituency have today received a notice. It is described as an "important notice" and comes from the prospective parliamentary candidate for Richmond Park. In bold print he declares:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="10031095000057"></a>"The Conservative Party is absolutely committed to scrapping the charges-if we win the election".</p>

<p><a name="10031095000051"></a>There is the rub. He then adds,</p>
<ul><a name="10031095000061"></a>"and we are trying to stop the charges even before then".</ul>
<p><a name="10031095000052"></a>I suppose that the "before then" means winning the election.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="10031095000025"></a>If that is the case, why do we have this regret Motion? To regret is one thing; to stop it altogether is another. So why propose a feeble Motion instead of a fatal Motion? Why so queasy? I am told that fatal Motions do not appeal. They are perhaps too brutal, too bold and too decisive. The position tonight is clear. We should not regret: we should act and stop this proposed tax-because that is what it is-on the public spaces that so delight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="10031095000026"></a>Free access to Richmond Park and Bushy Park needs to be preserved and protected for all who want to visit and enjoy what the young Alexander Pope called the brightest beauties-superior to "distant fields". It was so then. It is so now.</p>

In particular, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, for her contribution. I know that she is a great supporter of the royal parks and Richmond Park in particular. I got clearly from the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, if I did not realise it before, that there will be a general election. It will not be more keenly fought or fought with more passion than in the Richmond area. That is clear also from the contributions.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="10031095000028"></a>All contributions made clear just how much the royal parks are cherished, not only in this House but by the millions of people who visit them every year. As the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, pointed out, each of the eight parks consists of a listed landscape, and they comprise 5,000 acres. They are enjoyed as places of relaxation, recreation and retreat, and they provide a backdrop to many ceremonial events. As the noble Baroness rightly said, they also provide valuable conservation areas and important habitats for wildlife.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="10031095000029"></a>A number of passionate views have been expressed today opposing the parking charges for Richmond Park and Bushy Park. I have not found the arguments particularly compelling, for reasons which I hope to explain. First, in recognition of the special nature of Richmond Park in particular, but also Bushy Park, Richmond is particularly unusual in that it has a triple whammy: it is a designated site of special scientific interest, a national nature reserve and a European special area of conservation. As long ago as 1996, Dame Jennifer Jenkins in a report on Richmond Park stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="10031095000058"></a>"Measures must be taken to alleviate existing pressures and ... to prevent future traffic growth".</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_311"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column 311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="10031095000053"></a>The report went on to say that in cities and elsewhere, charges have become an acceptable means of sharing the use of existing parking space and encouraging some people to make greater use of public transport. Richmond Park should be no different. She also made observations about Bushy Park.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="10031095000030"></a>Anyone visiting the parks can see the obvious negative impact of traffic. It is not unusual to see cars queuing along the road outside the park waiting to enter the car parks. At popular times, parking areas can be full by mid-morning. Not only does that diminish the special ambiance of the parks, but it leads to degradation of the roads and the car parks, as has been emphasised by several speakers. It is estimated that £2.7 million is needed to be spent to bring the car parks in Richmond Park up to an acceptable standard, including-this is an important point-installing environmentally appropriate petrol interceptor drainage that will reduce the pollutants entering the soil, which the noble Baroness mentioned in her opening speech. Maintaining the roads, the car parks and other park infrastructure is an ongoing process. The fabric is under constant pressure. It is estimated that the accumulated works maintenance and liability across the royal parks is £58 million.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="10031095000031"></a>Noble Lords have referred to access. The royal parks are free to everyone and will remain so. There is no question of access being denied. We are looking at the cars that enter not for access but to park. We do not want to create barriers to people visiting the park. We want to encourage people to visit by means other than their car when they can. As has been quoted in the percentage figures, I recognise that there has been a great deal of local opposition to introducing charges. In some ways that is not really surprising.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="10031095000032"></a>Who enjoys paying for parking, particularly if it has been free in the past? But it is wrong to suggest that what is being proposed for Richmond Park and Bushy Park is in any way exceptional. It is not. All the other royal parks with public parking provision-Greenwich, Regent's Park and Hyde Park-charge for parking and have done so for a number of years. In the past three years, parking in those car parks delivered to the agency a net income of £1.4 million, all of which was reinvested into the parks. Many local authorities, public bodies and private facilities charge for parking. In and around Richmond and in Bushy Park, the parks could be said to be unusual in that parking remains free.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="10031095000033"></a>Much has been made of the substantial charges being made. It has been suggested that it was wrong in some way to measure the socio-economic background of people using the park. But, as one of the criticisms was a fear that poor people, rather than less-poor people, would be particularly impacted, it was sensible to find out who uses the park on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, I do not apologise for that inquiry or for the results which show very much that socio-economic groups A, B and C use the park most extensively, whereas socio-economic groups D and E use them only to the extent of 4 per cent or 5 per cent.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="10031095000034"></a>The proposed level of charge is 50 pence for an hour, up to a maximum of £2 for a whole day in Bushy Park, and £1 an hour, up to an all-day maximum of £3 in Richmond Park, which I would argue is not

Indeed, it is and will remain less than that for other royal parks. Blue badge holders will not be charged for parking. The charges are not set in a manner that would make them punitive, but we lack some form of deterrent. At the moment, there is no disincentive whatever to bringing your car into the park, even for those who live a short distance away. It is estimated that 17 per cent of the users of Richmond Park and 31 per cent of the users of Bushy Park live within a mile of the parks.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="10031095000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, went to great trouble to look up my hobbies-I am very flattered-and he pointed out that walking is one of them. Yes, it is, and I recommend Talkin Tarn, which is the remainder of an Icelandic lake near Brampton in Cumbria. You cannot get there by public transport but you can park your car, for which you are charged. I recommend it as a place to walk round; it is spectacular. It is in the charge and ownership of Cumbria County Council, and therefore Cumbria taxpayers like me pay council tax and also pay for the privilege of parking there.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="10031095000036"></a>The Royal Parks do not belong to the borough of Richmond or to the people of London; they are national treasures which belong to all of us. The good burghers of Richmond in Yorkshire are paying the same contribution as the burghers of Richmond in Surrey, so, in that sense, the charges cannot be excessive.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="10031095000037"></a>The question of public transport links to Richmond and Bushy Parks brought out a great deal of sympathy among noble Lords. Several bus routes stop within walking distance to the parks but I accept that, for some people, travelling there by public transport could be inconvenient. The Royal Parks Agency has offered to accommodate a public bus service to Richmond Park, subject to appropriate support from local authorities and transport for riders. I understand that negotiations are ongoing-I do not necessarily share the pessimism of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, on this-and that the agency is also looking at the viability of a land train through Richmond Park.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="10031095000038"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Watson of Richmond, referred to the problem of displacement. One can see that people have a reasonable concern that all that will happen is that drivers who do not want to pay the charge will park their cars in the surrounding streets. The agency realised that that concern had some traction-if you will pardon the pun-and so commissioned independent research on the issue. That research came to the conclusion that displacement parking in the streets around the parks was unlikely to occur as a result of charging. The boroughs surrounding the parks have a range of parking control measures at their disposal already, including controlled parking zones, of which some are already in place.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="10031095000039"></a>On the issue of bus services in the areas of the parks, I am told that 10 bus routes run in the vicinity of Richmond Park and a dozen in the vicinity of Bushy Park. While the railway stations around Richmond Park are some distance away, the stations around Bushy Park are only some 15 minutes away. It is true, as has been said, that this will have some impact on those who are physically impaired and on families who have to carry their goods for picnic. If you are

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="10031095000040"></a>The key point of toll roads was made eloquently by both my noble friend Lady Hilton and the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, in moving her Motion. We considered the issue of using road tolls as an alternative in both 1998 and the early part of this century. I can see why the suggestion would be supported by those who would prefer it to the parking charge, but when we tested this in 2002 only 20 per cent of those consulted had a favourable view of road tolls and 67 per cent opposed them. So if we introduced them, all we would do is change the lobby of opposition from static to mobile and from the immediate environs of Richmond and Bushy Parks to a slightly wider area. Although the issue may be looked at again in future, at present there are no plans for toll roads.</p>

<a name="100310-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="10031095000041"></a>It has also been suggested that the measure is being forced on the agency because of cuts in its aid grant and a demand that it raises more of its own revenue. It is true that the Royal Parks have been highly successful in raising income-from £3 million in 1997-98 to £13 million in 2008-09. This has reduced the agency's dependency on the public purse, which must be a good thing as we go into an era of greater public stringency in the revenue and income available for investment in public services, a point which has been stressed in particular by the opposition parties. However, the key is that the agency invests back into the Royal Parks all the moneys that are raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="10031095000042"></a>The proposals that we are putting forward in these park regulations are about managing the parks for the benefit of the present and future generations. Some have criticised the proposals as exceptional and unreasonable; I hope that I have proved that they are not inasmuch as they already exist in other Royal Parks. As I have said, the Royal Parks are funded by central government and have an international reputation. They need to be continually managed in the light of new challenges and the changes in behaviour of visitors, or the danger is that we will destroy the very things that we value so much.</p>

In particular, it was a great pleasure to hear the warm words said about Richmond and Bushy Parks. The Minister has not addressed the issue of the pressure caused by through traffic using the park as part of the road network. This is a problem for Richmond Park. The problem is not the people who go to the car parks to enjoy the park for the day and to picnic, it is the through traffic-and that does not apply to all parks.</p>

<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="10031098000001"></a><b><a name="100310-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10031098000071"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> My Lords, I have given notice that we oppose Clause 1 standing part of the Bill and, for the convenience of the Committee, I have grouped Clauses 2, 3 and 4 stand part with Clause 1, as my reasons for opposition strike at the totality of these clauses and not merely at Clause 1.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="10031098000002"></a>The Council for Financial Stability is not much more than the tripartite arrangements given a fancy title. A couple of pages of legislation cannot create substance when none exists. We know that the only reason why the tripartite arrangements are being preserved in the Bill is that they were invented by the Prime Minister, and there is no recorded occasion when he has admitted that he personally has got something wrong. It is not in his nature.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="10031098000003"></a>That the tripartite arrangements failed is not just the opinion of my party; it is also the opinion of the Labour-dominated Treasury Select Committee in another place. That is what it found in its report on Northern Rock, entitled <I>The </I><I>R</I><I>un on the Rock</I>. Turf wars between the three parties meant that even when issues were identified nothing was done. The tripartite authorities had hardly met formally at principal level until the Northern Rock crisis. The bank issued careful analysis of the excessive leverage building up, but the three did not sit down to discuss the issues. In a rational world, the Government would have looked at the arrangements and concluded that they were bust and needed to be radically overhauled. Instead, we have the cosmetic, window-dressing solution of these clauses, which make the parties meet to discuss the analysis that each produces. If anyone thinks that this is more than a superficial approach, they need look no further than the evidence of the Financial Secretary to the Public Bill Committee in another place when he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="10031098000062"></a>"What we are doing through the Council for Financial Stability is formalising arrangements that have already been in existence".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Financial Services Bill Committee, 8/12/09; col. 5.]</p>

<p><a name="10031098000060"></a>There we have it.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="10031098000004"></a>This Bill will give us nothing more than the failed tripartite arrangements. There is nothing in this new council to give us any confidence that they will not fail us again. Doubtless, if exactly the same circumstances arose, while those on the council have the memory of the recent financial crisis still in their minds, the same mistakes will not be made. The Banking Act 2009, which we supported, created more efficient tools in the special resolution regime. We will have no confidence that the old arrangements in their new clothes will be able to anticipate, let alone respond, to any new crisis. As the director of the Building Societies Association said when he gave evidence to the Public Bill Committee in the other place:</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="10031098000005"></a>We oppose these clauses because they do not address the fundamental flaws in the structure created in 1997 by the Prime Minister. The big idea of the first few days of the then Chancellor was monetary policy independence for the Bank of England, which has been widely supported. But he was not content with one big idea; he had to have another one, which involved wrecking the link between the detailed work of banking supervision, which we now refer to as micro-prudential supervision, and the overall understanding and analysis of developments in financial markets, which we now refer to as macro-prudential supervision.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="10031098000006"></a>The Prime Minister deluded himself that he was generating value by creating the huge organisation of the FSA out of the various supervisory bodies already in existence and transferring to it the Bank of England's banking supervision role. We now know that he destroyed value because the dislocation between micro and macro-prudential supervision meant that the build-up of excessive debt went almost unnoticed and was certainly not acted upon. The Bank of England, with its rather ill-defined non-statutory function relating to financial stability, did analyse it, but nothing happened in practical terms. The Chancellor was not interested because excessive borrowing was what was underpinning the illusion of a bust-free boom. The FSA, if it was interested, did nothing.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="10031098000007"></a>Even the Prime Minister knew back then, in 1997, that he was playing a dangerous game and that the system would be more vulnerable with three separate players in the area of financial stability. At least, I think that that is why he created the tripartite authorities with their own memorandum of understanding. He must have realised that his new structure had gaps and that something needed to compensate for that. It did not work and this country is paying the price for the failure of the tripartite arrangements.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="10031098000008"></a>The Government's narrative has always been that all of the problems derived from the global financial crisis. We do not deny the existence of the global financial crisis, but the way that it hit the UK, which has a uniquely high dependence on the financial services sector and a small number of systemically important organisations, can be laid at the door of the tripartite arrangements. The UK cannot blame what happened wholly on the rest of the world because the architecture created by the Prime Minister when he was Chancellor was itself a big part of the problem when put to the test.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="10031098000009"></a>That is the background to my party's policy, which is to ensure that never again will micro-prudential supervision of systemically important organisations be severed from macro-prudential supervision. The shorthand for this is returning banking supervision to the Bank of England, but it is of course much more than that. Under our proposals the bank will assume more responsibilities than it shed in 1997.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="10031098000010"></a>We all know that there is not one model of supervision in the main financial centres and that the impact of the global financial crisis cannot be correlated with any particular supervisory architecture. However, it is interesting to note that the US has recently decided that the Federal Reserve Bank will continue to supervise

The tide is not running towards the separation of macro and micro-prudential supervision.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="10031098000011"></a>In addition, we will be separating out of the FSA its consumer functions and placing them in a separate consumer agency. Anyone in the City will know that, until the last couple of years, the FSA was dominated by its treating-customers-fairly agenda. I do not know how or why this happened; that will repay careful study at some time. In our view it contributed to the FSA's lack of focus on prudential supervision. This, too, will not be allowed to happen again. Both consumer protection and prudential supervision are important, but they are not the same and they should not be confused in the same body.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="10031098000012"></a>Whether or not the population of our country allow my party to form the next Government in a couple of months' time remains to be seen. If we do form the next Government, we are quite clear that Clauses 1 to 4 of this Bill are not part of our vision of the future arrangements for financial stability. However, even if we do not form the next Government, we would still oppose these clauses. They are half-baked for the reasons that I have outlined in other amendments today. They do not answer who is in charge or deal with the powers that are needed. Most importantly, they are a mere cosmetic patch applied to conceal what ought to be made plain-that the tripartite arrangements did not work and are unlikely to deliver in future. For these reasons we oppose these clauses standing part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="10031098000013"></a><b><a name="100310-0012.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10031098000072"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, we disagree with both the analysis and the prescription that the noble Baroness has just given. In terms of the analysis, she places a pretty large burden on the tripartite arrangement-the architecture for the problems which we faced in the UK-and yet she said that the Chancellor was not interested in the asset bubble. From evidence that he gave when I was a member of the Economic Affairs Select Committee of your Lordships' House, we know that the Government did not believe that the Bank of England should worry about asset bubbles either. Let us suppose that, at that stage, only two bodies were responsible for supervising the macroeconomic financial situation-a Chancellor who was uninterested, and a Government who did not believe, that the bank should be worrying about bubbles. Would that have changed the way that matters went? No, it would not. The Government and regulation were caught up in the bubble just as much as the banks were. Therefore, to argue for the collapsing of three into two, when the heads of the two were not interested, as the noble Baroness has just said, seems not to be an effective analysis of why we got into the mess that we did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="10031098000014"></a>As for the prescription, my question for the noble Baroness and her colleagues who are going to speak is: why, when I go and have meetings and dinners in the City or meet people who work there, do at least three-quarters of them not believe that this is an effective change and believe that it is merely changing the name plate on the FSA's door? That is the reality of this. I know that the noble Baroness and some of

This seems to me, as someone who does not work in the City but observes it and talks to people in it, to be a serious flaw-it is going to be a problem for her party.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="10031098000015"></a>No one can claim that the tripartite system worked well, or that any system anywhere worked well. As the noble Baroness said, the success or failure of the system cannot be correlated with any financial supervisory architecture. We agree. The key thing that has changed, and that needs to change, is the attitude of the people at the top. The shock that they have been given by this terrible collapse will mean that their attitudes are now very different from those that they adopted before. Those attitudes are not coloured in the slightest by whether they are part of the FSA, part of the Bank, part of a duopoly running the system or part of a tripartite arrangement. It is a question of experience and changing attitudes. The best hope for an effective regulatory system is the shock that they have had in terms of the way that they manage their regulatory affairs, rather than the structure in which they operate.</p>

I firmly believe that it is necessary that the Bank of England should again assume ultimate overall responsibility for financial supervision. Call it macro, micro or what you will, the separation of the macro from the micro was undoubtedly a contributory cause of all parties' eyes being somewhat off the ball as the financial crisis developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="10031098000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, suggests that three-quarters of those who work in the City do not agree with my party's solution to the problem, to re-empower the Bank of England as being in overall charge of financial supervision. However, what answer does the noble Lord think he would get if he asked people who work in the City whether they think that the FSA has correctly and properly conducted financial supervision over the 10 years or more that it has been in existence? He might find that, again, at least 75 per cent of those who answered said no. In my experience, most people think that the FSA was too much an internal organisation, having meetings with itself or going to harmonisation conferences all the time and not actually spending enough time on prudential supervision. Why? Because it was separated from the real, ultimate responsibility for the macro-prudential supervision, which was at the Bank of England.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="10031098000018"></a>Whether the FSA is completely abolished, or is simply made to report to the Bank of England with regard to prudential supervision, does not matter so much. If the noble Lord asked people in the City whether they thought that the FSA ought to report ultimately to the governor or to the Bank of England, again he would find that a majority of practitioners supported that view.</p>

We know that it is inconceivable that this clause is likely to become law, yet we are going through the motions of debating and amending it. We have had a number of interesting debates on various aspects of economic management, but the reality is that this clause simply formalises the failure of the tri-part system. Instead of getting rid of it, the clause continues the process and merely seeks to ensure that the people in the tri-part system do their job in the way which they ought to be doing without any legislative provision whatever.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="10031098000021"></a>One of the important things that we need to do about regulation in the City is to restore the authority of the regulators. It used to be the case that the authority of the Governor of the Bank of England was hugely influential. It used to be said that even his raising his eyebrows was sufficient to terrify bankers. That is no longer the case, but we can do something to avoid a situation where authority is divided between the governor on the one hand, with his historic role in these matters, and the FSA on the other. Therefore I believe that the proposals put forward by my party concerning this are entirely to be supported, and that the continuing division of authority as the Government propose in the Bill is certainly a mistake.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="10031098000022"></a>We have debated a number of aspects of this clause, but I want to raise one other point. There is at the moment a fashion to invent new economic expressions, of which the most pervasive is that of quantitative easing, when all one used to refer to was increasing the money supply. Now we suddenly have another: macro-prudential regulation. It is not the least bit clear what that means. In fact, it is likely to lead to considerable confusion because there are two separate things.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="10031098000023"></a>The first is the macroeconomic management of the economy. It is certainly important, to avoid future disasters of the kind that we have just had, that that should be operated properly. However, that is rightly the concern of the Treasury and to some extent the Bank of England, with the powers which the present Prime Minister gave it back in 1997-98-although, as I have pointed out on many occasions in this House, monetary policy was not transferred to the Bank of England; all that was transferred was the right to set a single interest rate in the hope that other people would follow. Control of the money supply continued to be taken away by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer by removing the Debt Management Office from the Bank to the Treasury. We therefore have an extremely unsatisfactory situation regarding the macroeconomic management side.</p>

<a name="100310-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="10031098000024"></a>However, we also have the question of microeconomic management and regulation, which at the moment falls to be undertaken jointly by the FSA and, to some extent I suppose, by the Bank. The use of that expression "macro-prudential regulation" totally confuses the distinction between macroeconomic management on the one hand and micro-regulation on the other. That might affect major banks of a very significant size that may put forward or introduce macroeconomic instability into the economy. However, that is really a separate operation from macroeconomic management. It is important not to use this expression, which I believe is

Having said that, I remain of the view, as my noble friend knows, that this clause is mere window dressing. It is not likely to do more than formalise the problems we have faced over the past few years, and to that extent it is not the way to go forward.</p>

If you start a very important and large institution, which had forebears, and it is a failure, it is very seldom-I should like the noble Lord, Lord Newby, to find me an example-that anyone can put the culture and performance of that institution right. Institutions acquire a character of their own in their very early years. When it goes well, it is brilliantly unchangeable, whoever happens to be in charge. But if they acquire the wrong character right at the beginning, it is virtually impossible to put them right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="10031098000027"></a>At one point she said that one of the problems with the FSA was that it was taking too much time engaging in consumer protection. I declare my interest as chair of Consumer Focus. That canard, which has run through quite a lot of commentary on the failures of the banking regulation system, is a complete misinterpretation. We have to ask ourselves what the banking system is for. The banking system is not for itself, nor is it for the City of London. It has a good benefit on the balance of payments in making a profit, and we should recognise that, but essentially the banking system is to provide the oil and the money to ensure that the rest of the economy and society operate. Its responsibility is to its depositors, to those who take loans from it and to the other people who take up its financial services. It is therefore an absurd argument to say that the regulator has undermined the industry by forcing it to take too much notice of its customers. If you step back and think whether it could make sense to apply that to any other industry, then the absurdity becomes apparent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="10031098000028"></a>I had some criticisms of the FSA and the way it pursued its consumer protection agenda-I still have, and I still have some concerns that the Bill might be slightly diluting that. However, the alternative which the noble Baroness and, as I understand it, the Conservative Party are proposing is the abolition of the FSA and the complete separation of the issue of supervision of the financial system from its responsibility to its customers. There will be another quango with no leverage and much less authority which will look after consumer protection. That is a move in completely the wrong direction. We need to associate all forms of supervision of the financial sector with its responsibilities to the business and individual consumers of the services of that industry. If that fails, then it is not just the banking system or a few banks which fail; it is the whole economy, with wider implications for society, individuals and families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="10031098000029"></a>This is admittedly a pretty substantial failure of financial regulation here and in other parts of the world. However, if the conclusion we draw is that the regulators should stop worrying about consumers, whether they are businesses or individuals, and start worrying solely about macroeconomic affairs, then that is the wrong conclusion. The two have to go together. The banks have to operate on a prudential basis, and they should be supervised more effectively by the regulator in that regard. That also has to go with the way in which the banks are performing a service to the rest of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="10031098000030"></a>Therefore, the solution that seems to be behind the opposition to this clause standing part, and the policy of the Opposition in this regard, is taking us down a blind alley. I much prefer, with a few criticisms which I may voice later in Committee, the approach that the Government are taking to tighten up the regulation and leave a regulator which is looking after both sides of the performance of the financial sector, and not just one.</p>

In the past three or four hours we have teased out of the noble Lord, Lord Myners, several interesting aspects of these clauses. We are essentially formalising an existing structure. It did not work that well and a lot of the top people did not turn up, but good deputies came so that was all right. When push came to shove, it did not work at all well, so we will put some more bells and whistles on it and give it a bit more formal structure, which will now make it fit for purpose.</p>

Who will take responsibility for some of the points that he has raised? Where I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Newby, is over the need for some analysis. We need to consider carefully how we can draw the best lessons from the crisis that we have been through and are still going through.

In this case, the Government are following the old saying that generals prepare to fight the battles of the last war. This structure is designed for the last war. The next war will not at all be in this shape. We are creating a bureaucracy and structure that will not help us to look forward; it looks backwards.

I will not waste the Committee's time by repeating those arguments, except to say that the Minister has not been in the least convincing that, with responsibility split three ways, there is anything but another disaster in the making. It has been clear from our debate, as several of my noble friends have pointed out, that the proposed arrangements are nothing but the old ones in a different piece of rather shoddy wrapping paper. There is nothing fundamentally new. I wish only that there was some way that the Government could come to their senses and see that they are in the act of perpetuating a horror story.</p>

It is rather remarkable that we are asked to stand here and say that the FSA is the most magnificent organisation and should be left in place. It seems quite obvious that the FSA has failed abysmally. This is despite the assurance that I have been given by the noble Lord, Lord Myners, and which was mentioned earlier when we discussed my amendment, that all the people responsible for banking regulation have been moved over into the FSA. So in theory, if everything was going to go on as it was before, under the Bank of England, the regulation of banks would continue and that would all go very smoothly. Quite clearly, when we look at Northern Rock, that was not the case. Northern Rock was an abysmal failure, and much of the blame has to be placed at the feet of the FSA.</p>

<p><a name="10031098000061"></a>One of the problems which the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, might admit is that when it comes to regulation, the people who are sharp and on-the-ball and make a lot of sense go off and make money and earn enormous bonuses and God knows what else. The people who cannot do it-and I hate to say this and have no wish to demoralise the FSA-are the people who end up working as regulators. So they are all behind the curve anyway and the people they are trying to regulate are a hell of a lot cleverer than the people in the FSA.</p>

<a name="100310-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="10031098000037"></a>If we look back on the Bank of England, it had a much better reputation for being slightly ahead of all the people it was trying to regulate, rather than behind them. That is certainly not true of the FSA, which proved itself to be very good at protecting consumers-taking up complaints from people who had invested their money wrongly-and I have no objection to the role it played doing that. However, when it came to the big decisions, as to whether it should actually move in on Northern Rock, and deem the whole of its business plan completely faulty, totally indefensible and unworkable because it was borrowing short-term money and lending long, that is when the FSA completely failed. Therefore, I cannot understand why we should have any confidence in the FSA.</p>

The failure of the tripartite authorities to anticipate, prevent or even mitigate the damaging effects of the crisis is there for all to see. However, rather than tackling the confusion inherent in the regulatory structure, which led the Governor of the Bank of England to ask who was in charge, the Bill simply puts the tripartite standing committee on a statutory footing, operating under terms of reference practically identical to the Memorandum of Understanding that governed the old standing committee.</p>

<a name="100310-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="10031098000039"></a>This measure is misconceived, because it fails to get to the root of regulatory failure. We need real regulatory reform, learning the lessons of the financial crisis. Real reforms mean an enhanced role for the Bank of England, including putting it in charge of prudential supervision of all significant institutions. As the noble Lord, Lord Howard, has said, in the old days, the Bank of England genuinely seemed to be ahead of the game. But in cases such as Northern Rock, it seems to me that the FSA supervisors had expertise only in insurance matters, so no wonder they failed to realise that Northern Rock's lending was expanding at a completely uncontrollable rate, and it was lending at 120 per cent of property values. I support my noble friend.</p>

The Government's position is quite clear: we seek to retain these clauses in the Bill. I emphasise the context in which we are working. In the White Paper <I>Reforming Financial Markets</I><I>, </I>the Government undertook a considered analysis of the financial crisis. I understand the points noble Lords have made about things that went wrong. Of course things went wrong: that is why we had a White Paper and why we have legislation derived from it.</p>

The simple fact is that the Opposition make a great deal of criticism of the structure that was in place in the United Kingdom, particularly regarding the Financial Services Authority-and I of course recognise the validity of that criticism. That is why we are proposing reforms of the FSA; but one cannot conclude from that that the structure was wrong, particularly as the Opposition in all their contributions have not indicated why other institutional structures different from this framework also failed. They suggested that we are fighting the last war, which is always an easy epithet to put to anyone concerned with analysing a problem in order to do better in the future, but it is at least as important to learn the lessons of the past to make the reforms necessary to ensure that we make a better fist of the situation in the future.</p>

They have been well documented. Over the past two years we have rehearsed in this Chamber and the other place weaknesses in the position. That is why this Bill provides for an operation of the three institutions that is different from what obtained in the past. However, I shall not accept that the institutional structure per se was responsible for the financial crisis which overwhelmed every significant economy in the world. Every institutional structure failed accurately to foresee that position.</p>

In many ways, it is a reasonable analysis to say that others went earlier. After all, in terms of the real problems with regard to the banks' toxic assets, the issue was much more apparent and happened earlier in the United States of America than it did here. Noble Lords identified that Northern Rock was a serious failure. Indeed it was, but I cannot remember any noble Lord from the Opposition rushing to support the Government when we actually produced legislation to deal with Northern Rock. I cannot remember any commitment to match the Government's action in those terms. I understand that the Opposition did not object. There is a difference between not objecting to what the Government are doing and being at the forefront of action that should be taken.

We all recognise that, but it is against a background where the Government were being constructive in their response to the nature of the problem. I give credit to the Opposition on the Banking Act: there was considerable assistance there. Yet no opportunity was lost to suggest a failure of government, when in fact Northern Rock presaged what we then saw of the great difficulties with American banks and subsequently with the British banking system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="10031098000048"></a>I emphasise that it will not do for the Opposition to suggest that what went wrong at that time was something different, separate and unique-the result of the institutional structure operating in Britain at that time. That will not hold, even with the point about Canada. I doubt the extent to which the noble Baroness can stretch that example. The institutional structure in Canada is somewhat closer to the system that the Government are proposing in this Bill than it is to the noble Baroness's proposals and her party's position on the situation. I am not prepared to accept that challenge either.</p>

<a name="100310-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="10031098000049"></a>The issue here is learning from the past and being in a position to make the right judgments, not merely changing the institutional structures. It will not do to move specific responsibilities from one body to another, as the noble Baroness suggests-thereby suggesting, in passing, her criticism of the Government because blame attached to the FSA indicates that the structure was at fault. We will not see a significant improvement in the position by just moving the furniture of the institutional structures. The Government are concerned that we learn the lessons of the past with regard to the institutional structure and how it functioned, but guarantee that we have a framework in which its judgments are more effective and accurate in the future. After all, the main institutional functions-those of a central bank, a financial regulator, and a financial and economic ministry or Treasury-are central to the maintenance of financial stability in every major economy. They may reach different positions on the nature of their institutions but they all have those three concepts to underpin their approach to financial stability. The United Kingdom position is no different from that.</p>

This Bill indicates how the three institutions that I just identified are bound to play their part. The three functions have to be fulfilled in every economy with regard to financial stability. The essence is to make sure that they work effectively together to guarantee that we do not repeat weaknesses of the past. Clearly the communication and understanding between them about the development of that bubble was why the catastrophe occurred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="10031098000052"></a>Therefore, we conclude that the tripartite model is the right one. We intend to remain committed to the approach of having a single, independent financial services regulator in the form of the FSA, but it has to work better and we intend that it will. The council builds on the existing model, which the Government continue to believe is the right one, but it will bring real improvements compared with the old standing committee functions. Most importantly, it places financial stability arrangements on a more formal, transparent and accountable basis. We will make sure that there is more formality, for example, because the terms of reference are in the Bill laid before Parliament. We will

Why, when almost every organisation in every country throughout the entire world runs a single chain of command rather than dividing it into three, should it suddenly work so well for him when he divides his chain of command into three?</p>

<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="10031098000054"></a><b><a name="100310-0013.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="10031098000090"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> Why does the noble Lord think that under the structure there will be a chain of command of three equals? When I have finished describing how it is intended to work, I will indicate-and it is also described in the Bill-where authority lies. His model, to which I imagine he, as a loyal Back-Bencher, and his Front Bench subscribe, also has divided command. Who is meant to be the decision-taker under the Conservative model? Is it the Governor of the Bank of England or the Chancellor of the Exchequer? Within the framework put forward by the Opposition, is there not a bifurcation of function and therefore the potential for collision of command? The noble Baroness shakes her head, but she is going to resolve that situation in the same way that we are with regard to the tripartite position; namely, it will be essential that the structure is open and accountable, and the three will have to work together in terms of effective co-operation. Of course, each organisation will have a single command and clearly defined responsibilities, but we are guaranteeing that we will set out in the framework of the Bill the constraints of partnership required to resolve that issue. There will be a need to work together-something that manifestly failed with regard to the FSA and the other organisations during the build-up to the last financial crisis.</p>

<a name="100310-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="10031098000055"></a>I was going on to indicate that the third dimension that we are concerned about is accountability. The annual report on the council by the Treasury will enable full parliamentary scrutiny each year of the progress by, and work of, the council. That will underpin the structure in an open and accountable way and help to produce the remedies to the situation that obtained in the past. Within this framework I also want to emphasise that, even under the model that has been put forward by the Opposition this evening, the crucial issue will still be the exercise of judgment. It will not be the institutional structure that is crucial but the judgment to which it gives effect. We maintain that the FSA still has a valuable and important role to play within the structure-a role greatly advanced by the framework that the Bill creates in relation to all three institutions. The Bill creates a much more formal structure. It establishes a Council for Financial Stability to replace the standing committee and its membership is clear: the Governor of the Bank of England, the chairman of the FSA and the Chancellor as chair. Within that framework and following our White Paper, the Bill indicates the lessons which needed to be learnt from the crisis which we have all been through and which has been so painful for the economy and for our people. Building on that, we will create a structure which, in Clauses 1 to 4 of the Bill, is absolutely crucial and which I defend, advocate and propose.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Newby, challenged me on why three-quarters of the people he met did not believe in the prescription put forward by my party. I cannot say whom he meets in the City, but that is perhaps reconcilable with the view of my noble friend Lord Trenchard that three-quarters of the people do not think that the FSA is effective.</p>

<a name="100310-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="10031098000057"></a>If you ask people in the City whether they want change, on the whole they say no, and that they prefer the devil they know. But if you ask another question about whether there is a joined-up approach between macro and micro-prudential, they will agree with us. It depends which question is asked and it depends whether they want the FSA to be abolished or whether they want more effective macro and micro-prudential regulation. They are different aspects of the policy. I accept that there can be different views. We say that the most important thing is the joining up again of macro and micro-prudential supervision. I apologise to my noble friends who cannot bear those terms; I have got rather used to using them. Although I accept that they are inelegant, they have meaning to those of us who have learnt how to use them.</p>

<a name="100310-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="10031098000058"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that I am sorry if he misunderstood what we are trying to say about consumer protection. I think he suggested that our proposals for a new consumer protection authority would have no leverage and no authority. That is absolutely not what we wish to create. Putting consumer protection and prudential supervision together means that probably neither is done completely effectively. We certainly believe that consumer protection masked the other. That is why we believe that we will have better consumer protection with a dedicated consumer protection agency. It is not our desire to create a weak piece of the system; our intention is to create something that is a strong part of the system. I hope he understands that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="10031098000059"></a>I thank my noble friends who have spoken, all of whom have supported the fact that the FSA failed, the tripartite arrangements failed and this Bill has a cosmetic response. The Minister seems to be in denial about that. He said that our policies would have a bifurcation function, but that is not so. We are reuniting macro and micro-prudential supervision. The Government's proposals keep them apart. The Minister has not rebutted our charge that these are merely cosmetic changes which create no change in substance. We will return to these clauses at another time, either on the Floor of this Chamber or in the process that we discussed earlier, known as wash-up. That is all I have to say on Clause 1 stand part.</p>

The amendment would add a new subsection to Clause 2. Under Clause 2(1) the Council for Financial Stability must meet in each quarter of each calendar year, which is a rather curious formulation. It could mean that the council met at the end of one quarter and then again at the beginning of the next, with perhaps only a few days between so-called quarterly meetings. I hope that in practice the council will not meet in this way. My amendment would give transparency to meeting dates by requiring the council to publish them at least 12 months in advance.</p>

<a name="100310-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="100310101000002"></a>There is a substantive reason for making meeting dates well in advance. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is required to meet monthly and the outcome of those meetings is watched carefully by financial markets. The Bank, being mindful of that, publishes the meeting schedule of the MPC well in advance. The meeting dates of the MPC are already well known for 2011. The meeting dates for the Council for Financial Stability may never have the high drama of the monthly decision on interest rates. The minutes of the first meeting that I have seen have nothing in them to interest markets, let alone move them. Nevertheless the topics discussed could become much more relevant to financial markets over time if, for example, it was clear that the council was watching excessive leverage building up or was considering actions necessary to counter it. It is just as likely to be on another topic, but I cite leverage because we are familiar with it as an issue from the recent financial crisis.</p>

<a name="100310-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="100310101000003"></a>If the way in which the council works becomes part of the framework of information which markets look to, some certainty about its meeting schedule would be highly desirable. That is what has been suggested by the British Bankers' Association. I hope that the Minister sees the sense of that. I beg to move.</p>

We have a little concern about a statutory requirement to schedule them 12 months in advance. After all, there might be global economic or political events that make the proposed dates difficult. We do not believe that a statutory requirement is appropriate. The terms of reference are a more appropriate vehicle for such procedural matters. If the noble Baroness persists and indicates in her wind-up that she feels very strongly about this, I would recognise that the terms of reference could have a firmer commitment and we might reconsider this in drafting the final version, with the intention of a more significant form of schedule than the one that dissatisfies the noble Baroness at the moment.</p>

Under Clause 2(2) the Council for Financial Stability must consider any such reports at its next quarterly meeting. I shall leave aside the leisurely approach to risks that this timetable implies. I would hope that if the FSA or the Bank of England produced a report which highlighted serious risks, perhaps imminent risks, the Council for Financial Stability would not sit back and content itself with the fact that a meeting was already scheduled for, say, two months' time. Clause 2(6) allows the council to meet more often than quarterly and we have to hope that the council would meet when necessary. As I understand it, the shadow council is already meeting more than quarterly.</p>

<p><a name="100310101000027"></a>It is clear that the Bank of England's warnings on excessive debt, as set out in its financial stability review, were not acted upon. It is also true that the

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="100310101000009"></a>When this amendment was debated in another place, the Minister said that it was unnecessary because all this is dealt with in the terms of reference, which will be issued under Clause 1(5), which we debated earlier. I put it to the Minister that that is not an adequate response. The terms of reference are subject to no parliamentary procedure and will say whatever the Treasury wants them to say from time to time. But let us assume that the current draft of the terms of reference represent what the Treasury intend to issue formally if this Bill becomes law. Does it do what my amendment asks for?</p>

At the other extreme, there is the minimalist school, which records not much more than the headings of any papers discussed, together, where necessary, with the formal decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="100310101000012"></a>Under the terms of reference, the minutes could be anywhere on the spectrum. My amendment seeks to ensure that the minutes contain the response to risks identified by reports which the council considers. These minutes will be a public document and the Government have stressed that they are an important component of transparency. As we have debated earlier today, the Government have claimed that transparency is one of the key features of the new arrangements, but the Bill does not ensure that, in this key area, the council's response to risks is achieved.

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="100310101000015"></a>At all events, in relation to my noble friend's amendment, surely it is not enough to go through the procedure here and then, the report having been considered by the council, for the council not to say what it proposes to do about the risks that have been mentioned. Presumably it will not simply sit there and say, "We have received this report. There are risks to the UK economy", and that is it. My noble friend's amendment is entirely appropriate.</p>

To have different risks put up by different groups is a recipe for disaster and misunderstanding. We need a unified approach and a unified response. One of the problems in the background to the crisis we have had was that businesses, whether in the wider economy or financial services, were not clear as to exactly what the risks were. There were different views of what the risks were. Therefore, a clear statement of what the response to the risks should be would send a signal to the country-whether within the City or within industry at large-on the dangers that lie ahead and what the council believes is the appropriate response. It is a way to stop bubbles growing as it enables a clear response to be made to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="100310101000017"></a>The Minister was generous in his response on Amendment 12. I cannot see why he cannot be generous in response to this amendment too. It is very important to get clarity in this area so that everyone is at exactly the same place in the economic cycle.</p>

<a name="100310-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="100310101000019"></a>We certainly share both the ambition outlined by the noble Baroness in her opening speech and the position put forward by the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord Higgins. In our concept, the quarterly meeting exists to provide transparency through the minutes of the council's deliberations on strategic issues that are in the wider public interest; it will consider the risks. That is the point that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, emphasised. It is the responsibility of the council to discuss these matters. The Government are clear that they want the council's assessment of risk, and its consideration of possible actions and options for mitigating the risk, to be open to the public. That is the concept behind the openness of this operation.</p>

<a name="100310-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="100310101000020"></a>The terms of reference of the council, which we have published in draft, stipulate that such reports by the Bank and the FSA must be considered in three

All these issues will be part of the council's report because they will have been discussed and minuted. I therefore do not think that the Government's approach is vastly different from that intended by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="100310-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="100310101000021"></a>As an additional constructive point, I can offer to commit that the minutes will cover the substantive items on the agenda and that the terms of reference will be updated to reflect this. We will then be in no doubt as to what the total responsibility of the council will be. The identified risks and the actions proposed will be in public arena, which is where we and, I believe, the noble Baroness want them to be.</p>

I do not see any objection to the way in which the council is expected to act or to the way in which the nation will be able to see both the assessment of risks and the action taken-if any there is-recorded in the minutes.

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000004"></a>When we published our report in July, it was in a sense an icebreaker. It put momentum into a process that had already started, and since then the momentum has gathered speed. Led by the Information Service in the Lords but involving a huge number of staff from both Houses, far more is being put into engaging and interacting with the public.</p>

<p><a name="10031099000005"></a>Last week, I spent some time on the internet reading the latest webpage of www.parliament.uk. I spent two riveting hours enthralled by the variety of speeches, special events and Select Committees at Westminster. I joined Anthony Steen from the other place and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, in the Second Reading of their Anti-Slavery Day Bill, the purpose of which is to raise awareness of human slavery today. I followed a picture of the noble Baroness, Lady Kinnock, a Minister, about to give evidence to the Lords Committee on 4 March on piracy off the coast of Somalia. I looked at the noble Lord, Lord Darzi of Denham, his head nodding vigorously as he introduced the First Reading of the Health Bill. I followed what some Lords of the Blog have recently been saying about the issues raised by legislation. The stages of a Bill as it passes through the Commons and the Lords were made clear and easy to understand. I have to say that I found on the website for the very first time the e-mail address of my own Member of Parliament. I therefore strongly recommend that anyone-teenager, adult or elderly-who wishes to understand more

I am sure they will relish the amount that they can learn.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000006"></a>Guiding and encouraging those who are not normally interested in politics to become interested in our workings at Westminster is critical for us, especially when, as we all know, the reputation of Parliament is at a dismally low point. Our report had 49 suggestions and recommendations for the Lords on which the administration is now working. I shall give a few examples. The idea of parallel debates online for young people and the broader public to complement our Thursday debate in the Chamber is moving forward, and I very much hope that it will be trialled later this year.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000007"></a>A growing number of Peers is discussing current issues with the public via Lords of the Blog. I blogged two days ago about our meeting this afternoon and I received a number of comments, most of them polite. Sounding out the broader public on issues raised by legislation has been trialled informally-particularly by two Lords of the Blog with regard to home education. This aroused considerable interest and controversy. The fact that Lords of the Blog links directly to Peers is clearly valued by participants.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000008"></a>Useful preliminary work is going ahead to link up the Parliamentary Information and Communications Technology service-briefly known as PICT-with government departments to streamline information about Bills going through Parliament. PICT has developed a way of extracting the text of Bills from the editing software used by the government team which drafts the Bill. However, a great deal more needs to be done in this field and I would like to see much more action from the Cabinet Office to match the good work being put in by PICT.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000009"></a>In all of this we are collectively trying to explain and demystify Parliament's work and thus make for a more engaging, more interesting Parliament, which is more understandable to the public. The search is going ahead in the Education Service for a new website to provide an animated overview of Parliament's history and development for young people, building on the success of the "MP for a Week" game. The Education Service is delivering valuable teaching materials online, as well as continuing to host visits for some 40,000 students a year.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000010"></a>On outreach and the archives, the Connecting with Communities project was very successful in Norwich with the Norfolk Record Office. The great majority of those involved-84 per cent-said that the activities made them want to find out more about Parliament. A tie-up with Birmingham is being planned.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000011"></a>However, all this work is essentially being done by the Administration Committee. I now address what we, the Members of the House of Lords, are doing to bridge the gap between us and the outside world. I am sure we all agree that we have been given a splendid lead by the Lord Speaker. The outreach programme in which she and other Peers visit schools to talk about the House of Lords is highly successful. The number of visits is growing; there are likely to be more than 100 this financial year. However, she cannot do it alone. Clearly, we have to try to interest more of our colleagues in taking up a metaphorical mace and  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC95"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>getting involved in breaking down the barrier of lack of knowledge about the work of our House. I hope very much that after the election, when we will certainly have a large host of new Peers coming from many different backgrounds, a number of these may be interested in joining the team to demystify this Upper House of ours. It needs a commitment above all of time and a belief that the task is worthwhile. In my judgment it certainly is.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000012"></a>The media will continue to give an unbalanced view of us, concentrating on ermine, the State Opening, mice in the bar, squirrels and our expenses, but the serious side of our story is well worth pursuing. I remember that after the debate for young people, which was hosted in July of last year in the Lords Chamber, a youth worker commented that this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience which the young people would never forget. A similar event in the Chamber is planned for this autumn. This will build on the pupil parliaments that the Education Service runs.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000013"></a>I will finish with a final thought. Some three years ago, when I succeeded my noble friend Lord Baker as chairman of the committee, I was surprised at how structurally separate the management and Peers were. The administrators had their meetings to decide on new activities, on the budget and on various activities to watch over finance, and to promote and hire members of staff. We, the Peers, occasionally asked to meet some of the senior officers, and were told the decisions that they had made. It would be very sensible if our Information Committee was changed in composition-I think that my mobile phone is ringing: I am deeply sorry, I will turn it off. At least it shows that I am reasonably modern-so that it included not only the Clerk of the Parliaments, but also a number of senior management administrators. We would meet together more frequently for a frank and full discussion of our ambitions, our achievements, our finances and our future targets.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000014"></a>Last October, I spent one afternoon with senior managers on their awayday. This opened my eyes. It was very useful for me to be able to put over the objectives of our recently published report. In turn, senior managers were able to learn what members of the committee were aiming for. This nurtured the enthusiasm from senior management that we have seen in recent months. Formal divorce between senior management and a Peers' committee should end. Our Information Committee would come forward with more and better ideas, and ways of fulfilling those ideas, if senior managers were committee members. I realise that this is an unusual, perhaps even revolutionary, suggestion. However, it should be thought about seriously after the election, and I am sure that it would enable the Upper House to carry through many more of the recommendations of last year's report.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000015"></a>I will end by thanking three members of the senior management who have helped me so much in the last few years: Liz Hallam Smith, the Director of Information Services and Librarian; Joan Miller, Director of PICT; and Richard McLean, the Clerk of our committee, who was seconded to PICT in October, and without whom this report would never have been written. Our

The better people understand how Parliament works, the more positive they feel about us.</p>

<p><a name="10031066000016"></a><b><a name="100310-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10031066000062"></a>Lord Puttnam:</b> My Lords, I would like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Renton, for introducing the debate in way that he did. He covered a lot of ground. I will pick up on one of the last things that he said, which was that we undoubtedly have "much further to go". For me, today's debate is just another staging post on what has been-and I anticipate will continue to be-a long journey. I have been very lucky to sit on the Information Committee under two wonderful chairs, the noble Lords, Lord Baker and Lord Renton, who have succeeded not just in moving along the agenda, but in transforming the atmosphere in which this debate has continued over the past five years. The atmosphere is constructive and positive: it is an atmosphere of hope. When I started on the committee, in 2003-04, the situation was rather different. I will focus on a small group of recommendations in the report, in part because they are relatively simple.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000017"></a>Paragraph 132 recommends that the House of Lords administration should invite officials to look at the possibility of people getting electronic alerts to update them on Bills or issues of interest about what is going on in Parliament. This is the norm in many people's lives. It can be done on Twitter, on your mobile telephone, your computer or almost any other similar device. It is normal practice for people in work to be alerted to what is going on in the rest of the world that is of particular interest to them. There is no technological reason why this should not be done, and while obviously some costs are involved, it is almost the best way of ensuring that people are constantly reminded that things which impact on them are taking place in this House. It is therefore very much in the interests of the House to do this because it is possible to forget that a lot of constructive work goes on here that relates directly to people's daily lives. Not to take the opportunity to remind them of that is self-defeating.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000018"></a>The second area in which I feel that we are somewhat self-defeating is set out in paragraphs 139 to 141, which refer to greater access to the House of Lords for factual filming, and a recommendation that we revise the leaflet setting out the regulations that govern filming. Most importantly, many noble Lords will have had the miserable experience of being interviewed in the so-called Interview Room. We should be able to come up with a room for interviews that in some way, shape or form is illustrative of the dignity of this House, perhaps by way of a backdrop. As all noble Lords know, the impression given is that you are being interviewed in a cupboard. I cannot think that it helps the House and its reputation to be seen in such a way by the rest of the world. If I walk across the road to the BBC, I sit in an even more uncomfortable place, but at least there is a diorama behind me which gives viewers the impression that we are actually somewhere in Westminster. It is cannot be beyond the wit of man to conceive of something similar and thus dignify the way in which we communicate with the rest of the world.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000019"></a>The last recommendation I want to focus on is a review of parliamentary language. I touched on this a  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC97"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>week or so ago in a debate introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. I illustrated my remarks by recounting something that happened quite recently to the noble Lord, Lord Stone of Blackheath, and me. After a really excellent debate in the House on the outcomes of the Copenhagen change climate conference, in which more than 30 speakers took part, we made it our business to ensure that the <I>Hansard</I> report of the debate was sent to schools that were interested. What came back was fascinating. Pupils loved the debate and thought the points made were interesting, but the same question was put to us both: why on earth did we "move for Papers", and what does that mean, and why at the end of something in which a lot of convictions were expressed did we "withdraw the Motion"?</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000020"></a>I have since asked any number of people-indeed, just about everyone I meet-what the process is and what it means. I have yet to receive an answer of any sort. No one knows why we "move for Papers" and no one knows why, having done so, we "withdraw the Motion". If we do not know, and our job is presumably to excite and enthuse people in the outside world, then surely enough is enough. It would not need a great deal of thought or time to put this right, and I would be perfectly happy to work with anyone on drafting a new and rather more explicable form of words.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000021"></a>There are two other things that I want to pray in aid. Last week a very good Hansard Society report entitled <I>Parliament 2020: Visioning the Future of Parliament</I> was published. On page iii a table sets out the issues that came out of focus groups looking at what would be of overwhelming interest to first-time voters. It is fascinating to note that MPs, Peers and first-time voters all agree that greater use of new technologies is crucial, which is good news. But further down the list we discover that while "understandable language" is felt by MPs and Peers to be somewhat important, it is felt by first-time voters to be crucial. What is really dreadful is that transparency and accountability are felt by MPs and Peers not to be of any importance, and of no importance by parliamentary officials, yet these same things are felt to be utterly crucial by first-time voters. We cannot afford the luxury of that sort of gap in understanding between first-time voters and Peers and officials. It is we who are wrong, not they.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000022"></a>This is the most important lesson I should like to get across this afternoon. For us to believe that somehow first-time voters are wrong in thinking that transparency and accountability are important and for us to content ourselves that those things are not particularly important is clearly wrong and sends out a bad message. Why are we sending out that message? There are two reasons. First, the process of interactivity is entirely normal to the lives of first-time voters although it is very new to many of us. Perhaps I may illustrate that fact in these semi-formal surroundings. How many people here are wearing a watch? Hands up everyone who is wearing a watch. Just about everyone, and yet very few first-time voters ever wear a watch. In fact, they think that the wearing of a watch is almost inexplicable: why would anyone bother to carry a single purpose device? Young people do not wear watches. Until we are prepared to have the flexibility of mind to understand their view of the world, we will continue to struggle. That is possibly a silly example of the generational difference between

This Hansard Society report is important and well worth studying.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000023"></a>Recently I came across a terrific article in <I>Business Week</I>-it is dated 2 July 2009, but I have only just found it-entitled:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031066000050"></a>"The old solutions have become the new problems".</p>

<p><a name="10031066000046"></a>One marvellous line leapt out at me:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031066000051"></a>"Letting go is a Catch-22. You don't want to let go until you have something new to cling to, but you can't discover the new thing until you let go".</p>

<p><a name="10031066000047"></a>I suggest that one of the great inhibitors to change within the parliamentary process is our terror of letting go and losing control. Until we overcome that terror, we will never find out how transformative good and well communicated democracy could be. In that sense, we are doing ourselves an enormous disservice. Only 41 per cent of first-time voters are showing any interest in registering to vote. That would normally translate into about a 30 per cent turnout among young people at the coming election. That is not democracy, it is a mockery of democracy. Unless we are prepared to turn that 30 per cent into 70 per cent, we are all failing in our duty.</p>

<p><a name="10031066000024"></a>Five years ago, I had the privilege of chairing a committee on which the noble Lords, Lord Tyler and Lord Renton, sat. We made a number of recommendations, the last of which is quite interesting. We stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031066000052"></a>"We want to see a Parliament which is an accessible and readily understood institution, which people know how to approach, and when and where to make their voice heard, a Parliament which relates its work to the concerns of those in the outside world. This is the challenge".</p>

<p><a name="10031066000048"></a>It was the challenge five years ago, and it remains the challenge today, but time is moving on and we cannot afford another five years and another period of delay.</p>

I have never had a vote; I have always been disfranchised, and I have spent much of my life being misunderstood. When I came here, they said, "We need to get young people interested. Will you go out and speak?" I was not very good at speaking; I had made a few sales presentations, but that was about all. The great and the good, whom I called "Sir" because I did not know that you should not, would say, "We would like you to go off somewhere and speak".</p>

<p><a name="10031066000026"></a>When I arrived, sometimes in a dinner jacket, I would look at the menu and it usually had Snopake on it. I realised fairly quickly that I was replacing someone much more important, so I became known as the Snopake speaker. When they could find no one else, I would go to speak. You were asked to speak about the House of Lords, but I was told that you did not communicate with the outside world; that was represented by the House of Commons. As some of your Lordships may remember, we did not have more than 10 sheets of writing paper a month, we had ink pens and we certainly did not have any stamps. Every time you received a communication from the outside world, you

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000027"></a>For a long time, I did not think that the Lords should communicate with the outside world until suddenly, in 1985, when televised debates started, we found that people wanted to communicate. How many of your Lordships have that terrible problem of having to explain to people what you do, why you are here, how undemocratic you might be-all of the logical criticisms-without the support?</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000028"></a>Suddenly, when the Lords decided that it would start to communicate with the outside world, things changed, particularly when we had e-mail. I was perfectly happy getting one or two e-mails a day, rather than 120 if I ever speak on something. I did not realise that modern electronic communication could put you in touch with a whole range of people. I did not realise how that could be dangerous when the letters-I call them marmalade letters-were from those who sit down on a Sunday and write to every Peer in alphabetical order.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000029"></a>When I sat on the Information Committee, I realised that I had been right about some things. I have found this House a greater source of information than any in all my time in as an economic research man. If you go to the Library, you find everything you could possibly want. If you cannot, you go to a higher authority. When you ring up Archives to ask them something, they speak at a slightly higher level; they do not look down on you, but I realise that their intellectual capability is far in excess of mine.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000030"></a>I wanted to make certain suggestions under the subject of outreach. I was elected, of course. The House has changed the rules now. Instead of calling us all excepted hereditary Peers, we are now acknowledged as elected hereditary Peers, whether the election was a genuine election or we were elected under an Act. If you morally feel that you have been elected, you feel that you ought to represent someone. I asked: who do we represent? Anyone we want to. I decided that I would represent the 19 million people who did not vote at the last election.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000031"></a>I thought that the House of Lords should represent someone, and I suggested-I have eight drafts, because I know that it is sometimes not good to make suggestions overtly, you drip feed their Lordships and gradually something starts to well up-that we should seek to represent all the elected people in the United Kingdom. We should, as was the case before in our relationship with the House of Commons, serve on committees together and get to know people, so that we might say that we represent the elected Members of Parliament. Then I went further and asked: what about the elected councillors? There are 20,000 of them. Perhaps they might have a relationship with suitable people in the House of Lords-those dealing with particular Bills or particular areas.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000032"></a>I then looked at where your Lordships were around the country and found to my amazement that there were 604 more of your Lordships than Members of the House of Commons. Determining where they were had nothing to do with where their homes were; I  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC100"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>looked at such things as who were Deputy Lieutenants-as I have pointed out before, I thought that they were D Litts to begin with. A Deputy Lieutenant obviously knows something about his county. I have a chart here showing where they are.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000033"></a>I then thought that we might also represent parish councillors or parishes, so I had a word with the bishops in the Lords-they keep changing-and realised that the current bishops in general have a flock of about 30 million in the country. There are about 80,000 parish councillors. Knowing that every bishop is related to a parish and appoints every vicar, could we not find a relationship there? We might consider putting forward the idea that we are prepared to represent people from different parts of the country, different regions, according to our knowledge, rather than it being assumed that you have knowledge of a particular subject. Recently, the Marine Bill dealt with almost all of the United Kingdom. If we had had closer relationships with all the parish councillors at that time, there would have been a tremendous input.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000034"></a>Now I come to what information we disseminate and how we do it. There is a strange rule in the House that anyone who works for the House is not really able to advise you. They can comment, they can provide information, but they cannot direct you. In general, the dissemination and promotion of information is not to promote the House. The success has been the remarkable amount of information to which the Lord Chairman referred, which has become one of the best sources as the links are created.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000035"></a>Perhaps the next stage that we should consider is: who do we represent, or can we represent anyone? Because I speak on the Commonwealth, I have had representations from Commonwealth nations which would also like a voice in the House of Lords. I have looked at the question of the overseas territories. I wondered whether we should seek to have direct relations with individuals or bodies, or should we just let them come to us? As the concept is outreach, I feel that we have a long way to go, but a great opportunity.</p>
<h5><a name="10031066000057"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="10031066000036"></a><b><a name="100310-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10031066000064"></a>Lord Haskel:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Renton, spoke about the ambassador scheme. I have been an ambassador since the scheme started. Last Friday, I went to the Marist School near Ascot and spoke to 115 senior pupils. It is a private girls' school with a very high academic standard. I followed my usual routine of spending 15 or 20 minutes explaining the work of the House of Lords, using overheads, and then taking questions relating to Parliament and politics. As usual, they came thick and fast, and when the teacher brought the questions to an end, I asked if I might ask a question. My question was: how many of the pupils had visited our website, seen our blog or our videos on YouTube, or visited all the interesting things on www.parliament.com that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, spoke about? One hand went up-and this was in a middle-class school where every pupil had access to the web at home and at school.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100310-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000037"></a>Afterwards, over coffee, I raised this with the head teacher. He assured me that as a result of my visit, over the next couple of days most pupils would access  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC101"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some of our web material, and he would try to include it in their lesson plan. I recount this because it shows that just being on the web is not enough: ambassadors are needed, too. This point is made in your Lordships' report. As well as going to schools, we go to adult events. I have spoken at major regional conferences of the Women's Institute and Rotary International. Our outreach is not limited to schools. The report also mentions shadows. A number of us have had shadows from schools after the exams are over. In a way, they, too, become ambassadors. The shadows report back to the school assembly and also write a diary. This, too, has stimulated interest in Parliament.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000038"></a>Perhaps I may use this occasion to join other noble Lords in congratulating the Lord Speaker on her outreach initiative. Not only is the timing of your Lordships' report helpful in dealing with the expenses scandal, but so is the timing of the ambassador scheme. The report points out that the expenses scandal has affected the relationship between Parliament and the public. The Hansard Society audit of political engagement reports a reduction in the public's satisfaction with Parliament and with the political class-but, thankfully, little change in the level of trust. This is largely because the level of trust was already pretty low.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000039"></a>In response to this, there have been many proposals to raise the level of public satisfaction with, and trust in, Parliament. Being more open and accessible is seen as crucial. The Government have agreed to play a role in this. The Hansard Society report reveals that the public's views are complex. However, by informing the public better and by encouraging more public participation in legislation, the level of satisfaction should rise. We are learning also that this poor relationship has effects elsewhere. The <I>Financial Times</I> suggests that it makes investors more cautious about investing in this country. So it is important, as the noble Lord, Lord Renton, said, that we get on with rebuilding satisfaction with our political institutions, and firmly establish public trust.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000040"></a>It seems to me that there are three strands to our proposals. First, we should communicate directly with the public via the web, rather than through an intermediary, namely the media. Secondly, we should make what we say and do much more open and available. Thirdly, we should provide a resource for citizens, commentators and researchers to find out how decisions were reached and actions taken. None of this is easy. We have made a start with direct communication by webcasting and being on social networks, and indeed we are broadcasting at the moment. New and different skills and attitudes are required to communicate directly with the public on the web. It is we who have to do the blogs. To make our mark on the web, we also have to be interconnected so that what we do is automatically picked up by searchers or browsers. We will also have to work with sophisticated databases which classify and distribute our data. As others have pointed out, unless the issues and choices are explained, making what we do and say more open and available will lose much of its impact. Again, it is something that will require new skills and attitudes.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000041"></a>The report deals well with the practical and process problems related to providing a proper resource, and acting on the committee's proposals will get us some  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC102"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>way along the road. But I do not think that they will get us to our destination; that will require another major change, and that change is us. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, has spoken about this. In the debate held last June, he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="10031066000053"></a>"the Lords are listening and aim to make their work better".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 16/6/09; col. 1020.]</ul>
<p><a name="10031066000049"></a>To do that, we have to become more professional and improve our performance. There is nothing novel about this kind of cultural change, and it happens in every organisation. How do other organisations change their culture and get people to improve their performance?</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000042"></a>In companies, line managers appraise their staff and the audit committee appraises the directors. Universities have external academics appraise their performance. Some public services use a combination of both, and sometimes a regulator gets involved. In order to win support and trust, some sort of appraisal is part of the governance of most organisations. Who appraises us? Apart from the Front Bench, no one does. We do not even have to get re-elected, and the Front Bench appraisal is rather more political than personal. Most Members of this House perceive themselves as being here to serve the public. As lawmakers, we are constantly appraising public servants to try to make the public service work better. Why not apply this to ourselves? It would certainly reflect the experience of most of the people with whom we are trying to communicate.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000043"></a>In my opinion, unless we tackle this, all our hard work in winning back the satisfaction and trust of the public will take us only part of the way. Recent history is littered with organisations that moved with the times and prospered by cultural change. Those that did not do so have faded away. What I am suggesting may seem impossible and outrageous to some, but to others it is quite normal. What we say, how we vote, and how often we come to the House are all matters of public record. Indeed, we have already taken an important first step through an appraisal of our expenses. Nor am I the first to suggest this. In an earlier debate, my noble friend Lord Puttnam suggested confirmation hearings for Ministers, which are a form of appraisal. Today, he explained how we must keep in touch with young people.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000044"></a>We could have some kind of self-appraisal that looks at what we plan to do in the House, the new skills we need, the old skills that need polishing up, appraising the things that each one of us needs to do or not to do in order to communicate directly with the public, how to make what we do more open and available, and how we can help to create a public resource for our work. We would then become a lot more professional as parliamentarians, and this would enable us to complete the journey to win the satisfaction and trust of the public whom we seek to serve and which is the purpose of your Lordships' report.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10031066000045"></a>This report makes many sensible proposals to change the process of our information service. Changes in process are much more successful when people change too. Perhaps that should be the topic of the committee's next report.</p>

I am booked to speak at a school on the other side of London and I ought to leave by 6.30 pm at the latest. I hope that the Committee will forgive me. I know that that is the wrong thing to do, but, as I say, I do so because I so much want to speak in this debate and go to the school. I hope that it will not happen, but if it does, I hope that noble Lords will allow me that liberty on this one occasion.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000002"></a>I join in this debate in part because I am a blogger on the Lords of the Blog website and a participant in the Lord Speaker's outreach programme to schools, but also because I have benefited greatly from the many websites which allow a parliamentarian-at home or in the Palace of Westminster-to keep abreast of documents, debates, developments and drafting that affect the passage of legislation in the House of Lords.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000003"></a>I say in relation to the two reports that are being debated today that the information provided on, for example, the Lords Whips' site, the parliamentary calendar, and the Cross-Benchers' site are essential and well presented tools which have improved with time. I find the ability to trace the passage of a Bill online and read its provisions and the Explanatory Notes and associated debates quite outstandingly well organised as a site. I wish that parliamentlive.tv was more widely known as it, too, is a remarkable tool.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000004"></a>I have also benefited from an intern, and am grateful to the LSE for its scheme, and the website, workforanmp.com, that enables young people to apply for these posts. I regard internships as an essential part of outreach and social mobility, as long as they are paid and advertised and therefore not available solely to friends' children who can afford to work for free. This relates to the current review of Peers' expenses, but this is not the place for that discussion.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000005"></a>I am also grateful to the excellent organisation of visits to schools by Ms Page in the Lord Speaker's Office, and have learnt a great deal from the teenagers to whom I have spoken. They tend to have fewer misconceptions than the press, but in general schoolchildren still regard us as born to a life of privilege, and, sadly, tarred by the same brush as MPs in relation to expenses.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000006"></a>I am flattered to see that 14 people are tracing my every word on the website theyworkforyou.com, which enables members of the public to pull up all the speeches of a Peer or MP and e-mail them. I should point out that I now receive so many letters and e-mails from members of the public if I speak on a controversial topic that I am unable to deal with them personally. That is a shame. This, too, relates to the review of our expenses, for the solution has to be a secretarial pool. To encourage members of the public to communicate with us, but not to provide the means whereby one can send an individual response is counterproductive. The office of the Convenor of the Cross Benches is most helpful in obtaining press attention for relevant speeches by Members.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC104"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000007"></a>As a former governor of the BBC, I am well aware of the difficulties inherent in communication, even when one has the levers of every possible means of mass communication in one's hands. I note three areas, therefore, where improvement in our communication might take place. The first is in the ability of the public to follow what happens in the Chamber, specifically in relation to Questions. Members of the public have said on my blog that if one of them is watching or listening to Oral Questions in the Chamber, the text of the Question is not immediately available-it is not read out by the questioner. Instead of the rather time-wasting formula of "My Lords, I beg leave to put the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper", the time could be better used by the questioner actually putting the Question, so that the watcher or listener knows what it is without reference to <I>Hansard</I> or the daily Order Paper.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000008"></a>Secondly, in my view the screens in the Chamber and around the House could be better used. When an amendment is being debated, its wording could be on screen as well as the number and the names of those moving it. While I understand that it would be difficult to insert all amendments into the original Bill's clauses, so that one could see readily what difference they would make if accepted, it must be possible for a single amendment to be shown on screen inserted into the clause under discussion. It must also be possible to show the wording of Questions, and other issues being debated, on the little red screens.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000009"></a>Certainly it would be appreciated if every effort could be made by the communications officers of Parliament to convince the media that Members do more than vote. So often, the work of Members of your Lordships' House is measured only by the frequency of voting, and we are ranked accordingly. The public need to know that much work-for some, the majority-is in committee, answering letters, asking questions, making speeches and so on. This is not readily measurable except on theyworkforyou.com.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000010"></a>My final point concerns the use of the web for communicating with the public. I have greatly enjoyed blogging on lordsoftheblog.net. However, some of the responses are intemperate, or come from the same people over and over again, or from a lobbying group. Therefore, I am not sure what constitutes successful communication. There have been more than 300,000 visits to the site and more than 9,000 comments. Daily visitors range from a few hundred to a few thousand. The commentators often appear to believe that Peers are members of a party other than the one to which they belong. There are quite a few unjustified comments about religion, knowledge and wealth. Those comments can be edited by the bloggers, but in an age of digital communication, the response of the public should be left largely unedited for all to see.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000011"></a>Whether minds are changed is open to doubt. It is arguable that an article or a letter by a Peer in the press may have more influence, even if it seems more remote than a blog dialogue. Also, the value of public participation in all-party parliamentary groups in this House is clear. We must therefore continue along the useful path that has been drawn for us all by the Information Committee.</p>

I will concentrate on education and outreach, on language and on the ceremonial aspects of Parliament.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000013"></a>I turn first to education and outreach. Like others here, I have taken part in the ambassador scheme, Peers in Schools, which is part of the outreach work. I found my experience both interesting and satisfying. The response from the schools that I have visited, which have been situated in my home county of Lincolnshire and in north Essex where I now live, has been very positive. In some instances, the visit has resulted in the school bringing pupils to look around the House of Lords. This I welcome greatly, because this place is part of every person's heritage. To this end, I look forward to the opening of the parliamentary education centre.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000014"></a>I also fully support the travel subsidy that has been introduced to assist pupils from state schools, and from schools outside the south-east of the country, to visit us. Outreach to young people is vital if we want to expand knowledge about the House of Lords, how it works and how our work affects the lives of our citizens, including young people and their families and friends. Encouraging teachers and the relevant curriculum bodies to include good coverage of the House of Lords in the curriculum should pay dividends, which is why the recommendation in paragraph 20 of the report is so important. It is also vital that the outreach and engagement programme, which owes a tremendous amount, as we have already heard, to the great support of the Lord Speaker, remains a key priority and must be built on in the future.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000015"></a>As well as visiting schools, I am in touch with a number of women's institutes, again as part of our outreach activities. Earlier this year, I visited my home town of Market Rasen in the Lincolnshire Wolds to speak to the West Wolds women's institute. To my amazement and pleasure, more than 100 people came to the meeting on a very frosty and slippery morning. They asked very pertinent and excellent questions after my talk, and I am delighted to say that 40 members are due to visit the House in June. Another group of 20 members of the women's institute will attend Parliament next week. I tell noble Lords this because I believe that people who come into this place and look around are amazed but also begin to understand a great deal more about the House of Lords than they did before they visited it. Very positive outcomes are spinning off from the outreach programme, which can only be helpful to our work in reaching out to citizens.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000016"></a>We have heard a little about language this afternoon, and the report's recommendations are both practical and possible. The language that we use in the Lords has been in use for centuries. After an initial steep learning curve, we get used to it, but I am sure that it can be a barrier to understanding and can prove intimidating for those who come across it for the first time. Indeed, we have heard of instances of that this afternoon. Therefore, explaining parliamentary terms and the glossary on the parliamentary website would be a great step towards understanding them.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000017"></a>I am also sure that a debate in the Chamber on the language and terminology of the House would prove very enlightening, and I hope that this proposal will not be forgotten. However, I do not want speeches in the House to be summaries or précis, which some of our witnesses from the various bodies that deal with the news seem to indicate are necessary if the average viewer is to understand and engage with the Lords. My noble friend Lord Puttnam put his finger on the dilemma of press coverage of the Lords when he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="10031085000021"></a>"we are caught in a Catch-22 situation, in that news is driven by what interests people and what interests people is what is in the news".</ul>
<p><a name="10031085000020"></a>This is another area on which to work further, and the proposal for a review of the parliamentary language that is used in the Lords to enable people outside the House to understand our work better could be a good starting point.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000018"></a>Finally, the issue of the ceremonial aspects of Parliament is different from that of language. I do not accept that our ceremonies are of necessity a barrier to understanding how we work. Again, an explanation on the website could be most helpful. Whenever I have visited schools or women's institutes, I have found an appreciative interest in our ceremonies. Ceremonies are part of our heritage, and I for one would be sad to see them watered down or substantially changed. Dr Meg Russell, reader in British and comparative politics at University College London's Constitution Unit pointed out to us that it was difficult to find a picture alongside a story on the Lords that did not show us in our ermine. That is not our fault-the media appear to have slipped into this mode of portraying us-but I do not accept that this is a barrier to understanding us. A debate on this matter may prove helpful, but there is no doubt that these issues are complicated and very contentious, and, in the larger world of how we communicate better, our ceremonies should be way down our agenda for reform. I joined the committee later than did many others, but I very much enjoyed taking part in the work on this report and I am enjoying today's debate. This work should continue, because the more connection there is between the people of this country and Parliament the better.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10031085000019"></a>In recent months, both Houses of Parliament have faced very difficult criticisms. Only yesterday, I received a copy of the Hansard Society's <I>Audit of Political Engagement</I>, which concentrates on MPs but is a salutary text for us all in both Houses. One of the statistics is that the majority of the public-62 per cent-admit that they know not very much or nothing at all about the Westminster Parliament. However, 60 per cent of the public believe that it is worth while. It is up to us in both Houses to change the former of these findings and to build on the latter. Our work in the Information Committee can only help us.</p>

I take this opportunity today to refer to one section of that evidence, and I will quote from a few bits of it.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000017"></a>One of the most interesting and important evidence sessions that we had was when three groups of sixth-formers came to see us. What they told us really helped to shape some of our most crucial recommendations. They told us how they had thought of the House of Lords and what image they had of it before they came to see us. One of them described it as, "a big scary thing". Another said that she thought that it was "for older generations". Another said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031099000161"></a>"A lot of people would associate the House of Lords just by titles and to be all toffs and big-wigs".</p>

<p><a name="10031099000150"></a>Another said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031099000162"></a>"A lot of people ... do not think that politics is anything to do with them and especially the House of Lords".</p>

<p><a name="10031099000151"></a>Another said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031099000163"></a>"Younger people ... think that the Lords are the elite society, they are really upper class and higher than us".</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000018"></a>This view of the elitism was compounded by the comment from another sixth-former, who said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031099000164"></a>"People associate the Lords with a couple of centuries ago when Lords meant they were Lords and they owned land. People just associate it with a title and not the people behind the title".</p>

<p><a name="10031099000152"></a>Fortunately, all this was modified, so we were a little less disheartened, when, after having spent the day taking a look at the place, one of the group said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031099000165"></a>"I thought you were all of a higher status, but you're just like normal people who have worked to get somewhere".</p>

<p><a name="10031099000153"></a>After their day with us, we at least managed to compensate for some of the more preconceived ideas.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000019"></a>Terminology can clearly be off-putting. I agree absolutely with what the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, said about language. The word "Lords" is particularly misleading. The students who came to see us clearly expected to see a bunch of male, ermine-clad landowners. There is probably nothing very much wrong with continuing to call each other collectively "my Lords", as we do in formal debate. However, it is worth considering whether for external consumption the institution might be better referred to as the House of Peers rather than the House of Lords. The word "peer" is a normal, accessible word with normal connotations. All those young sixth-formers would know, for example, what "peer group" means. Calling ourselves the House of Peers-as some people do informally-might be a better way to describe the institution formally.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000020"></a>Despite complaints about our quaint and rather alienating ways, during the evidence session we were also struck by how passionate and interested the sixth-formers were. They were not going to let all that stuff get in their way. In fact, they said it made them determined to change things rather than to be put off. The two topics that many of them mentioned they were most passionate about were the position of women in politics and climate change. We had some very interesting, albeit brief, discussions with them on those topics. One of the things that they had learnt through  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC108"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their visit was that although Members of the House of Lords do not represent a geographical constituency, as MPs do, we could be approached on the basis of declared interests and areas of expertise on a particular subject. I hope that as a result of our recommendations we will do something practical to create and publish clear information or a database along those lines in order to make ourselves more accessible to the public in ways in which they might want to contact us.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000021"></a>We also asked the sixth-formers about direct engagement with the democratic process through voting. I am glad to say that all of them seemed very keen to start using their vote when they were 18. They raised a couple of other interesting aspects of the democratic process although we did not have time to discuss these with them in any great detail. These were whether the voting age ought to be lowered to 16 and whether voting should be compulsory. There were mixed views on both those issues. Personally, I would like to see much more discussion on both these issues-especially the latter-on the formal agenda of this House. I, for one, have never bought the argument that young people do not vote because they are apathetic. I think it is much more likely to be a rational refusal to engage with a process and a category of people for whom they have little respect. There is a case for examining very carefully the Australian system of compulsory voting in exchange for a positive abstention on the ballot paper, and at least asking whether that might not also be a reasonable deal for the UK electorate too. If we were willing to initiate debates on such issues, it would be attractive to many people who might otherwise think that the House of Lords, and Members of Parliament more generally, are just self-serving and stuck in their ways.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000022"></a>Finally, I return to young people. I commend and pay tribute to the work done on behalf of this House by the outreach and education services. They are really important aspects of the work of this House. I hope that the recommendations of our inquiry to continue and strengthen this work will be rigorously implemented and fully resourced.</p>

<p><a name="10031099000023"></a><b><a name="100310-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10031099000191"></a>Lord Parekh:</b> My Lords, this is an excellent report. I begin by congratulating and thanking the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, and his colleagues for producing this splendid report with its excellent suggestions and ideas. The question is not only whether people listen to the House of Lords or how we reach out to people; it is much more basic. It is about the legitimacy of this place and the esteem in which we are held. When we talk about reaching out to people or getting them to communicate with us on a more regular basis, we do so because we know that the legitimacy and respect that this House enjoys depends on what people think of us.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000024"></a>I think that we ought to appreciate that this House represents an interesting paradox. On the one hand, we have enormous intelligence, expertise and good sense in the House. On the other hand, people at large know very little about it, and those who know something have mixed feelings, for all kinds of reasons. The expenses scandal is one. How are we appointed? Why am I here and not another professor?</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC109"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000025"></a>There are also the scandals that have appeared from time to time, such as those of the noble Lords, Lord Archer and Lord Ashcroft. There is also the fact that when you belong to the House you do not have to attend it regularly, and stories leak out in the papers that some Peers may have attended only five, six or seven days in a year. There is also the case that people may be here for years without speaking or turn up simply to vote but not to participate in the debate, table an amendment or ask Questions. When people get to know about that, they ask disturbing questions.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000026"></a>In the Hansard Society's research, when people were asked, "How much do you know about the House of Commons?", 42 per cent of people said that they knew quite a bit, 58 per cent said that they knew not much or nothing at all. When the same question was asked about the House of Lords, 26 per cent said that they knew something about it and 74 per cent said that they knew nothing about the place.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000027"></a>The problem for us is twofold: how do we make ourselves more comprehensible, more accessible-both intellectually and emotionally-and how do we communicate on a regular basis with the wider British public? Those are the two questions on which I briefly want to concentrate.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000028"></a>It is striking, as many Peers have pointed out in your Lordships' House, that there are many archaic features. I have nothing against archaic features; as an historian myself, I love the past. The more dead it is, the better it is. At the same time, the archaic elements have a tendency not just to make things inaccessible but to create the impression that we belong to a bygone age.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000029"></a>For example, people have talked about dress. I must confess that I have never taken to it. I have never worn an ermine in my life and I do not think that I will. Language is another issue. The noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, talked about the use of the word "Lord". I know that when people refer to me in public as "Lord", I often feel deeply embarrassed because there is a stereotype to which I am expected to conform, and I cannot. I would rather be known as "Professor" or "Doctor" than "Lord". People are also puzzled why lady Members of the House of Lords are referred to as Lords. People often ask me why I say, "My Lords", and not "My Lords and Ladies". I remember asking that question on my first day, and I was told that a Lord is a concept, a generic category under which Ladies are subsumed. I said: "It could be the opposite. Why not say 'My Ladies' and subsume Lords under it?" They said, "Oh, we cannot do that". You can see the gender bias behind an apparently neutral exercise. Procedures are another issue.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000030"></a>Our dress indicates that we belong to a different age; our language indicates that we belong to a different species, the Lords, and our procedures indicate that we belong to a different world. It is about time that we started thinking about that more seriously.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000031"></a>In order that people should know more about the House, it is important that we think about travel subsidies. The report recommends travel subsidies to state school pupils. We should also think about visits to schools and universities. Let me give an example of one thing I did that evoked a lot of interest and might  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC110"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be worth thinking about. When I was a professor at the University of Westminster, the vice-chancellor asked me if I would organise public debates on important questions. We thought that a debate that was engaging the attention of the public and students was whether or not we should be part of the European Union, or what role we should play. We got together three Members of your Lordships' House holding different views and organised a debate. That was one of the most successful debates that the University of Westminster had, attracting about 200 people. My friend the noble Lord, Lord Norton, has done something similar in Hull. It is a question not just of visiting schools but of using your Lordships' expertise to arrange important debates.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000032"></a>In that context, I make a suggestion that I think needs to be thought about more carefully. One of the great qualities of this House is its debates. We hold wonderful debates such as this one, and many others that we had last week on higher education, universities, Europe and women's equality. What happens to those debates? They remain in <I>Hansard</I>. However, two things can be done. First, either in the form in which they appear in <I>Hansard</I>, or in a suitably abbreviated and critically edited form, they could be sent out to schools and colleges. Here we have debates which represent a wide variety of views, a lot of wisdom and a good deal of common sense. These debates could evoke much interest.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000033"></a>I will give a small example. My grandson is a 14 year-old boy at school in Oxford. I sent him the <I>Hansard</I> report of the debate on constitutional reform, because he is interested in that kind of thing. He read it and wrote back to me, saying, "Grandpa, I have shared it with other students and we are all excited. Will you from now on promise to send me copies of <I>Hansard</I> on a regular basis?". This will give noble Lords some idea of how the quality of the debate can lead children to read and understand, and to relate to us intellectually. Word will begin to spread without us having to do much propaganda work. The <I>Hansard</I> records of debates can be used as a basis for reaching out to a large audience. I am told that there is a plan to increase the number of researchers when new office space becomes available at No. 1 Millbank. It might be a good idea to ask one researcher to summarise, in five pages, any important debate that has gone on for two and a half hours, and send out free copies to lots of schools, colleges and universities.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000034"></a>One suggestion in the report slightly worried me, and I would like us to be careful. In order that we are seen to be doing good work and playing an important constitutional role, we are told that we should point out from time to time how a piece of legislation came to us from the Commons and how we amended it. It is important that we amend it, and pointing out amendments that we have made would indicate the role that we play. However, if it is not done carefully, we could end up making the Commons look incompetent, and making ourselves look good at the expense of the Commons is not a useful political policy.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000035"></a>The last question is this: we may be trying to reach out to the general public, but are they waiting and wanting to reach out to us? The supply is there, but if there is no demand, there is no point to the exercise,  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because whatever initiatives we take, we would be inviting only disappointment and frustration. Therefore, we must look at the demand side, and I will make three quick suggestions. First, greater attention should be paid to citizenship education, which was introduced a few years ago in our schools. It is an important part of the school curriculum, but it is poorly delivered, it remains rather marginal and in many schools there are no specialised teachers.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000036"></a>Secondly, school, college and university students will be interested in what we are doing if they have some experience of public debate and of democracy. Therefore, we should encourage school councils, class councils and youth councils in local authorities, where people will get used to the cut and thrust of public debate.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000037"></a>Finally, it is important that we should seek comments on new Bills and policies. Putting the Bills on our website before pre-legislative scrutiny is a very important and effective idea. Another suggestion would be to make a public announcement of what Bills are coming up, and why we would be delighted to have comments on them from schools, colleges and the public. This would enable people to take ownership of what we are doing, and would also encourage them to take a sustained interest in what happens to the Bills on which we have invited them to comment.</p>

The debate has been extremely useful, and I have learnt a lot from the evidence that has been given.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000039"></a>What it comes down to is how accessible we are to the general public: do they understand what we are doing? I rather agree with the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, that we have to be careful about using a completely different language. I recall the words of a teacher from Kimbolton School who said that we should, "assiduously eschew obfuscatory prolixity and hyper verbosity". There are moments in the Chamber, when people are speaking, when I wish that we would hurry up. On the other hand, language denotes respect, and there are some things that I do not think we need to drop. "The noble Earl, Lord So-and-so" is nice old convention. The title is indicated first but because we are all Peers, we are all addressed as "Lord", apart from Dukes who have something different. They are a cut above us, and there is only one left, a Scot. But an awful lot of other stuff needs to be cut out.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000040"></a>I have been thinking about disability issues now that we are being broadcast and published in text. What is an issue is that we put Questions in the way we do, because it does not help those with sight problems if the words are not spoken. In order to comply with disabilities legislation, we should start reading out the Questions at the beginning. That is a very good point.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000041"></a>But it is not always about language and ceremonial, which comes through later, and I shall say something about it. One of the reasons that the younger generation do not bother with watches and rely on their telephones  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC112"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>while I use a watch is that I am now slightly challenged in trying to read the very small figures displayed on the telephone without assistance. If the telephone boys could give us much larger figures for the clock, I could drop wearing a watch. Unfortunately, however, they do not think that way at the moment.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000042"></a>Another way in which we have moved on and the world has changed is that we now live in a world of electronic idioms. The Lords of the Blog is a move in exactly the right direction, and I feel guilty that I do not write for it myself. The trouble is that I speak a lot-far too much-but I do not write so much. It takes me hours to think things through because I am terrified of putting the wrong thing down on paper. For some strange reason I seem to be far less terrified of putting my foot in my mouth. Most people are sensibly the other way around. That is why the work we did on data formats is important, and I want to draw attention to it, albeit briefly. If other people take this stuff and make mash-ups with it by incorporating it with other material to produce something more interesting and understandable for the general public, it has to be in an accessible format for them. That is all part of getting our message out there. Some will lampoon us, but others will view us in a positive light. We should not be frightened of the lampooning. If we really cannot withstand it, we do not deserve to be here.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000043"></a>Posting clips on YouTube is a wonderful step in the right direction. Again, it encourages people to be short, sharp, succinct and focused. TheyWorkForYou measures these things-I have just managed another three-word alliterative phrase, which will annoy the organisation because it does not think we should be doing that deliberately. But it is part of the modern world, and we need to focus in that direction.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000044"></a>The point was raised about people wanting to talk to the right Peer. Now that we have raised our profile and people know we exist, they have become more interested. They are aware that we do things and that often we are the subject experts in ways that do not exist in the Commons. It is something we need to improve on. We should not tread on the toes of the Commons because the Members represent constituents, but we can do a valuable job in providing certain bodies of expertise and being concerned with special issues through all-party parliamentary groups. On that subject, I must apologise because I am going to pop out before the end of the debate to greet a whole lot of people who are coming to a meeting of an all-party group at the other end. Having done that, I shall come back for the final speeches. The trouble is that there is always so much to do.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000045"></a>If people can get to you to discuss an issue, they feel that they have influenced the process in some way, even if only that someone has listened to them. That is something that frustrates people and discourages them from voting: they do not think that anyone is listening to them. Parliament is sitting here passing laws, the Civil Service is writing regulations, and there is nothing that they can do about it. If they can get to someone, whether through all-party parliamentary groups, blogs or whatever, they feel that they have contributed and been listened to, even if things do not then happen in the way that they want.</p>

<p><a name="10031099000046"></a>How we project the House is extremely important-again, I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. I refer to the visual background, our backdrop. Recently, I had much help from Black Rod and the Yeoman Usher, who gave me a much better location in which to conduct an interview with the BBC. They have taken this on board and are thinking creatively.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000047"></a>It is important that we project our role correctly. We must make it easy for people to find a debate. I liked the idea that was suggested of having summaries of our discussions that people could access easily and from which they could drill down if they wanted.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000048"></a>I do not think that ceremonial is a block: I entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, about that. People like ceremonial and tradition, but it must not interfere with their vision of us. Dr Meg Russell suggested that we should not wear robes for the State Opening of Parliament, so that we do not get photographed wearing them. A journalist from one of the more left-wing papers laughed and said that it would make no difference because they would still run pictures of us in robes. I am afraid that people who wish to present us in a certain light will continue to do so: we have to live with that. However, we must make sure that we have enough other good stuff out there to counteract that impression. Ceremonial lends dignity and conceals the fact that some of us may not be fighting fit and tough, with lovely six-packs or whatever it is that people want to see in their representatives. Robes conceal the difference: perhaps they can respect that. Sometimes it is the position that should be respected rather than the individual.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000049"></a>We need more interesting shots of the Chamber. It is hard to get ourselves projected and used in news clips if we cannot show something interesting. A picture of one talking head will not go very far: people will get bored.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000050"></a>In conclusion, I did like one thing. I have just been involved with the Digital Economy Bill, trying to work out how amendments affected other parts of it. I was scribbling things down and drawing little arrows. I welcome the Government's willingness to consider how in practice we could show how amendments alter a Bill. I look forward to seeing that come to fruition. It would help us in what we are doing, and would help the public to understand what we are trying to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="10031099000051"></a><b><a name="100310-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10031099000193"></a>Lord Soley:</b> I begin by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Renton, for the remarkable leadership that he has shown in this area, and also the members of his committee, who have produced an excellent report. I am in broad agreement with almost all of it. I also thank the staff of the House, who have been very good at taking this forward.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000052"></a>I propose a special vote of thanks here, because when I left the House of Commons in 2005, I brought my blog with me but changed the title to lordoftheblog. I then decided to open it up a bit, so it became plural. I was delighted by how much support there was for it-it was much easier for me to get it up and running than I expected. That indicates to me that the House of Lords is far more open to change than many people think. In many respects, we can give a lead to the  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC114"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>House of Commons and others. I think that I am right in saying that this is still the only legislature in the world that has a group blog facility for Members. We should be proud of that.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000053"></a>I will say more about that in the moment. First, I will build on what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. We are going through a period of profound change-one can pick out any aspect of life and focus on it. I like the analogy of the watch: if I go out without my watch and diary, I feel distinctly undressed, whereas if my kids went out with a watch and diary, they would feel distinctly embarrassed. He is absolutely right to identify that.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000054"></a>In relation to the work we do, the changes that are affecting politics and the media are immense. It is important to note that the readership for all newspapers is declining. I may say a little more about that in a moment, but we should remember that when people buy a newspaper, they do not necessarily read very much of it. So when people ask who reads the blog, you might respond by asking who reads the letters page in the paper, and who reads your particular letter. This is about the amount of information available and how people select what they do and do not want to look at. I shall not dwell on the point, but if you had asked people in the 1640s what Parliament would look like in 40 years' time, they would almost certainly have been profoundly wrong in their predictions. We are in a similar position for very different reasons. However, these dramatic changes are affecting all countries and democracies, and we have to find new methods of communication between the general public and legislators; there are many ways in which it can be done.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000055"></a>I endorse absolutely what has been said about language, and have mentioned it many times in the past so I will not repeat myself. What we ought to adopt in our mindset is that change is generally a good thing and that we should foster an open and encouraging approach to it. People can find good reasons for not doing something rather than the other way around. When we say, "We cannot do that because-", we need to question the word "because" and decide whether it is in fact a problem that can be solved instead.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000056"></a>The issue I want to touch on now is that of the use of <I>Hansard</I>. If noble Lords take my point about people dipping into newspapers and so on, given that the amount of information now available is enormous, everyone looks at the superficial bits and then wants to get below only some of that. The best way to check this is to find something you are not interested in and ask yourself how you would find out about it if you wanted to be interested. I use for my own case the example of football because I am singularly uninterested in it. For a Member of Parliament with a football club in the constituency, that was seriously bad news. The point is that if I want to know the score of a particular game, I would know how to find it quite easily. If I want to know more detail about the game, what I need is access to routes to find it. The importance of <I>Hansard</I> in this cannot be overstated. For years, literally hundreds of years, we have produced <I>Hansard</I> as a written record of the House which people have a right to see. That is absolutely reasonable. What we need now is a means by which people can find out roughly what has  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC115"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>happened and then go into more depth if they need to. That is why the blog is important. We need to see these things as being linked.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000057"></a>For example, when I posted an entry about the Venables case yesterday, I included a complete quotation from the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, because I thought it was profoundly important. I wrote only three or four lines about the case, attached the full quote from the noble and learned Baroness, and then provided a link to the relevant <I>Hansard</I>. Some 1,300 people have already visited that entry. What I want them to do, although I do not know if they will, is to go on to look at <I>Hansard</I>. Given that, <I>Hansard</I> needs to be presented more like a newspaper website where you can look either at a summary-one of the recommendations of the report is that <I>Hansard</I> should have summaries of speeches and debates-or be led into a full reading if that is what you want.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000058"></a>Only a minority of people will want that, but it is important. Similarly, I posted an entry this morning on dangerous dogs. Actually, I did it last night, but because you can post-date entries it went on to the website this morning at about 8 o'clock. I know that it has had hundreds of visits already. I also linked that to the Home Office report and asked people for their views on the consultation document that has been published. That is how we link these things up. If we have a <I>Hansard</I> that is visual-that shows pictures of the debate-has short summaries, relevant links and a complete reading of the debate, if that is what people want, we give them the options that they need in today's rather complex world.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000059"></a>At the end of all this, we want people to be fully engaged. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, took part in my genuinely innocent blog on home education, where I suddenly discovered that I had tapped into a great deal of feeling on the part of a lobby group. I am very much in favour of lobbies, so I congratulated it, but it piled in. As the noble Baroness said, some of the comments are intemperate.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000060"></a>I will talk briefly about the at times intemperate nature of these things. It is important to remember that a blog-the original term was "web log"-is a public meeting place without walls. One of the reasons I set mine up was my frustration at the collapse of public meetings, and blogs allow you to communicate with people. I have a more dramatic example. The noble Baroness described the comments as intemperate at times. I do not know how she would describe some of the comments that I received when I was an MP. One guy railed about just about everything about me in the most offensive language imaginable. I was minded to strike it off, but I was rather struck by the last sentence, which says a lot: "However, I have to say, it is a very great privilege to be able to address this matter with you". I thought, "Okay, so it's worth it". I think we all know this, particularly people who have done the elected politician bit and have had to deal with complex meetings.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000061"></a>The noble Baroness, to her immense credit, went along to the public meeting for home educators, which was held in the House. I had to leave before she spoke, but they were incredibly deferential with me, having  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been quite rude from time to time on the blog. That is what tends to happen, and frankly I do not have a problem with that. We obviously have to edit and delete particularly offensive comments, but by and large we have to have a thick skin about some of the things that are said, because we take it as part of the political process and it should not worry us too much. When people are not addressing you in person, they tend to be much ruder than when they see you in person. I always think that this is a bit odd, because I tend to be the other way around; I am terribly polite in letters but rather more direct in my speech. There we go; we are all a bit different, I guess.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000062"></a>Let us try to merge the processes about which we are talking. Let us make <I>Hansard</I> a much more central part of our ways of communicating with what is happening in the House. It should be linked into Bills and into some of the other suggestions in the report about how you can make your views known. All those things need to be in it. We can do a lot of this without having great debates and discussions first. It is significant that Lords of the Blog was created without any debate or discussion about whether it should be started, other than through the committee process and with the Officers of the House. We could do a lot more like that. We need to be very positive.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000063"></a>We could also make more progress on interviews. I did an interview with Nick Robinson, which I hope to follow up with one with Alastair Campbell, although that will probably have to wait until after the election, for obvious reasons. The links to interviews can be very important, too, and perhaps we should think more widely about them. Why do not Members of the House of Lords who have a blog interview someone with a particular interest in a Bill and invite comment on that? We must think laterally and allow it to happen. That is a very important part of it.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000064"></a>I do not want to say anything else other than to thank the committee for an excellent report. Let us just try to take it forward.</p>

<p><a name="10031099000066"></a>The next confession that I must make is that I was involved in the Puttnam commission set up by the Hansard Society-indeed, I am now a vice-chair of the Hansard Society. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, who has led this exercise so magnificently, was also a member of that commission. I also want to mention that this afternoon we have had four Lord bloggers here. The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, was here earlier; the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, is here; but the godfather of us all-if that is the right expression-is the noble Lord, Lord Soley. He has led us into that territory in a way that has been extremely helpful and good for your Lordships' House. It has shown us to be a lot more open to an interactive connection with the  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC117"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>public than the other place, which tends to be party pris on these issues. I am proud that we have been able to make a real advance in that respect.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000067"></a>There has been comparatively little reference this afternoon to the second report before us, which, because it is more recent, is important in ways than have been less apparent. It includes the Government's response to the original report and, in appendix 2, contains a helpful assessment of recommendations and progress. Before the completion of Committee this afternoon, I hope that we will get some indication of what happens next.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000068"></a>This House is famous for good debates and for good reports. It is not so famous for indicating what action should take place on those reports. Paragraph 7 refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="10031099000171"></a>"the Leader of the House, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, responding to a question about the newly-formed National Council for Democratic Renewal".</ul>
<p><a name="10031099000154"></a>I challenge anyone here to tell me who is on the National Council for Democratic Renewal, and what the council is doing. The whole context of this debate is within that very important framework. We are all concerned about democratic renewal.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000069"></a>I do not know whether the Chairman of Committees can answer that question. It is rather unfair to put it to him, because it is not his department. However, I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, will be able to tell us not only who is on the National Council for Democratic Renewal, but why it is called a national council-I understand that it is actually a Cabinet sub-committee, which in our plural society is scarcely a national council-whether it has been meeting regularly, what it is doing and whether it is responsible for the considerable delay in any action on these extremely important issues.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000070"></a>That brings me to my important point about the main report before us, <I>Are the Lords Listening?</I> Frankly, it is not very encouraging that it has taken from 15 July 2009 to 10 March 2010 for us to have a full debate on this report. I know that there have been other debates in the Chamber. The noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, led a debate that touched on these issues. There have been other debates, Questions, and so on. It is implicit in the important report before us that we need greater topicality. If the House of Lords is to make itself relevant to the issues of the day, the number of months that have gone by before the report came before us is not encouraging. The electorate in general are understandably concerned that we will take so much time over issues that we will miss the trick in topicality.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000071"></a>The point made by the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, about the cohesive approach of Members of the House as regards the staff team of experts is extremely important. I have not detected that point in the report, but his contribution on it was extremely interesting. There have been important improvements in the cohesive approach of the two ends of the building in the past few years. That was a central theme of the Puttnam report. The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, did not refer to it this afternoon, but I know he feels very strongly that we need to work more closely together, given our major responsibility as a  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cohesive whole Parliament to adopt a holistic approach to hold the Government to account. The officers of the two Houses work together in the Group on Information for the Public (GIP), but it is high time that Members of both Houses looked again at that.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000072"></a>The report's recommendations are not controversial and there has been broad support for them all around the Committee this afternoon. The important point concerns what the action plan will be. That brings us back to the House authorities as, to a large extent, this is not a government responsibility, although there is a government response here and the Government have a role in some areas. I look forward very much to hearing the Chairman of Committees speak on that issue.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000073"></a>A number of Members have referred to the education and outreach activities. That is, of course, a combined operation and a very good one. It has hugely improved since the Puttnam report was published. I pay tribute to the staff involved in that exercise. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Deech and Lady Gibson, referred to school visits. I had the privilege of attending a very large meeting-one of the largest meetings in the whole of my political career-of a county federation of the National Federation of Women's Institutes. My contribution was somewhat truncated because I was due to be followed by Mr Bob Flowerdew of "Gardeners' Question Time", and the participants on that occasion thought that that was slightly more relevant to their primary concerns than what the House of Lords did. However, these occasions are hugely valuable. I pay tribute to the extent to which the officers of the House support us in that effort. I especially endorse what has been said about the Lord Speaker. Your Lordships' House has led the way on this. Until the new Speaker arrived at the other end, the Commons was way behind us in this respect. It has caught up a little now, and good luck to it, but we have made huge improvements in that regard.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000074"></a>Language has come up regularly as a theme in the Committee this afternoon. This should be reviewed. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, about the use of the word "Lords". "Peers" has the advantage of being gender neutral, but I do not know how one would address a Committee using that term. I suppose that one could say, "My fellow Peers". However, we could address that issue in other ways. The example was given earlier of debates in which we move for Papers and then withdraw the Motion at the end. I dare a Member of the Committee not to withdraw a Motion for Papers to see whether there is a vote and it is passed. Where do the Papers come from? It would be very interesting to see what happened on such an occasion.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000075"></a>I am a great enthusiast for this amazing building. I am really a failed architect-one of my many failed careers before I fell into evil company among politicians. I love this fantastic building, which is built for ceremony, but there is an issue about the red dressing gowns. After all, that is only one day in the legislative year; the rest of the year we are all in working garb. There is a good case for us to look at that. I do not buy the idea of moving into Westminster Hall-that has been suggested-for the very good practical reasons contained  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC119"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the Library note. It would be extremely difficult to organise the security. It would also be difficult for Her Majesty the Queen and there would be all sorts of other difficulties. However, to give the press the opportunity constantly to show us in our extraordinary garb is quite absurd. I must confess-another confession-that I have not yet attended in full garb and my wife and I have decided that we will not do so until the tumbrels are outside and someone has sharpened the guillotine. Then we will come for the last one.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000076"></a>Engagement with young people is extremely important. This week, there was a report that the 18 to 24 age group is simply not registering to vote, let alone going to vote. Nearly half of them are not going to register, for goodness sake. Therefore, our not speaking their language and our not being in a position to respond to their interests is extremely important. The evidence points not just to the way in which we behave in the two Houses of Parliament, but also to a feeling of disconnection-they feel that they have no impact, and that they will not get any result. Having seen an extremely important report from the British Academy this morning on the choice of electoral systems, I am led to believe that having so few people having any real impact with their vote is part of the problem. I leave that on one side for others to consider.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000077"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Parekh, made a very important point about familiarity. It is not a given that greater familiarity with something will make people more favourable to it. We must be very careful. By opening up the way in which we operate, we do not automatically make people think that we are doing a better job. We have actually to do a better job. It was very interesting that a noble Lord referred today to the need for more pre-legislative scrutiny. That goes right across Parliament. Parliament has to work better before it can be seen to be working better. We cannot just invent a new image for Parliament. That applies to both Houses. The emphasis on outcomes by the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, was absolutely right. In that context, the report and the work of the Information Committee, which is hugely valuable, are part of a much wider exercise. It concerns the reform of how we at both ends of this building do our job. It is important that we should see it like that. It is part of the comprehensive modernisation of this House.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000078"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, made an extremely interesting point about the change of culture and of mindset. We are a working House. We need to show ourselves to be a good working House. We are in many respects-I do not deny that-but there are ways in which we can improve. The way in which the Lord Speaker has led the discussion about how we, too, can change the way in which we operate is extremely important. Last week, as many of your Lordships will know, the House of Commons voted on the Select Committee report on ways in which it could improve its working methods. We will have to do that sooner rather than later.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000079"></a>I turn to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. The disenchantment and disengagement with your Lordships' House, with parliamentary democracy and with politics in general, is very serious. We should not delude ourselves that because it has faded a little,  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC120"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>last year's so-called crisis over expenses and allowances has gone away and people have lost interest. The evidence of the Hansard Society audit last week is that it has not gone away. It was and remains one of the big talking points, but it goes much deeper than simply worrying about remuneration. It is a general feeling of us and them. That degree of disengagement is very serious.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000080"></a>I think that change is our ally. I cannot remember who first said that, but I believe it to be true. The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, said, "Let go"-but we must let go in a way that creates more transparency, so that we can be seen to be accountable.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000081"></a>In my last few words, I certainly do not suggest that this is the right moment to talk about the composition of your Lordships' House. However, the question will not go away; it is still there. In the mean time, we have had two extremely interesting and important reports from the Information Committee. We all welcome its work, and this has been a fascinating debate. I am sure that when we receive the response from others, it will continue to be so.</p>

My noble friend Lord Renton has led from the front in the area of technology. I looked on the web and found a very fetching YouTube performance, as well as blogging. The YouTube performance was distinctly better than that of the Prime Minister recently. It was a real progress and a good example of what we can achieve.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000083"></a>As noble Lords mentioned, the first report of the committee was an ice-breaker. The area of communication and engagement is front and centre of the agenda. Some very positive things are happening. The Information Committee is concerned with the Parliamentary Information and Communications Technology service, the Library service, the information service including <I>Hansard</I> and public information, bicameral services and the parliamentary archives. As a relatively new Member of this House, with experience in another place, I have been hugely impressed with the support received from these departments and services. The dedication, professionalism and courtesy of the staff are enormously impressive and must be recognised and celebrated at every opportunity.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000084"></a>In common with several Committee members, I have had the privilege of welcoming guests here, and also visiting schools and colleges to talk about the work that we do. Last week, I welcomed to this great building a group of sixth-formers from Emmanuel College, Gateshead. I was struck by two things. First, they were incredibly knowledgeable about the House of Lords and its workings. Doubtless that was because it was part of the curriculum-they were working on a project-and also because of access to the internet. They were also immensely grateful for the red bags of goodies that were prepared and given to them to take away: that made a difference as well. In the areas that  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC121"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>puzzled them, there was only one question that I had difficulty in answering. They asked why it was that after Question Time had taken place, which they had observed from the gallery, the House emptied from 200 down to 10 at a speed which would grace any fire drill. I found it difficult to provide an adequate answer: it might be something to which more established Members of your Lordships' House might turn their attention.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000085"></a>Mention was made of the excellent website TheyWorkForYou. That has helped journalists to keep track of when we are speaking. However, TheyWorkForYou will not cover this debate, because we are in Committee. That is a disappointment. Perhaps my noble friend Lord Renton, on behalf of his committee and others, could take that up with the excellent people who run the website, because Grand Committees are not covered.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000086"></a>As one would expect from an Information Committee report specialising in communication, I found the annual report one of the easiest documents to digest that I have ever read. That may be because I have become used to studying government legislation over the past few months. In particular, Appendix 2 sets out the recommendations in a very clear form. The Government might take note of this as a way in which data can be presented. Of course, one of the downsides of presenting accessible information in a transparent way is that it becomes immediately apparent what has been implemented and what has not. Huge numbers of recommendations are being progressed, others are being considered, but I have yet to see one that has been implemented. That would be encouraging. However, as an example of how things should be presented, the report is outstanding.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000087"></a>I turn to the points made in the report. Engagement with the media is central to all that we do. I know that there is a wish for us to communicate directly with the electorate. However, for the next 100 years or so I am sure that we will rely on the media, and so having a constructive relationship with them and making it as easy as possible for them to do their job is a sensible approach. Having been interviewed in the "cupboard" a few times myself, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, has made a wise point. Personally, I rather like the idea of an Oscar winner designing a set for the studio of your Lordships' House. If that were to be proposed, I think that it would be very welcome indeed.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000088"></a>The report begins thus:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031099000166"></a>"Parliament's reputation is at a low point".</p>

<p><a name="10031099000155"></a>Media coverage about Peers' allowances and MPs' expenses and the suspension of two Members of the House of Lords has had a negative impact on people's perception of Parliament. I am comforted that this opening makes us all deeply uncomfortable. That is the point from which we start: that we have a problem. The fact is that in 2009-10 a Parliament which has been meeting on this site since 1215 when Magna Carta was signed has, almost 800 years later, reached a low point. It is a particularly difficult problem. Granted King John probably did not have to contend with a Freedom of Information Act, let alone the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>, but the fact is that we are at a low point and therefore action needs to be taken. That is what is  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC122"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>required, and I am pleased that my right honourable friend David Cameron has made some clear statements about it:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031099000167"></a>"People are fed up with politicians hiding behind the cloak of independent inquiries and endless reviews. They want us to stand up, grasp the issue by the scruff of the neck and start dealing with it".</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000089"></a>He has set out in response a number of proposals to fix our broken politics. He has also said that we do not believe that an arrogant or controlling Government sitting in London passing endless rules and regulations actually make things better. In fact, they can often make matters worse. That is why we want to embark on the most ambitious shift of power from the centre as a way of engaging people in local communities that has been seen for generations. We will cut Ministers' salaries by 5 per cent. We will have a pay freeze for all Members of Parliament. We will take a long, hard look, as they say, at the gold-plated pension scheme operating for Ministers and parliamentarians. We will cut the number of MPs by 10 per cent because we have one of the largest legislatures in the world.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000090"></a>As well as cleaning up Parliament, we need to empower it to fulfil its proper constitutional role of holding the Executive to account. There would be more emphasis on scrutinising how existing legislation is being implemented rather than proposing rafts of new legislation. There will be a focus on simplifying government and the tax system, not only because it would save money, but because complexity in any system obscures what is actually happening and makes it less effective. It makes it less accessible to the lay person. The fact that 3,700 pieces of legislation went through this place between 2007 and 2008 is a case in point. How on earth is a Parliament made up of 1,200 Members supposed to be able to scrutinise that amount of legislation going through at such a high rate?</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000091"></a>We will introduce the power of recall to allow voters in constituencies to kick out MPs in mid-Parliament who are proved to be guilty of serious wrong-doing. We will introduce more open primaries to give every constituent the right to choose their candidates for election. We will create a right of initiative nationally whereby any petition that can collect 100,000 signatures will be eligible to be formally debated in Parliament. Any petition with a million signatures will allow members of the public to table a Bill that could end up being voted on in Parliament.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000092"></a>These examples are not in any way gimmicks, they are very much ways of engaging people, particularly young people. The fact is that young people using forms of social media could collect signatures for a Bill and have a direct influence on Parliament. It is something that will invigorate our system. We will also introduce a public reading stage for Bills to give the public an opportunity to comment on new legislation. We will limit the number of special advisers to protect the independence of the Civil Service, which is one of the most important guarantees of the independence and scrutiny powers of our system of government.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000093"></a>I want also to comment on the remarks made by Timothy Kirkhope, Leader of the Conservative Party Group in the European Parliament and vice chairman of the European Conservatives and Reformists group, as well as being a distinguished former Member of the  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC123"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>other place and a Home Office Minister. He has made the point that one of the biggest constitutional changes in our history has been our membership of the European Union, and yet it has passed Parliament by largely unnoticed. We are hopeless at scrutinising European legislation.</p>

<p><a name="10031099000094"></a><b><a name="100310-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10031099000196"></a>Lord Haskel:</b> Are we debating the committee's reports or his party's manifesto?</p>

<p><a name="10031099000095"></a><b><a name="100310-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10031099000197"></a>Lord Bates:</b> We are debating the committee's reports, which talk about how we can improve the way in which Parliament communicates with the electorate. My speech is entirely in keeping with that. European legislation has an impact on people who watch what we do, and they want to see how Parliament scrutinises it. The point has been made that we are very poor at scrutinising European legislation, and we want to ensure that it is properly scrutinised. David Cameron has said that we will give the House of Commons more control over its own timetable so that the habit that has become the norm in the timetabling and guillotining of Motions-truncating debate and scrutiny places an additional responsibility on your Lordships' House to deal with the inadequacies of legislation-will be tackled. There will be more free votes, and we will limit the use of the royal prerogative so that Parliament is involved.</p>

<p><a name="10031099000096"></a><b><a name="100310-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10031099000198"></a>Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen:</b> I am a little bemused. Will the noble Lord's proposals come before the Information Committee, because that is the whole ambience of our debate this afternoon?</p>

<p><a name="10031099000097"></a><b><a name="100310-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10031099000199"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I would be delighted for them to be considered by the Information Committee, if the committee wished to consider them ahead of a general election. The point is that Parliament has an image problem. Its procedures are in question and its reputation is in doubt among the public whom it is there to serve, and there need to be some radical responses. It is entirely appropriate in Parliament and on occasions such as this, given that we are weeks away from a general election, to set out alternative views on how it could be restored.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000098"></a>Finally, the report by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and others, including Members of Parliament in the public eye, concluded, as has already been mentioned, that we need to create a Parliament that is accessible and understandable. That is the challenge for the next five years. These points are a response to that challenge. The Lords are certainly listening, and people are certainly watching.</p>
<h5><a name="10031099000181"></a>5.47 pm</h5>

<p><a name="10031099000099"></a><b><a name="100310-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="10031099000200"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, and the Information Committee for the reports, which I have found absolutely fascinating. When I read the report from the summer, and found myself on the Back Benches again, I thought that it is one of the committees that I should try to get on to because it is so interesting. It made me rethink my view of how both Houses of Parliament, and  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC124"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>indeed government, should communicate with the public. Although I did not start out thinking this, I have long thought of the traffic as one-way. Yet reading these reports I realise that it is very much two-way. It is not just on our terms but on the terms of the public. As the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, says, therein lie risk, letting go and the whole issue of control. The report was absolutely fascinating-and you will not often hear that from a Minister commenting on reports.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000100"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bates, about the committee encouraging the fundamental values of openness and two-way communication, which the Government strongly support. The committee members include, of course, the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, whose points about parliamentary language and electronic alerts I will take back to the Cabinet Office. This report rightly builds on the foundations of the group he chaired, which I now know included the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, for the Hansard Society.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000101"></a>The House has made good progress on some of these recommendations. Building on those foundations, the latest report of the Information Committee reminds us that there is still some way to go to deliver the vision of a Parliament fully engaged with the public it serves. That was reinforced by several noble Lords. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, raised the issue, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson. We heard my noble friend Lord Haskel recount the work he does with many other noble Lords in the successful outreach programme and as an ambassador, and the telling responses he had from the students he spoke to.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000102"></a>The Information Committee clearly states that increased transparency strengthens trust and is key to democratic renewal. The committee has never been so right, as these are unprecedentedly difficult and buffeting times for Parliament. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, underlined the importance of the democratic renewal process, as did the noble Lord, Lord Bates. The Government wholeheartedly share that view. The Prime Minister himself said in his Liberty speech of October 2007:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031099000168"></a>"It is clear that to protect individual liberty we should have the freest possible flow of information between government and the people."</p>

<p><a name="10031099000156"></a>He said in his Statement on constitutional renewal in the other place on 10 June last year that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031099000169"></a>"Democratic reform cannot be led in Westminster alone. It must be led by engagement with the public. That is part of the lesson of the last month: the public want to be, and should be, part of the solution. So we must build a process that engages citizens themselves, people of all parties and none, of all faiths and no faith, from every background and every part of the country"".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons 10/6/09; col. 797.]</p>

<p><a name="10031099000157"></a>Those sentiments were widely welcomed across the House and in the other place.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100310-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000103"></a>The Government therefore welcome the Information Committee's truly first-rate report, <I>Are the Lords Listening?</I><I> Creating Connections between People and Parliament</I>, and welcome the proactive and practical steps that have been recommended. Most of the recommendations are matters for the House itself and for its Officers. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, will spring into action as soon as I resume my seat. The Government would not want to encroach on the prerogatives of Parliament.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC125"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000104"></a>However, as my noble friend Lady Royall promised in her speech in our debate on 16 June, the Government are very willing to share with the House our experience and expertise from having to address many of the same issues in the relationship between the Government and the public. I am glad to say that Officers of the House wasted no time in taking my noble friend up on her offer. Indeed, the Government's Director of Digital Engagement was approached before he could leave the Lobby that very evening. I am pleased to be able to tell the Committee that those contacts and the other discussions emerging from them, including the involvement of the national archives and parliamentary counsel, have continued ever since. From the comments made this afternoon, perhaps they have not continued at the pace that some noble Lords would want, but they have continued and are increasing all the time. I shall return to the point in a moment.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000105"></a>The report mentions the work that the Prime Minister has asked Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who led the creation of the world wide web, and Professor Nigel Shadbolt to undertake. They are to lead the opening up of access to government data on the web. The first phase of this work culminated in the launch, on 21 January, of data.gov.uk. This provides a single, easy to use, online point of access to government data. It already contains nearly 3,000 data sets on subjects ranging from ambulances to animal feed. The Government have introduced a new licence for core Crown copyright material on data.gov.uk, which explains the right to reuse the data. Noble Lords have talked about the right of individuals and lobbyists to take and reuse information that can be obtained from parliamentary sites. Data.gov.uk makes clear the rights to reuse the data, including for commercial purposes, and is designed to be interoperable with the widely recognised Commons creative licences. Importantly, more than 2,750 people have registered to join the developer community and work with us to improve the service and use the data. Even more important is that we are seeing the emergence of new, innovative applications and products as creative people of all ages outside government-we have talked a lot about young people this afternoon-start using government data. The particular creativity of young people was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, and by my noble friend Lord Parekh.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000106"></a>There have been many innovative applications. For instance, Jeff Gillett has built an "ASBOrometer", an anti-social behaviour order application for Apple iPhones that shows ASBO data by local area. For a while, this was the most downloaded free application from the Apple App Store. That is one way of using government information. The Newspaper Club has shown a postcode paper that provides a range of data on your local area, from allotments to travel times. Such applications add real value and provide new insights that would otherwise have remained untapped and hidden in government departments.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, made a similar point in his reference to a huge well of hidden information. He was talking about the House of Lords, and how important it is to free up that information. We could say the same for government. My noble friend Lord Soley talked about the importance of letting information go out freely, and the creative use that will be made of  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC126"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it. In <I>Smarter Government</I>, published on 7 December, the Government set out their plans to extend data.gov.uk work into local government, set out the overall principles that would apply to the release of public data, and promised the release of further data sets in the months to come.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000108"></a>Improving the flow of information between Parliament and government is a key theme of the report. The benefits of this are clear: improved efficiency, greater effectiveness and a consistent view of information as it makes its way between government and Parliament. The Information Committee's report made three recommendations for action by the Government, and I am pleased to tell the Committee that we have accepted and are working on all three. This answers the question of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, about what comes next.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000109"></a>The first of the committee's recommendations for action by government concerns common information standards to improve the flow of information and to enhance the public's ability to reuse that information. The Government are working with House officials on this. As we said in our response, we believe that Written Answers, currently moved from Whitehall to Westminster on paper, would be a good place to start. A number of government departments are interested in trialling a new system, and we are reviewing potential solutions from two technology providers. We will continue to work with parliamentary officials to seek a sound, cost-effective and affordable solution.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000110"></a>Secondly, the committee recommended that the Government produce Bills in an electronic format that complies with open standards and is readily reusable. The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, raised this point. As we all know, the Bill process is complex, time-pressured and draws on a range of stakeholders. Therefore, working with the appropriate officers of the House, we have brought together the relevant parts of government and are now working on the detailed standards, the revised processes, the technology requirements and the implementation plan, as well as the business case-the costing case-for the necessary investment.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000111"></a>Thirdly, the Government support the principles of producing informal documentation to show how a Bill would change the original legislation-some noble Lords raised this-although there are a number of practical difficulties to be resolved. Therefore, the Government suggested that a proof of concept be developed to show what could be done by testing this as an idea, and to gather feedback before any major investment is made. I am delighted to report that, combining the expertise and technology of the National Archives and Parliament, we have set up a web-based proof of concept linking the Digital Economy Bill to the latest available texts of the Acts it would amend from the statute law database. The noble Earl mentioned this. I pay tribute to the officials of the National Archives, Parliament, BIS and DCMS who have worked hard over the winter to bring this proof of concept to life. These pages have now been made public on Parliament's Labs site and have already generated feedback. Feedback from noble Lords and from the public will be invaluable in informing us how best to proceed with this recommendation. I take the points  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC127"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>made by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, on following a Bill through online. Please let us know what you think, and how this could be improved for the future.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000112"></a>The Information Committee also asked how and when recommendations can be incorporated in Sir Tim Berners-Lee's work on government data. The principles behind Sir Tim's work are already reflected in Parliament's work. I pay tribute to the work by Parliament's officers on the Procedural Data Programme, which has developed invaluable core reference data such as a unified Members names service. Parliament's data are a matter for Parliament. However, I know that Sir Tim would be delighted if Parliament was able to put references to its data on data.gov.uk, so that whenever people look they can find parliamentary data as well as government data.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000113"></a>I pick up one or two points made directly to me as the representative of the Government this afternoon. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, said that he would like to see the Cabinet Office do more work to match the work done by PICT. I hope I can reassure him that the Cabinet Office is working constantly with PICT, the National Archives and the Bill teams to create the technology to which he referred. It has been a complex process and has involved a number of relevant stakeholders. We have shared expertise, technical knowledge and lessons learnt from other government initiatives. For example, the commendable consultation papers have been invaluable to this process and have led to the delivery of the proof of concept for the Bill about which I have just spoken. This group will continue to work together and the Government have offered to forge links through data.gov.uk.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000114"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Puttnam, Lord Parekh and Lord Soley, the noble Baronesses, Lady Gibson and Lady Coussins, and the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, talked about the language that it is important to use when you are trying to communicate with the public, particularly with young people. I am reminded by my officials that language is not only about clarity and relevance, but also the medium and the channels of communication that are used. It is also about the community.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000115"></a>The Government must continue to work with young people where they are, not where we are, by using social media. The Government have done a lot to harness platforms such as Bebo and the Big Think campaign which asks young people how they want to communicate and gets them involved in practical processes. It listens to their aspirations, and we have had over half a million responses. The MoD RAF video diary on YouTube has won awards for recruitment. Photographs of the work being done by DfID and the FCO have been made public by using Flickr. On outreach, the Government pay tribute to the tremendous work being done on this by parliamentarians both here and in the Commons. Many noble Lords have taken part in this work over several years, and I pay tribute to the leadership of the Lord Speaker in the programme.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000116"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, was rather scathing about the National Council for Democratic Renewal. It is a very significant Cabinet sub-committee. I understand that it was set up last June to discuss democratic renewal and related issues, along with the means by  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC128"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which the Government can take forward the agenda on engagement and renewal by including, for instance, citizens' diaries. The members of the committee are the Prime Minister, the Leader of the House of Lords, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Secretary of State for Justice, the Secretary of State for the Home Office, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Secretary of State for International Development, the Secretary for Communities and Local Government, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary of State for Wales, the Chief Whip and the Attorney-General. That is the National Council for Democratic Renewal.</p>

I hesitate to ask the noble Baroness to speak on behalf of such an amazing array of talent, but it is scarcely a national council. Actually, all it is is a gathering of Members of the Cabinet.</p>

<p><a name="10031099000118"></a><b><a name="100310-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10031099000202"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> The noble Lord will know that Cabinet Committees are quite significant in that they are the political leadership for government policy and direction, so they are not insignificant bodies by any means. I am not sure when the council last met and I will seek to let the noble Lord know. He asked what it has done. Many of the practical outcomes that I have outlined in my contribution are the result of that political leadership.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000119"></a>I shall conclude. We face obvious hurdles such as constrained budgets as we move forward. Noble Lords have talked about facilitating a culture change, which represents another hurdle across Parliament, Westminster and government. Change does not occur overnight. However, there are already signs of progress and great potential is evident. The committee's report kindly pinpoints particular areas in which collaboration between the Government and Parliament can produce real gains, and shows that it strengthens crucial connections between ourselves and the people we serve-the public.</p>

<p><a name="10031099000120"></a><b><a name="100310-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10031099000203"></a>Lord Puttnam:</b> Perhaps I might ask the Minister for help on one issue. In the 2005 report from the committee on which the noble Lords, Lord Renton and Lord Tyler, also sat, we made eight recommendations regarding the televising of Parliament. I will address recommendation 36, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031099000170"></a>"The 'democratic value' principles contained in the BBC's own Charter Renewal document imply the need for a significant increase in resources to BBC Parliament ... The BBC should, in the coming months, provide a clear and substantial action plan for its development and for a targeted and ambitious increase in its impact".</p>

<p><a name="10031099000158"></a>A year later, we did an audit and sadly came to the conclusion that no such action plan had been prepared by the BBC. At a moment when the BBC is looking at cuts and changes, can we assume that this important area of its work is being developed and is ring-fenced, and that the action plan that was asked for five years ago will be implemented and presented to Parliament?</p>

<h5><a name="10031099000182"></a>6.11 pm</h5>

<p><a name="10031099000126"></a><b><a name="100310-gc0005.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="10031099000209"></a>The Chairman of Committees (Lord Brabazon of Tara):</b> My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to wind up this important and thought-provoking debate. I thank all noble Lords who have spoken. I congratulate in particular the noble Lord, Lord Renton, for his introduction to the debate, and his committee on this report, as well as on the helpful annual report for 2008-09. Now more than ever, it is incumbent on us to ensure that the public understand and engage with the important work carried out both in this House and the other place. The committee's inquiry was wide-ranging, and detailed assessment of connections between people and Parliament, and the benefits of this approach are clear to see. Speaking for the Administration, I know that the committee's report has helped to focus minds, and we now have a comprehensive and ambitious action plan in place.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000127"></a>Rather than list the huge number of initiatives in the action plan, many of which have been mentioned by noble Lords, I will summarise some of the latest and most interesting developments. One of the most effective ways of connecting people and Parliament is to encourage direct communication between Peers and the public. One of the most successful initiatives is the Lord Speaker's Peers in Schools programme, which goes from strength to strength. This has attracted universal praise from every speaker in the debate. The number of schools visited by noble Lords has risen from 96 in the last financial year to 125 this year. Letters have recently gone out to all schools about next year's programme, and already we have received a large number of expressions of interest. I congratulate all noble Lords who take part, and urge others to get involved in the programme and in our other outreach activities. The Information Office will shortly produce a leaflet outlining the activities and explaining how noble Lords can take part.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000128"></a>Another valuable channel of communication has been the Lords of the Blog site. Not only is it a good way for noble Lords to keep readers abreast of developments and issues in your Lordships' House, it also allows members of the public to feed back their views. I was particularly interested in the intensive exchange of views after the noble Lord, Lord Norton, who is a prolific blogger, asked for readers' opinions on a controversial part of what is now the Policing and Crime Act 2009. More recently, the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, and the noble Lord, Lord Soley, blogged about home education in advance of the Second Reading  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC130"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the Children, Schools and Families Bill, and sparked a staggering number of comments from the public. I was very interested to hear the speeches of both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord on this subject. I appreciate that not all the comments were entirely complimentary: however, this kind of consultation and engagement may be a harbinger of things to come. I understand that research is under way to evaluate Lords of the Blog, and to identify potential new audiences and how best to reach them. In the mean time, I urge noble Lords to become bloggers on this site.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000129"></a>It is also important that members of the public who actually visit the House of Lords should receive a high-quality visitor experience. With this in mind, I am pleased to report that the Administration and Works Committee, which I chair, agreed yesterday to improve Black Rod's entrance to make it a more efficient and welcoming facility. There will be an extra search lane and camera, as well as vastly improved waiting room facilities. In the long run, we also hope to build a canopy outside the entrance to keep waiting visitors dry. The first stages of this work will take place over the Summer Recess, which I am sure noble Lords will welcome. We need support from English Heritage for the canopy.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000130"></a>Two initiatives will make it easier for people to follow proceedings in your Lordships' House. Various noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Soley, referred to this in particular. First, the Information Office and Hansard are developing a web-based update on the House's business, which would provide a brief summary of proceedings in the Chamber, enriched incrementally by a variety of hypertext links to proceedings and to contextual information, including the online glossary. This should make your Lordships' proceedings far more accessible. The second innovation is the presentation of <I>Hansard</I> text and audio-visual proceedings of both Houses side by side on a web page, a project which I understand is on track for June this year. I hope that this will prove a popular and useful tool for the public and, indeed, for Members.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000131"></a>The Information Committee also made a number of recommendations on filming in the Palace. In particular, it wanted,</p>
<ul><a name="10031099000172"></a>"a presumption in favour of factual filming throughout the House of Lords, except in specific areas",</ul>
<p><a name="10031099000159"></a>and a revised leaflet that sets out the filming regulations. I am therefore very pleased to inform your Lordships that the Administration and Works Committee agreed yesterday to much shorter and simpler regulations, which state that,</p>
<ul><a name="10031099000173"></a>"the presumption is that appropriate requests for filming will be granted".</ul>
<p><a name="10031099000160"></a>We have had to retain a number of important caveats, but I think the Information Committee will agree, once the new regulations have been published, that they are much crisper and more positive than the existing ones, which are positively Byzantine. The new regulations are now in force and will be included in the next edition of the filming leaflet.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000132"></a>The Information Committee also asked for a more appropriate room near the Chamber in which noble Lords could be interviewed. As your Lordships know,  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC131"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>accommodation is currently in very short supply, and there are already three convenient places for interviews: the Peers' Lobby, the Television Interview Room and the Media Room. I take on board the point which the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, made about the furnishings in the interview room, and I will see whether anything can be done about them. At this stage, we have not been able to provide an additional room, but I am glad to report that the Administration and Works Committee has agreed that interviews with noble Lords may take place in the Moses Room when it is not in use for other things. This location has the same geographical convenience as the Peers' Lobby, but without the background noise.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000133"></a>Finally, I draw noble Lords' attention to "People and Parliament: Connecting with Communities", the major outreach project that is being led by the Parliamentary Archives. The aim is to raise awareness of the holdings of the archives and the history and work of Parliament by working outside the confines of Westminster. Partnerships have been formed with five regional archive services; and through exhibitions, regional events and web content, the project uses material held by these archive services and the Parliamentary Archives to explore the impact that Parliament has had on communities and the ways in which local people have influenced Parliament. The first regional events have been held with the project's first partner, the Norfolk Record Office, and feedback has been very positive indeed. I look forward to the ongoing expansion of this very worthwhile project.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000134"></a>Before turning to questions that have been raised by noble Lords, I should mention the committee's annual report for 2008-09. The report provides a very useful summary of the wide range of issues which the committee keeps under review, and reprints, as an appendix, the Government's response to <I>Are the Lords Listening?</I> I am sure noble Lords will agree that the annual report amply demonstrates the ongoing value of the committee's work, and I look forward to seeing the committee continue to thrive in the new Parliament.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000135"></a>I shall now address various points made by noble Lords in the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, gave us a useful overview of the activities taking place in response to his committee's report. I echo his warm words about the excellent work being carried out by PICT and the Education Service, and I agree that it is crucial for Members to get involved with outreach activities. On his suggestions about the composition of the Information Committee, which was also taken up by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, there are some complex procedural issues to consider, but I am sure that the Clerk of the Parliaments will pay close attention to what he has said.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000136"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, spoke about the need for electronic alerts. I am pleased to say that people can now sign up for email alerts on the Parliament website, enabling them to follow Bills in which they are interested. Parliamentary language was also mentioned by the noble Lord and by many other speakers. I understand the points that have been made and encourage noble Lords to put specific proposals for change directly to the Procedure Committee, which I chair, for consideration. I have taken on board the comments of  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC132"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, about having to withdraw Motions for Papers-indeed I heard his speech in the debate instituted by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, the other day. I will put the issue to the committee, but I would mention that if possible we want to avoid divisible Motions on general debating days. That would not be what we want. However, I also note that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, has tabled a Motion for a specific debate on this subject.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000137"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, made a thought-provoking speech about how Members of this House can seek contacts with public representatives outside Parliament. I have no particular suggestions to make on that front, but I am sure that noble Lords will take his views into account. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, made the interesting point that a comprehensive web presence is not enough in itself. We need Members to act as ambassadors for the House. I quite agree, and that is exactly why the outreach strategy is so important. He mentioned the Hansard Society's <I>Audit of Political Engagement</I><I>, </I>which interestingly concluded that the more the public know about Parliament, the more they value it, thus surely demonstrating the importance of demystifying what we do here. I was also interested in his suggestion of self-appraisal by Members, which I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, will have taken on board.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000138"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, highlighted the valuable visits paid by noble Lords to women's institutes, as indeed did the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. I agree that we should target a variety of groups across society and not just schools, although that effort is extremely important. The noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, spoke about the desirability of the public approaching Members on the basis of their areas of interest, and I think other noble Lords mentioned this. More information on areas of interest will be made available as part of the work to improve information about Members, which is already well under way on the website.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000139"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, made a number of interesting practical suggestions about making our proceedings more comprehensible. I fear that the idea of putting the text of amendments on the Annunciators may be difficult, merely because of the size of the Annunciator screens. This afternoon, for example, they are displaying the proceedings of both the Chamber and the Moses Room at the same time. But the suggestion that noble Lords should read out the text of their oral Questions when asking them is worth pursuing. On the issue of promoting the work of our committees, I point to the great improvements in recent years and the valuable work of our Press Office.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000140"></a>I was interested to note the emphasis placed by the noble Lord, Lord Soley, on the importance of providing website links on blogs to the relevant passages of <I>Hansard</I> and other supporting documentation. The brief summaries of proceedings that I mentioned earlier will start to do this and will become an accessible and valuable resource as they develop over time.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000141"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Parekh, spoke about the importance of engaging young people in the proceedings of Parliament and in the skills of debate. The debating events for young people which have taken place in the Chamber of the House have been very welcome in this  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC133"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column GC133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regard, and I am sure that there will be more of those in the future. They are just one of the ways of looking at this subject.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000142"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, made a number of interesting points about the importance of some of our apparently arcane terminology and ceremonies, and I agree that we must not throw out the baby with the bathwater.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000143"></a>I enjoyed the contribution by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. On what happens next, I have already mentioned the comprehensive action plan which the Administration has put together, and I am sure the Librarian will be happy to provide him and any other noble Lords with a copy. The Information Committee reviews the plan regularly. The noble Lord also mentioned pre-legislative scrutiny. This is an important tool, and I am sure we will all keep a close eye on how the Government's new procedures develop.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000144"></a>I welcome the supportive remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Bates, on the content and layout of the action plan, and his positive view of the goody bags which the Information Office hands out to visiting school children and students. Beyond that, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the merits of Conservative Party policy at this stage.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000145"></a>I know that I have not covered all the points that noble Lords have made, but I hope that I have covered the major ones. If any noble Lord would like me to look into anything further, please let me know. I apologise if I have missed any queries.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000146"></a>In conclusion, I thank the Information Committee once again for its two reports. It is clear that the Administration takes very seriously the need to enhance connections between people and Parliament, as shown by the comprehensive action plan that has been put in place. None the less, I encourage the committee to keep pressing for the implementation of its recommendations, and I look forward to seeing an ongoing programme of change over the coming months and years.</p>

<p><a name="10031099000148"></a>I have just two points to make.

Again, I welcome the news of the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, that new filming guidelines have just been agreed by the Administration and Works Committee, and that the facilities at Black Rod's entrance will be improved.</p>

<a name="100310-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10031099000149"></a>I am sure that colleagues will be delighted to hear that I do not intend to synthesize all the speeches that have been made this afternoon into a brilliant five-minute summary, but I will respond to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler: what happens next? As a chairman who has only a few more weeks in office in front of me, it is very much a question that I ask myself. I very much hope-a hope that comes from this afternoon-that there is a momentum of thought, support and encouragement for what the Information Committee is doing, and that, after the election, it will be enabled to go further both in implementing the report about which we have been talking today and in looking at other related subjects. I hope that that will be the future of the Information Committee, and I send it my good wishes. I warmly thank all colleagues who have taken part in the debate this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="10031065000004"></a>The 2010 report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) has now been published.

I am pleased to confirm that the AFPRB's recommendations are  to be accepted in full, with implementation effective from 1 April 2010.</p>

The Government have also accepted the AFPRB recommendations on a number of targeted measures, including the introduction of financial retention incentives to retain personnel essential to delivering key operational capability and a widening of the eligibility for longer separation allowance. The AFPRB has also recommended that unpleasant living allowance be extended to cover service personnel in forward operating bases and patrol bases in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="10031065000008"></a>Today I am laying before the House <I>The Government's Response to the Speaker's Conference</I> (Cm 7824), which sets out the work Government have done to increase diversity of representation in political and public life and responds to 20 of the Speaker's Conference's  71 recommendations to government.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="10031065000011"></a>We will continue to act to increase diversity in Parliament. Fair representation is not only just, it is necessary for the legitimacy of our democratic institutions. For decisions to be made that meet the needs of all

Since 1997, women in Parliament have championed flexible working, the extension of childcare and legislation to tackle domestic violence, and forced marriage.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="10031065000012"></a>The Equality Bill currently before Parliament contains a number of specific measures to tackle under-representation, for example by extending the time available to political parties to use all-women shortlists to 2030, and increasing the options open to political parties and public bodies to tackle under-representation, for example by reserving places on electoral shortlists for those with a protected characteristic.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="10031065000013"></a>The Government welcome and accept the recommendation that political parties should be required to publish diversity data in their candidate selections, which is why we tabled an amendment to the Equality Bill to give it legal effect.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="10031065000014"></a>The Government's response includes commitments to examine progress on women's representation following the 2010 general election and consider further options if sufficient progress is not made; to find time for a debate in government time on the implementation of the Speaker's Conference recommendations; and to consider establishing a Democracy Diversity Fund to support the work of developing talented individuals from under-represented groups.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="10031065000015"></a><b><a name="100310-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="10031065000105"></a>The Minister for Trade and Investment (Lord Davies of Abersoch):</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Business and Regulatory Reform (Ian Lucas) has today made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="10031065000016"></a>The EU Competitiveness Council took place in Brussels on 1 and 2 March 2010 and the following is a summary of those discussions.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="10031065000017"></a>The main Internal Market/Industry Council items discussed on 1 March were on industry policy, intellectual property rights enforcement and the Europe 2020 new long-term EU economic strategy.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="10031065000018"></a>Council conclusions on EU industrial policy were adopted after a debate involving divergent opinions between member states, particularly on how much focus there should be on electric cars. The UK (with support from a number of other member states) successfully argued for the importance of a technology-neutral approach to EU support for low-carbon vehicle technologies. The UK also emphasised the need for open and competitive markets and for a horizontal rather than sector-specific approach to EU industry policy.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="10031065000019"></a>A council resolution on enforcement of intellectual property rights in the EU internal market, which the UK supported, was also adopted. The UK and others called for more transparency in the international anti-counterfeiting trade agreement negotiations. The Commission agreed to raise these transparency issues with the EU Trade Commissioner.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="10031065000020"></a>In the exchange of views on Europe 2020, the Commission outlined its main themes as being innovation, green growth and social inclusion. There was broad support for the Commission's priorities, with emphasis on support for SMEs, better regulation, energy, infrastructure, internal market and competition. The UK stressed the need for increased EU venture capital (particularly for high technology investment) and the importance of the digital economy to the EU. There was general support for the Commission's proposals on governance and for a more social dimension. The presidency undertook to report the council's discussion to the General Affairs Council ahead of the forthcoming European Council debate on Europe 2020.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="10031065000021"></a>At a Ministerial lunchtime discussion, Professor Mario Monti discussed his preliminary views in advance of his forthcoming report for the Commission on relaunching the EU internal market. He wanted to promote to business and citizens better enforcement, free movement of services, implementing the digital agenda and real economy measures with acceptable regional, social and tax co-ordination policies. The Commission said it planned to follow up the Monti report with a Commission communication in June 2010. The UK stressed the need to engage with business, to focus on growth and jobs and also the importance of services directive implementation.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="10031065000022"></a>The any other business items discussed covered reports on the outcomes of the December 2009 Copenhagen conference on climate change and the February 2010 EU Informal Competitiveness Council on electric cars; updates on the EU internal market scoreboard of member states' transposition of EU directives and on the EU internal market information system for administrative co-operation; progress on EU services directive implementation; and a Commission update on a proposed a private-public partnership model on the development of the future internet.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="10031065000023"></a>The main Research Council items discussed on  2 March were the research and innovation aspects of Europe 2020, the global monitoring for the environment and security (GMES) programme, a joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (BONUS) and the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) nuclear fusion research project.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="10031065000024"></a>The Commission advised that research and innovation would be a central theme for the new Europe 2020 strategy. The UK said that the framework conditions for investment in research and innovation (R&amp;I) should be improved and suggested using the European Investment Fund to raise a further €3 billion from the private sector for venture capital. The UK also called for a greater proportion of the EU budget to be spent on these activities. The Commission said a detailed EU research and innovation plan would be launched in autumn 2010 which would focus on tackling "grand challenges" such as climate change, energy, food security, health and an ageing population.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="10031065000025"></a>At the discussion of GMES, the Commission stressed that it would have a prominent role within a new European space policy, the requirement for an effective governance structure and the need to identify further funding. A progress report was given on BONUS, with the Commission saying it would be a pilot initiative for research initiatives in other European marine regions.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="10031065000026"></a>The Commission also gave an update on ITER, saying it was vital that the project was delivered at a reasonable cost and within acceptable levels of risk. The Commission said that a range of funding options for ITER would be put to the council working group prior to further discussion at the May Competitiveness Council. The Research Council also adopted conclusions on the European Research Council and on European researchers' mobility and careers.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="10031065000028"></a>I am responding on behalf of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to the 39th report of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB), Cm 7837, which has been laid before Parliament today. I am grateful to the chair and members of the review body for their hard work.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="10031065000029"></a>For salaried doctors and dentists the DDRB has divided its recommended pay awards for 2010-11 into three groups:</p>
consultants-0 per cent;registrar grades, specialty doctors and associate specialists (SAS) grades, salaried general medical practitioners (GMPs) and salaried dentists-1 per cent; andfoundation house officers (1 and 2) and their equivalents-1.5 per cent.
<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="10031065000030"></a>In addition, the DDRB recommend that a banding multiplier be introduced for foundation house officer 1 posts that only attract basic pay and that this should be set at 1.05 of basic salary.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="10031065000031"></a>The Government do not accept that there is a compelling case for the recommended award of 1.5 per cent for foundation house officers and their equivalents, and in line with their evidence believe that all salaried doctors and dentists below consultant level should receive an award of 1 per cent. The remainder of the DDRB's pay recommendations for salaried doctors and dentists have been accepted in full by the Government.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="10031065000032"></a>For independent contractor general medical practitioners (GMPs), DDRB has recommended an increase in contractual payments to practices of 1.34 per cent designed to result in no increase to GMPs' average net income after allowing for movement in their expenses. With regard to general dental practitioners (GDPs), the DDRB has recommended a 1.44 per cent increase in contract values which the DDRB intends to result in no increase in GDPs' net income after allowing for movement in expenses.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="10031065000033"></a>In making these recommendations the DDRB has indicated that it considers efficiency savings made by GP and dental practices should only be taken into account retrospectively, after the scale of these savings becomes apparent in data showing trends in earnings and expenses. The Government do not consider this

In view of this, and in line with its evidence to the Pay Review Body, the Government have decided to abate the DDRB's recommendations for GMPs and GDPs by applying a prospective efficiency assumption of 1 per cent of contractors' operational costs. This will have the effect of reducing the proposed uplift in the value of contract payments to 0.8 per cent for GP practices and 0.9 per cent for dental practices.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="10031065000035"></a>The Board of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has decided to dissolve the executive agency status of the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) and to bring its staff and functions into the FSA to form the core of a new FSA Operations Group.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="10031065000036"></a>The MHS is an executive agency of the FSA and is responsible for verifying that operators of approved abattoirs, cutting plants and game-handling establishments in Great Britain fulfil their responsibilities for the production of safe meat and the protection of animal health and welfare.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="10031065000037"></a>All of the FSA's operational delivery functions, including those of the MHS, will be merged together in a single operations group to derive a wide range of benefits, including:</p>
a consistent, strategic view of the enforcement of legislation relating to all food business operators, irrespective of whether enforcement is undertaken by local or central government;a structure capable of better strategic delivery against external expectations and drivers-for example recommendations of the 2009 report of the public inquiry into the September 2005 outbreak of E.coli O157 in South Wales and recommendations of EU Food and Veterinary Office Missions;a more cohesive understanding of education and enforcement interventions that work in increasing food business operator compliance with food hygiene regulations; and co-ordinated and consistent support to UK businesses in relation to compliance with official controls and other statutory requirements.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="10031065000038"></a>Health and Rural Affairs Ministers in England and Wales have indicated their support for the FSA Board's decision-Ministers in Scotland noted the decision. In line with the process set out in Cabinet Office guidance, formal approval to dissolution of the executive agency status of the MHS has been granted by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the Minister for the Cabinet Office. The MHS will be merged into the FSA on 1 April 2010.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="10031065000039"></a>The dissolution of the MHS will not create a risk to public health and animal health and welfare. All existing regulatory functions undertaken by MHS operational staff in approved meat premises will continue to be undertaken by the same staff in the same way post-merger. Creation of the FSA Operations Group will increase the effectiveness of the FSA as a regulator in the longer term and reduce risk. Savings of approximately £2 million will be generated through the merger.</p>

<ul><a name="10031065000102"></a>"this House regrets that, following the judgment of the House of Lords in Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF and the subsequent revocation of AF's control order on the ground that he did not have a fair hearing, Her Majesty's Government have not, in the five years since the Act was passed, found a means of dealing with suspected terrorists that is just and effective; and calls on the Government to introduce primary legislation to limit the duration of control orders to a maximum of one year, without renewal".</ul>

<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS19"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column WS19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>system of control orders is both just and effective-for the reasons that I set out during the debate on Wednesday 3 March-and we have serious reservations about imposing a fixed time limit on the duration of control orders.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="10031065000047"></a>The protection of human rights is a key principle in all of our counterterrorism work-including in the use of control orders. Control orders are subject to numerous checks and balances, including judicial oversight in every case. During its review of the control order, the High Court must determine whether the Secretary of State's decision to make a control order was flawed. The judge must thus agree (a) that there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity, and (b) that a control order is necessary for purposes connected with protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism. The judge must also satisfy himself that each obligation imposed by the order is necessary, and compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights-including Articles 5 (right to liberty) and 8 (right to respect for private and family life). The judge will further ensure that the individual's right to a fair hearing in accordance with Article 6 is protected-which is now considered in the light of the Law Lords' June 2009 judgment in AF and Others. If any of these tests are not met, the judge can quash the order, quash one or more obligations imposed by the order or give directions for the revocation of the order or for the modification of the obligations it imposes.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="10031065000048"></a>The Government accept that control orders cannot entirely eliminate the risk of an individual's involvement in terrorism-related activity in every case. No executive action can do this. But in most cases control orders have restricted and disrupted that activity, and in some cases they have successfully prevented involvement in terrorism-related activity. The reports on control orders of the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, support this conclusion. His 2009 report made clear his view that control orders were "a largely effective necessity for a small number of cases, in the absence of a viable alternative for those few instances". His 2010 report examines individual cases in greater detail. In that report, he includes some more detailed commentary on effectiveness. For example, he states in relation to three controlled individuals that in each case the order:</p>
<ul><a name="10031065000099"></a>"has substantially reduced the present danger that exceptionally they still present despite their having been subject to a control order for a significant period of time. Unless control orders were replaced by some equally disruptive and practicable system, in these cases the repeal of control orders would create a worryingly higher level of public risk".</ul>
<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="10031065000049"></a>And in another case, Lord Carlile notes the controlled individual:</p>
<ul><a name="10031065000100"></a>"is assessed as a dangerous terrorist who would re-engage with terrorism the moment he could. I agree with this assessment, and that the control order is an effective intervention. I have no doubt that the removal of his control order would immediately increase risk in the UK and to UK interests elsewhere".</ul>
<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="10031065000050"></a>The Home Office works with partners to take every available step to protect the public from the threat we face from terrorism, including continuing to ensure that all control orders are as effective as they can be.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="10031065000051"></a>The Government do not intend to introduce primary legislation to limit the duration of control orders-whether to a maximum of one year without renewal, or to a maximum of two years save in exceptional circumstances, as Lord Carlile has previously proposed.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="10031065000052"></a>The Government's position continues to be that control orders should be imposed for as short a time as possible, commensurate with the risk posed. However, the Government have national security concerns about imposing an arbitrary end-date to control orders, regardless of the risk posed by that individual. Each order is addressing individual risk. There are obvious risks about assuming individuals no longer pose a threat after a defined period of time. If, to protect the public from the risk of terrorism posed by an individual, a control order is still necessary and proportionate, it is the Government's responsibility to renew that control order. A definite end-date would also mean individuals on control orders could simply disengage from involvement in terrorism-related activity on the basis that they knew they could re-engage at the end of that time period.</p>

In a judgment handed down in 2009 (Secretary of State for the Home Department v GG &amp; NN [2009] EWHC 142 (Admin)), the High Court upheld the second renewal of a control order, meaning that the judge in that case also agreed that a control order remained necessary to protect the public from a risk of terrorism for a longer period than two years. He made the following observations on this matter:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031065000101"></a>"Lord Carlile in reporting on the use of control orders has indicated that it is his view that no person should remain subject to an order for more than two years, save in rare cases. He believes that such a person's usefulness for terrorist purposes will have been seriously disrupted. The Government have not accepted that there should be what it describes as an arbitrary end date for individual orders. If there is evidence that an individual remains a danger, an order should continue for however long is necessary. That I entirely accept, and, to be fair, Lord Carlile recognised that there could be cases in which a duration of more than two years was appropriate. Much will depend on whether there is material which persuades the Secretary of State and the court that the individual remains a danger because he has been, notwithstanding the order, continuing so far as he could his terrorist-related activities or because he is likely to do so once an order is lifted. That in my view is the position with GG".</p>

<a name="100310-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="10031065000054"></a>Lord Carlile accepts in his 2010 report on control orders that there have been cases where the imposition of a control order against an individual can be justified for more than two years.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="10031065000055"></a>The statutory test in control orders legislation already ensures that the Government can only lawfully renew a control order if it is necessary to do so. And any decision by the Secretary of State to renew a control order can be appealed by the controlled person-and the High Court must agree that the test has been met. This ensures that rigorous judicial scrutiny of the necessity of the control order continues throughout the duration of the order.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="10031065000056"></a>The Government continue to work hard to identify exit strategies for every control order case. This is an integral and significant part of the Control Order Review Group's formal quarterly review of each control order. In his 2010 report on control orders,  


<notus-date day="10" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS21"></a><b>10 Mar 2010 : Column WS21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Carlile stated that he is "satisfied that in every case there is an ongoing search for a strategy for the ending of the order".</p>

<a name="100310-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="10031065000057"></a>Control orders continue to be an important tool to protect the public from the risk of terrorism where individuals whom we suspect of involvement in terrorism-related activity cannot be prosecuted or deported. While recognising the House's concerns, we remain of the view that control orders are a vital element of our overall approach to counterterrorism, and we do not believe that introducing primary legislation to limit control orders to one year without renewal would be in the national interest.</p>

Copies of the report are available on the <a href="http://www.ome.uk.com/review.cfm?body=2">www.ome.uk.com/review.cfm?body=2</a>.

a 1 per cent consolidated increase to the maximum point of all pay scales for the remit group;an additional 0.5 per cent for senior officers (giving a 1.5 per cent increase in total) to ensure a pay differential which offers a greater incentive for Prison Officers to seek promotion;a 1 per cent uplift to the required hours addition (RHA), where payable, to senior managers D and managers E to G; endorsement of proposals to ensure probationers recruited from 1 April 2009 are eligible for their first increment after no more than 15 months; no changes to the rate of any of the main allowances (eg specialist, tornado, payment plus) andno change to the rates of local pay.

<a name="100310-wms0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="10031065000090"></a>I wish to inform the House of the publication of a consultants' report entitled <I>Assessment of the provision of marine aids to navigation around the United Kingdom and Ireland</I>, and of a revision to the planned level of light dues rates from 1 April 2010.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a><a name="10031065000091"></a>On 10 June, I informed the House that the Department for Transport and the Irish Department of Transport had agreed to undertake an independent assessment of aids to navigation around the UK and Ireland. Subsequently, the department awarded a contract to Atkins, which has now completed the assessment.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a><a name="10031065000092"></a>The report of the assessment makes over 50 recommendations, many of which will be demanding of the three General Lighthouse Authorities (GLAs), and the two Governments, or which challenge long-standing assumptions about delivery and charging for the provision of aids to navigation. Key recommendations include:</p>
the creation of a GLA Joint Strategic Board to drive efficiencies; the use of an annual target reduction calculator (RPI-X%) for GLA running costs; andthe development of a "roadmap" agreed with  the Irish Government on the financing of the Commissioners of Irish Lights, setting out an incentivised financial model, which retains the all-Ireland body while allowing its costs within the Republic of Ireland to be covered wholly from Irish sources.
<a name="100310-wms0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a><a name="10031065000093"></a>The report also contains recommendations concerning the management of the General Lighthouse Fund and the charging of light dues.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a><a name="10031065000094"></a>Many of the recommendations can be implemented quickly. Others will prove challenging and we will need to consult widely on some before deciding how to proceed. Nevertheless I welcome the Atkins report, which offers a blueprint for the provision, management and funding of aids to navigation for many years  to come. The report will shortly be posted on the department's website and copies will be placed in  the Libraries of the House.</p>

<a name="100310-wms0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a><a name="10031065000095"></a>Last June, I also announced the first increases in light dues since 1993. They comprised a twofold set of increases, with the changes due to take effect on 1 July 2009 and 1 April 2010, providing payers with more time to prepare for the second rise and price their services accordingly.</p>

We have also worked closely with the GLAs to identify efficiency savings over and above the 5.6 per cent reductions I announced last year with further reductions being made in 2010-11, largely in back-office running costs. The Atkins report also makes recommendations to deliver further GLA efficiencies over time. All of these outcomes have reduced anticipated future calls on the General Lighthouse Fund.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a><a name="10031065000097"></a>In the light of these factors, and having listened to the views of the GLAs and the Lights Advisory Committee representing shipping industry light dues payers, I have reviewed the level of light dues needed to maintain the fund at a viable level. As a result, I

I am therefore reducing by 2p the increase in light dues to be paid on and after the 1 April so that the rate will stand at 41p per net registered tonne from that time. As previously announced, the tonnage cap will increase to 40,000 net registered tonnes, reflecting the increasing size of vessels that make up the world fleet.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="10031065000098"></a>I have chosen this course of action to ensure that the General Lighthouse Fund remains able to finance the GLAs and ensure the safety of all mariners, while recognising the difficult economic times that the shipping industry continues to experience.</p>

<a name="100310w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="10031084000007"></a>Net lending to businesses in the UK declined in 2009 in percentage terms at a similar rate to the 1990s recession. Similar trends have also been seen in the US, the euro area and Japan. The subdued level of lending over the past year reflects a number of factors. These include:</p>
a reappraisal of risk by lenders, investors and borrowers following the crisis;uncertainty about the prospects for the economy;financial institutions restructuring to deliver higher capital levels and more conservative loan exposures;larger businesses turning to reviving corporate bond and equity markets as an alternative source of external finance; andbusinesses restructuring and paying off debt during the recession.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a><a name="10031084000011"></a>Under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007, HMRC maintains a register of auditors, external accountants and tax advisers who are not supervised by one of the professional bodies listed in Schedule 3 to the regulations. These businesses are referred to collectively as accountancy service providers. An external accountant is a firm or sole practitioner who by way of business provides accountancy services to other persons. The service provided by a bookkeeper comes within the definition of external accountants. HMRC does not maintain a separate list of businesses that only provide bookkeeping services.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_1093"></a><a name="10031084001107"></a>The Medical Research Council (MRC) funds a wide spectrum of stem cell research supporting a range of approaches. This includes research on induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, some of which may involve the derivation of stem cells lines from patients to study disease using a range of technologies, including Yamanaka factors and subsequent developments. The MRC does not currently support any research which aims to derive patient-specific stem cells by human somatic cell nuclear transfer or through the use of traditional Chinese medicine.</p>

The MRC has also commissioned an independent study to investigate the views, values and experiences of potential donors in egg sharing for somatic cell nuclear transfer research; this study is due to end six months after the research project has been completed.</p>

It would be inappropriate to speculate on issues that may, or may not, have had an impact on recruitment until all of the data collection and analysis has been completed, and research papers have been published.</p>
