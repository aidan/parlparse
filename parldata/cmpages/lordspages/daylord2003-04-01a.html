</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their response to those who allege that plans for neighbourhood renewal, though sensible, may be stifled by complex representative structures.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister   (Lord Rooker): </B>  My Lords, in order to tackle the diversity of local needs, neighbourhood renewal plans must include structures for engaging with the full range of local stakeholders. We will do all that we can to continue to work with local partnerships as they seek to improve local decision-making and delivery mechanisms. However, this is not an area for prescriptive solutions from central government. Local problems require local remedies, and it is for local communities to decide what is best by way of the arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the Government have very wisely and sensibly given no less than £20 million to the cause of neighbourhood renewal in Tower Hamlets? In the light of that, does it not behove them to ensure that sensible arrangements are made in order to provide that that money becomes fully effective? Is the Minister aware that many people fear that instead of effective action, we will get another layer of chatter and bureaucracy just trotting about in the purloined garments of democracy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I thought that I had dealt with the noble Lord's issue regarding Tower Hamlets in January. I invited him to visit Tower Hamlets, and I repeat that invitation today. The leader of the council would be more than happy to discuss with the noble Lord, on the ground, the effectiveness of the neighbourhood renewal programmes in what is, I must say, the most deprived borough in the country. It is certainly the most deprived borough in London.
<P>

<a name="30401-01_para0"></a>The sums involved are £7.9 million last year and £10.6 million next year. The system for delivering that money has been accredited not by my department but by the Audit Commission. Contrary to some rumours peddled by certain people, the number of groups and bodies involved in the delivery to local people is very <P>


<a name="column_1158"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>modest; namely, some eight local partnerships, five theme groups and one overall management group. There is much public money to be looked after. It is important that it is looked after to local people's satisfaction, which I understand it is, and that it is accredited by the Audit Commission. This is the best way to deal with the problems in that deprived borough.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister tell the House how the Government intend to allocate the extra money contained within the Comprehensive Spending Review for next year? Will the money continue to be allocated to the current 88 localities or will it be ring-fenced to hit government targets rather than locally set ones?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that that was a very friendly question in the way it was put. So far as I am aware, without notice on the specifics, the programme remains for the 88 most deprived areas of the country. We can easily make big programmes by spreading money thinly. The idea of this programme, over a number of years, was to target it. There are always other areas on the border of meeting the deprivation indices near to the 88. But we decided to concentrate on the 88 areas in order to make a real difference to the lives of people in those communities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clarke of Hampstead: </B>   My Lords, I should like to ask another friendly question. In places such as Burnley, the neighbourhood renewal plans have brought great hope and some joy to people who have suffered decades of neglect. Will the Minister agree that the local strategic partnerships, which are helping to carry out these plans, are doing a valuable job? I could not agree with the Minister more that it must be left to local people. In the case of Burnley, they are doing a first-class job after the difficulties of a couple of years ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend speaks with knowledge of Burnley. There is evidence that the local strategic partnerships being set up around the country are proving effective in taking out other layers of organisations which have sometimes got in the way. I fully admitted that to the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, in my answer in January. There were complications in delivering many different programmes in areas. I used the analogy "almost like a bowl of spaghetti" and people not understanding the flow of finances. The local strategic partnerships are cutting through that, reducing the numbers of different organisations involved and it is to be hoped that they are obtaining better value for money.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister agree with the view that proposals, though sensible, may be stifled by complex representative institutions? It is one which, at different times, has been held by every government who have ever put proposals before Parliament.
<P>


<a name="column_1159"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, yes, in order to make things happen and do things. No Minister comes to Parliament with bad ideas. They are all very sensible ideas. It is making them a practical reality that touches the footprints and fingerprints of people's lives so that they can see a connection between what is said in this House and another place and what is happening in their local community.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as the chairman of the Neighbourhood Management Board of Castle Vale, the successor body to the housing action trust. Is my noble friend aware that community representatives on the Castle Vale estate have made a brilliant success of the transformation of that pig-sty civic area into something that is now a leading-edge example of regeneration? I can assure my noble friend that they will continue to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I know the area well. There were times in the 1970s and 1980s when many of my constituents who wanted to move broke down in tears in my surgery when they were told to go to Castle Vale. "Please don't send me there", they begged. Now people are queuing up to get into Castle Vale, not to get out of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, while applauding the initiatives being taken&#151;particularly those in Tower Hamlets, which is certainly one of the most deprived areas in the country&#151;will the Minister consider returning to the House with a detailed report on how such schemes are working? Having visited two Sure Start schemes in London, which are very impressive indeed in their initial stages, I believe that such initiatives merit more information being given to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I shall come back to report on these matters as often as the House wishes. I am pleased that there is an interest in this subject. There are pockets of deprivation all over the country&#151;they are not confined to the cities&#151;and we are attempting to change people's lives. All programmes are in their early days&#151;they are only one, two or three years old&#151;and have had an extremely short time in which to make a difference. I believe that the House and another place should keep such schemes under constant surveillance and hold Ministers to account for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is not only the House that needs to keep these schemes under constant review? In declaring an interest as a resident of Lambeth, what are the Government doing to ensure that the local strategic partnerships draw these schemes to the attention of the 99.5 per cent of the people in their neighbourhoods who have no idea of what is being done in their name?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I do not wish to nitpick but to say that 99.5 per cent of people do not know what is going on is, frankly, an exaggeration. I met certain <P>


<a name="column_1160"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>groups of the leadership of Lambeth Council yesterday to discuss matters relating to their planning service, which has in the past been poor but which has seen massive improvements over the past couple of years. Indeed, the council received the fourth highest planning development grant for the new scheme that has recently been announced to reflect its improved performance. I gave encouragement to continue that improvement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Strange: </B>   My Lords, speaking and declaring an interest as a taxpayer, does the Minister agree that when he says "government money" he actually means "our money"? As taxpayers, we are all interested in seeing that our money is spent correctly and directly on deprived areas and less on the people who are creaming it off and running about, as the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I dispute that there are people creaming it off and running about. All right, I made a slip of the tongue: all the money is taxpayers' money, whether it is raised locally through businesses or through individuals. It is just quicker to say "government".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, we have 40 minutes and there are only four questions. As the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House is not getting to his feet, I assume that I can continue.
<P>

<a name="30401-02_para0"></a>Does the Minister agree that one of the problems in local government at the present time is the system of cabinet government where only a few people are involved in making important decisions? The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is surely right when he says that people feel a little disenfranchised with local government at the present time. Does the Minister consider that it would be a good idea&#151;as happens in the countryside where there are parish councils&#151;to set up neighbourhood councils in large cities and towns to help with planning and the distribution of the aid available from central government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, that is exactly what is happening in some big urban areas in parishes where devolution is taking place. If there is such a large interest in this subject, I hope that there will be a substantial attendance in the House on Thursday when I shall be bringing forward the Local Government Bill for your Lordships' consideration.

<A NAME="30401-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Berkeley </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether, in view of the inconvenience caused by the closure of the Central Underground line, they will take steps to expedite its reopening.

<a name="column_1161"></a>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government are well aware of the misery, which is worse than inconvenience, that the closure of the Central Line is causing passengers and businesses. We share their concerns about the considerable time it has taken to restore services. Some services are now running on eastern and western sections of the line and London Underground will announce this afternoon that a through service from Loughton to Ealing Broadway will open on Thursday. The Government will continue to keep up the pressure on London Underground to deliver improvements to the service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that Answer. Ten weeks after the accident happened it is good to know that one train might achieve the long distance from one end of the line to the other. Is my noble friend aware that a similar accident happened in Philadelphia in 1990, which involved a motor falling off the bottom of a train? Sadly, four people were killed. On that occasion the line was reopened four days later. Who is responsible for allowing or not allowing the Central Line to reopen? Whose signature has to be the first one on the piece of paper? It seems that everyone is frightened of making a decision, which, as my noble friend said, is affecting many millions of people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am not aware of what happened in Philadelphia. In London the responsibility falls on London Underground and Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate, which is part of the Health and Safety Executive. I do not know what were the engineering conditions in Philadelphia but my noble friend should take into account that here we are talking about a Tube line on which there are 2,800 motors, each as big as a dustbin and weighing half a tonne. There is a motor on every axle of every train. That means that there are 11,000 bolts. Each time a motor is replaced it has to be lifted off the bogies, placed over an inspection pit&#151;there is one at each end of the line&#151;and the new bolts and new safety brackets have to be installed. That is a big job.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister explain whether the delay is due in any part to necessary track repairs as well as repairs to the trains? If, as the Minister has said, the trains are being repaired and the motors rebolted, why have not those trains that have been repaired come back into service as quickly as possible?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, this is not a matter concerning the track, but rather one concerning the motors on the trains. In fact, trains have been coming back into service. The first group were brought back into service on 14th March, the second group on 24th March. Furthermore, as I have said, from this Thursday a through service will operate from Loughton to Ealing Broadway. I understand that London Underground intends for all stations on the line to be served by Easter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell the House whether the opportunity <P>


<a name="column_1162"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provided by this prolonged closure has been taken by London Underground to carry out necessary track, signal and station maintenance while the line is closed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, advantage has been taken of the closure to carry out modifications to the bolts and safety brackets for the motors. That has been the most urgent work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I know that that is not a full answer to the question put by the noble Baroness, Lady Scott. I hope that she will be able to contain her impatience.
<P>

<a name="30401-02_para1"></a>The Central Line is part of the second element of the three public/private partnerships due to be signed within the next few weeks. All the issues raised by the noble Baroness in her question will be tackled by the partnership. There would have been no advantage in seeking to do anything about the situation in advance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, has there been any news with regard to the bolts and brackets holding the motors on trains on the other Underground lines in London?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Central Line is very peculiar&#151;I say that in full anticipation of the laughter which will follow. The central section of the Central Line has very sharp bends and therefore the trains on that line are designed differently; that is, the trains are put together in two-carriage sets rather than four-carriage sets. For that reason, the trains have motors fitted on every axle of every carriage. That is not the case on any other line and thus there is no reason to suppose that the problems which have arisen with the 1993 rolling stock&#151;those are the trains we are referring to&#151;could arise on any other of the Underground lines.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that when the original contract for the Central Line rolling stock was awarded in the late 1980s, the previous government decided that they would split the maintenance of the trains from the procurement of them? Does he agree that, in retrospect, perhaps that was a mistake? A much greater incentive is generated if those providing the rolling stock also have to take responsibility for maintaining them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Central Line contract was a disgrace. It went way over budget and took far too long. For many months now I have been citing it as an example of the justification for the public/private partnership in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="30401-02_para2"></a>Yes, problems arise if engineering contracts are separated from any responsibility for subsequent maintenance. That is exactly what the public/private partnership is all about; that is, it is designed to ensure that those who undertake such contracts bear continuing and long-term responsibility for their work.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spopq1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they intend to take any action in respect of the policies and performance of the Medical Research Council.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, we note the Select Committee report on the Medical Research Council issued on 25th March and are reviewing its recommendations. We shall make a detailed response in due course, but the MRC is highly renowned around the world for its track record in promoting excellent medical research.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. I had intended to mention the report in my Question, but under the procedures of the House, I was not allowed to do so. That is why the Question has been worded as it appears on the Order Paper.
<P>

<a name="30401-02_para3"></a>The report states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have found evidence of poor financial management and poor planning, with too many funds committed over long periods leading to large numbers of top quality grant proposals being turned down".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-02_para4"></a>
As someone who has always had a high regard for the Medical Research Council, I was very disturbed to read press reports concerning this Select Committee report, especially as public expenditure of over £400 million is involved. Can the Minister reassure the House that the Government have had no cause to worry about the Medical Research Council and that they continue to value its work?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that question. In view of the press accounts of the Select Committee report, I should like to take this opportunity to assure the House that the report does not suggest that the structure of the MRC is faulty, that money has been wasted or that there has been any financial impropriety. The criticisms have related to the allocation of funds between responsive-mode funding and managed funding, the management of commitment and forward funding, consultation and the way that the peer review of the UK Biobank project was handled. These are complex issues, in many cases involving matters of judgment, and therefore they require careful responses.
<P>

<a name="30401-02_para5"></a>I should also say that in the past we have had some concerns as regards the processes of financial planning and commitment. We have been working with the MRC to address those concerns and we are satisfied that good progress has been made.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030401/text/30401-03.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a former member of the Medical Research Council during the 1970s. Even at that time criticisms <P>


<a name="column_1164"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were often levelled against the MRC by disgruntled scientists who failed to secure funding for their research. Is it not the case that the MRC has a proud record of achievement which has won for it international respect and acclaim? Does the Minister accept that many members of the scientific community regard a number of points made in the report as being seriously misconceived, not least the fact that so much criticism has been levelled against the UK Biobank project? That project was warmly commended and strongly supported by the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology in its inquiry into UK genetic databases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has made a number of points. I agree completely and say again that the MRC has gained an excellent world-wide reputation for its funding of medical research, and I do not think that anything in the report suggests otherwise. A number of criticisms have been made of certain specific issues and certainly there is a need to improve some of the financial planning and commitment. However, those problems should not detract from the excellent work carried out by the council in the past.
<P>

<a name="30401-03_para0"></a>As regards the UK Biobank project, again I believe that some of the press reaction has rather overstated what is set out in the report. The report itself makes the point that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Biobank is an exciting project and we commend the MRC's efforts to ensure that the UK is taking the lead in harvesting the fruits of the human genome".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-03_para1"></a>
Thus even in the report it is understood that this is an extremely important and imaginative project which should be supported.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, the paragraph immediately following the one from which the Minister has just quoted goes on to state that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is not clear to us that Biobank was peer-reviewed and funded on the same basis as any other grant proposal. Our impression is that a scientific case for Biobank has been put together by the funders to support a politically driven project".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-03_para2"></a>
I believe that the Minister was only partially quoting from the report. Over recent years UK Biobank has received £45 million, the lion's share of funding from the MRC. Will the Minister take seriously the criticisms made by the Select Committee to the effect that it was possible that the UK Biobank proposal was not peer-reviewed. The Select Committee is well regarded, as is the MRC both now and historically, so the Minister should not brush aside lightly any criticisms made by the committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I made it clear in my original Answer that we take the report seriously and shall consider it in detail. However, I do not think that the noble Lord is correct to say that the UK Biobank project was not peer-reviewed. In fact, it was peer-reviewed by an international panel. Furthermore, it was not reviewed on the basis of a normal grant project, but rather as a major infrastructure project. Such projects are never <P>


<a name="column_1165"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reviewed on exactly the basis as other projects. UK Biobank is a major infrastructure project and was peer-reviewed by a very distinguished international panel which supported it. On that basis, while there may be criticism, it should be kept in proportion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a practising scientist whose laboratory has repeatedly benefited from funding granted by the Medical Research Council, although obviously from time to time we, too, have felt disgruntled when we have not secured a grant.
<P>

<a name="30401-03_para3"></a>Is it not fair to say that the Medical Research Council is to be congratulated on the excellence of medical research in Britain, due in large part to its scientific leadership and to the standards and levels of funding which the Government have allowed the Medical Research Council to contribute? May that long continue.
<P>

<a name="30401-03_para4"></a>It is essential that large projects such as UK Biobank compete side by side with smaller projects, and that those large projects continue. As a way of improving funding from the Medical Research Council, does the Minister agree that some more attention might be given to extending project grants rather than merely collaborative grants? Collaborative grants are important, but project grants often launch new science in a slightly different way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I totally agree about the quality of the MRC's science. Project grants versus collaborative grants is another area of debate within the medical research community. We need to look at this very carefully and discuss it more fully with the MRC before we give a reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, it is quite difficult to maintain the usual courtesies between the Houses when in a report from another place this immensely imaginative project, the UK Biobank, is described as politically motivated. Is it not a fact that the project is leading the world in bringing together a person's genetic make-up, environment and lifestyle in a unique way&#151;half a million people will be in the survey&#151;which will enable society in future to predict, prevent and cure some of the world's most devastating illnesses?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I do not quite understand what it means to say that this project is politically driven. I fear it is simply a rather low-level form of abuse to describe it as political. I do not think that that is the kind of abuse another place should indulge in.
<P>

<a name="30401-03_para5"></a>I agree with the noble Lord that the project is leading the world in this respect. Various other countries see it as a major and important source of valuable information. I regard it as an extremely important project.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recall the recommendation of the House of Lords Select Committee on stem cells that a discrete <P>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1166</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>line should be kept between embryos and eggs being used for research purposes and those being gathered from fertility clinics? Will he therefore look again at the way in which the MRC has decided to fund nurses working in fertility clinics, bearing in mind the proscription that is placed on such activity in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990? In upholding the very high standards to which the noble Lord has just alluded, it is important that that separation is maintained.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, that is an important question. I will take a further look at this to see whether there is any issue on which we should focus.

<A NAME="30401-03_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they are considering any new initiatives to help people with mental illness.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, we have embarked upon a long-term programme of modernisation to increase the capacity of the mental health service, provide better access to effective treatment and care, reduce unfair variation and raise standards. This includes action to implement the national service framework for mental health. Our strategy, as always, will be informed by research and development.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. Can she confirm or dispute a report that mental illness is the cause of 50 per cent of all measured disability, yet only 12 per cent of NHS funding and 6 per cent of the medical research budget is spent on it? If those figures are broadly correct&#151;and I believe that the research went up to 2001&#151;will my noble friend tell the House what the Government intend to do to change this very sorry picture?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I suspect that no one knows better than the noble Lord just how long a history of neglect mental health has in this country and the extent of the under-funding that we inherited in 1997. We have made mental health a priority in several ways, primarily through the first national service framework that we established, with seven standards aimed at raising standards across mental health services. Those standards are generating improvement in community development services and in many different ways. We have made £300 million extra available for three years to 2003&#150;04 to develop prevention and care services. We have invested in finding out what is needed, primarily by establishing a new institute, the National Institute of Mental Health, which will play a key role in research and development and good local practice. I think that we can look forward to a better future in mental health.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   Yes, my Lords, there is a new range of atypical antipsychotic drugs which seem to be helping people significantly. We understand there have been some concerns about delays, but all PCTs are required to follow the NICE guidance after three months and make those drugs available. We believe that they are making a difference.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, the Minister referred to the national service framework. Can she confirm that money will be adequate to implement the national service framework and that it is being received by those trusts to which it has been allocated. Can she also confirm whether the Mind Out mental health campaign, which is an excellent government initiative, will carry on beyond this year, whether it will be funded and whether it will be evaluated by the Government?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, on the first part of the question, we believe that the funds allocated are sufficient. We are beginning to see growth across the service&#151;for example, 22 new early intervention teams are in place in local communities. These are particularly intended to pick up young people who display psychotic attitudes and episodes. We have 63 new crisis resolution teams for people in acute need; we have 191 assertive outreach services. We are already noticing the difference now that we have these community developments in place. For example, where the crisis resolution teams are in place, we have seen a 30 per cent drop in admissions to hospital.
<P>

<a name="30401-04_para0"></a>On the second part of the noble Lord's question, I shall have to write to him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the National Health Service is now working more closely with the Prison Service? Will there be any new initiatives to help those prisoners who are mentally ill, of whom there are far too many?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, that is a very important question when one considers that 90 per cent of people in prison have some sort of mental disorder. Again, the health service has been working much more closely with the Prison Service for over a year; the PCTs will be driving the funding for the Prison Service as of this April. We are seeing a much more integrated service, which is very helpful.
<P>

<a name="30401-04_para1"></a>We already have 48 teams working in 48 prisons to develop inreach services and more psychiatric services. We hope that there will be 70 of those by next April. Although it was not exactly a target, we hope that by 2006 every prison will have these additional and very important services.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the development of inreach services for mental patients in <P>


<a name="column_1168"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>our prisons. What is being done to make places available for the 500 people in our prisons who still need residential psychiatric care? How will those places be provided?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I am not entirely sure which population the noble Lord is talking about, but I can tell him that because of the development of the range of community services as a whole and the development of specialised mental health trusts, there should be increased capacity across the service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, further to the Minister's answer to my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy, is she satisfied with the availability of the latest drug to help schizophrenics?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, as I said, there have been concerns that the new atypical antipsychotic drugs, which were the subject of NICE guidance last summer, have not been reaching patients quickly enough. However, we have seen the rates of prescription going up, so we think that they are reaching more of the people who need them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister think that, given the complications caused by mental illness and its diversity, there should be at least some form of legislation to ensure that people who have one episode of mental illness are not discriminated against in employment and so on for the rest of their lives?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, that is an extremely important matter. We are considering ways of ensuring that people with mental health problems are not excluded from employment. For example, the Social Exclusion Unit is about to start work on a report examining social exclusion of people with mental illness. It will examine particularly the employment prospects of such people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, speaking of legislation, can my noble friend give us a progress report on the redrafting of the expected mental health Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, there was an extremely large response to the consultation on the draft Bill. Over 2,000 responses were received. They are still being evaluated. A report will be published but the Bill itself will have to wait for parliamentary time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew11"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that research suggests that a healthy relationship between an infant and his or her parents is likely to reduce susceptibility to certain kinds of mental disorder in adulthood? Does she further agree that the work of my noble friend Lord Northbourne&#151;who I see is present&#151;in championing support for parents, that of the noble Baroness, Lady Brigstocke, with Home Start and that of the Government's own Sure Start programme are likely to prevent many children developing certain kinds of mental disorder in <P>


<a name="column_1169"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>adulthood and may indeed have an impact on those 90 per cent of adults in prison with personality or similar disorders?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree. There is no doubt that loving family relationships are absolutely essential for people to develop into sound adults. We are investing in parenting schemes such as Home Start, through which homes are accessed that would otherwise be very difficult to reach, and Sure Start, which helps many families who are not entirely confident about bringing up their children and want advice and support. Those are fundamental building blocks to a better and healthier society in terms of mental health.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew13"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that in the five years from August 1997 the number of people claiming state benefit on grounds of mental illness has dramatically increased? There has been an increase of 78 per cent in those claiming Disability Living Allowance and an increase of 25 per cent in those claiming incapacity benefit. What do those figures say about the state of mental health services in Britain? Do they not underline the priority that the Government should be giving to this area of healthcare?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, the reasons for those figures may be complex and diverse. For example, they may reflect an ageing population and the forms of dependence that come with it. As I said, one of the matters that the Social Exclusion Unit will examine is how to increase employment opportunities for people with mental health problems. I imagine that many people on incapacity benefit could be helped with extra support resulting from the changes in incapacity benefit. The figures say a lot about the health of the nation but we are putting new remedies in place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Howells of St Davids: </B>   My Lords, one of the most worrying considerations for the Caribbean community is the number of black males in mental institutions and the treatment they receive. Can the Minister tell the House whether there has been any advance in the type of treatment that they now receive, or whether there is any on offer?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, we are certainly aware that black and ethnic minority people are disproportionately represented in the part of the population with mental health problems. A report was published in March on how to improve mental health services for black and ethnic minority people which explores some of the reasons services fail. After consultation we shall publish implementation guidance in the summer which will address the question of how we get the black and ethnic minority workers we want; how we deal with language issues; how we build capacity; and how we clear pathways for people in need to get the help they want. We hope that by making that a priority&#151;certainly the National Institute of Mental Health will help us do that&#151;we shall be able to make a significant difference to that population.

<P>

<a name="30401-04_para6"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 1, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-04_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   I have received indirectly a message from the Chief Whip that if I intend to speak to the Question that the clause stand part I should do so expeditiously. Despite the dulcet tones of the Chief Whip, I intended to do so in any event.
<P>

<a name="30401-04_para7"></a>What I wish to say I can put very shortly. Clause 1 is without redemption. We have two matters to consider. First, the clear-cut issue; namely, whether the existing law, which requires the proof of a guilty mind as in all serious offences, subject, of course, to a measure of objectivity&#151;because by statute the jury is told that the reasonableness or otherwise of a belief is evidence of whether the belief was genuinely held&#151;should stand having been in existence for some 40 years without any complaint. Alternatively, we should consider whether the golden thread, as that obligation is known, should be cut and in its stead there should be put in place a new obligation which results in the accused being guilty of rape if he is negligent. That is the clear-cut issue.
<P>

<a name="30401-04_para8"></a>The second matter is the feasibility&#151;the practicality&#151;of what is now proposed. In that regard I wish to refer to one and only one quotation. It has already been referred to by me on Second Reading but it is particularly apposite in view of the debate yesterday. It is from an essay of Professor Hogan, written in 1978, and given in honour of Professor Glanville Williams, who was virtually a permanent member of the Criminal Law Revision Committee of which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, who gave such an admirable speech yesterday, was also a member. He stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The least that can be said&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-04_para9"></a>
he was referring to the existing law on sexual offences&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in its favour is that it is accessible and even with the accretions of case law, it may fairly be said that a layman possessing ordinary powers of comprehension is not at all hard put to make both head and tail of it. Since the layman, and sometimes the lawyer, is sometimes hard put to make either head or tail of much modern legislation these attributes should never be undervalued. Whether or not a man likes the law that he reads, it is a signal advantage to him to be able to understand it . . .  Again, when in Morgan v. D.P.P. the House of Lords decided that an honest belief in consent was a defence to a charge of rape, the opposition was so considerable that it seemed only a matter of time before the <P>

<a name="column_1171"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1171</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>decision was overturned. But in the end much of the opposition was brought round to accepting the essential good sense of that decision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-04_para10"></a>
That is what I believe has happened as a result of yesterday's debate.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I want to say a few words on clause stand part as it gives an opportunity to reflect on the many important issues debated yesterday. I reiterate that we on these Benches are open to change on the definition of rape and the other sexual offences, but we have always said that those changes need to be demonstrably workable and effective. If one thing was demonstrated yesterday, it was that there were considerable doubts about workability and effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="30401-05_para0"></a>We need to be clear that any changes that we make will result in better outcomes. One of the striking facts that came from the Minister yesterday was that the rape conviction rate for those who went to trial by jury was 41 per cent, compared with 73 per cent overall. That shows that there is a problem. Whether we have the right result in the formulation in the clause is very much open to doubt after yesterday's debate.
<P>

<a name="30401-05_para1"></a>One of the problems with the way in which the grouping worked out yesterday was that I did not have a chance to sum up in our debate on Clause 78, although the Minister offered to withdraw his amendment at one stage, if I recall. Nothing that we heard during yesterday's debate led us to believe that Clause 78 was workable in any real sense. We will want to return to that on Report.
<P>

<a name="30401-05_para2"></a>I hope that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, will not press his opposition to Clause 1 stand part today, because we still have some way to travel in terms of how we can improve the Bill. I hope that the Minister and his officials will engage in constructive dialogue, in particular with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, based on his constructive amendments that we discussed yesterday.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that it may be wise to press any opposition to Clause 1 on Report and give the Government time to reconsider. The debate yesterday demonstrated that the clause as drafted is completely unworkable and will cause enormous problems. Not only is it unworkable, but it is bad in principle.
<P>

<a name="30401-05_para3"></a>I have my own bone to pick with the Minister, who suggested that at Second Reading I had,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"proposed that the right way to deal with the matter was for there to be a date rape offence&#151;that is, an acquaintanceship rape offence&#151;and another offence".&#151;[Official Report, 31/3/03; cols. 1151-52.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-05_para4"></a>
When I intervened and said that I had never said anything of the sort, the Minister pressed the matter and said that it appeared that I had changed my position since Second Reading. He went on to reiterate that point.
<P>


<a name="column_1172"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-05_para5"></a>I have read what I said on Second Reading in case I happened to say something that could remotely justify that comment yesterday from the Minister, but there is nothing to do so in it. I did not refer to date rape or acquaintance rape. In no correspondence or discussions&#151;I have had discussions with and sent memorandums and drafts to him&#151;have I ever suggested that I or we on these Benches draw any distinction between date rape or acquaintance rape and marital rape and stranger rape. That has never been my position. Why did he suggest that it had?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I should be most grateful if the Minister could take the opportunity of the debate to tell us how the offences are intended to mesh. What sort of behaviour will lead to a person being charged with one offence or another?
<P>

<a name="30401-05_para6"></a>Almost the only difference between rape under Clause 1 and assault by penetration under Clause 3 is that one can rape in the mouth but not commit assault by penetration in the mouth. I am bemused as to why that is. On what occasions would the Minister expect the prosecution to prefer a charge under Clause 3?
<P>

<a name="30401-05_para7"></a>I should also be grateful for some enlightenment as to what sort of behaviour we are looking at under Clause 5. Does pinching the passing bottom count as an assault of the relevant type? Where is the boundary drawn? Common sense may be thought to apply but, given some of the actions sought to be outlawed by provisions from Clause 70 on, I am not entirely sure that the drafting of the Bill has had common sense in mind at all times.
<P>

<a name="30401-05_para8"></a>To what extent are the offences in Clause 7 separate from those in Clause 3? I do not see how they will mesh. We had so much debate about whether "oral" belonged in one or the other and what the proper compass of such offences was. No other amendment addresses the matter, so I should be very grateful if the Minister would cover it now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I have no questions to put to the Minister on the long debate that we had yesterday, which he entertained with great courtesy and patience. All that I want to say is that, having moved amendments to Clause 1(3), I hope when we return to the matter on Report to be able to persuade the House that that is the right approach. I had very large support yesterday. I am therefore grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, for not pre-empting that outcome today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   So far as the opposition of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, to the Question that Clause 1 stand part of the Bill is concerned, he rightly identified the issues that we went through yesterday. I do not think that I can assist the Committee by repeating my points in relation to reasonableness or workability. We had a long debate on that.
<P>

<a name="30401-05_para9"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that we need to reflect carefully on what was said yesterday. I would find it useful to have conversations with her and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, to <P>


<a name="column_1173"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discuss the detail. From yesterday's debate, I take the point that several Members of the Committee firmly opposed the idea of introducing an element of reasonableness into the consent issue. In particular, I identify the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, who is not in her place at the moment.
<P>

<a name="30401-05_para10"></a>I understood the vast range of other Members of the Committee who spoke, including the noble Lords, Lord Alexander of Weeden and Lord Thomas of Gresford, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Noakes and Lady Walmsley, to take the basic position of exploring whether to put reasonableness in. Some were committed to it, and some tried to put it in in a different way from that used by the Government. We obviously need to reflect on that approach before Report.
<P>

<a name="30401-05_para11"></a>I said that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, proposed a lesser offence of date rape because that was my recollection of his speech at Second Reading. I completely apologise if I am wrong. I have not had a chance to read it again. My noble friend Lord Bassam has drawn to my attention the fact that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, certainly thought that a more limited offence was proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, if not in his speech then somewhere else. Both of us came away with the wrong impression. I apologise in relation to that.
<P>

<a name="30401-05_time0"></a><H5>3.30 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-05_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I should clarify for the Minister's sake that I said that I was happy with the clear range of offences laid out in my noble friend's amendment. That was workable for the courts and understandable for the general public. It also takes account of the problem expressed by some noble Lords yesterday about the difficulty associated with rape in the mouth, which is labelled differently but which is just as serious and just as much of an offence against the privacy and dignity of the person. My noble friend's amendment takes account of that problem and many others.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   As I say, I apologise unreservedly to the noble Lord for having the wrong impression in that respect.
<P>

<a name="30401-05_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, asked me to identify what is involved in the main generic sexual offences that will be created. Rape, which we have already discussed, involves penile penetration of the anus, vagina or mouth. Assault by penetration is penetration of those areas but not with the penis. Sexual assault is any non-consensual assault of a sexual nature. Sexual assault of a child under 13 is different because the consent of the child is no longer an issue. Any child of 12 or under is presumed not to be able to consent. Causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent would occur where, for example, a woman forces a man to have sex with her. I could go through those points in much greater detail but I do not believe that it would assist the Committee.

<A NAME="30401-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   I am somewhat surprised that the Minister did not include in his honourable mentions the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, whose speech on the desirability of retaining the law as it is was outstanding.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I apologise to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. I entirely agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, that the speech was outstanding&#151;it was so outstanding that it blinded me to the extent that I completely forgot that it had been made. Now that the noble and learned Lord reminds me of it, I remember that it was a truly excellent speech.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-05_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   I was blinded to the extent that I thought that the noble and learned Lord had mentioned me!

<A NAME="30401-05_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   In future, I shall test the extent to which I have succeeded in making speeches by their effect on the eyesight of the noble and learned Lord. That is a strange way of judging the merit of what one puts before him.

<a name="30401-05_para13"></a>It is clear that the feeling of the Committee is that it wants more time in which to consider the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley </B>   moved Amendment No. 9:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 2, after "person" insert "aged 16 or over"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-06_para0"></a><P>

<a name="30401-06_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 20, 31 and 47.
<P>

<a name="30401-06_para2"></a>We turn to a group of amendments relating to very young people. The purpose of these amendments is to prevent the prosecution of boys under the age of consent or 16 years old who participate in sexual activity of any kind with a girl under 13 with her consent. The amendments are not intended to prevent the prosecution of children under the age of 16 where they have committed rape, sexual assault or any other sexual offence in which the victim did not consent because those offences are dealt with under Clauses 1, 3, 5 and 7 and because the age of neither offender nor victim is specified in those clauses.
<P>

<a name="30401-06_para3"></a>The amendments are about bringing some common sense, humanity and justice to this important new law, which is designed to protect children from abuse. The Home Secretary said in the White Paper that the existing law was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"archaic and incoherent&#151;it is also discriminatory".
<P>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Without the amendments, the law may remain all of those things. It could produce appalling injustices. For example, a boy of 12 who had sexual intercourse initiated by a girl of the same age would be automatically guilty of rape and liable to a life sentence. It also poses risks to children's health and welfare. One can easily imagine that girls under the age of 13 might avoid approaching doctors because they know that all sexual activity is defined as serious child abuse when those who are under 13 are involved and that the doctor must report to social services; it is also, of course, a criminal offence. Their boyfriend may get into serious trouble and they would fail to get contraceptive and other health advice. I am sure that that is not what the Government intend.
<P>

<a name="30401-06_para5"></a>The Government should follow the example of Finland. In 1998, the Finnish Government decided to update their penal law on sexual offences. As in England, 16 was set as the age of consent. However, Section 6(2) of Chapter 20 of the new Finnish penal code provided that sex with an under-16 year-old,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall not be deemed sexual abuse of a child, if there is no great difference in the ages or the mental and physical maturity of the persons involved".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-06_para6"></a>
Germany and other countries also followed that course. In countries where the age of criminal responsibility is high&#151;15 to 17 years, unlike 10 years in our country&#151;under-age sex is automatically decriminalised for that age group. Many European countries, such as Sweden and Norway, fall into that category. Surely the Finnish approach shows an appropriate modernisation of the law. We may not like young adolescents having sex but it happens, and it does not involve the criminal child abuse that the Bill is supposed to be tackling.
<P>

<a name="30401-06_para7"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Minister may say that if we have an age of consent we must stick to it. However, it should be noted that the Bill already allows a defence of consent if someone is charged with raping 13 to 15 year-olds and they are also under the age of consent. So it would not introduce a legal anomaly to say that for under-16s who are charged with raping under-13s, a defence of consent may also be available.
<P>

<a name="30401-06_para8"></a>I hope that the Minister will accept that it is inappropriate to use the full weight of the criminal law in cases where young people who are close in age are experimenting. Educational and health advice&#151;and, in some cases, the child protection system&#151;are much more appropriate ways of addressing that issue. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I shall briefly clarify the position of those on these Benches. We will consider the broad issue again in relation to child sex offences, when we will debate in particular whether we should criminalise that activity or whether the dominant issue is one of social and medical support.
<P>

<a name="30401-06_para9"></a>Let me be clear about our approach to those who are under 13. We believe that a cut-off age of 13 is appropriate and practical. The issue of consent should not be relevant in relation to such young children. We believe that regardless of the age of the defendant. To <P>


<a name="column_1176"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1176</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have anything less on the statute book would involve a broad assumption that there are circumstances in which it is appropriate or acceptable for a young child to be involved in sexual activity. We do not believe that and therefore accept that the offence should exist in law. I do not suppose that every 14 or 15 year-old who has sexual intercourse with a 12 year-old will be prosecuted but I do not believe that it is right to remove that possibility from the statute book in all circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   As the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, stated, a fundamental justification for the under-13 offence is the age and vulnerability of the victim. We do not think it is right that where the victim is 12 or under the question of consent should arise. There will be many cases where it would be utterly invidious for a 12 year-old or under to have to give evidence in relation to consent. We therefore think that there needs to be a cut-off period. We think we have got the cut-off period right.
<P>

<a name="30401-06_para10"></a>The amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, seek to provide that it would not be possible to charge a defendant aged under 16 at the time of the alleged offences with any of the under-13 child sex offences. The noble Baroness prays in aid the Finnish experience in relation to that. The amendments would mean that where the evidence did not support charges for any of the under-13 non-generic offences&#151;that is, rape, sexual assault and so forth&#151;the defendant would have to be charged with a child sex offence which, as the noble Baroness knows, makes no distinction as to the age of the victim.
<P>

<a name="30401-06_para11"></a>I recognise, as stated by the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Noakes, that children under 13 engage in mutually agreed sex. I have listened to those who argue with real conviction that it is completely unfair for the law to make it possible for a boy aged 14, for example, to be charged with raping a 12 year-old girl following mutually agreed sexual intercourse. It is worth pointing out that prosecution is certainly not the inevitable outcome where two minors of the ages I have described engage in sexual activity. In those cases where sexual activity between minors is truly mutually agreed and there is nothing to suggest that the activity is in any way exploitative, we would not expect and would not want the full weight of the criminal law to be used against them. Our overriding concern is to protect children, not to punish them unnecessarily.
<P>

<a name="30401-06_para12"></a>Where sexual relationships between minors are not abusive, prosecuting either or both children is highly unlikely to be in the public interest; nor would it be in the best interests of the children involved. In such cases, protection will normally best be achieved by educating the children and providing them and their families with counselling services. Even where the sexual activity is abusive, the Crown Prosecution Service may consider that it was not in the public interest to prosecute someone under 16 if other courses of action were likely to be more effective. The CPS has a discretion about whether or not to prosecute in such cases. We would expect it to continue to use that discretion wisely.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-06_para13"></a>I fully understand the legitimate concerns raised by the noble Baroness as regards agencies giving advice to children in those circumstances, and her profound and deeply held desire, shared by many, that that should not raise the risk of criminalisation. As the noble Baroness will know, we will propose an amendment later in these proceedings which seeks to deal with that issue. Perhaps we may deal with that more fully at that point.
<P>

<a name="30401-06_para14"></a>Having said all that, if the law is to be effective, there will be cases in which under 16 year-olds commit such crimes where prosecution is appropriate. We must remember that not only children aged 12 and 14 but also children very much younger will be protected by this provision against teenagers of 16 and under. That is where we need the clarity and protection of the criminal law. That is why we believe it would be wrong to accede to the amendment and to say that a person under 16 could not be prosecuted for one of these offences. As we have been told by the agencies dealing with this issue, there are cases in which prosecution of children is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30401-06_para15"></a>I hope I have dealt with the particular concerns raised by the noble Baroness. We believe that this should be covered by criminal law but we recognise that a whole range of alternatives may be more appropriate in particular cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My noble and learned friend has helpfully tabled Amendment No. 74 in Clause 15 which would exempt health professionals and others from liability to prosecution under the Bill in the way he described. As he said, we shall discuss that later. However, does he not feel that perhaps in practice there will be difficulties for people working in such agencies who are exempt from prosecution under Amendment No. 74 if the criminal offence he described remains on the statute book as it could prevent people being open in their dealings with young children who they may feel they are advising but who, as he rightly says, may be liable for prosecution in extreme cases?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The provision in Amendment No. 74 is designed to try to remove as much as possible any fears by health professionals in that regard. It goes beyond health professionals and includes anyone seeking to give advice, including a parent. Will the position nevertheless cause the child or young person not to be full and frank because of fear of the law? We believe that probably it will not. In many respects this reflects the current law in the sense that there is still criminal sanction in relation to a whole variety of sexual activity covered by the new law. We do not believe that that leads to inhibition when there should be frankness.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   I hope that my noble and learned friend did not misunderstand me. I find Amendment No. 74 extremely helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-07_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   Can the Minister explain to the Committee what form of assessment he would expect to take place if there were prosecutions under this particular part of the Bill? Does he expect that a psychologist would be involved to consider the level of learning development of the child? Perhaps the details may wait until we debate Clause 14, but it would be helpful at this point if the Minister could advise the Committee on how he sees assessment coming into practice under this part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I believe the question is directed to those cases in which a person aged 16 years or under is prosecuted in this regard. The issue of young people who sexually abuse or commit sexual crimes is complex. In the past it has not received the focus and attention it should. Young people who sexually abuse are a diverse group. Many may have been victims of sexual abuse or may have witnessed domestic violence. In addition, we know that a large number may also have learning difficulties and some may have mental health problems. So there is a real need to address the problems which have contributed to the offending, including providing any specialist intervention that may be required.
<P>

<a name="30401-07_para0"></a>As this area has been neglected in the past, there seems to be a lack of knowledge and expertise about how to deal with such young people, including the kind of assessment and treatment methods which are most appropriate. Various bodies within the family of government are considering this issue. The Home Office and the Youth Justice Board have set up an interdepartmental working group with the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills to consider the whole issue of young people who sexually abuse. The group has covered a number of areas where further improvement is needed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-07_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I thank my noble and learned friend for giving way. Having been involved 10 years ago in the work initiated by the NCH and then with the Department of Health following the report on children who abuse other children, I am deeply concerned that any work that is undertaken now is carried through. As the Minister explained, this is an offences Bill rather than a welfare Bill. There are real difficulties about getting on to the face of the Bill which kind of assessments and treatment programmes <P>


<a name="column_1179"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would work. There is a large amount of knowledge among professionals about what would work, but that is re-examined on every occasion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I agree with the comments of the noble Baroness. It is not appropriate to put on to the face of the Bill how we deal with the problem of a sexually abusive child or young person. I appreciate that this does not bring much comfort, but the problem is recognised. There are gaps in our knowledge and in the approach that we take. There are also gaps in particular parts of the country and in the kind of help available. We need to consider how we fill in such gaps. That is what we are seeking to do.
<P>

<a name="30401-07_para1"></a>There must be a twin-track approach; that is, clarity as regards what is the criminal law but also a commitment to deal with the problem much more widely than simply by considering the criminal law. I always feel that when dealing with a criminal offences Bill, the other part of the story tends to become lost. However, I am glad that the noble Earl has given me an opportunity to describe the other side of the process, perhaps more fully than I would have done otherwise. I have also indicated that there are gaps and problems that we need to look at. I am sorry to have talked for so long, but it may help later on.
<P>

<a name="30401-07_para2"></a>We are consulting practitioners and experts in the field to help inform the inter-departmental working group. It will report to Ministers later this year; but how much and how quickly we can continue to improve work with this group will depend on resources&#151;in particular the outcome of the next spending review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   It occurs to me that the noble and learned Lord relied, both in his wind-up on Second Reading and today, on the good sense and discretion of the CPS. Is that entirely satisfactory? I understand exactly what he said about the difficulties of getting the right words into the Bill. However, I hope that when he comes to look at this with his advisers and perhaps other noble Lords, he will bear that in mind, because it does not seem to be satisfactory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I understand the point. It is difficult to deal with, save on this basis&#151;there has to be a clear criminal offence. One cannot have something that seems to reflect shades of grey. It has to be clear what is criminal. As there needs to be that criminal offence available for an appropriate case, to some extent one has to trust to the good sense of the police and the prosecutors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-07_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I hope that the noble and learned Lord's reputation will not be damaged by my saying that I am pleased that he is going to resist the amendment. First, the amendments in effect legalise all consensual activity between people under 18, which would otherwise be caught by an age of consent offence under Clauses 9 to 13. It would also almost completely abolish the age of consent. It would <P>


<a name="column_1180"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>therefore remove key protection for children, which the Government have recognised in devising the clauses for this Bill. The other amendments would leave cases to be dealt with under Clause 1&#151;that is regarding small children. It would mean that children would have to go into the witness box to be cross-examined, which they are protected from under other provisions in the Bill, on whether they consented to sexual intercourse with an accused person under 18. It would become one of the central aspects of that trial. There could be quite an aggressive procedure for eliciting whether the child either gave consent or even understood what that meant. If the child did consent, then the case would have to be dismissed with no case to answer, because that would be the whole point of the trial. Under the present law, that is thought to be unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="30401-07_para3"></a>The Minister will argue that the Government have recognised that in the Bill. Under the amendments a 17&#189; year-old who repeatedly had sex with an uncomplaining 12 year-old could not be prosecuted. Clauses 1, 3, 5 and 7 cannot be used, because they all require proof that the victim did not consent. He could continue with impunity, as long as she indicates her consent. The evidence is that a considerable amount of child abuse is carried out by young people.
<P>

<a name="30401-07_para4"></a>Finally, a 17&#189; year-old who brutally and repeatedly sexually assaults a seven year-old, should be liable to the same penalty as an 18 year-old who does the same thing. Under the Liberal Democrat amendment the 17&#189; year-old would face the maximum sentence of five years in prison, and the 18 year-old would face life imprisonment. There is an inconsistency.
<P>

<a name="30401-07_para5"></a>Whatever else we do, we should continue to keep the key protection for children, which the Bill, as it stands, provides.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I support the carefully considered speech of my noble friend. I wholly agree with the Minister that there has to be a criminal provision. It seems to be common ground that there are gaps that have to be filled. Could the Lord Chancellor's Department, in consultation with the Home Office, provide a paper for this House to consider how those gaps can be filled? It is only an idea. Does it attract the Minister?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-07_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Yes, I will certainly consider it. We have tried in the Bill to provide, as it were, a seamless series of criminal offences that cover everything. The gaps that I referred to in my response to those behind me were the gaps in provision on a public service or other basis for those children and young people who do sexually abuse. Could the state take any measures? I understood that the request of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, related to the legal gaps in criminal law provision. I could certainly agree to provide that, but I do not think that it would <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-07_spnew11"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, for his helpful suggestion. If the Minister was prepared to do that, I would certainly find that most helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-07_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, in moving this amendment, limited her remarks to Clause 2 and the rape of children under 13. I understand what my noble friend Lady Noakes has said and the position taken by the Opposition&#151;and what the Minister has said.
<P>

<a name="30401-07_para6"></a>However, I notice that two other amendments are being taken here&#151;in particular Amendment No. 31. That deals not with a clause that defines rape, but with Clause 6 dealing with a sexual offence with a child under 13. It states that a person commits an offence if he intentionally touches another person, if the touching is sexual, and that other person is under 13. Are we really sensible to legislate to make it an offence for a child of, say, 14 or 16 to touch sexually another child who happens to be under 13? I can totally appreciate my noble and learned friend's views on Clause 2 and those of the Government. However, what is meant by "a sexual touching"? Is a kiss a sexual touching? Is a pinch of the bottom a sexual touching? Are we really sensible to legislate to a degree that we are making an offence for any child to pinch another child's bottom, without at least putting some restriction that it should not apply if done by a young boy under 16? It should not be a criminal offence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   I entirely agree with the noble Lord who has just spoken. There are many problems in that area, which should not be lost sight of. One is that girls aged 12 to 16 or even under not only can be the most appalling of flirts, but are also nowadays very often dressed up in such a manner as to lead people to suppose that they are a great deal older. Those problems need to be kept in mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I say to the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, "sexual" is defined in Clause 18 and "touching" is defined in Clause 81. It covers a huge range of sexual touching, and one can identify minor cases where one would not remotely think that it would be appropriate to bring proceedings. That is particularly the case where the ages of the children involved are close and the activity is patently consensual. But without being too graphic, the definition in Clauses 80 and 81 also embraces extremely abusive behaviour of children who might be 15 and whose victims might be seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 or 12. Just as in the other examples that have been given, one needs to be clear about what the criminal offence is so that it exists and can be used in the appropriate case. As was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, one does not want the child to have to go through the process of proving that he or she did not <P>

What about the danger of a private prosecution brought by a person less well-endowed with good sense? Plenty of people take an extreme view of these matters, and how does one deal with that and the immense stress and distress that that can occasion?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   In practical terms, I do not believe that that causes much of a problem. In balancing the risk of a private prosecution against having clarity in the law so that it can be used in the kind of case I have described, the balance falls on the side of having it there because the other side of the coin is not giving rise to problems in practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   The noble and learned Lord put a stress on clarity in the law. Clarity is precisely what there is not in the definition of "sexual" touching. We shall come to that under Clause 80 and the Minister may wish to leave the matter until then, but I wanted to make the point now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   There is clarity in relation to the ages and in relation to those who cannot give consent. There is no sensible way of seeking to embrace in a legal definition every single sort of sexual behaviour and every single sort of sexual assault. Even the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has not attempted any amendment to try to define sexual touching&#151;

<P>
<A NAME="30401-08_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   If it assists the noble Lord, the current definition of "indecent assault" comes from the case of Court in which I appeared for the appellant, my noble friend Lord Carlile of Berriew appeared for the respondent and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, gave the leading judgment&#151;so it is all in-House. In that case, the issue was the smacking of the bottom of a 12 year-old girl. Was that an indecent assault? When arrested, the defendant, when asked why he had done it, said, "I don't know. Bottom fetish, I suppose". And the issue was whether that coloured what was otherwise a simple assault and made it an indecent assault.

<a name="30401-08_para1"></a>The arguments of both myself and my noble friend Lord Carlile were rejected in the judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner. I recall a discussion taking place about the mental element, when Lord Fraser of Tullybelton inquired whether, if six undergraduates from Balliol debagged an undergraduate from New College&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-08_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   All right, from Trinity. I am not too familiar with that place. The question was whether if they did that it was an indecent assault. He decided that it depended upon whether some of them gained sexual satisfaction from the debagging, which would turn it into an indecent assault.
<P>

<a name="30401-08_para2"></a>The point I am making is that, as always, it is extremely difficult to try to define all the circumstances which will arise in a criminal case in a statute. One cannot ever define everything exactly: it must be left to common sense.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-08_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   The point I would make is short. My noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew of Twysden took a valid point, which was not wholly answered. But ought there not to be some safeguard against a private prosecution? Ought not that safeguard to be other than with the consent of the Attorney-General?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-08_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, will forgive me for spotting an irony here. We are talking about not having a criminal offence in terms of touching and, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, mentioned, smacking a little girl's bottom. However, in another context, the very same noble Baroness is advocating that smacking a little girl's bottom should be an offence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-08_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, can reply to that irony. I do not know what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, might think, but in my view the idea that the Attorney-General should spend his time reading papers to see whether someone should be privately prosecuted is a complete waste of the Attorney-General's precious time. I can see the point that the noble and learned Lord makes, but we trust to people's good sense. That is not causing a problem at the moment, so let us not solve something that is not causing a problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-08_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I thank all Members of the Committee who have contributed to this short debate, in particular the common sense of the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, about sexual assault.

<a name="30401-08_para3"></a>I want to draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that these amendments are about under-16s and would not affect 17&#189; year-olds. It is intended to bring the under-16s out of Clauses 2, 4, 6 and 8, in particular <P>

<P>

<a name="30401-08_para4"></a>I welcome the reassurances that the Minister has been able to give me. In particular, I welcome the inter-departmental working group on the issue of children who exhibited harmful sexual behaviour. But I fear that the agencies and organisations which have supported the amendments would have much more confidence in the status quo if it were consistent. We need a consistent framework of assessment before a young person was even charged with any kind of sexual offence; and a consistent arrangement of pre-sentencing reports and assessments available to the courts when they have been charged and convicted; and consistency in the availability of high-quality professional services across the country. We do not have any of those things, which is why I felt obliged to table some amendments, which I am afraid the Public Bill Office would not accept, about issues such as pre-sentence reports and pre-charging assessments. I was told that the Bill had been so tightly drawn that they were not within its bounds.
<P>

<a name="30401-08_para5"></a>The Minister spoke about the CPS and its discretion and good sense. However, in order to satisfy those of us who are concerned about these young people, will he provide written guidelines to the CPS that they can use, and not rely only on its common sense and discretion? That would give a great deal more comfort to those of us who are concerned about these damaged young people, whom I shall speak more about when we come to our debate on Clause 14 stand part. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. No doubt we shall return to it later.

<a name="30401-08_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: I spoke to this amendment yesterday. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, took the view that the better way to deal with this offence was to amend Clause 3. Having read Hansard this morning it seems to me, subject to the view of the House, that he was right. It would be simple to include the amendment on oral penetration in the first line of Clause 3. That would have the effect of differentiating&#151;the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu&#151;between the two offences. That would mean that Amendment No. 1 could be carried on the basis that oral penetration is not sex.

<a name="30401-08_para11"></a>If this offence were included in Clause 3 it would be a specific offence that would carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Having listened with great attention to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, said&#151;I did not know about the police information and other information about the gravity of the offence&#151;I was beginning to think that a life sentence could be appropriate, whereas originally I would have thought that 10 years was appropriate. So in those circumstances it would not have been my intention to move the amendment on Report. On that basis, I ask leave to withdraw it.

<a name="30401-09_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: Under this amendment I am concerned with looking at the scope of offences in the Bill. I am interested to know where this fits in: a person using not an object that he manipulates or a part of his own body but a living animal. The noble Lord may have a better spam filter than I have on my House of Lords e-mails, but perhaps he does not look at them. If he looked at the unsolicited e-mails that I receive he would realise that there is a great deal of activity taking place between young women and animals. The suggestion in some e-mails is that the women do not take part entirely willingly. The Romans were similarly inclined, as doubtless the noble and learned Lord knows.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The offence of assault by penetration is designed to cover cases where one person intentionally penetrates the vagina or anus of another person with a part of his body or another object without that person's consent. It will cover cases where a person forcibly inserts his hands or fist into a woman's vagina or a bottle or a knife into a man's anus. That is extremely serious offending behaviour that can inflict as much, if not more, pain and physical damage on a victim as penile penetration and is likely to result in similar psychological trauma. No one would disagree with the seriousness of such an offence and the penalty that is provided for there would be life imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="30401-09_para5"></a>I believe that the noble Lord refers to what happens when a human uses an animal to penetrate, without the consent of the person involved, somebody else's body. Clause 72(2) deals with the situation in which a person commits an offence if he,

That is a maximum period of imprisonment of two years which the noble Lord may consider too short a sentence. I am unsure whether the examples quoted by the noble Lord are living or dead animals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   The noble Lord raised the point as to how this would fit with the amendment to which I referred. After the word "anus" there would be the words "or mouth". That would constitute the specific offence. I do not think it would be affected by my noble friend's amendment. I am afraid that I am not very good with e-mails. My computer is out of action at the moment&#151;I have a new box and cannot work it. So I am not able to comment or deal with that situation.

<a name="30401-09_para20"></a><P>

<a name="30401-09_para21"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 21 and Amendment No. 33, which are grouped, are probing amendments about offences against children. I have not gone through the Bill and tabled the consequential amendments that may be appropriate, because I want first to test the Government's views and the opinion of the Committee about the level of sentences provided for in Clauses 4 and 6.
<P>

<a name="30401-09_para22"></a>I accept that the levels of sentencing within the Bill have a certain coherence about them, but I am surprised by those levels. In the case of offences against children, we must consider the comparative sentences for other activities that may be equally damaging to children.
<P>

<a name="30401-09_para23"></a>Clause 4 provides for a sentence for penetration of up to life. I understand that life is also the sentence for murder. My view is that murder might reasonably be regarded as a more serious offence. Clause 6 provides for sexual touching a maximum sentence of 14 years. I am advised that the maximum sentence for violence against children is 10 years.
<P>

<a name="30401-09_para24"></a>It is right to ask the Minister to give the Committee the Government's reasons for those seemingly high maximum sentences. Your Lordships may well ask why it matters what are the maximum sentences, because the court will apply the right level of sentence. There are three reasons. First, good and decent men working in the caring professions&#151;caring for children as professionals or volunteers&#151;are already seriously concerned about the risks to their families, careers and liberty of false accusations of sexual abuse. The long sentences proposed cannot but exacerbate that problem.
<P>

<a name="30401-09_para25"></a>My second concern is that it has been put to me by learned counsel working in this area of the law that if the sentences for sexual abuse and for murder are or <P>


<a name="column_1188"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1188</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>seem to be the same, some men, having committed the offence of abuse, will be more tempted to try to destroy the evidence by murdering the child.
<P>

<a name="30401-09_para26"></a>The third reason is that those who have worked with families that have often for generation after generation been sad and inadequate know that such families' problems are complex. It is perhaps not surprising that the main bar to disclosure by a child is its fear of the terrible effect that that will have on the family. The family often represents the only security and love that that child has ever known, however inadequate and perverted it may be.
<P>

<a name="30401-09_para27"></a>This is not the time to discuss what society ought to be doing about those problems, but I suggest that dramatic increases in sentences for familial child abuse will not solve them and may even make them worse. I should like to hear the Minister's explanation of the Government's reasons for setting those sentences so high. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-09_spnew12"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   I support my noble friend's amendment, for more or less the reasons that I mentioned a few minutes ago. Very young girls can fall in love and, if they have had no proper upbringing and have no idea of restraint, they may throw themselves at the object of their affections to such a degree that they make it difficult for him&#151;especially if the child appears to be considerably older than she really is. A judge should have considerable discretion as to whether to imprison at all. There are occasions when it is not the chap's fault, it is the child's fault.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-09_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   That is all very well, but the clause covers a potential assaulter of any age, who may well be a serial assaulter, in which case a very high penalty is indeed appropriate. As I understand it, imprisonment for life is a maximum and therefore an appropriate sentence could be given for the particular offence, once it is proven.

<A NAME="30401-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I support my noble friend Lord Northbourne, but should like to ask the Minister a question. I take the view that the appropriate sentence for such behaviour must be available and that there must be a clear distinction and boundary between the young woman and the adult. I therefore disagree with the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun.
<P>

<a name="30401-10_para0"></a>In my long experience in Childline and working with the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, my concern has been with the dozens of youngsters who will not come forward because they are determined that they will not put the adults in their lives through that process. That process means them being on child abuse registers, probably being imprisoned, and often takes the breadwinner out of the home.
<P>

<a name="30401-10_para1"></a>As the noble Lord said&#151;I am terrible at knowing the correct nomenclature&#151;there is a clear difference in the spectrum of abuse. On one end, there are those who <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>should never be let out of prison&#151;I am a great believer in indeterminate sentences with continuous assessment. At the other, there are people for whom prison is an entirely inappropriate solution to a family problem.
<P>

<a name="30401-10_para2"></a>The great problem that we have with the Bill, because it is insufficiently sensitive to the issues with which it deals, is how we assure ourselves that that spectrum and framework is present, so that the lawyers among your Lordships, when in the courtroom, will be able to achieve the right sort of sentence for the circumstances after assessment and having thought through the question of treatment programmes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Am I right in my understanding that the sentence is not mandatory but a sentence of up to life imprisonment? When one considers the relatively minor offence described by both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and the much more serious offence alluded to by my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale, it is right that they should both be accounted for. It will be for the courts, as they do in other offences where life is a possible sentence, to take account of the severity or relatively minor nature of the case and ensure that the sentence is appropriate. Many who know what is the maximum sentence are greatly frustrated when the courts dispense a much lesser sentence, but we have always taken the view that that should be a matter for the judge and the courts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I am not clear which minor sentence I mentioned. I mentioned violence against children. If we consider the Victoria Climbie case, if that child had not died, the maximum sentence would have been 10 years. I am saying that we must get the balance of the maximum sentences right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I must apologise to the noble Lord if I misunderstood what he said. I thought that the thrust of what he said was that if the maximum possible sentence is life, the temptation on the part of the person committing the offence might be to murder the child rather than be guilty simply of that initial offence against the child, and that the sentence of life is therefore inappropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   Yes, indeed, I did say that, but that was another point.

<A NAME="30401-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   The purpose of Parliament setting a framework for sentencing is to give an indication of the seriousness with which it regards the offence. To replace the words "life imprisonment" with "a maximum of 14 years" may be taken as implying to the judiciary that for some reason an offence under Clause 2 is less serious than one under Clause 1. I cannot believe that there are not offences of penetration of a horror, degree of bestiality and distress to the victim for which it would be wrong to have a different maximum sentence from that which applied to the rape case, even if the provision were used only seldom.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   Would it not be possible to bring such a case under Clause 1?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   With respect, I do not think that it would. Clause 1 defines rape specifically as penetration by penis. Clause 3 describes penetration of various natures. It may be penetration by an animal, a knife or a fist. It would not be right for Parliament to attempt to send a message to the judiciary that in some way such offences are less serious than the offence of rape. As someone who is bitterly opposed to mandatory sentences, as the Minister knows, I believe that it is Parliament's duty to set the framework in which a penalty should be imposed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I agree with my noble friend. We seem to be forgetting that the importance of the life sentence is not the time spent in prison but the fact that you are under licence from the time you are released. In these sex cases, that is an important factor. Listening to the debate, it seems to me that it is far better to keep a life sentence because if it is the kind of case where the man should be kept under constant supervision you can award the maximum sentence, the life sentence, and protect everybody. If it is not that kind of case, the judge can impose four years or five years and deal with the circumstances. To throw away the safeguard to the community which exists in the life sentence&#151;the protection of people&#151;would be wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-10_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Cameron of Lochbroom: </B>   I hesitate to intervene, having been a judge in another jurisdiction just over the Border from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, perhaps the Minister will agree that this part of the Bill endeavours to distinguish between acts of rape of the child under 13 who is the victim, and others. Likewise, Clauses 3 and 4 make precisely the same distinction because consent is not a necessary part of the offence; and likewise in Clauses 5 and 6 where, in Clause 6, consent is not a necessary part of the offence.

<a name="30401-10_para3"></a>From my own experience, I believe that the kind of conduct which is struck at by Clause 4 can extend to just as serious conduct as is contained in Clause 3. As regards Clauses 5 and 6, it might properly be said that a distinction is made in the maximum sentence which can be imposed between conduct aimed at the child under 13 and someone over 12. I should have thought that that could certainly be said to be a proper way to proceed. Under Clause 4(2) the sentence must be fixed to include those who have offended in the past as well as the first time convicted offender. I understand that that is the manner in which all sentences are fixed by statute; namely to have regard to the full circumstances which may arise with regard to the offender by the sentence imposed. I may be wrong in my understanding of what is intended by Clauses 2, 4 and 6 as distinguished from Clauses 1, 3 and 5.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-10_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The account of the circumstances by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, is exactly right. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, asks, quite legitimately, for an explanation of why we have adopted these <P>


<a name="column_1191"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1191</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sentences. The noble and learned Lord's approach is broadly right. Clause 1, rape on someone over 13, not an adult, attracts life imprisonment as the maximum. I emphasise "maximum" because it has been said that it is for the discretion of the judge to determine where, below the maximum, sentence is passed. No noble Lord has suggested that it is not appropriate to have life as a maximum for rape.
<P>

<a name="30401-10_para4"></a>Clause 2 relates to rape of a child under 13. It is inconceivable that one would have a lower maximum for rape of a child under 13 than for a rape of someone over 13. Therefore, there can be no distinction there about the maximum.
<P>

<a name="30401-10_para5"></a>I believe that the mood of the Committee is to recognise that assault by penetration can, in certain circumstances&#151;particularly if done more than once&#151;be so damaging as to attract a sentence of life imprisonment. That involves a case where the victim is 13 or over.
<P>

<a name="30401-10_para6"></a>If life imprisonment is right in those cases, it is again inconceivable that one could have a lower maximum sentence when the victim was 12 or under. For sexual assault, the maximum is 10 years. Should one have a higher maximum when the victim is a child under 13? I should have thought that common sense would suggest strongly that one should.
<P>

<a name="30401-10_para7"></a>That is how we have constructed the maximum sentence. The noble Lord gives three reasons why the sentences may be too great. First, he says that good and decent men are already concerned about false accusations. If serious sexual offences are committed, the issue is not whether they should be given a low sentence because they are worried about false accusations. The focus should be on ensuring that before a conviction there is proper evidence and proper process but, once convicted, an appropriate sentence should be passed. That will not mean necessarily the maximum but in the appropriate case one should be able to impose the maximum.
<P>

<a name="30401-10_para8"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord raises the possibility that if the sentences are too long it would encourage murder. Again, with respect, I am not sure that that is necessarily right. If the range involves maximums of life, 14 years or 10 years, I wonder whether those distinctions are being drawn in the cases we are discussing.
<P>

<a name="30401-10_para9"></a>Thirdly, the noble Lord is right to identify that all too many victims, in particular child victims, are fearful of coming forward because of what may happen when the case is brought to court. I suspect that that issue does not relate to what the criminal law provides. It is inconceivable to say that the criminal law should not exist in this area. The issue is about how one provides support and makes contact with people in that specific circumstance. That is the basis upon which we have approached the matter.
<P>

<a name="30401-10_para10"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said that this is too crude an instrument to deal with the whole range of cases that I believe she would recognise as stretching from the most vicious sort of sexual offender who, she would say&#151;quite apart from any other reasons&#151;should be locked up for as long as possible, to those committing much less serious offences. The noble <P>


<a name="column_1192"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1192</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Baroness is absolutely right. But, again, this is the criminal law part of the story where the crime should be defined with clarity, with the right range of sentences being available to the judge.
<P>

<a name="30401-10_para11"></a>In the light of my explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdrawn the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I stated earlier that this is a probing amendment. I shall, therefore, withdraw it. It seems to me that I shall never be able to argue with the phalanx of lawyers present in this Chamber. I understand the logic from a lawyer's point of view, but my worry relates to the unintended outcomes of the legislation. I believe that the noble and learned Lord referred to "proper process". However, we need to ensure that the unintended consequences of the Bill do not operate seriously to the disadvantage of children with there being nothing like enough male teachers in schools; too few male workers in the youth service; and not enough men prepared to become involved in residential social care. The latter are important consequences that could prove to be extremely damaging to a wide range of children.
<P>

<a name="30401-11_para0"></a>I ask the Minister to consider how this problem can be overcome. I wonder whether other amendments could be introduced in that cause. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord could ask his officials to consult the Department for Education and Skills and the relevant departments concerned with local authorities. I am sure that he will find that grave difficulties are already being experienced in the recruitment of men to work with children in the care and social work community.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Before the noble Lord concludes, I do not want anything that I said during the course of this debate to be seen as an argument against some of the points that he has just made. We have made life very difficult for male teachers, for step-parents; and, indeed, for very many people.
<P>

<a name="30401-11_para1"></a>Perhaps I may quickly recount a story regarding the experience of a young teacher, just out of training, who was working in a primary school. The children under his charge were out on what we would have called in my day "a nature walk", studying trees, leaves and collecting samples to take back to school for identification, drawing and colouring purposes. A little girl in the group ran ahead and fell on a gravel path. She grazed her knee quite badly. The male teacher picked up the little girl, dabbed her knee with his handkerchief, and put her on his shoulders to carry her back to school. As a result, he later found himself in very serious trouble. He subsequently left teaching, never to return to it again.
<P>

<a name="30401-11_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has made some very serious points. However, I am not convinced that they fit into our deliberations on this Bill as regards someone facing a serious charge in court. I do not want the noble Lord to feel that the points he has made and the concerns that he has expressed are falling on deaf ears. That is certainly not so in my case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I am most grateful for the noble Baroness's support. I accept that the way I have perhaps addressed the question is the wrong way. However, I had to raise the issue somehow. We may be <P>

<a name="30401-11_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 32 and 45. This is the first of a number of groups of amendments that I have tabled on a probing basis to discover the Government's intentions as regards the circumstances in which certain offences under the Bill could be regarded as appropriate for summary conviction, and the much lower penalties that attach to summary convictions.
<P>

<a name="30401-11_para10"></a>Clause 5 deals with sexual assault. Conviction on indictment can carry up to 10 years' imprisonment compared with six months' imprisonment, or even a fine, on summary conviction. The offence of sexual assault is widely drawn. It covers a spectrum ranging from the act of kissing at one end to penetration at the other. Potentially serious matters certainly fall within the ambit of Clause 5. Can the Minister say what the Government believe should affect whether a summary conviction or a conviction on indictment is thought appropriate? Can the noble and learned Lord say what guidance will be given to the Crown Prosecution Service?
<P>

<a name="30401-11_para11"></a>Clause 6 raises even more concerns, because it deals with the sexual assault of under 13 year-olds. There is the possibility here of a summary conviction, even though conviction on indictment can carry the maximum determinant sentence of 14 years. Can the Minister say under what circumstances such a case might be dealt with on a summary basis?
<P>

<a name="30401-11_para12"></a>Clause 7 deals with the offence of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent. Where penetration is not involved, there is the possibility of six months' imprisonment or a fine on a summary basis, or 10 years' imprisonment on indictment. What kind of non-consensual sexual activity could fall within the category that would appropriately be dealt with on a summary basis?
<P>

<a name="30401-11_para13"></a>These amendments seek the clarification from the Government on the points raised. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Amendment No. 30 is designed to probe what is appropriate in relation to indictment. In effect, the noble Baroness answered her <P>


<a name="column_1194"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1194</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>own question on sexual assault under Clause 5. This can cover very serious offences but can also cover cases that are very much less serious. In relation to the less serious offences, the noble Baroness asked what approach the Crown Prosecution Service would take in such circumstances. I cannot give the Committee a comprehensive answer. The CPS must make such a decision based on the seriousness of the offence. It would be quite misleading to try to lay down strict criteria in relation to such matters. Such decisions must be left to the good sense of the CPS.
<P>

<a name="30401-11_para14"></a>Clause 6 deals with sexual assault of a child under the age of 13. Where, for example, an 18 year-old kisses a 12 year-old with his or her consent, I am not convinced that it would always be necessary for such a case to be tried in the Crown Court. I can envisage circumstances where it might be appropriate for it to be dealt with in a magistrates' court. Again, the CPS would have to make a judgment about the seriousness of the offence.
<P>

<a name="30401-11_para15"></a>Finally, Clause 7 relates to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-11_para16"></a>
Here, too, there could be circumstances where one man causes another to touch his naked body in a sexual manner&#151;behaviour that could well fall within the power of summary trial. But, again, that would depend upon the facts of the particular case. Underlying this perfectly legitimate probing amendment is the fact that there will be a great range of conduct. The question is whether we should always ensure that the case goes to the Crown Court. In each of these offences, we believe that there could be circumstances for which summary trial would be appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-11_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the noble and learned Lord for his reply. However, it was lacking in specificity because it gave examples of extremes that would not offer the kind of guidance that might be required. In particular, the Minister referred to the possibility of an 18 year-old being dealt with by summary conviction. That may be a difficult area and we shall seek the Minister's further guidance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I referred to an 18-year-old because where the accused is under 18, the proceedings will start in a youth court anyway.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-11_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I was just making the point that the issues are whether or not one should prosecute, then the appropriate place. I will carefully read the Minister's remarks. Other amendments raise more substantive issues than this group, so I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30401-11_para28"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 44, 46 and 65. This group of amendments is about the appropriate way of dealing with teenagers close to each other in age who participate in under-age sex. The purpose is to ensure that there is a defence of consent for under-18s who participate in sexual activity with someone between 13 and 15 and to ensure that the penalty for non-consensual sex committed by under-18s is consistent in the Bill at a maximum of five years. For example, Clause 14 determines that the maximum sentence shall be five years.
<P>

<a name="30401-11_para29"></a>We want to prevent the prosecution of, say, a 17-year-old boy who has sex with his 15-year-old girlfriend with her consent but where her parents make a complaint to the police. The amendment would not prevent the prosecution of a 16 or 17-year-old if there has been no consent. Then the offender can be prosecuted under the provisions of Clauses 1, 3, 5 and 7. While we may not wish to encourage under-age sex, we must be realistic, accept that it happens and take appropriate measures.
<P>

<a name="30401-11_para30"></a>Young people close together in age cannot be viewed in the same light as a much older man who takes advantage of a young girl. The law should not present a barrier to a young girl who may wish to receive sexual health or contraceptive advice but fears doing so in case she gets her boyfriend in trouble. Again, it is a matter of unforeseen consequences. We should be in the business of harm reduction and the law should play its part. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Clause 7 is rather curiously worded. It is entitled "Causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent". That does not necessarily mean that only two people are involved. A third person could be involved and hence is prosecuted. One has in mind a man encouraging another man to have sex with a woman of whatever age. Under Clause 7, that seems perfectly possible.

<a name="30401-12_para0"></a>I have nothing to say about the amendment itself but I am confused by subsection (6):
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Unless subsection (5) applies, a person guilty of an offence under this section is liable".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-12_para1"></a>
That is fine but what happens if subsection (5) does apply? I have got lost.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I cannot quite follow the noble Lord's question. Is it about Clause 6?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I was referring to Clause 7(6).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   If subsection (5) applies, the maximum sentence is life. If it does not, the maximum sentence is 10 years.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para2"></a>Amendment No. 44 is much more wide ranging than the noble Baroness let on. It is grouped with Amendment No. 65, which states that for all sex offences in Clauses 1 to 8&#151;including rape, assault by penetration or sexual assault&#151;the maximum sentence for someone age 18 or under should be five years. Once that is clear, I can easily put our case.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para3"></a>Of course the defendant's age will have an effect on the sentence passed in many cases but a number of sex offenders aged 18 and under commit serious sexual offences&#151;for example, rape&#151;and do so more than once. For example, there are 14-year-old and 15-year-old serial rapists. It would be wholly inappropriate to say that the maximum sentence in those cases should be five years&#151;which would be the effect of the amendments.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para4"></a>We return to the question that we have examined before&#151;set a maximum, recognise that age will plainly play a significant part in the penalty but acknowledge that courts need the flexibility required to impose a sentence that fits the crime. We strongly oppose the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-12_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I thank the noble and learned Lord for his comments. It all boils down to the concern felt by myself and other noble Lords, many children's charities and agencies such as the Family Planning Association, as to the way in which young sex offenders are dealt with and the danger of criminalising young who have sexual activity with consent&#151;which is entirely different from the sexual abuse that the Bill attempts to address. If we were more satisfied about the framework, consistency, quality and availability of services for young people, we would be much happier with the Minister's intentions in setting down criminal activities and maximum sentences. It is a matter of practice.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para5"></a>Many young people commit such offences because they have themselves been victims and are damaged. They must be dealt with in a way that is appropriate to them. Society has failed many of those young people and we should try to put things right. We should help and bear in mind their welfare by providing appropriate treatment&#151;and by doing so, protect other young people from inappropriate sexual behaviour. We shall return to this issue later today and at other stages in the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
(ii) B is under 13."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30401-12_para14"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: This group of amendments in effect suggests the deletion of Clause 76 and makes consequential amendments. The policy intention behind Clause 76 was to ensure that where someone engages in sexual activity with a child under 13, he must be found guilty of one of the specific offences designed to protect children under 13. They are Clause 2, rape of a child under 13; Clause 4, assault of a child under 13 by penetration; Clause 6, sexual assault of a child under 13; or Clause 8, causing a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para15"></a>Our purpose was to ensure that anyone engaging in sexual activity with a child under 13 should be charged with an offence of strict liability, where any ostensible consent of the child is legally insignificant, there can be no defence of mistaken belief in age and a guilty verdict results in a serious penalty that reflects the gravity of the crime.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para16"></a>However, we have realised that, despite our best intentions, there are difficulties with the way that Clause 76 would operate in practice. For example, where a defendant had engaged in ostensibly consensual sexual intercourse with a child who was believed to be 14 at the time, the Crown Prosecution Service would charge the defendant with the offence of sexual activity with a child under Clause 9. However, should it emerge during the trial that the child was, in fact, aged only 12 at the time of the alleged offence, the prosecution would, because of the effect of Clause 76, have to apply to the judge to amend the indictment to include a charge of rape of a child under 13, pursuant to Clause 2.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para17"></a>Judges have the discretion to amend an indictment during a trial but can be reluctant to do so, especially in circumstances such as these in which the indictment would be amended to reflect a more serious offence. Depending on the lateness of the amendment, the later it is, the less likely the judge is to agree to it.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para18"></a>If, in such a case, the judge were to refuse to amend the indictment, the unfortunate result would be that the defendant would have to be acquitted because the wording of Clause 76 has the effect of making it impossible for him to be convicted of an offence under Clause 9 if the victim was under 13. That would lead to a serious injustice since the defendant would be acquitted on a technicality despite having engaged in sex with a <P>


<a name="column_1198"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1198</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>12 year-old. That is clearly not the effect that we intended and I ask Members of the Committee to approve the changes to the Bill to rectify this position and to ensure that the law provides maximum protection for children under 13.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para19"></a>I oppose Clause 76 standing part. That is with a view to striking Clause 76 from the Bill. This would have the effect that, should it transpire during a trial for an offence under Clause 9&#151;sexual activity with a child&#151;that the victim was under 13 at the time of the offence and that the judge is not minded to allow for the indictment to be amended to a charge of rape of a child under 13, the defendant could at least be found guilty of the offence of sexual activity with a child.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para20"></a>Amendments Nos. 48, 50, 100, 101, 113, 114, 176 and 177 amend all those offences which, as a result of Clause 76 being dropped, could be charged in relation to sexual activity involving a child under 13, to provide that where the child is under 13 there shall be no defence of mistaken belief in age.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para21"></a>For completeness, Amendments Nos. 49, 51, 76, 106, 119, 183, 216, 219, 222, 223, 228 and 237 all have the effect of removing references in other offences to the application of Clause 76 which will no longer exist. Together, these Government amendments will preserve our policy that the law should provide maximum protection for children under 13. For these reasons, I invite the Committee to accept the amendments. I beg to move.

<br>
(d) penetration of a person's mouth with B's penis."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30401-12_para33"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: Under existing legislation, sexual intercourse with a child below the legal age of consent is unlawful, even if the child willingly engages in the activity or even encourages it. It is our intention that this situation should be maintained, but that the protection offered by the law should be extended to protect children not only from sexual intercourse but from all forms of sexual activity, including those that do not involve physically touching the child.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para34"></a>We have therefore introduced a range of child sex offences to protect children under 16 from all forms of sexual activity. The offences of sexual activity with a child and causing a child to engage in sexual activity are designed to protect children aged 13 and over, but under 16. The maximum penalty for these offences has been set at 14 years to reflect the fact that the sexual activity covered by these offences is ostensibly consensual. Where activity is non-consensual, the offence would fall to be charged under one of the generic non-consensual offences; that is, rape, assault by penetration, and so forth. In relation to children under 13, we have adopted the policy that they are not capable of giving legally significant consent to sexual activity in any circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para35"></a>Physical sexual activity involving a child below that age will therefore be charged as one of the specific offences relating to children under 13. They are rape of a child under 13, assault of a child under 13 by penetration, sexual assault of a child under 13, or causing a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para36"></a>The maximum penalties for the offences of rape of a child under 13 and assault of a child under 13 by penetration are the same as for the generic offences; that is, life imprisonment. The offence of causing a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity also carries a maximum life penalty where the activity involves sexual penetration of, or by, the child.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para37"></a>As currently drafted, the offence of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity at Clause 11 carries a maximum penalty of 14 years, regardless of the age of the child or the type of sexual activity that takes place.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para38"></a>Amendment No. 53 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, would have the effect of introducing a maximum <P>


<a name="column_1200"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1200</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>penalty of life imprisonment for this offence. I cannot accept that amendment because I consider that a maximum life penalty is too severe for an offence that covers ostensibly consensual activity with a child aged between 13 and 15.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para39"></a>However, I accept that the current penalty attached to the offence is inconsistent with our policy on providing maximum protection for children under 13 who are deemed incapable of giving legally valid consent. This offence is different from the Clause 9 and 10 offences as there is no equivalent under-13 offence. Therefore, this offence will be used where a person incites an under 13 year-old to engage in sexual activity.
<P>

<a name="30401-12_para40"></a>I am therefore proposing government Amendment No. 52 that will bring the maximum penalty in relation to victims under 13 in line with that for the offence of causing a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity&#151;that is, life imprisonment for cases involving the incitement of sexual penetration, otherwise 14 years. In the light of my comments, I hope that in her amendment the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, will accept the approach that we are adopting. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   We come to one of those areas of the internal consistency of the Bill. Amendment No. 53, which proposes a maximum life sentence for the offence of incitement, is based on a comparison to the corresponding offence in Clause 35, under which the incitement involves a person with a mental disorder or learning disability, because that offence carries a possible life sentence.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para0"></a>The comments made by the Minister are partially welcome. They align the potential penalties between Clauses 11 and 35 where the offence involves both a child under 13 and penetration. But I remain mystified by the lack of alignment on the incitement offences. I do not understand why incitement of a child under 13 to non-penetrative sexual activity or for other children is less heinous than with a mentally disordered person.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para1"></a>Looking forward in the Bill, Clause 35 makes no distinction between penetrative and non-penetrative sexual activity. I understand what the Minister said about the logic in regard to offences described earlier in the Bill but I have been looking forward in the Bill to offences involving mentally disordered persons. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain the logic in those kinds of cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I shall need to come back on the point of why Clause 35 makes no distinction between penetrative and non-penetrative offences.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-13_para6"></a><P>

<a name="30401-13_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall be brief. This group of amendments concerns summary proceedings and indictments. Amendment No. 54 relates to Clause 12 <P>


<a name="column_1201"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1201</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the offence of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child; and Amendment No. 63 relates to Clause 13 and the offence of causing a child to watch a sexual act. As the Bill is currently drafted, there is the option of a summary conviction even where the child involved is under 13. I find that difficult to understand.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para8"></a>Amendment No. 77 relates to Clause 15. Can the noble and learned Lord indicate the kind of circumstances that would lead to the conclusion that a summary conviction was appropriate? This group of amendments is particularly concerned with the under-13 category and the interaction with Clauses 12 and 13. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The Bill makes provision for the offences of "engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child", "causing a child to watch a sexual act" and "arranging or facilitating commission of a child sex offence" to be tried either way. The effect of Amendments Nos. 54, 63 and 77 would be that these three child sex offences would be triable on indictment only.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para9"></a>The noble Baroness is aware that these offences cover a wide range of offending behaviour and, as I have said before, I do not accept that trial in the Crown Court will always be necessary. For example, although sexual gratification is a key element of the offence of "engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child", where the relevant act is an 18 year-old masturbating in front of a 15 year-old the case might be more appropriately heard in a magistrates' court.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para10"></a>Similarly, if a 15 year-old were to be charged with the offence of "arranging or facilitating commission of a child sex offence" because he has made arrangements for his 17 year-old cousin to have sexual intercourse with a 15 year-old friend at his house while his parents are out, it would not seem necessary for such a case to be tried in the Crown Court.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para11"></a>By the same token, causing a child to watch a pornographic movie might be considered serious enough to merit trial in the Crown Court where the defendant is an adult and the complainant is a 10 year-old, but the circumstances surrounding an 18 year-old causing a 15 year-old to watch the same movie might make the case more suitable for trial in a magistrates' court. Similarly, where the child is 12 the case might be suitable for a magistrates' court.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para12"></a>It is not appropriate for the Sexual Offences Bill to add unnecessarily to the workload of our Crown Courts. It would increase delays and overburden the system with cases that could equally be heard by magistrates.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para13"></a>These are probing amendments. The difficulty is that there is a range of offending behaviour and the seriousness with which cases are treated will have to depend on the facts. I fully appreciate and accept why the noble Baroness has tabled the amendments. I hope that she accepts that there is a range of such behaviour. We shall not make much progress on this issue unless she accepts that there has to be discretion.

<P>

<a name="30401-13_para17"></a><P>

<a name="30401-13_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 55, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 57, 58, 59, 61 and 62, which all relate to Clause 13. They stand in my name, with support for some of them from the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, for which I thank her.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para19"></a>Clause 13 concerns causing a child to watch a sexual act. The amendments are logical and sensible and seek to update the Bill in that they recognise that images are available in many forms.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para20"></a>Amendment No. 55 seeks to add the words "or for gain". The reason for this is that it seems odd that the Bill, as currently drafted, proposes to make it an offence for an adult intentionally to cause a child under 16 to watch a third person engaging in a sexual act or to look at a photograph or pseudo-photograph of the same where obtaining sexual gratification is his reason for so doing, but if the same person did it for gain it would not be an offence. So you can sell the stuff and that is okay. Surely not. That is not the intention of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para21"></a>I appreciate what has been said elsewhere about the provenance of the Bill but I none the less consider it important to continue to promote an amendment which seeks to put similar conduct done for gain on the same footing as conduct done for sexual gratification. The intention behind the amendments is to raise the duty of care which online publishers will be expected to observe in relation to pornographic material&#151;that is, that, at the very least, no website should present pornographic images on its home page. Anyone selling or promoting such material should, at the very least, interpose a warning page which, if you click on to it, will warn you that are about to see adult material. The standards I have in mind in relation to the display are those in the Indecent Displays (Control) Act.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para22"></a>Amendments Nos. 57 and 61 seek to add the word "recklessly" at different points. This means that publishers will be expected to take steps to verify the age of people to whom they might be selling or promoting material. Amendment No. 58 seeks to add the words "or allows" to make it clear that a person would be guilty of an offence if he simply failed to take reasonable steps to prevent someone watching a video or seeing a picture of a sexual act.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para23"></a>Amendment No. 59 is intended to catch not only pornographic photographs but other kinds of pornographic images&#151;for example, cartoons. There is an increasing amount of such material in circulation <P>


<a name="column_1203"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>through, for example, Japanese Manga and Anime. This should be caught by the Obscene Publications Act but this clause would avoid the necessity of having to go via that more complicated route. Amendment No. 62 seeks to include obscene texts but only in the context of an adult selling them or promoting them to children for gain or for sexual gratification. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-13_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I shall speak to my Amendment No. 56 and to Amendments Nos. 57 , 58 and 59, to which I have added my name to that of the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton. I agree with almost all the points raised by the noble Baroness. There are many issues of concern about the way in which the clause has been drafted.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para24"></a>Amendment No. 56 is a probing amendment. It seeks to delete the word "intentionally" from subsection (1)(a). "Intentionally causes a child to watch a sexual act" has connotations of coercion. The Explanatory Notes refer to a person who forces a child to watch a pornographic film. We have had helpful discussions with members of the Metropolitan Police who have told us that paedophile behaviour is often much more subtle. Paedophiles will leave pornographic material lying around in the hope that children will look at it out of natural curiosity.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para25"></a>We support Amendment No. 57, which seeks to add the words "or recklessly". Our amendment is in an alternative format. It does not inquire into the mind of a defendant; it merely states that if by his action of leaving material lying around he causes a child to see it, he will be guilty of the offence on the basis that those who are involved in exposing children to this kind of material should beware.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para26"></a>We wholeheartedly support Amendment No. 59 which seeks to extend the material to any other visual depiction. Again, we have received clear advice from the Metropolitan Police that we need to include cartoons, tracings, drawings and other visual representations which, in the view of the police, are often very much more disturbing than photographic pictures and so forth.
<P>

<a name="30401-13_para27"></a>I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept the majority of this group of amendments.

<A NAME="30401-14_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I rise to express my general support for the amendments. They are sensible and it is absolutely vital that the law keeps up with new technology. If the provisions place a small extra burden on those with Internet businesses, I really do not care, as long as the law protects children. Given the technology now available, every effort should be made to keep such material away from young people.
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para0"></a>I agree absolutely with Amendment No. 59. As the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, pointed out, cartoons can be just as distressing and damaging as studio photographs. I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept the amendments.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I, too, rise to support the amendments. They go a long way towards protecting children from what might be called 21st century technology. I shall pick up on a point made by my noble friend: the subtlety with which some people operate is astonishing. We know that they are some of the most manipulative people in the world. They are extremely clever and will resort to new techniques to bring awful material before children.
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para1"></a>I wish to make a further point, one which I make given my experience of serving on the Government Front Bench. When departments produce a Bill and lay it before Parliament, they are loath to see it tampered with in any way whatever. They will go to enormous lengths not to accept amendments. However, I think that the amendments before the Committee are unarguable. While it is possible for the Minister to say that, while he agrees with them, the wording is not right in every sense and so government amendments will be brought forward to make them technically correct, there is no argument for rejecting them. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will fight the corner in his department to ensure that this change is made. Indeed, I think that it would also be welcomed in another place.
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para2"></a>One matter that does not divide Members of any party in either House is the belief that we should do everything we can to protect children, without being overly burdensome or bureaucratic. These amendments go a long way to achieving that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I certainly go along with all that has been said. However, this clause does not cover only the Internet and access through that medium to these particularly pernicious pictures and pseudo-pictures&#151;or whatever they are called nowadays&#151;but also material left lying around at home, in an uncle's home or in the home of the babysitter. I should like to ask the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, whether the term "other visual depiction" includes videos and compact discs. If it does not, it jolly well should do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-14_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Thornton: </B>   It is my intention that the amendment should cover such material.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The purpose of the offence of,

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"causing a child to watch a sexual act",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-14_para3"></a>
is to protect a child from being an unwilling witness to sexual activity, whether live or recorded. I fully agree with what has been said by all noble Lords; namely, that such material is frequently used to sexualise young people with a view then to taking advantage of them.
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para4"></a>As drafted, the offence covers any situation where an adult intentionally, for his own sexual gratification, causes a child to watch a third person engage in a sexual act, whether that act is live or recorded and whether that recorded act is a still or moving image. Since the provision refers to pseudo-photographs, it also covers the situation where the adult causes the child to look at pornographic material which does not involve a real person.
<P>


<a name="column_1205"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1205</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para5"></a>Amendment No. 55, proposed by my noble friend Lady Thornton, would make it an offence for someone to cause a child to watch a sexual act "for gain". The purpose of the provision as presently drafted is to criminalise the actions of anyone who makes a child watch a sexual act because doing so gives him, the defendant, sexual pleasure. This is deviant behaviour of a personal and intimate kind that merits being treated as a sexual crime and in relation to which it is right that the perpetrator should be regarded as a sex offender.
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para6"></a>The "for gain" element, which I assume the noble Baroness suggests is an alternative motivation, would suggest that we should criminalise, for example, the film company that uses an image of a naked couple in a sexual embrace in order to advertise the film and to encourage people to pay to see it, or even the publication of a newspaper that includes photographs of models in various stages of undress. Plainly that would be going too far.
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para7"></a>Equally the amendment would cover a teacher who is paid to deliver sex education and who distributes perfectly appropriate illustrated material or shows videos as a part of the lessons that he is providing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-14_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Thornton: </B>   I thank my noble and learned friend for allowing me to intervene. The point of the amendment is that if someone uses as a defence the fact that they were being paid or doing this for gain, at the moment it appears that that will not be covered by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para8"></a>If the acts were committed for sexual gratification, possibly and probably they would be caught by the legislation, but what if a defendant says, "Well, actually I wasn't doing it for sexual gratification. I was being paid to do it"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-14_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Perhaps I, too, may intervene at this point. Where teachers are doing the decent thing by children, of course they will not be caught by the amendment. Furthermore, I do not believe that that is what the noble Baroness intends in her proposal. However, under an amendment tabled by the noble and learned Lord that we shall discuss later in our proceedings, a whole raft of people are to be given immunity from prosecution simply because they will be able to claim that they did something for educational reasons. It is possible that some people will take advantage of that.
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para9"></a>I have on file for the purposes of our discussions on this Bill some horrendous material, including videos, to which children have been exposed for so-called educational purposes. People who do that cannot be allowed to claim immunity from prosecution simply because they say in defence that what they were doing was only for educational reasons.
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para10"></a>If someone is caught in these acts for sexual gratification, for personal gain or for commercial gain, the noble Baroness has a real point with her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I understand the argument, but the effect of the amendment would be <P>


<a name="column_1206"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1206</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this. If someone depicted any act of a sexual nature for money and children saw it, that would be made a crime. I understand entirely the point being made by my noble friend Lady Thornton; namely, that certain people, for bad motives, will seek to show children sexual activities in live or recorded forms. I have no difficulty with the concept of "for sexual gratification", but the term "for gain" is more difficult.
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para11"></a>I think that both my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, are trying to target those who do it for money, but have in the background a sexual motive for their actions.

<A NAME="30401-14_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Thornton: </B>   It is quite possible that the wording may not be correct. Perhaps the Minister has another form of words to express the matter. However, as it stands I do not think that the Bill covers all eventualities; that is, it does not cover all the reasons why people may depict sexual acts to children.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-14_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I think that there may be a fundamental point here. What both noble Baronesses are proposing is that, while we all agree that the motive of sexual gratification is covered, we should also cover circumstances where it is done only for money. Thus, when a person sells a magazine or a film which depicts a sexual act in order to make money, and to some extent the material could be targeted at children, that would become a crime. Is that what is intended? If that is the case, I respectfully submit that that would be going much too far. Some limit needs to be put on what the words "for gain" are intended to cover.
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para12"></a>I am not remotely unsympathetic to the point, but if my noble friend has in mind some form of limitation, I invite her to help us to identify how to define it precisely. I say that because I do not think that the House would thank the Committee if we sought to make the Radio Times or a perfectly legitimate children's magazine depicting a sexual act guilty of doing something criminal.
<P>

<a name="30401-14_para13"></a>I have a sense of what the noble Baroness seeks to achieve here&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-14_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   In supporting the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, perhaps I may call the noble and learned Lord's attention to line 38 on page 5. It refers to a person committing an offence if, for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"he intentionally causes another person . . .  to watch a third person".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-14_para14"></a>
Surely "intentionally" would remove the possibility that the Minister has raised of a film made mainly for adult consumption falling into the hands of a child by accident or a newspaper publishing an advertisement for a film in which a couple with no clothes on engaged in sexual activity. The provision would not catch them either because they would not be intentionally aiming their products at children. I think the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, is trying to catch those people who are intentionally aiming their products, services or images at children. That is possible, as long as the Bill is amended in line with the noble Baroness's proposal.

<A NAME="30401-14_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Let me deal with that important point. A film specifically aimed at and sold to children could contain the depiction of people kissing. We certainly do not want to criminalise that, but that appears to be the consequence of including the words "or for gain". Can the noble Baroness give me an example of what she wants? That is really what I am after.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cameron of Lochbroom: </B>   Will the Minister look at this again? He quite rightly says that the clause is aimed at a person carrying out these acts for his personal sexual gratification. The point is that that may sometimes be accompanied by a gain. I am speaking off the top of my head, but perhaps a phrase such as, "whether for gain or not" could be included in relation to sexual gratification, rather than making gain an alternative. As an erstwhile prosecutor, I think it would cause considerable difficulties to add an element to sexual gratification as an alternative and not an addition, which is what the amendment may be striving to achieve. I make these points for the Minister to think about; perhaps he could look again at the clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-15_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   As I read the amendment, I thought there was a distinct point to it. I may be quite wrong, and it may not be the point. What if a person shows a child a video, a film or something on the Internet not just for his own sexual gratification but to attract someone who has paid him money for it? I could be wrong and that may not be what is meant. However, I have in mind some of the horrors that have been going on in America via the Internet. There is grooming, not to mention the list of about 6,000 potential paedophiles resulting from a case that was exposed there. That certainly was for gain, as those people made millions. The whole area needs amending, in the Communications Bill as well as this one. This will be very important in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   Perhaps I could make one more point before the Minister replies. The Minister referred to a film aimed at children in which a couple of people might be kissing. Clause 80 gives a definition of what is sexual and says of various activities that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a reasonable person would consider that it may (at least) be sexual",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-15_para0"></a>
and that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a reasonable person would consider that it is sexual",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-15_para1"></a>
in this particular context. I am sure that that is what it means. Given that definition, the example that the Minister raised would not fall prey to the amendment. Besides which, surely the CPS would not bring a case against a film-maker in those circumstances. A little earlier, the Minister was praising the common sense and discretion of the CPS. Perhaps we could rely on that common sense and discretion in a situation such as this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-15_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I was going to make the same point about the definition of "sexual". If the Minister has that <P>


<a name="column_1208"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1208</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problem in relation to minor acts under this clause, the problem will exist in relation to virtually every other offence in the Bill. If we hit that problem here, perhaps we should look again at the definition of "sexual".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   There is obviously great enthusiasm here, and I understand why. We need to work on defining what we are looking for. The intervention of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, was helpful, as was that of the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, in defining what that is. But if two hurdles have to be overcome, that will not ultimately help anybody. We must be quite careful about exactly the activities we want to catch. I would find it helpful to have a conversation with the noble Baronesses, Lady Thornton and Lady Blatch, to identify precisely what conduct we are trying to catch that is not covered by "sexual gratification". I cannot give any guarantees that it will produce anything, but it is well worth making the effort to find out whether there is something that has not been caught.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para2"></a>There is some help in relation to pornographic and unsolicited commercial e-mail which I do not think is the only thing that the noble Baronesses who have spoken are after. There is an issue that needs to be addressed. The Department of Trade and Industry is consulting on unsolicited commercial communications in Chapter 6 of its wider consultation on the EU directive on privacy and electronic communications. I believe that that is one of the bodies to examine the problem of pornographic and unsolicited commercial e-mail.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para3"></a>Amendment No. 56 is in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, and, I think, the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton&#151;no, she is denying it. This would remove the intentional element of the offence. It would mean that a person who obtained sexual gratification from accidentally causing a child to watch a sexual act would be captured by the offence. It is quite difficult to conceive of a situation in which someone could accidentally cause a child to watch a sexual act for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification. If one carries out an act for a purpose, that must mean that one has acted with that intention&#151;in other words, intentionally. The deliberate leaving around of pornographic material in the hope that a child will find it is plainly an intentional act.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para4"></a>Perhaps the thinking behind the amendment is that it is unnecessary to say that the causing must be carried out intentionally, given that it must be carried out for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification. Removing "intentionally" on this basis would mean that the offence was no longer consistent with all the other child sex offences, all of which require the activity in question to have been carried out intentionally.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para5"></a>Amendment No. 57, which I suspect goes with Amendment No. 56, proposes a different amendment to the state of mind necessary to commit the offence. It would mean that a person would be guilty of this offence if he were reckless about letting a child witness a sexual act, even if it was not his intention that the child should witness the act. Is that desirable? For example, <P>


<a name="column_1209"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>such a provision might cover parents who leave their bedroom door unlocked so that their child can seek comfort during the night. The child comes into the room quietly and unnoticed while they are having sexual intercourse. Any parents who, having noticed the presence of the child, continued their lovemaking, would fall within the meaning of the term "intentional" and would be covered by the offence, but we would not wish to catch those who are unintentionally observed.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para6"></a>A recklessness provision would also catch anyone who mistakenly, rather than intentionally, left videos or photographs in a place where a child could find them. It is not unreasonable to expect adults to take care to keep sexually explicit material out of the reach of children. However, I do not think it would be right to bring the full weight of the criminal law against someone in cases where a child finds and looks at such material.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para7"></a>Our offence requires defendants to take positive actions that cause a child to watch a sexual act. It should be possible to be found guilty of this offence only if it can be proved that it was their intention that a particular child or children should be subjected to such activity.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para8"></a>In a similar vein, Amendment No. 58 is intended to broaden the scope of this offence to cover those who intentionally allow (as opposed to cause) a child to watch a sexual act. Our purpose is to criminalise those who purposefully expose a child to pornographic or sexual images purely for their own sexual gratification. Do we want to criminalise, for example, parents who consider that it is acceptable for their 15 year-old child to watch an X-rated movie or to look at a pornographic magazine and knowingly allow him to do so? That is where some of the amendments we are discussing would lead.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para9"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 61 would be to import an element of recklessness about the age of the child into this offence. I can see no justification for treating the question of the defendant's knowledge or belief about the age of the child any differently in relation to this offence than it is treated in relation to all other offences in Part 1 of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para10"></a>Where a defendant has intentionally caused a child to witness a sexual act and he is able to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that he reasonably believed the child to be 16 or over, he should be acquitted of this offence. In any event, if a defendant is reckless about the age of the child and it transpires that the child was under 16, he is extremely unlikely to be able to satisfy the jury that he reasonably believed the child to be at least 16.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para11"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 59 would be to bring visual images other than photographs and pseudo-photographs within the scope of this offence. That plainly requires consideration. I hope that I shall be able to help in that regard.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para12"></a>Amendment No. 62 would extend the scope of the offence to cover written material of an obscene nature shown either for gain or sexual gratification, intentionally or recklessly. I have already mentioned what seem to me to be the problems in relation to the concept of "for gain" although I have indicated that we need to consider that further. As regards the concept of "recklessness", I have <P>


<a name="column_1210"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>indicated what I think the dangers are in that regard. Obviously, we cannot accept the amendment as it is drafted.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para13"></a>The amendment also introduces the idea of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"text which a reasonable person would be likely to understand to be obscene within the meaning of the Obscene Publications Act 1959".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-15_para14"></a>
That would mean that the court would have to find that a "reasonable person" would be likely to understand that the material was liable to deprave and corrupt, which is likely to add complication and difficulty to making out the criminal offence. However, we need to consider the principle of whether intentionally showing text to a child for the purpose of gaining sexual gratification&#151;which I suspect is broadly what the noble Baroness seeks to catch&#151;should be covered in the same way as we propose showing photographs or pseudo-photographs should be. I do not believe that the noble Baroness is particularly wedded to her drafting. The drafting is not the problem; we need to look at that along the lines that I have indicated.
<P>

<a name="30401-15_para15"></a>I hope that I have indicated that we can consider much of what has been said. I can give some assistance in relation to the material I referred to at the end of my speech. As regards the other matters, we need to look at them and try to define precisely what we are trying to cover. I hope that in the light of those remarks the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30401-16_para12"></a>In our earlier debates we touched on the issue that is at the heart of these amendments; that is, whether consensual sexual acts involving teenagers should be criminalised by the Bill. The issue attracted a number of comments during the Second Reading debate. Many noble Lords who spoke were concerned that the Bill was out of touch with the realities of modern day teenage life. Several of the groups that have provided briefing, notably various children's charities, support the case for amending the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para13"></a>The Minister said on Second Reading that in order to protect children,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That will mean, as it does now in relation to current offences, that one must criminalise certain activities that, on the facts of a particular case, would never merit a prosecution because it would not be in the public interest for there to be one".&#151;[Official Report, 13/2/03; cols. 875&#150;876.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-16_para14"></a>
I challenge that proposition. I do not believe that it is always necessary to criminalise activities where it would not be in the public interest to prosecute. Indeed, I think that it is dangerous for the criminal law to be written in a way which criminalises activities that are regarded as normal activities.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para15"></a>We are not talking about exceptional activity whether or not Members of the Committee approve of teenage sex. It is a fact of life that it takes place. We should get the matter in context. Clauses 9 to 13 deal both with full sexual intercourse and with sexual touching, for example, kissing and all the activities that make up heavy petting, which Members of the Committee may remember from their youth.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para16"></a>The Bill could criminalise a game of postman's knock, or whatever it is that teenagers play nowadays. If two 15 year-olds were involved, both could be guilty of an offence under Clause 14. The offence of causing a child to watch a sexual act could catch a couple of 15 year-olds looking at a dirty magazine together, as I understand that 15 year-old boys down the ages are wont to do. If a Martian came down to Earth, I do not think that we could rationally explain why activity which is widespread and barely condemned in society is made illegal by this Bill.
<P>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para17"></a>The Minister will doubtless say that the Bill makes no changes to the current position where underage sex is a criminal activity. But I have to say to the Minister that we should not miss the opportunity offered by the Bill to ensure that the criminal law reflects society as we find it today and not, for example, as it might have existed when the Sexual Offences Act 1956 was passed.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para18"></a>I turn to my amendments. Amendments Nos. 64 and 66 do not give a blanket exemption for teenage sexual activity. They provide that a person under 18 can be charged with something that would be an offence under Clauses 9 to 13 unless the other person involved&#151;the child under 16&#151;has the capacity to consent and does consent. We defined capacity to consent in Amendment No. 66 as the child under 16 being capable of understanding the nature, implications and reasonably foreseeable consequences of the activity or conduct.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para19"></a>These amendments draw no distinction between those who are under 13 and those who are between 13 and 16. I have already said in relation to the amendments to which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, spoke earlier that we accept a threshold of the age of 13. If the Minister were minded to accept the thrust of the amendment, I should be happy to see a restriction on the ability of under 13s to consent.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para20"></a>Although I hope that the Minister will see that the amendments are rational and in keeping with the facts of life today, I have tabled two further amendments in case he dashes my hopes. Amendment No. 67 seeks to leave out the sentencing provisions in Clause 14(2), and Amendment No. 68 seeks to delete only Clause 14(2)(a). They are probing amendments to try to find out how the Government would seek to apply the wide-ranging offences via the CPS. We have had some discussion on that today. We understand that much would be left to the CPS, which might make it difficult for such a wide range of potential teenage sexual activity to be handled. There would be no clarity for those young people as to what they could and could not do.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para21"></a>It is not easy to identify the extremes in relation to children. I expect that the Minister would say that consensual petting, consensual looking at pornographic magazines, and perhaps even consensual intercourse without aggravating circumstances should not be prosecuted. However, the dividing lines are important. We need a greater understanding. If the Minister is unwilling to amend the Bill, we need to press the Government to be much more specific about the kind of circumstances in which they think that the offence would be prosecuted.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para22"></a>My final amendment in the group is Amendment No. 71, which requires the Attorney-General to issue guidance to Crown prosecutors when considering whether to prosecute those under 18 for sexual offences. That continues the theme that, if we have to have the law as drafted in the Bill, we should be clear about what guidance is to be given to Crown prosecutors for applying that. That amendment is supported by the Law Society, various children's charities and Liberty. If the Government are wedded to the Bill as drafted, we believe it extremely important that guidance be publicly <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-16_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   It grieves me to take issue with my noble friend because I know how thoughtful she has been on the subject, and that what I shall refer to is not what she would intend for the amendments. However, we have an age of consent. We argued long and hard about it, and Parliament decided that there should be one. The effect of the amendment, like previous amendments, would be to abolish it. As a Parliament, we have to think hard about simply removing the age of consent.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para23"></a>Amendment No. 66 effectively abolishes the age of consent where both parties are under 18. It allows the defendant to claim that his victim consented to the activity. The amendment imports the concept of the "Gillick competence" into the age of consent offences in Clauses 9 to 13. It does not affect the non-consensual penalties, but for the age of consent offences it has much the same effect as the earlier amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. Amendment No. 71 would require the Attorney-General to issue guidance to Crown prosecutors about how to decide whether to prosecute under-18s for sexual offences.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para24"></a>The amendments open up the possibility of endless courtroom arguments about whether the child victim had the capacity to consent to the sexual activity and whether the child in fact consented. That would place a huge burden on the child, who would have to give evidence of her capacity and try to persuade the court that she could not or did not consent. On an earlier amendment, I said that it would be grievous to have a child in court to defend their position as to whether they gave consent.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para25"></a>Many prosecutions would be dropped simply because prosecutors fear getting bogged down in a defence argument that the victim was competent to consent. The whole purpose of an age of consent offence is that the law assumes that a person under the age cannot consent. If it is proved that sexual activity took place when the victim was under 16, the question of consent is irrelevant. Amendment No. 66 demolishes that.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para26"></a>It is true that the clauses allow the perpetrator to argue that he reasonably believed that his victim was over 16, but that is easier to resolve than questions of consent. Furthermore, the Bill, combined with government amendments, will not allow that argument to be raised where the victim is under 13.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para27"></a>Amendment No. 66 does not recognise the under-13 age limit. That would allow a 17-and-a-half year-old to have sex with a 12 year-old and then claim that she was "Gillick competent" and gave her consent. An 18 year-old would not have that option. The amendments have some side effects that need to be thought through.
<P>

<a name="30401-16_para28"></a>Amendment No. 71 suggests further scope for undermining the age of consent by requiring extra guidance on prosecuting under-18s. Presumably the intention is that the guidance will indicate that prosecutors should be more lenient on under-18s.

However, my main purpose in speaking is to oppose the Question that Clause 14 stand part of the Bill, which is part of this grouping. In a way, that is a protest about how tightly the Bill has been drawn with regard to young people who commit sexual offences, thereby preventing us tabling amendments about their treatment. Opposing the Question is the only way in which we can have that debate.

The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and I recently visited a centre where such people receive expert help from a highly-trained multi-agency team of professionals. It became apparent to us as we listened to some of the case histories that society had failed each and every one of them. Every one had suffered neglect, physical or sexual violence, or severe deprivation of some sort. Research shows a very high correlation between being subjected to physical violence as a small child and the development of some sort of sexual dysfunction or aberrant behaviour later in life.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para1"></a>How inappropriate then to deal with such young people by the criminal law. They are victims themselves. The more I looked into the research, the more it became very clear to me that a great deal could be done to help those children to avoid reoffending. The earlier the treatment is begun, the more successful it will be. Sadly, there are not enough centres such as the one that we visited and those run by the NSPCC all over the country.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para2"></a>It is also sad that there is currently no obligation on the police to consult a multi-disciplinary professional team about the best action to take, with regard to both the welfare of the child and the safety of society, when a complaint is made. In addition, if the case goes for prosecution and the child is convicted, there is no obligation on the youth offending panel or court to obtain a professional assessment before deciding on the sentence.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para3"></a>There is some very good practice, however. In Greater Manchester there is a protocol for such cases, and an initial assessment is carried out to decide what is in the best interests of the child and society before proceedings get under way. That is getting very good results but is not happening everywhere, despite the guidance on the final warning scheme issued by the Home Office juvenile offenders unit. The guidance encourages prior assessment by the youth offending teams to inform the police decision about whether to <P>


<a name="column_1215"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reprimand, issue a warning or prosecute. The police themselves welcome that approach, as they do not feel able to make such decisions. They should obviously be made by specialised professionals.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para4"></a>Similar arrangements already exist for adult sex offenders when they have been convicted. Given the importance of the welfare of the child, however, it is important that those arrangements are made prior to prosecution everywhere in the country.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para5"></a>"Prosecution" and "sentence" are inappropriate words in respect of those cases. "Treatment" is a much better word. Treatment&#151;either in a residential or non-residential situation, depending on the properly assessed risk&#151;is much more effective than putting such a child in the normal youth custody situation, where he may not receive the specialist help that he needs. Surely our objective must be to put right the damage that the parents or society at large have done to those children and prevent re-offending. That would protect other children from possible future predation. Surely they have a right to expect that. That should be mandatory, not optional. We have failed them, which is bad enough. However, to compound their misery by punishing them instead of treating them and helping them to put their lives in order is appalling in a society that calls itself civilised.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para6"></a>I beg the Minister to find a way of reassuring me and of ensuring that children in this situation will have a right and an entitlement to have their welfare taken into account if they offend. We should keep them out of the criminal justice system wherever possible and put them into the child protection system instead when they commit acts that society rightly abhors.

<A NAME="30401-17_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I will speak to the Question whether Clause 14 stand part of the Bill. I will also briefly speak to Amendment No. 67, which stands in my name. Before doing so, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, for speaking so eloquently about the need to treat children as children in this regard.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para7"></a>We are well aware of what needs to be done. The Minister earlier made it clear that we know what needs to be done, although it is not now being done. In, I believe, 1991, the NCH produced a report clearly laying out the range of services and interventions necessary with this group of children. In 1999, I believe, the Department of Health produced guidance about safeguarding children which clearly laid out the range of services needed by those children, who are at risk and are children in need. That depends on close co-operation between many different agencies. Each child behaving in that way needs an assessment. The Minister kindly wrote to me&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-17_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   It is right to be concerned about vulnerable children and children in need and those needing a great deal of support. However, does the noble Earl agree that this catch-all group of amendments also involves robust and extremely mature&#151;sometimes not mentally mature, but certainly <P>


<a name="column_1216"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>physically mature&#151;14, 15 and 16 year-olds, and very immature seven, eight, nine and 10 year-olds? In this context, there can be extreme wilfulness and the understandable situations&#151;one would expect the Crown Prosecution Service to take them into account&#151;described by the noble Earl.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-17_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness for her intervention; what she says is quite true.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para8"></a>One must bear in mind that some of those young people are deliberate about what they do, have no remorse and are very unattractive. A range of children is involved. Most of those children are of the sort described by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley; they have experienced abuse and neglect. Even those who demonstrate such a lack of compunction for what they do have often also had very poor experiences. All the same, it is important to make it clear that they are responsible for their actions. It is therefore acceptable and desirable for a small minority to be entered on the sex offenders' register.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para9"></a>This is a complex area and I do not seek to argue that there should be only one approach. The research clearly shows&#151;this is well evidenced&#151;that often in cases of children abusing other children, the children who abuse are often themselves in need. I have spoken to therapists who have worked with such children, and they say that it is quite difficult to like them and to want to work with them. They do not demonstrate any compunction for buggering several children, for example. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why there has been admitted slippage in this regard; I believe that the Minister will admit that this area has been neglected for many years. I have heard that from many organisations working in this field. One reason for that is because so many of the children are so unattractive.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para10"></a>We know what needs to be done. Are the services that are necessary to address the needs of those children out there? We should also consider the risk that those children involve; we cannot have them continuing to abuse other children. We should remember that while many of those children grow out of such behaviour, many adult sex offenders report that their behaviour began in their adolescence. This is an important matter of public protection.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para11"></a>If we intervene early and effectively, the great consensus of professional opinion in this area is that if one wants to stop adult offending behaviour, it is best to get in there as early as possible&#151;perhaps even before adolescence starts&#151;with an effective, multi-agency approach to the problem and to the child. It is imperative that there is a clear strategy in this area. That has been lacking for many years. The National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers made that clear in literature that it sent to me.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para12"></a>This matter involves public protection and child welfare elements. To illustrate that, I give the example of Darren, a five and a half year-old boy, who was, I believe, severely neglected when he was less than two. His brother had abused two girls and at the age of five and a half Darren was displaying severe difficulties with concentration and unacceptable sexual behaviour. One <P>


<a name="column_1217"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1217</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>worries about his welfare very much. Another example is that of 14 and a half year-old Neil, who was having sex with animals, who had buggered many children and who was displaying very distressing modes of behaviour. Despite that, he was allowed to continue until he successfully abducted, raped and killed a child. No intervention was made to protect other children by assessing him and making available the right sort of treatment.
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para13"></a>I was grateful to the Minister for acknowledging earlier the gaps in service provision in that area and the need to give more thought to the needs and risks associated with the children and an appropriate response. What timescale does he have for pulling together what must be done to address those children's needs, and who is responsible? Responsibility falls principally between the Department of Health and the Home Office, but several other agencies can be involved, such as the Department for Education and Skills. Is Hilary Benn, the Minister who has taken over from John Denham as the Minister responsible for children, now responsible for that area?
<P>

<a name="30401-17_para14"></a>Amendment No. 67, which also appears in my name, would leave out subsection (2). It is a probing amendment; more specifically, my concern is that there should be a preliminary assessment in nearly every case where a child abuses another child. That assessment would inform the decision taken by the Crown Prosecution Service if the case goes that far. Such an assessment would ensure that the welfare of the child is borne in mind as he goes through proceedings, if that is the course of action which is decided on. If there is a question of the child being included on the sex offenders' register, there should be a more thorough assessment. That assessment should involve a child psychologist, because many of the children concerned have learning disabilities and only a child psychologist is equipped to detect them. I look forward to the Minister's response.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   At Second Reading and, indeed, in the short debate on the White Paper, I was one of those who raised the question of whether we were attempting in this way to overcriminalise acts which were more appropriately dealt with by the kind of multi-agency approach referred to by the noble Earl. In both those instances the Minister replied that, indeed, he saw the force of that argument and that such an approach was desirable but that that was not the point of this piece of legislation.
<P>

<a name="30401-18_para0"></a>I agree with the general tenor of the remarks by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, concerning the difficulties which may ensue precisely because of the kind of points raised in earlier debates today about relying in this instance on, for example, the discretion or good sense of the criminal justice system, and in particular the CPS, in deciding whether or not to prosecute such cases as may come before them.
<P>

<a name="30401-18_para1"></a>I am sure my noble friends will say that discretion will be used in such instances. However, difficulties may arise because of a disjunction between what is formally proposed and enacted and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said in her opening remarks, the general behaviour of many young people who <P>


<a name="column_1218"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1218</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would fall into the category of criminalisation if this were carried out to the letter of the law. I remind the Committee that we are talking of a society in which the average age of sexual experience in the way we have discussed, not necessarily sexual intercourse, is now 14 for girls and 13 for boys. So, we are talking about general behaviour, not aberrant behaviour.
<P>

<a name="30401-18_para2"></a>I believe that problems will arise in a situation where this kind of behaviour may be investigated, even if not formally prosecuted, because we will create an environment in which it would be difficult to take the kind of multi-agency approach vividly described by the noble Earl in relation to children with particular difficulties and special needs but also more generally with children who simply behave in the way their peers in 2003 may behave. As several noble Lords have said, such behaviour may not necessarily be something we congratulate on or approve of, but it is undoubtedly the case that it takes place.
<P>

<a name="30401-18_para3"></a>I hope my noble and learned friend will not simply say that he accepts that a multi-agency approach is appropriate, but that that is not the remit of this piece of legislation. In addition, perhaps he could comment on another point raised at Second Reading, I believe originally by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, in the context of mental disability but also by me in relation to under 13 year-olds; that is, the present inquiry by the Department of Health into the legal concept of capacity&#151;I am not sure of its formal title&#151;which is relevant to under 13 year-olds.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-18_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I support the general points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and my noble friend Lord Listowel, even though they are a "pretence", if I may use that word, for bringing forward such matters for discussion. I also support the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes.
<P>

<a name="30401-18_para4"></a>We must realise that the extreme forms of behaviour which lead ultimately to the kind of centre I visited the other day with two colleagues are horrendous. By the time the 15 year-old whose case we discussed had arrived at that age, there was practically no hope for him. Without doubt, he will be one of tomorrow's sexual offenders on the sex offenders' register. Equally, the centre was struggling with a five year-old who had abused a three year-old.
<P>

<a name="30401-18_para5"></a>Many such children are in care, and we should think of the added risks of multiplication of such offences. These are children about whom we should be particularly concerned and with whom we should be taking particular care. I believe that the suggested form of treatment has an important part to play, but not for all the offences referred to. By the time such children reach the age of 16, or 13 in the case of those who abuse under 13, the offences committed will be horrendous.
<P>

<a name="30401-18_para6"></a>As a juvenile court chairman over many years, such children have come before me. There have been various methods of taking them into care and not dealing very effectively with them. However, I have seen the specialist at the centre I referred to as a <P>


<a name="column_1219"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1219</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>professional over many years and, my goodness, she is a professional. When the children are really difficult they are brought to that centre and begin to make a relationship. Then, what happens? The local authority thinks that that costs too much and withdraws the child, thereby making the position even worse in the long term.
<P>

<a name="30401-18_para7"></a>Whereas I disagree with some of the points made, some cases in which matters have been left for too long will have to be brought before the courts and there will have to be a criminal record. I would rather like to see followed a suggestion made by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, on our tour. If that point is reached, there should be an entitlement to treatment, which may be compulsory. Before that stage is reached, at pre-court assessments, if permitted there could be an opportunity for the family and children to consent to that rather than a criminal case being brought.
<P>

<a name="30401-18_para8"></a>There is much that can be done. I refer back to a point I made earlier. There is an increase in pornography and the extent to which paedophile material is available via the Internet, and so forth. This situation is not likely to get better. It will get worse if we do not nip in at an early stage. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, insisted that we get to these families at an early stage and give them the support and help they need. That is where the emphasis should be. I am glad to say that that is where the Government are beginning to put a lot of emphasis and resources. I hope that those points will be borne in mind.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Perhaps the noble Baroness will answer this question. As I said earlier, many sexually active young people are healthy, worldly and extremely streetwise. What would happen in the case of three to four very bright 15 year-olds, who gang rape a much younger girl? If the amendments are agreed to, the only way that child could defend herself would be by going to court to give evidence that she did not give consent. It is possible that she would be so frightened she simply would not argue with the boys who had defiled her in such a way.
<P>

<a name="30401-18_para9"></a>It seems to me that there is no allowance. Once this is decriminalised for this age group it is decriminalised. If one is to nip in the bud such terrible, abhorrent behaviour there needs to be a mechanism through the courts to declare that the behaviour is wrong is law and then to deal with such people in the way suggested by the noble Earl. If appropriate, that could be through treatment. The courts are free to leave someone to go back into the community just for treatment or to pass a custodial sentence together with treatment. It seems to me that to decriminalise would leave many young people extremely vulnerable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I remind my noble friend that these amendments deal only with consensual sexual activity, and so the issue of a 15 year-old being gang-raped by some teenagers is exactly the same as far as that girl is concerned. It is taken that it is non-consensual, as is the basic offence of rape in Clause 1. <P>


<a name="column_1220"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1220</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I do not see what the problem is in relation to the points my noble friend has just put, because my amendments are about consensual sexual activity between teenagers, not non-consensual activity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I know what my noble friend Lady Noakes means. However, existing law deems that a child under 16 cannot give consent. Therefore, it is possible for the boys to say that they believed the person consented. In some strange cases, it could be that the girl did consent. However, if the amendments are accepted, the only way that the girl can defend her own position is to go into court and have to prove that she did not give consent, rather than consent being deemed not to have been given for being a child of that age.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-18_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   Perhaps I may reply as the question was addressed to me. I do not believe that there is any doubt about common sense in that case. I should be glad to hear that confirmed, or otherwise, by the Minister. If there is a case of gang rape involving three young men and a woman, it is clearly a case that has to go for prosecution, as long as the girl is under 13. Over that age, with consent, maybe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-18_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   That was my point. The case would be heard under Clause 1 conditions, and the child would have to be cross-examined in court, sometimes very aggressively. I think that a child of that age deserves the protection of the law. Consent should not be deemed to have been given at all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-18_spnew7"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Guildford: </B>   I have some sympathy with the points that have been made about the age of consent. We should not drift into changing the law, without confronting that issue head-on and properly. We have been around that circle a number of times in this House. I have a great deal of sympathy with the noble Baroness's argument. The Minister could help by recognising that sometimes the courts can be of assistance by using their authority to summon agencies to ensure that the right services are brought to bear when children and young people have particular and special needs. The family courts are well able to do this over the placement of children. I should have thought that with the right skills and development, it would be possible to ensure that we developed services that did exactly what people have asked for; namely, using the authority of the courts to ensure that the services are provided for children in these situations. We could square the circle if the Minister would indicate how we might more effectively use the system as set out in the Bill. Sometimes the courts can help, and may rescue us from the label "criminalisation" by the way in which we as a society use them to address the issues.

I am not dealing with the issue of consensual sex with young people. We have to keep that clearly separate&#151;<P>


<a name="column_1221"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recognising that young people will engage in sex. There is a debate about the age of consent, which, I agree with the right reverend Prelate, we should not be mixing with this present debate. That is because the issues of non-consensual sex and dealing with the range of abuse are so important. I shall not repeat all of the speech given by my noble friend Lord Listowel who put the issues so well. I want to raise one or two other matters.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para0"></a>There is a body of research about these children, over what works in their treatment, and what needs to be provided. I repeat that if, having gone through all of that research, yet another committee is to examine this, we will simply delay the possibility of providing services. I know the issue is about resources. This is not cheap. Another issue is that in providing for abusers, one also has to make sure that there is provision for victims. That is what the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, was trying to make us face up to. If we give good provision for those who have committed the offences, but fail to remember the victims, that causes us great difficulty.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para1"></a>The sensitivity of assessment is crucial. That will tell us the range of services that someone will need. It will also tell us the likely problems that will be faced over reoffending. I am vice-chair of the Faithfull Foundation, which treats adult offenders with clear behavioural problems. We know that behaviour can be changed, even in adult serial abusers, if the right steps are taken. As I have said, some men cannot be changed and I hope that one day they receive longer sentences, because it is the only way to give protection.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para2"></a>If the services could be developed, that would be good child protection. Whatever we say, these abusers are going to go back into the community. I should like to disabuse the Committee of the myth that all such people are contained. Large numbers of such children are in ordinary children's homes where the people in charge are going quite mad over how to prevent those youngsters harming other youngsters in their care. This has been going on for 10 years, and we still do not have proper provision or advice for those carers in institutions who are still struggling to deal with such youngsters. They give those difficult youngsters a great deal of care. Some of them are extraordinarily difficult to like. They are painfully difficult to get through to; they do not listen and&#151;as one carer recently said to me&#151;they would sell their grandmothers. Yet one has to care for them and turn their behaviour around. It takes skill, understanding and endurance.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para3"></a>My only other point is about getting the right kind of orders for those children. I have picked up the point in the wider debate made by the right reverend Prelate about the court system. It is not equipped to listen to the issues, to make assessments and to take the planning through. An adversarial system will not get to the truth. That is because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, said, many young women will not go to court and tell of their experiences. I know of dozens of young women, who have been hurt in sexual ways, who will not go to court&#151;frankly because the court process is more painful than what they endured in the sexual offence.

<a name="30401-19_para4"></a>If we are really serious about making a difference, we must do so at the structural end, at the court end&#151;and I recognise how long term that may be. We have to look also at the resource end to ensure that there is good treatment, and at the societal end also by making sure that there is good education. Public health education programmes aimed at understanding child sexual abuse&#151;like the "Stop It Now!" programme&#151;need to be extended throughout the country.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-19_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   Perhaps I may make one or two more points before the Minister replies. Those of us who have been pressing for changes to be made in the Bill as regards young people are not arguing for any kind of drift in the age of consent. That is not what we are about. Nor are we suggesting that many of the offences to which we are referring should be ignored.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para5"></a>Despite its complexity, the Bill does two things. It outlines the offences and the consequences: five years; seven years; 14 years; life; custodial sentence; and so forth. It is right that society draws a line in the sand and says, "This is not acceptable. We don't want you to do it". There is a consequence. But as regards young people, there is potential for intervening in a way that will stop them ruining the rest of their lives and protects society. That is what we are trying to do. That was the name of the White Paper.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para6"></a>We must have appropriate consequences, and they are not seven years, 14 years, life imprisonment, or lock them up and throw away the key because that is not a positive way of dealing with the offences. It is a negative way and it will not stop re-offending, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, rightly said, when young people return to society.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para7"></a>Some of us have been struggling with the Bill, trying to amend it to include provisions appropriate to young people and to achieve the positive outcomes that we all want. But the Bill does not allow us to do that. Can the Minister indicate that the law can be drawn in a way that will allow young people to have the appropriate treatment, thereby preventing the abuse of potential victims? That will take a programme of many years because it takes time to train people in that work. We need a national strategy for that.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para8"></a>Young people in these situations need an entitlement to treatment but we cannot provide that tomorrow. We need a national strategy to produce the people with proper professional training to deal with these serious offences. This is a growing problem, it is not diminishing, because society is becoming more overtly sexualised. Any child who has been suffering the neglect and abuse to which we have referred in this mini debate, and who tends towards harmful sexual behaviour, will be encouraged in that behaviour by everything that he sees around him.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para9"></a>It is a growing problem and we must grasp this nettle. We must have a long-term national strategy to produce the professionals who can undertake the work. We must give young people, for their own sake and for the protection of the rest of society, an entitlement to that treatment. It is possible and it works. The noble <P>


<a name="column_1223"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1223</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Baroness, Lady Howarth, referred to plenty of research&#151;good quality, peer-reviewed research and we must get hold of it. I hope that the Minister will help us in that respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I want to intervene only briefly. The noble Baroness and many other noble Lords have spoken about the therapeutic treatment of these problems shortly before, at the time of or after the offence. The reality is&#151;and it is a matter to which research should be devoted&#151;that at a fraction of the cost one could prevent many children ever reaching the state of impoverished relationship ability, lack of self-esteem and an inability to relate to others which make them assert themselves through sexual activity.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para10"></a>I believe that the Government's strategy ought to be to ensure that 50 or 70 per cent of children who commit these crimes never do so through support for their parents and improving the environment in which they live. Another 50 or 70 per cent of the balance should be treated as the noble Baroness recommends. The noble Lord will be amazed how the cost of putting children in prison will drop. I suspect that it will probably finance the whole operation.

<A NAME="30401-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   This has been an interesting debate which raises two separate issues. The first is raised by the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. In effect, it states that many people under 16 are committing various acts of sexual activity which no one would remotely regard as criminal. Therefore, the noble Baroness proposes that even though this might be sexual activity between two 12 year-olds, if it were truly consensual it would not be an offence under the child sex activity offences. It might be an offence under Clause 1, but it would not be criminalised by the child's sex activity. She is saying that we should abandon the age of consent except where the sexual act is committed by an adult with a child.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My amendment certainly implies that, subject to the offences at the beginning of the Bill. I modified that when I introduced it and would prefer to see it restricted to the age of 13.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I understand why the noble Baroness is saying that. What is the right way to approach it? Assuming that one raises the age to 13, the amendment provides that the age of consent does not apply to activity between minors. It is a difficult issue but one of the underlying principles of our reforms is better protection for all children and the vulnerable.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para11"></a>Research estimates that adolescents commit about one-third of all sex offences and it is likely that many of the victims of those sex offences&#151;I use that word advisedly and I mean offences which people would regard as serious offences&#151;committed by adolescents will be other adolescents and children. In framing the Bill, we must have regard not only to the needs of those who commit the offences but also the victims.

<P>

<a name="30401-19_para12"></a>It would be misguided to provide coherent sanctions to protect children from sexual abuse by adults but not provide adequate sanctions for protection from abuse by other children or young people. To be effective in this respect, the law has to be clear about the age of consent and that sexual activity below this age is not lawful. If it is not achieved, as everyone will agree, we are damaging a fundamental plank in our raft of child protection measures.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para13"></a>Any lack of clarity in this area will bring uncertainty and open the way to further change. For example, if we decide that sexual activity is lawful in some circumstances&#151;say, between consenting children&#151;what about young adults? We will be losing the ability as far as the law is concerned to draw the line in a firm and justified place. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said that it is important to have a line somewhere.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para14"></a>However, we must recognise that this unlawful activity will include a wide variety of circumstances. Where the sexual activity is mutually agreed between two people below the age of consent and it is genuinely consensual, it is extraordinarily unlikely that the CPS will decide that prosecution is in the public interest and there is no problem about this issue at the moment. The number of children in 2001 aged below 16 who were prosecuted is as follows: 368 children were cautioned for sex offences; 593 were prosecuted, of whom 273 were found guilty; of those 273, 42 were sentenced to custody; and 193 were given community sentences.
<P>

<a name="30401-19_para15"></a>I fully accept that the law must be relevant, but as regards the idea that there is a problem or an issue in the way the current law operates which makes unlawful sex below the age of consent, I am not hearing people saying that there are wrongful prosecutions.

<A NAME="30401-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   Can the noble and learned Lord tell the Committee how many of those young people receive treatment?

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I do not know the answer. I am sure that not enough are receiving treatment. The second problem that we have to deal with is what we are doing about those children. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Howarth and Lady Howe, have graphically described what children in those situations are doing. We want to stop them offending. Should we say that the criminal law has no part in that? The second part of the debate poses that question. The first part of the debate is that, in order to avoid criminalising those things that should not be criminal&#151;and most of us would agree that there is a lot of activity here that the criminal law has no part in&#151;do we in effect make the age of consent optional, which is what the proposal involves?
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para0"></a>As I have indicated, the CPS can make decisions. There is no indication that there is a problem at the moment. Where it is agreed that sexual activity has taken place&#151;that would be covered by the amendment of the <P>


<a name="column_1225"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1225</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Baroness, Lady Noakes&#151;but there are clearly abusive circumstances&#151;for example, one child is engaged in sexual activity with a number of other children or has pressurised the other children into agreeing&#151;it is possible that the most effective way of preventing the child causing harm to children in the future may be psychiatric help or child protection procedures. But the criminal law has to be available for that to be the most effective option in such cases, particularly where it will enable the child's behaviour to be tackled properly.
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para1"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, talks about consent and consent where the non-defendant&#151;if I may use that phrase&#151;has a full understanding of what has happened. How are those problems to be resolved when one is dealing with possibly abusive circumstances, where there is peer pressure or pressure by the defendant that may have caused what is, in effect, abusive conduct? There is such a wide range of circumstances that one does not want to make the law much more complex and make it harder to intervene where necessary .
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para2"></a>We all agree that there may be cases in which the behaviour is so serious and so abusive that the criminal law has to intervene, even when those committing the abuse are children. How are we to define those circumstances? We cannot take such decisions in Parliament. We cannot capture the complexity of each case that may arise. Such decisions need to be taken on a thorough assessment of the circumstances of each case. The criminal law cannot provide a tailor-made response, which is why the Crown Prosecution Service takes and continues to take a decision on whether a prosecution is in the public interest in every case. Where prosecution is appropriate, I am sure that it is wrong to have a situation where nuance and difficulty&#151;the result of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes&#151;become the order of the day in relation to what happens in court.
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para3"></a>The age of consent most certainly has benefits, but only if it is clear. That is the effect of the current position. If public protection for children is one of our aims, and there is not a real difficulty in the way in which the law operates in what may be regarded as innocent circumstances at the moment, surely we should err in favour of the protection of children. The criminal law needs to provide a strong framework to deal with the most serious behaviour, but a prosecution does not have to be pursued in every case. That is exactly the same as the current position. It does not remotely mean that the criminal law will be invoked in every case if an alternative course of action will be more effective in protecting children. That will apply to circumstances in which it is patently abusive behaviour. But maybe the invocation of the criminal law is not the right course. I hope it goes without saying that it certainly does not mean that a prosecution will be pursued in cases where the behaviour is genuinely and mutually agreed.
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para4"></a>Recognising the difficulties of the problem that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, seeks to deal with in her amendment, we believe that the right course is a clear age of consent. Not putting either the courts or <P>


<a name="column_1226"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1226</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>children in difficulties in certain circumstances is the best way to approach the matter. One then has in one's armoury the power to deal with it when there is a problem. If at the moment it is not proving to be a problem in practice, we do not want to cause other problems in relation to public protection.
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para5"></a>The second issue raised fairly and squarely by many noble Lords is what we are doing about those who are plainly guilty of abusive, criminal behaviour. Are we providing enough for them? I touched on that in answer to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, earlier. It is a complex issue. I repeat that it has not received the focus and the attention that it should. Young people and children who abuse are a diverse group. From the interventions made in this short debate it is plain that many noble Lords have greater experience than I, as many have recently visited somewhere that provides treatment for such people. We need to look at that; there needs to be a strategy. It is an area that has been neglected in the past.
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para6"></a>We have taken some steps to address the problem. We are funding a dangerous and severe personality disorder study to look at the characteristics of children and young people who commit sexual offences. The National Probation Directorate funded a two-year pilot project developing assessment and treatment tools. The Youth Justice Board has issued effective practice guidance and is evaluating the effectiveness of an initial assessment tool for practitioners; and together with the National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers and the NSPCC, the Youth Justice Board is funding a national research project that is mapping the nationwide availability of services for young people who sexually abuse.
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para7"></a>As I have indicated, the Home Office and the Youth Justice Board have set up an interdepartmental working group with the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills to look at the whole issue of young people who sexually abuse. I accept that a strategy is required. The group will report to Ministers later this year. I openly indicated that the strategy will depend in part on resources and, in their turn, resources will depend on the result of the spending review in 2004. I recognise the problems, I have said that officials are looking at them and I have explained that more needs to be done, but I cannot give any assurances as to what may be done.
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para8"></a>A theme that came through many of the speeches was that as early as possible we should identify children who are at risk of becoming inappropriately sexually active as sexual abusers and at risk of being abused themselves. I thoroughly and wholeheartedly agree. It is not simply a matter of identifying children but of having an effective process by which intervention can take place. Those who are involved know full well that the interventions required will not be just the social services or just health or just the criminal law or just the Connexion service. We need to make all the agencies work together and focus on the individual to achieve the best result for him or her and for society. We need to consider ways whereby <P>


<a name="column_1227"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1227</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>someone is responsible for ensuring that all agencies are brought to bear for individual children at risk, whether victims or offenders.
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para9"></a>The Children at Risk Green Paper is due to be published in May. It focuses on three key outcomes: maximising the potential disadvantage to children in terms of educational achievement, employability, life skills and mental, sexual and physical health; preventing children from becoming victims of crime, abuse and neglect; and reducing offending by children and young people. The group about which we are talking is a small group within that wider group. The Children at Risk Green Paper will seek to address all those issues.
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para10"></a>That is our answer in policy terms to the second range of issues posed. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said twice, in the most hurtful way imaginable, that the Bill is too insensitive to deal with the problems. She is right in the sense that the Bill does not seek to embark upon the problems. It seeks to provide a framework of criminal law that is able to deal with the most serious cases, providing protection for victims. That means that high maximum sentences have to be available and that the process by which a crime is made out does not involve great difficulties of brief. There are also the points that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, rightly made about secondary victimisation in court, where a child victim of another child abuser is forced to go through a prolonged cross-examination of precisely whether or not he or she did consent to the activity. I fear that would be the consequence of the amendment. I do not believe that the noble Baroness was asking me to defend all of all Clause 14 but was seeking a debate.
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para11"></a>Amendment No. 71 would place a statutory obligation on the Attorney-General to produce supplementary guidance specifically in relation to the prosecution of children under age 18. The code for Crown prosecutors and other CPS documents contain detailed guidance about the circumstances in which prosecution would be in the public interest. Those will be updated as a matter of standard practice following the Bill's enactment&#151;though the problems that current law raises, in terms of lots of activity that one would not remotely think of criminalising, are set out in the code.
<P>

<a name="30401-20_para12"></a>In those circumstances, the statutory obligation on the Attorney-General to produce the guidance envisaged in the amendment is not necessary. It is standard procedure for prosecution guidance to be updated whenever existing legislation is changed in any way. Once the Bill has been given Royal Assent, the guidance will be updated in respect of prosecuting not only children but all offenders.

I thought that my noble and learned friend had ignored my point and I was going to take it up with him privately. I am grateful to him for responding.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-21_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   Can the Minister give some indication of whether there can be more action now in terms of spreading best practice? He mentioned that the CPS assesses children who sexually abuse others. My reading of Manchester was that one quarter of the children prosecuted for sexually abusing other children did not receive an assessment. The good people of Manchester working in that area took the matter into their own hands and have introduced an assessment process over the past two years, which is widespread and has been well received. While we await the Comprehensive Spending Review and for the wheels of Government to turn, what can be done to spread best practice more widely?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I hope that I did not imply for one moment that nothing happened until then. The Youth Justice Board has issued effective practice guidance on young people who sexually abuse, which has been sent to youth offending teams and others to support consistency of assessment and work. In addition, the board is currently evaluating the effectiveness of an initial assessment tool for practitioners based on multi-agency working. A number of local areas are already using that model and as it develops, the YJB will decide how best to spread good practice. That does not meet all the noble Earl's points but he is right to say, "Do not wait&#151;do what you can."

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-21_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank all members of the Committee who took part in this useful debate about the way that damaged children are handled by the system. I am sure that noble Lords will continue to pursue that matter, though that is difficult in the context of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-21_para0"></a>The Minister rightly identified that consensual teenage sex was the subject of my amendment. There may be a distinction to be drawn between the age of consent that applies to sexual intercourse between children and a range of activities that parts of the Bill criminalise&#151;including looking at dirty magazines.
<P>

<a name="30401-21_para1"></a>I remain concerned that we are potentially criminalising certain acts. I referred on the first day of Committee to guidance for schoolchildren sponsored by the Department of Health, which teaches them about levels of intimacy&#151;something other than full intercourse&#151;and therefore encourages young children to experiment sexually other than by full sexual intercourse. I am sure that there are good public policy <P>


<a name="column_1229"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1229</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grounds for pursuing that approach. We have an environment in which we are encouraging children to participate in sexual activity of that nature. On the other hand, we are saying that it is potentially criminal. I will reflect on the Minister's comment that it will never be a problem in practice because such activities would never be prosecuted. I thank the noble and learned Lord for his comprehensive reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The amendments would provide that children and young persons convicted of such offences should be sentenced to detention rather than imprisonment. That technical change would be a total departure from the way in which all other criminal legislation is drafted. The appropriate punishment for children and young persons aged under 18 convicted of a criminal offence is governed by the provisions of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, which applies to all criminal offences. Section 89 of that Act provides that a person shall not be sentenced to a period of imprisonment if he is under 21 at the time of sentence; and Section 92 makes provision relating to the place in which he is to be detained.
<P>

<a name="30401-21_para6"></a>There is no reason to suppose that the provisions of that Act will not continue to operate effectively in relation to new sexual offences legislation and we do not want to include in the Bill any provisions that might be seen to cast doubt on the way in which the provisions of the Act should be applied.
<P>

<a name="30401-21_para7"></a>We have special measures in place to ensure that children and young persons who abuse are treated fairly by the criminal justice system. Although children and young people who commit sexual offences should clearly be held responsible for their abusive behaviour, we recognise that they are likely to have considerable needs themselves&#151;we have discussed that. Our aim is to achieve a co-ordinated approach on the part of youth justice, child welfare, education and health agencies. The lower maximum penalties for children who commit any of the child sex offences are part of that strategy.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-21_para12"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "SENTENCE REVIEW
<br>
 Where a young person under the age of 18 has been convicted of an offence under this Part, the Court or Youth Offending Panel shall review the sentence when the young person reaches the age of 18."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30401-21_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: Given all that has been said about the importance of treating young children differently from adults when dealing with sexual offences, it seems only right that when young people have been convicted and sentenced, the sentence or treatment should be reviewed when they reach adulthood. We hope that some treatment will have been made available to them, in whatever situation they find themselves after conviction. It would be good&#151;especially where such treatment has been lacking or unsatisfactory&#151;for the court to reconsider their case when they reach 18. An assessment could then be made of how well the young person has responded to treatment, what risk he now poses to society and whether his welfare and the safety of society would be better served by changing the arrangements for his treatment or custody.
<P>

<a name="30401-21_para14"></a>When a young person is in care, new arrangements are made for him when he turns 18. The same thing should happen to a young person serving any kind of sentence for a sexual offence. In Sweden, which I recently visited to view their arrangements for dealing with young offenders, all young people who have offended up to the age of 21 are deemed to be in the care of social services. Appropriate treatment and care is provided with humanity and professionalism. We can learn some lessons from that system.
<P>

<a name="30401-21_para15"></a>A young person who commits an offence at 14 may well be a different person when he grows to be 18. We should have arrangements in place to take account of that. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-21_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am baffled as to why there should be such sympathy for some of the cases that we are discussing. I do not know whether the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, can even imagine the nature of the offence that could elicit from the courts a sentence of, say, seven years. It would be extremely serious. The child could be aged 15 and a half when receiving that sentence. In awarding that sentence, the judges would <P>


<a name="column_1231"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1231</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have considered the age of the child and would certainly have given a great deal of consideration to the nature of the offence.
<P>

<a name="30401-21_para16"></a>Anyway, at about the halfway point of the sentence, it would be reviewed. For the concern of the noble Baroness for a review at 18 to be real, if the child were 13 or 14 when receiving such a sentence, the mind boggles at what sentence he would have been given still to be in prison at the age of 18. But if the child is aged 15 or so, which is much more likely, if he has committed something serious and is sentenced, the judicial system allows for proper review of sentences and, indeed, proper parole arrangements for those who can be released from prison.
<P>

<a name="30401-21_para17"></a>In my view, it should be left to that process. There should not be any special arrangements for someone who is 14 or 15 who receives a sentence in the courts in the full knowledge of the child's age and the nature of the offence. The amendment certainly does not receive my support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   It is even worse than that, is it not? The young offender may well be aged 17 and a half. Why on earth would one want to review a sentence that has been running for only six months?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-22_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   The amendment allows me the opportunity to raise a point that I should have raised earlier&#151;the Committee will tell me whether I am in order. That is the issue of registration on the sex offenders' register. Although young people aged under 18 who are registered may end up with only half the tariff of an adult sex offender&#151;so they would get seven years if the adult were to get 14 years&#151;there is concern that if a 14 year-old, say, were entered on the sex offenders' register for seven years, he may change a lot in two or three years. Children change at a faster rate than adults. It may then be appropriate to review his presence&#151;his enrolment&#151;on the sex offenders register.
<P>

<a name="30401-22_para0"></a>Will the Minister tell us whether consideration is being given to how the sex offenders' register is applied to children&#151;to the review of their registration, to how a child is placed on the register and to involvement of professional groups in advising on the appropriateness of including a child on the register?
<P>

<a name="30401-22_para1"></a>An especial concern of mine is that the use of the sex offenders' register may change in future and that it may become a much more public document. I also understand that it may be useful to have a child on the register&#151;because the child is dangerous or to make clear to the child that it has committed a serious offence for which it is being held responsible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   It may help the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, to know that we have tabled later amendments that specifically concern children and the sex offenders' register. He may welcome a debate on that issue when we reach those amendments.

<a name="column_1232"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1232</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lady Walmsley, for two reasons. First, all children in prison should be covered by the Children Act 1989 and be given the proper care and concern that children have under that Act. Secondly, when a case is reviewed, the programme of treatment that may or may not have been given is reviewed, as is the level of dangerousness. So that is not only for the welfare of the young person but for the protection of society. One may decide that the young person is so dangerous that other action needs to be taken before the young person is released back into society. So the provision is both ends on: it protects victims as well as the welfare of the young person.

<A NAME="30401-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, is right: if, as a very young person, one is sentenced for a very long period in prison for a sexual offence, it would be an incredibly serious offence. In considering the length of sentence, the court will have regard to the age of the defendant and the seriousness of the offence. That judgment must be made at the beginning. It would not be appropriate in relation to any offence for the sentence to be reviewed when the person reaches the age of 18, unless that is in accordance with the normal parole arrangements. It is important to have regard to society as a whole, but especially the victims and what they would feel about that. It is difficult to see justification for the amendment in relation to the long sentences.
<P>

<a name="30401-22_para2"></a>With regard to the shorter sentences, the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is right. It is inappropriate to sentence someone at, let us say, 17&#189; and then to have a review shortly thereafter. It would make the position of the sexual offender unique as regards a particular concession in sentencing. I believe that the right course is to leave the matter to sentencers. While understanding the reasons for the amendment, we cannot support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-22_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The Minister did not respond to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth. The amendment asks for the sentence to be reviewed, not for an assessment of the treatment given or the handling of the case. I agree with almost every noble Lord who has spoken: that someone sentenced to prison at the ages we are discussing should be subject to treatment and proper remedial programmes. However, the amendment seeks review of the sentence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-22_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I thank noble Lords who have both opposed and supported the amendment, and thank the Minister. Perhaps I may reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that in bringing forward the amendment I have no lack of sympathy for the victims; indeed, quite the opposite. I accept that the approach underlying my amendments relates to the offenders themselves because they are damaged young people whom society has failed. However, in treating them appropriately it is to be hoped that we shall prevent them from reoffending, thereby protecting other children. If those young offenders are released into society without treatment, other children may be abused by them. If we deal properly with the situation, there are children who will never suffer the anguish of <P>


<a name="column_1233"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1233</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sexual abuse. That is why I seek review at appropriate stages, appropriate treatment, expert assessment and all the other matters I have been arguing for.
<P>

<a name="30401-22_para3"></a>I see no reason why the age of 18 should not be significant. It is a significant age for children in care. For example, better treatment may have become available since the original sentence. I argue for special arrangements for these young offenders because of the special nature of the offences. In 99.9 per cent of cases, the offences are the result of mental and emotional problems brought about by years of neglect, abuse and violence against those young people. At the end of the case history, those of us who visited the centre to which I referred earlier asked, "Do you have any patients who have not been subjected to some of these terrible situations?" The answer was, "No. They may not manifest themselves when the young person comes to us but when we dig a little deeper we always find them".
<P>

<a name="30401-22_para4"></a>These are special, unfortunate young people who commit appalling offences; I am the first to accept that. I want to protect other young children from their predations. However, I ask the Committee to bear in mind that a review at 18, half-way through the sentence, or whenever the court thinks appropriate, will be a positive factor, moving things in the right direction. Research and treatment programmes are moving on all the time. If we can review periodically what is happening to these young people, there is a better chance that they will leave custody able to enter society with the absolute minimum of risk. That is what we all want. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30401-22_para6"></a>Clause 15 [Arranging or facilitating commission of a child sex offence]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton </B>   moved Amendment No. 73:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 6, line 19, leave out subsection (1) and insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-22_para7"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(1) A person commits an offence if&#151;
<br>
(a) he intentionally arranges or facilitates something that he intends to do, intends another person to do, or believes that another person will do, in any part of the world, and
<br>
(b) doing it will involve the commission of an offence under any of sections 9 to 14."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30401-22_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to make clear that the offence of "arranging or facilitating commission of a child sex offence" can consist of arranging or facilitating child sex either for oneself or for others. The amendment also makes clear that the offence applies wherever in the world the sex is intended to take place. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-22_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Brennan: </B>   I welcome the amendment introduced by the Government, first, because it deals with a most serious international problem affecting children, especially those in the poorest countries. I declare a connection with the organisation in this country, Consortium for Street Children; and with Anti-slavery, an NGO which has a particular interest in protecting <P>


<a name="column_1234"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1234</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>children in those poor countries from sexual exploitation by those deviants in the developed world who go to those countries to take advantage of children and in doing so commit offences ranging between those set out in Clause 9 up to that in Clause 14. That is a commendable objective.
<P>

<a name="30401-22_para9"></a>Secondly, although the clause refers to anywhere in the world, it embraces equally the commission of the offence in this country. Anyone who has served on the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, as I and others have, will readily confirm that organised paedophilia, nationally and internationally, is a major source of damage to children here and abroad. I commend the Government's amendment.
<P>

<a name="30401-22_para10"></a>I note that it is to be associated with two related courses of action that I understand the Government are presently considering. The clause attacks the organisers but the offenders directly involved would be sex offenders if convicted. And the Register of Sex Offenders, I understand, is subject to review as to how long a trip abroad can be undertaken by a sex offender, within which time he is required to give notice of the trip abroad to the local police in this country. At the moment, because of regulations passed in 2001, a foreign trip of eight days or more qualifies for the giving of notice. If the Government's intention is carried through, I understand that that period is to be reduced to three days, which makes it effectively impossible to get to the countries in question.
<P>

<a name="30401-22_para11"></a>What is the consequence of that for sex offenders? It curtails their activities abroad. That fits in with Clause 15 and the people organising those trips. If we add to that another intended government action&#151;that the sex offenders' register will embrace in future the commission of offences abroad, not just in this country&#151;the register will be effective for crimes committed anywhere against children; the timescale will be short; and Clause 15, coupled with that, will give much greater protection to children than we have been able to give in the past.
<P>

<a name="30401-22_para12"></a>I close my welcome to the clause with one comment. It is to be noted in Clause 15 that the penalty on indictment for the commission of the organising of paedophilia is up to 14 years' imprisonment. I confidently expect the courts to impose draconian sentences against the organisers of this kind of national or international paedophilia, against which offences this clause is commendably directed.

<A NAME="30401-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   There is very little for me to say in reply. However, I should like to confirm the two points made by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan. We are consulting on shortening the period from eight days to three days. We are also very urgently reviewing the issue of offences committed abroad and their applicability to the sex offences register.
<P>

<a name="30401-23_para0"></a>I am most grateful to the noble Lord for his support. As he said, this amendment will sharpen up the clause in the way that he outlined. I commend the amendment to the Committee.

"(1A) A person does not commit an offence under this section if&#151;
<br>
(a) he arranges or facilitates something that he believes another person will do, but that he does not intend to do or intend another person to do, and
<br>
(b) any offence within subsection (1)(b) would be an offence against a child for whose protection he acts.
<br>
(1B) For the purposes of subsection (1A), a person acts for the protection of a child if he acts for the purpose of&#151;
<br>
(a) protecting the child from sexually transmitted infection,
<br>
(b) protecting the physical safety of the child, or
<br>
(c) preventing the child from becoming pregnant,
<br>
and not for the purpose of causing or encouraging the activity constituting the offence within subsection (1)(b) or the child's participation in it."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30401-23_para3"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: Many of the offences in the Bill are designed to protect children from those who seek to abuse and exploit them. We have no wish to interfere with the work of those who seek to protect young people from pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. Under existing law, we believe that such people will not be viewed as aiding and abetting a criminal offence while working within professional or agreed policy guidelines.
<P>

<a name="30401-23_para4"></a>It was firmly established by the House of Lords in the case of Gillick in 1986 that a doctor exercising his bona fide judgment about what he honestly believes to be in the best interests of his patient would not be criminally liable if he prescribed contraceptives for a girl under 16 years of age. That judgment would provide a defence to anyone who was acting within the guidelines it establishes, known as the Fraser guidelines, and giving legitimate contraceptive or sexual health advice to a young person under the age of 16. This will apply to doctors, other health professionals, and anyone exercising his or her bona fide judgment within the Fraser guidelines to provide legitimate contraceptive and sexual health advice and treatment.
<P>

<a name="30401-23_para5"></a>I listened very carefully to the significant number of people who have made representations to me in recent weeks about the concerns that still exist, and the fear that people will be deterred from providing advice and treatment to children under 16. I am sympathetic to those concerns. We have come to the view that the matter needs to be settled by clear statutory provision.
<P>

<a name="30401-23_para6"></a>A statutory exception needs to provide protection from prosecution for the offences of aiding, abetting, or counselling, the offences that cover sexual activity with children&#151;the child sex offences, the familial child sex offences, the abuse of trust offences, the offences relating to those with a mental disorder or learning disability who are children, and the specific offences relating to sexual activity with children aged under 13. The exception also needs to cover the offence of arranging or facilitating child sex.
<P>

<a name="30401-23_para7"></a>I am of the firm opinion that we need to draw the exception more widely than the Gillick case, to provide protection for people other than doctors and health professionals who should be able to act in the best <P>


<a name="column_1236"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1236</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interests of a child without fearing prosecution&#151;for example, parents, teachers and voluntary youth workers.
<P>

<a name="30401-23_para8"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 74 and 375 will make it absolutely clear, in statute, that those who act with the purpose of protecting a child from sexually transmitted infection, protecting the physical safety of a child, or preventing a child from becoming pregnant, are not liable to prosecution so long as they do not act to cause or encourage the sexual activity to take place. I believe that the provisions we are making provide effective protection for those who are genuinely acting in the best interests of a child, but they do not protect anyone whose actual purpose is to bring about the commission of the child sex offence.
<P>

<a name="30401-23_para9"></a>I am most grateful to the noble Baronesses, Lady Noakes and Lady Walmsley, and to the noble Lords, Lord Astor of Hever, and Lord Thomas of Gresford, for tabling Amendments Nos. 75, 459 and 78. These amendments would introduce an exception to the offence at Clause 15 of arranging or facilitating a child sex offence, and to the making of a risk of sexual harm order, where someone is involved in the provision of sex education, sexual health advice, or contraceptive services for a child under 16. However, I cannot accept the amendments as they stand. As I explained, they are not drawn widely enough to provide the protection from prosecution that is sought in relation to the offences in Part 1 of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-23_para10"></a>The risk of sexual harm orders will be made only where a person has actually, on at least two occasions, carried out one of the acts listed in Clause 110(3) and there is reasonable cause to believe that it is necessary for such an order to be made for the purpose of protecting children. In view of these criteria, I cannot see how someone who was acting in the best interests of the child could ever be the subject of one of these orders. Therefore, I consider it unnecessary for the exception in this context. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for introducing his amendments. As he said, they respond to a number of concerns expressed to him regarding those involved in sex education, the provision of sexual health advice, and contraceptive services. Had the Bill remained as originally drafted, there would have been a danger that those who have never accepted the Gillick judgment could have used this Bill to make life difficult for those providing advice to young people.
<P>

<a name="30401-23_para11"></a>Several questions arise as a result of the Minister's amendments. Can the noble and learned Lord clarify the position of a person providing sex education or information to a child who then goes on to commit an offence under the provisions of Clauses 9 to 14? Further, does the provision of sex education always fall within the "protection of the child"? If it does not, can the Minister tell us what would not be included? In all the circumstances, I am unsure whether sex education or information would fall within the terms of protection from sexually transmitted infections, protecting physical safety, and the prevention of pregnancy provisions. We need to be absolutely clear that matters covered by sex education would fall <P>


<a name="column_1237"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1237</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>within that category. If the Minister's response to that is positive, my much more modest Amendment No. 75 will be superseded.
<P>

<a name="30401-23_para12"></a>I heard what the Minister said in respect of Amendment No. 459, which relates to sexual harm orders. I toyed with degrouping this amendment in order to discuss it later tonight, but I have allowed it to be dealt with now in the interests of speeding up the proceedings. I understood the Minister to say that it would be unlikely that a risk of sexual harm order would be taken against such a person. However, the provision of sex education and contraceptive advice would fall within paragraphs (c) or (d) of Clause 110(3). We would not want the people who provide such advice to fall unwittingly within the basic criteria, which could trigger an application for a risk of sexual harm order. That is the reasoning behind the tabling of this amendment. I look forward to the Minister's response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-23_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I very much welcome the Government's amendments, which I believe move us in the right direction. However, my worry is that they may be a little overcomplicated in that they are too prescriptive. I fear that they may trap someone who, with the best of intentions, may be advising a young person, say, about the emotional side of sexual relations, which is not listed in the purposes specified in Amendment No. 375.
<P>

<a name="30401-23_para13"></a>My amendment would protect not only teachers and health professionals but also bona fide non-professionals, and workers employed by agencies such as the Brook Centres, which provide sexual health advice and distribute condoms to young people. Such people have expressed considerable concern about whether they would be trapped by the provisions of the Bill while going about their bona fide work. Although they are not health professionals, they provide a valuable service, supervised by professionals working for a competent and well-regarded organisation. Can the Minister reassure both myself and those agencies that, under his amendment, they would not be liable for prosecution if they continue with their valuable work in the best interests of young people?
<P>

<a name="30401-23_para14"></a>Increasingly, in order to reach out to those young people most at risk of unwanted pregnancy, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, agencies such as Brook and the FPA have to take part in outreach programmes, meeting youngsters in their home environment&#151;such as clubs, community and youth groups, and even on the streets. Young people working in their own communities are often the most acceptable to the young in providing such services. It would be a tragedy if such work had to be curtailed. Perhaps the Minister can reassure me and people from agencies like the Brook Centres.

<A NAME="30401-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Amendments tabled by all Members of the Committee are certainly well intentioned. Indeed, it is not my intention to knock them. However, I believe that these amendments would create a paedophile's charter; and I say so with some feeling. Perhaps I may explain why. Many have <P>


<a name="column_1238"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1238</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>supported the Bill because it will achieve a great deal as regards protecting children from sexual abuse&#151;an objective that we all applaud. However, I seem to be on my own in the Chamber in seeing protection for children as being absolutely paramount. It is disappointing that the Government are seeking to amend their own Bill in a way which will reduce that protection.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para0"></a>I understand the motives of the Government and others, including my noble friend Lady Noakes, in proposing amendments relating to sex education. They want to protect those people who are honestly working with young people and doing a job that we all applaud&#151;a job that, sometimes, parents will not do. But this is a totally catch-all set of amendments.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para1"></a>Government Amendment No. 74 gives a blanket exemption from Clause 15 if a person can make a case that he was protecting the child from sexually transmitted infection, protecting the physical safety of the child or preventing the child becoming pregnant. That becomes a total defence. Anyone can say, "That is what I was doing". They do not have to be a professional, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said. Anyone can say, "I was dealing with a sexual difficulty", or, "I was dealing with sex education in some way".
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para2"></a>Therefore, an act that was clearly facilitating the Clause 13 offence of causing a child to watch a sexual act could escape prosecution if the perpetrator claimed to be protecting the child. He could be facilitating an adult who acts on the words of Clause 13,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-24_para3"></a>
and causing a child,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to watch a third person engaging in an activity, or to look at a photograph . . .  of a person engaging in an activity",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-24_para4"></a>
that is sexual.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para5"></a>It is extraordinary that the Government should be trying to create such a broad exception. There is no requirement that the person be a doctor or a nurse. The defence is effectively available to anyone who claims that he or she is giving sex education or giving advice on contraception or sexual health. It even covers facilitating actual sexual activity between an adult and a child, under Clause 9, or facilitating a person who engages in sexual activity in the presence of a child, under Clause 12. The mind boggles at that.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para6"></a>What kind of sex education necessitates facilitating sexual activity in the presence of a child? What kind of sex videos are to be shown to young people which require special exemption from prosecution? It would not matter how pornographic the video was. Clause 15 gives a blanket exemption to the person who allows someone to show a video to a child so long as the person can make out a case that he or she acted to promote safer sex under Clause 15(1B)(a) and (c).
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para7"></a>The Government appear to have drafted the amendment to give an exemption to a person of any age, including those under the age of 18. Therefore, why is it necessary for children to have this special exemption from Clauses 8 to 14 for the purposes of sex education?
<P>


<a name="column_1239"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1239</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para8"></a>Amendment No. 75 stands in the name of my noble friend Lady Noakes. It has a similar goal. It seeks to amend Clause 15 to state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nothing done only for the purposes of providing sex education, sexual health advice or contraceptive services shall be treated as an offence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-24_para9"></a>
Anyone saying that that is what they were doing has a defence for all kinds of dreadful activities that we have been describing today. That very broad wording would exempt even more behaviour from the ambit of Clause 15. A defendant need claim only that sex education was his "purpose" in order to escape conviction. That is an even easier test than that in government Amendment No. 74.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para10"></a>Amendment No. 78 stands in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. It is less broad, but still it would present a potential defence to a paedophile who gets a sexual thrill from talking to children about sex or showing them books or photographs on the subject.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness for giving way. Why can doing something in the child's best interests be a paedophile offence?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Because that is what the person could claim to be doing. I have some examples which I shall turn to in a minute. A person befriending the family or befriending the young person could say to the parents, "Your child is sexually confused. You allow me to work with your child and I will help them with their sexual confusion". Their motive could be completely dishonourable but they would have a defence, in law, because of the way in which these amendments would work.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para11"></a>Of course, no one wants to see an adult who acts in the genuine best interests of a child&#151;the point just made by the noble Baroness&#151;convicted of a child sex offence with all that that entails. Any professional teacher taking a sex education lesson would never need any immunity from prosecution, such as that offered by the amendment. No sensible court would entertain such a case, let alone convict.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para12"></a>I ask myself: why would any professional person want to facilitate activity in front of a child which is so sexually explicit that for any ordinary person it would constitute a criminal offence? Surely, questions must be asked about whether such an activity is appropriate in the first place.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para13"></a>Those who believe that legitimate sex education is in danger of becoming criminalised by Clause 15 have fears and concerns which are unfounded. I simply cannot imagine that the police would entertain a case against a respectable professional acting in the normal course of his employment. I certainly cannot imagine a court convicting such a person. I should like to think that some action could be taken against the Marie Stopes clinic which is inviting young people to contact it on the Internet to receive free condoms&#151;at the age of 11, 12 and 13. That is inappropriate and even <P>


<a name="column_1240"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1240</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parents are not in a position to control that kind of offence. But the clinic would have complete exemption under these amendments.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para14"></a>If this special exemption from sexual offences is granted, paedophiles will exploit it as a loophole. We all know that they infiltrate scout and youth groups and work with children with disabilities. They are the most clever, manipulative people. These provisions, allowing them to say that they were helping a person with their sexual health or their sexual education or helping them through the difficult pubescent years, would hand them a defence on a plate.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para15"></a>Paedophiles commonly seek to get themselves into positions where they are responsible for young people. A paedophile who gets a thrill from talking about sex to young people could rely on the defence provided by these amendments. It is well known that paedophiles seek to break down the resistance of young people by talking about sexual activity or by facilitating someone who shows them pornographic images. It is known that paedophiles seek to put themselves in positions of responsibility over young people. This amendment provides a strong incentive for a paedophile to take up employment in the field of sex education.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para16"></a>Of course, there are checks on those who take up positions with young people. But those checks are completely useless if the paedophile's activities are undiscovered. In many cases, they go undiscovered for a very long time. At the primary school that my children attended, one young girl was abused over a very long period because the teachers were afraid to say anything. When the parents came together and the local policeman went into the school and confronted the headmaster, it was discovered that a young girl had been taken into the stock cupboard over a period. The defendant received only a fine. The defendant was the headmaster. When he went to court, his defence was that the child needed support because the child was having difficulties at home. That example is not exactly the same and that person would not be caught by these amendments. But the defendant need only say that he was helping the child with her sex education and that would be a defence.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para17"></a>The government amendment removes the protection of the criminal law from young people. Parents have a right to know why this is thought to be necessary. If such exemption was ever needed, surely it could be justified only for a qualified medical professional, such as a doctor. Under the amendment, a paedophile who worked as a teacher could satisfy the condition in subsection (1A) by saying, "I would much rather the children in my class didn't have sex with anyone. But, since you can't stop them, I just try to make sure that, whatever they do, they do it safely. That is why I talk so explicitly about sex. I tell them to be careful. What more can you do?"
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para18"></a>Teachers have never needed special exemptions from sex offences with children. To suggest that this is necessary calls into question the very activities which are proposed. Sex education carried out by professional people does not need to be exempt from a charge of arranging or facilitating a child sex offence. The <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>amendment is unnecessary and an insult to the professionalism of those who work with young people and the good sense of the police, the prosecutors and the courts.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para19"></a>Government Amendment No. 375 relates to aiding, abetting and counselling the commission of sexual offences against children. It uses the same formulation to do with protecting the child from sexually transmitted infections, physical harm or pregnancy.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para20"></a>The same convoluted form of words is used in Amendment No. 74, which states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"he arranges or facilitates something that he believes another person will do, but that he does not intend to do or intend another person to do".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-24_para21"></a>
As long as the defendant can say that he did what he did because "children will have sex whether we like it or not" and that he was acting to provide sex education, the amendment provides a defence.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para22"></a>It applies to the non-consensual offences: the rape of a child under 13 in Clause 2; the assault of a child under 13 by penetration in Clause 4; the sexual assault of a child under 13 in Clause 6. It applies also to Clause 9, sexual activity with a child; and, where the victim is under 16, to Clause 18, abuse of a position of trust. It also applies to Clause 28, familial child sex; to Clause 33, sexual activity with a person with a mental disorder or learning disability; and to other offences.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para23"></a>It is astonishing that anything which genuinely amounts to aiding and abetting such offences should escape prosecution. Once again, what kind of sex education is envisaged? It depresses me that I am the only person speaking up for children in this area because it is where entrapment and activities of this kind can take place.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para24"></a>For the benefit of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, I shall quickly name some people. A trainee church minister was gaoled for 12 months. The man's name was Gregory&#151;so it is in the public domain anyway&#151;and the court heard that his duties as a trainee minister at Kings Heath Baptist Church, Northampton, included giving a course of sex education lessons to a youth fellowship entitled Faith and Sexuality&#151; Let It Be Real. That case ended up in the courts. Under the amendment the offender would have a defence because he was dealing with the sex education of young people.
<P>

<a name="30401-24_para25"></a>I could go on but I have spoken for long enough. If the Committee requires further examples, I have cutting after cutting after cutting in which people profess to be dealing with sex education, sexual confusion, the sexual problems of young teenagers&#151;all of whom, under the amendment, would have a defence. It is outrageous that we should hand such a defence to people who are genuinely looking to obtain self-gratification from our young people.

<A NAME="30401-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   I shall not attempt to reply to the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, except to say that all of us who support the Bill, and who are considering it in great detail, are looking to the care, protection and support of children. It must be clearly understood that that is our aim. That is why we are working so hard on the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_1242"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1242</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para0"></a>I should also say to the noble Baroness that all that Amendment No. 74 seeks to do is to create the situation that already exists. Rather than believing that the amendment is an insult, the organisations concerned asked for it to be tabled to enable them to continue the valuable work they currently do to help and protect young children. I do not believe that they will feel even a little insulted by the amendment; rather the reverse.
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para1"></a>I declare an interest, again, as president of the FPA. Unlike the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, I welcome the amendment. The Minister has listened to the concerns of the organisations that provide contraceptive and sexual health advice and education to young people and has introduced this statutory provision. It was very clear that neither the Gillick case nor the Fraser guidelines were sufficient to provide those organisations with the protection and support they needed to be able to continue their important work.
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para2"></a>I should say to the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that there is an urgent and continuing need for realistic education to reduce teenage pregnancy and to avoid the spread of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases among young teens. Not to have the organisations doing this work would ensure that all those problems occur in excess. We are trying to prevent that happening. I am sure that the noble Baroness would not wish that to happen.
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para3"></a>My understanding of Amendment No. 74 is that it is designed to protect adults who seek to arrange or facilitate something for children who they know will engage in underage sex and who might otherwise be guilty of an offence. It gives them protection against prosecution in two ways. First, although they know that sex is likely to occur, they do not intend to take any action to cause or encourage that sex; and, secondly, the purpose of their actions is to protect children from sexually transmitted diseases, to ensure their physical safety or to prevent them from becoming pregnant.
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para4"></a>I make these points because, while the first defence is fine, the second is a little narrow. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, made the point about a child's emotional health and wellbeing. There is nothing in the list of provisions which covers that issue. We all know that when young people come to these organisations for help, they have problems with large emotional and social components. The organisations need to be able to deal with those problems and one worries that the clause is not wide enough to enable them to help the physical and emotional health of the child.
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para5"></a>I do not understand whether the words "arranges" and "facilitates" cover also the giving of advice and information as suggested in the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, Amendment No. 78. It has been suggested to me that the words do not cover talking to a child and that it may be possible for a litigious group or parent to use the omission to sue a well-intentioned adult who had simply talked to a child about that child's problems in regard to underage sexual relationships but had not given him or her any other advice. Do the words <P>


<a name="column_1243"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1243</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>"facilitates" and "arranges" cover the question of a professional or someone from any of the organisations which provide support having a chat with a child? I am sure that the organisations would like an assurance that there are no loopholes in the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   We cannot all wax as lyrical as my noble friend Lady Blatch but we can all&#151;and have done so throughout the day&#151;condemn paedophilia. To say that the government amendment&#151;or, to an extent, the amendment of my noble friend Lady Noakes&#151;is a licence to promote paedophilia is not how I and the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, have read the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para6"></a>I take great comfort in the words at the end,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and not for the purpose of causing or encouraging the activity constituting the offence within subsection (1)(b) or the child's participation in it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-25_para7"></a>
That covers the issue raised by my noble friend about the churchman and his particularly disgusting form of sex education.
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para8"></a>As regards sex education, I am not sure whether the Government's amendment covers the issue of teachers in a classroom. The amendment of my noble friend Lady Noakes mentions it, as does the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. Proposed new sub-section (1A)(a) may cover the point but I should like to see it made much more obvious in the amendment. If the noble and learned Lord will consider adding something to the amendment to deal with the issue of properly constituted sex education by teachers, we would all go home very happily indeed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I should like to ask a simple question. As currently set out, will the amendment cover Childline volunteers? I declare an interest as the former chief executive of Childline. Volunteers answer numerous questions about sex and sex education put to them by young people. Indeed, a high percentage of the work of Childline is devoted to responding to young people with such concerns.
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para9"></a>I should say that many of those concerns result in paedophiles being identified and caught, because young people are prepared to talk openly about those issues with Childline volunteers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-25_spnew3"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Guildford: </B>   I, too, wish to put a question to the Minister. Having put the first part of the new subsection into an international context, does the second part apply to those working for international aid and development agencies in other parts of the world? Will it affect workers from agencies based in this country who may be working with child prostitutes, offering education to children with HIV/AIDS or working with street children? Will the clause extend by implication, through the changes already made, to aid and development agencies and their workers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-25_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   Perhaps I may reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that she is not alone in speaking up for children. I believe that all noble Lords in the Chamber are speaking up for children.
<P>


<a name="column_1244"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1244</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para10"></a>I would not want to provide a paedophile's charter, but I believe that any child's best defence against paedophiles is a good quality sex education. If children understand the issues surrounding sex, if they are confident in themselves and in their own understanding and develop a good relationship with their parents or professional advisers about these matters, they are much more likely to be able to come forward and speak to a responsible adult, should they be approached by someone with harm in mind. Knowledge is a child's best defence and that is why good quality sex education is so vitally important, and the people who offer that education need to be protected.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I shall deal with the questions that have been raised. First, I turn to the question put by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, about sex education. Where a person provides sex education to a group, we do not consider that he would normally commit an offence of aiding and abetting child sex. That is because to aid and abet, which is what the provisions seek to deal with, a person needs to have a certain amount of knowledge about the offence that is to be committed. While that may arise where, for example, a child tells his doctor that he is planning to have sex with his under-age girlfriend and asks for contraception, it is difficult to see how it could arise in the context of group education.
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para11"></a>If, however, the teacher gives one-to-one advice to a pupil about sex matters, then it is possible that he would commit an offence of aiding and abetting. If so, the exception would apply to him if he had given advice in regard to one of the three permitted purposes and did not intend to cause or encourage under-age sex, but not otherwise. So he would be protected if the one-to-one advice concerned how to prevent pregnancy, but not if it concerned how to have enjoyable sex. That seems to be the correct place to draw the line.
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para12"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked whether physical safety is too limited; what of emotional and psychiatric needs. She asked me whether I would consider that. My noble friend Lady Gould of Potternewton mentioned the same point. I shall think about it.
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para13"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, was kind enough to describe these measures as "well-intentioned". She also said that she was the only person in the Chamber who was speaking up for child protection. In my own case, I do not agree with that. Like all noble Lords in the Chamber, we are seeking to deal as best we can with child protection. It may be, therefore, that certain noble Lords who have been deeply involved in child protection matters during their lives may not have been that impressed by the noble Baroness in her comment that they were not concerned about child protection.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-25_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I think that I have said on a number of occasions during our debates today that I believe that, in that sense, all noble Lords are very concerned about children. However, I said that it was rather depressing to note that I would probably end up <P>


<a name="column_1245"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1245</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the only noble Lord concerned about the kind of person who thinks that if an educational context could be used as a defence in law, then becoming a part-time teacher in a school&#151;with no protection under the abuse of trust clauses in the Bill&#151;or working in the Scout movement will provide such people with a defence that they were simply concerned about the sexual education or sexual confusion of a child. That can be used as a defence to justify activities such as showing videos and engaging in other acts set out in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-25_para14"></a>I do not refer to all those bona fide teachers and so forth who are doing a good job in ways that have been described and praised by many noble Lords, but once such a defence is enshrined in law, then many people will regard this as a serious loophole. It will provide a way of allowing them to seek all the unpleasant gratification they want from their activities, but they will have to hand a defence that has been put on the statute book by the Government themselves.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I understand the point being made by the noble Baroness. The part I misunderstood was that I thought she had said that she was the only person in the Chamber speaking up for child protection. I am very glad to learn that I did misunderstand her. However, noble Lords on the Benches behind me are commenting that the noble Baroness did use those words. However, I understand that the noble Baroness is now making it absolutely clear that she said no such thing. I accept that without reservation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   If I did say something like that, then I said it unwittingly and I apologise unreservedly for doing so. What I meant to say was that, in the context of these amendments, I would probably be the only noble Lord to speak against them in the interests of the protection of children. It seems that that is in fact the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I shall respond to the specific points made by the noble Baroness. She described the amendments as a "paedophile's charter". As various noble Lords have pointed out, the amendment states that no defence of any kind is provided where the acts involved are,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"not for the purpose of causing or encouraging the activity constituting the offence within subsection (1)(b)",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-26_para0"></a>
or similar ones in the other offences to which it refers.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para1"></a>I was not able to understand the examples cited by the noble Baroness. She referred first to the headmaster of the school which her children attended. He took someone into the stock cupboard. It is inconceivable that this provision could possibly provide a defence against such an act. Furthermore, I should be interested to hear the details about Mr Gregory, to whom she referred, and how the amendments could possibly provide any form of defence. Before this Bill, those acts would not even have constituted a criminal offence. Simply to speak <P>


<a name="column_1246"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1246</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on certain subjects to ordinands would not have been an offence; therefore something more must have taken place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-26_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   As I recall, the cases quoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, all resulted in prosecutions and everyone concerned was found guilty. Therefore the common sense of the courts was clearly demonstrated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-26_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The point I sought to make was that if these amendments are included in the Bill, then such people would have a defence against such a prosecution. In the Gregory case, he claimed that he was conducting sex education with a group of young people, but it turned out that his intentions were malign.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para2"></a>As the Bill was originally drafted, it was very protective of children, but the amendments will give that kind of person a defence and a person like Gregory would probably not have been prosecuted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Although not at this moment, I should like to learn the details of what happened in the Gregory case. However, I am not persuaded that the headmaster in the stock cupboard, one of the examples cited by the noble Baroness, would even remotely have a defence as a result of these provisions.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para3"></a>We considered the issues very carefully before the amendments were brought forward. We asked whether the provision would provide too much or, indeed, any defence for people with malign intentions. After careful thought, we concluded that it would not do so. That is why I think that the example cited of the headmaster is not persuasive so far. However, I would be anxious to hear from the noble Baroness about any other examples. As I have said, we have considered this matter with great care. We are just as concerned as the noble Baroness to ensure that children are protected from paedophiles and we do not believe that these provisions would have the consequences that she fears. However, we shall be more than willing to consider any further examples that she may cite.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para4"></a>I am grateful for the support of my noble friend Lady Gould. She pointed out that professional organisations wanted the Government to bring forward amendments of this kind. Child protection involves protecting children against the acts of paedophiles, but it also involves offering protection against physical harm through sex, from the activities of familial abuse, from early pregnancy and from sexually transmitted diseases.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para5"></a>My noble friend also asked the same question put to me by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley; that is, would the abuse include talking? Yes, it would do so. I draw my noble friend's attention to government Amendment No. 375, which makes the position clear. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked how education would be affected. I believe that I answered those points in my response to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, asked whether the provision would cover volunteers <P>


<a name="column_1247"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1247</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>working with Childline. Obviously, so long as the volunteers were acting in bona fide pursuance of the three aims&#151;physical harm, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases&#151;then of course the provision would apply. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford asked whether it would apply to those agencies assisting with the foreign element. If and in so far as it would be a criminal offence otherwise, then the provision would apply.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para6"></a>Finally, the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, was not alone in speaking up for children, and I entirely agree.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para7"></a>I hope that in the light of those explanations, the House will feel able to agree to the amendments.

<a name="30401-26_para18"></a>As noble Lords know, the Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, which introduced measures to minimise the opportunity for fraud while protecting the right of individuals to exercise their franchise, has already been subject to extensive consultation and debate involving the House, the Northern Ireland political parties, the Northern Ireland electoral office, the Electoral Commission and the electorate. These regulations, which follow on <P>


<a name="column_1248"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1248</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from the Act, introduce the electoral identity card&#151;a matter of great significance to this House&#151;into use for parliamentary and Assembly elections in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para19"></a>The regulations are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and are being made in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 201(1) and (3) and rule 37 (1F) of Schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983. Specifically, these regulations amend paragraph 1E of rule 37 of the parliamentary elections rules set out in Schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para20"></a>The purpose of the amendments is to remove all non-photographic forms of identity documents from the list of specified documents set out in paragraph 1E of the parliamentary election rules. Rule 37 (1A) stipulates that a ballot paper shall not be handed to a potential voter unless he or she has produced one of the specified documents to the presiding officer or clerk.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para21"></a>I take this opportunity to remind noble Lords of the four specified documents. They are: an EU member state passport for Assembly or local elections; a Great Britain or Northern Ireland photographic driving licence; a Senior SmartPass, issued under the Northern Ireland concessionary fares scheme; and, of course, the electoral identity card. For parliamentary elections, a UK/Irish passport is also required.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para22"></a>The Government are aware that some concerns have been raised recently by those who consider that we should wait until after the forthcoming Assembly election before enacting this measure. They believe that removing non-photographic identification at this time risks disenfranchising a large number of eligible voters. They cite the relatively small uptake for the electoral identity card. There have been 57,000 applications, whereas 235,000 people indicated on their electoral registration form that they required the card.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para23"></a>I should say straight away that the Government have no intention of taking away people's democratic right to vote. If we believed that thousands of voters would not be able to vote because of this measure, we would not be introducing it at this time. However, it is of course right that, as the Government, we should do everything in our power to ensure that anyone who requires a card receives it in time.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para24"></a>For that reason, the Secretary of State met last week with the Chief Electoral Officer and the Electoral Commission to agree a co-ordinated strategy to ensure that those who need the card have every opportunity to get one. As a result of that meeting, we are putting in place a number of measures which we believe should increase confidence in the card. Not only will it help those who need the card to get one, it should also inform us why a large number of people who indicated that they needed a card have not subsequently applied for one. The measures include writing to those who originally expressed an interest in the card but who have not applied or presented a complete application for one. This number is estimated at <P>


<a name="column_1249"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1249</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>180,000 people. A new application form will be sent to all these people in good time for them to be able to have a card, should they wish, in time for the election.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para25"></a>The Electoral Commission will conduct research with a representative sample of the Northern Ireland population to determine if they ticked the box on the registration form requesting an application form for an electoral ID card. If they requested a form but did not subsequently apply for a card, they will be asked why they did not apply and if they have other eligible ID.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para26"></a>Another measure will be to take the mobile application centres into other areas where people gather, such as shopping centres and supermarkets. Targeted publicity will tell eligible voters that they require photo ID to vote, and how to get it.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para27"></a>The political parties have, of course, a role to play, and I would like to use this opportunity to ask them to join me in playing an active and positive role in raising awareness of the card and of photo-identity in general.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para28"></a>People still have seven weeks to apply for a card. The Chief Electoral Officer has guaranteed that all correct applications received by 16th May will be processed in time for the Assembly election. People can apply by post or in person at a number of mobile application centres.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para29"></a>In conclusion, I hope that noble Lords recognise the importance of these changes in improving confidence in the electoral system in Northern Ireland and tackling abuse at the polling station.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para30"></a>I wish to speak also to the Local Elections (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Order 2003. The local elections order does not have an SI number. The Privy Council cancelled its April meeting and as a result we had to relay the order yesterday morning due to the commencement date on the original order now being wrong. The draft order was reconsidered by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments this morning. Copies of its report are now available in the Printed Paper Office. The committee found the order satisfactory. The order is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and is being made in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 84(1) and (3) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para31"></a>I shall try not to repeat myself as the order mirrors the regulations to which I have just referred. The order applies to local elections in Northern Ireland and specifically amends paragraph 6 of rule 34 (voting procedure) of the local elections rules in Schedule 5 to the Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1962, as substituted by Schedule 1 to the Local Elections (Northern Ireland) Order 1985. The next local elections in Northern Ireland are scheduled for May 2005.
<P>

<a name="30401-26_para32"></a>The purpose of the amendments is to remove all non-photographic forms of identity documents from the list of specified documents set out in paragraph 6. Rule 34(2) states that a ballot paper shall not be handed to a potential voter unless he or she has produced one of the specified documents to the presiding officer or clerk. The specified documents are the same as for the regulations.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-27_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches pay tribute to the efforts of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal in setting these arrangements in place. We welcome this small but essential progress towards the reduction of electoral fraud in Northern Ireland. I have only one question for the Minister: as regards the very specific and comprehensive arrangements for the issue of the documentation, can she assure us that the software is in place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-27_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for introducing the regulations and the order. As we heard from the noble Baroness, the purpose of the regulations is to remove all non-photographic forms of identification from the list.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para0"></a>During the passage of the Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, much debate took place on non-photographic forms of identification which could be open to abuse, for example the medical card. The Conservatives and these Benches argued that only photographic identification should be used to obtain a ballot paper. The Government introduced the electoral identity card and said that it was their intention to remove the non-photographic forms of ID from the list before the Assembly elections. However, they wanted to ensure that there was a sufficient take-up rate of the identity card so that no one would be deprived of their right to vote simply because they had the incorrect type of identification.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para1"></a>Concerns have certainly been raised about the electoral identity card, in particular the number of people who have not returned their application for one. About 200,000 people have stated that they required the ID but have not received it. One lady applied for her card in November but received it only yesterday. My concern is that the great length of time that it has taken for that to be received could be replicated for great numbers of people in Northern Ireland. We certainly support the intention behind the regulations. We have been looking for the Government's reassurances that such matters will be looked into, and that no one will be denied the right to vote because they do not have the correct identification. I am heartened by the Minister's response to that, giving us a number of assurances that have been put in place. I thank her for that.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para2"></a>I shall move on to the Local Elections (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Order, which removes all non-photographic forms of identity. It is consequential on the Representation of the People (Northern Ireland) (Variation of Specified Documents) Regulations 2003, and provides that a ballot paper will not be delivered to the voter unless he or she produces one of the <P>


<a name="column_1251"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1251</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>documents to the clerk or presiding officer. That therefore ensures uniformity across all elections in Northern Ireland, and we support the measures.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Laird: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to offer the support of the Ulster Unionist Party for these long overdue measures. The obvious need for the regulations is well known and, as such, I am going to resist the temptation to detail some of the more innovative techniques employed by republicans down the years in their attempts to cheat their way to electoral success.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para3"></a>Suffice it to say that, although Sinn Fein has significantly increased its representation in elected forums over some years, it would certainly not have done so to such an extent if the regulations had been in place. For example, the chairman of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr James Cooper, would now be representing the proud constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone in another place, rather than Sinn Fein's Michelle Gildernew. Of that I am quite sure.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para4"></a>My principal concern surrounding electoral identity cards is that take-up among the electorate in Northern Ireland will not be as high as one would wish, simply because of ignorance. Believe it or not, interest in all things political and electoral is not as high in the community at large as it is in your Lordships' House. Even though the Government have taken steps to publicise the existence of the cards, I believe that more could and should have been done. I hope very much that it is not a case of too little, too late, although I fear that that might well be so. None the less, I support the regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness will be surprised that I can give her my full-hearted support, which makes this rather an unusual occasion. I think that those who would have tried to prevent the legislation coming before the House until after the election had something to gain from that attitude.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para5"></a>The very fact that the statutory instruments have come before the House is an indication about the assertion once made in another place that Northern Ireland was as British as Finchley. One does not have regulations such as these in Finchley or any other part of the United Kingdom. They show that Northern Ireland was unique in its fraudulent elections that took place over many years.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para6"></a>I have a slight concern, which I hope that the noble Baroness can ease. Many people in Northern Ireland, particularly old people, are averse to having their photographs taken. I know that from people in my own family on medication such as cortisone, which leads to physical attributes including swelling of the face, particularly in women. It puts people off having their photographs taken. I hope that the Government will make every effort to ensure that the absence of a photograph does not lead to the denial of a vote in Northern Ireland.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para7"></a>I was particularly heartened by what the noble Baroness said about the mobile units that are to travel Northern Ireland to advise people on their eligibility for a vote. I hope that enough staff would work in the mobile units to handle the applications and assist people to fill them in. If political parties are to travel around and make an application on someone else's behalf, or help them to make it, the applicant may feel compelled to support that political party. However, if the application is helped to become valid by government agencies, there would be less compulsion for people concerned to vote for a particular political party.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para8"></a>I am very happy to support the legislation. It has been long overdue in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-27_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted that it is one of those rare occasions when speakers from all parts of the House have agreed with one another on the subject of Northern Ireland. In the absence of certain noble Lords, I could be emboldened to say to my noble friend Lord Fitt that not only is Northern Ireland not Finchley, but Finchley is not as beautiful as Northern Ireland, in spite of the beautiful trees in parts of it. I believe that we could probably all agree on that.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para9"></a>All noble Lords who spoke referred to the need to ensure that people know how to get help. I stress that there is a helpline telephone number that people can use for confirmation of programme dates and venues.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para10"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, asked about the system of software. The equipment being used in relation to the card is state-of-the-art technology and the electoral office has the ability to cope more than adequately with the increased demand. I hope that that also reassures the noble Lord, Lord Laird. I am sure that the noble Lord does not expect me to comment in any way on his view about what happened in previous elections.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para11"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, applications for the card started only in January, and nearly 60 per cent of those who applied have received their card.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para12"></a>While recognising that a photograph is the best way of ascertaining a person's identity, I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, that there will be enough staff on hand. I understand what he said about people feeling under pressure if a political party helps them to complete their form. There is a programme of mobile application centres at which eligible applicants, such as those on the electoral register, can apply in person for an electoral identity card. At the centres, people can have their photograph taken and their application completed. I stress that that process is free of charge. Over the next few weeks, the centres will visit shopping centres and housing estates throughout the Province.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para13"></a>I thank all noble Lords for their support and commend the regulations to the House.

<A NAME="30401-27_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton </B>   rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 12th March be approved [14th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, very simply, this order puts into practice a revised code of practice governing the video recording of interviews under the Terrorism Act 2000. I should remind noble Lords that the purpose of the code is to provide protection to both the person being interviewed and the officers conducting the interview, ensuring that no one can mistreat or falsely accuse the other.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para18"></a>The main revisions have been made at the request of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, to allow greater flexibility in the practical application of the code without diminishing the security that it provides. First, we have changed the text, which previously referred to the recordings being made on Super VHS, to say that recordings shall be made on Super VHS or an equivalent or superior format. That will allow them in future to use digital tapes or disks. A number of necessary changes in language have been made flowing from that basic change.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para19"></a>Secondly, a new paragraph has been added saying that, where possible, the recording equipment shall keep an audit trail of who views and copies the recordings. Of course, such an audit was kept manually under the existing code, but this allows for the equipment to keep that audit automatically. This refers to a specific system that the Police Service of Northern Ireland has been piloting.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para20"></a>The normal procedures for sealing videotapes have been kept for individual tapes or disks, but the code also allows for the police to introduce an alternative system as long as that system ensured the same or higher levels of security and accountability but without using seals. Again, this refers to a specific system being piloted by the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para21"></a>The Government have also taken the opportunity to update the code, changing one or two names as necessary and extending the list of alternative formats in which the text can be made available. In line with the Home Office's draft amended PACE codes the statutory term "mentally disordered" has been widened <P>


<a name="column_1254"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1254</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by the addition of the term "mentally vulnerable". The notice given to those formerly detained of the destruction of recordings has been extended from two weeks to four.
<P>

<a name="30401-27_para22"></a>As I am sure noble Lords can see, these are small amendments. They do not alter the substance of the code but make it more adaptable to the realities of technological change. They also allow for future developments without necessarily requiring the code to be amended further. I am confident that the revised code will serve the police well as they carry out their sensitive counter-terrorist responsibilities. I commend the order to the House. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-28_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, we welcome this measure as a further advance in the effective policing of Northern Ireland. We particularly welcome the provisions for flexibility and advancement in technology, which will save the requirement for further orders in that respect. Will the video technology be available in every detention centre where interviews are likely to take place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-28_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </B>   My Lords, we too welcome the order. As we have heard, the Police Service of Northern Ireland asked for the code to be revised to ensure that the police are not prevented from using more advanced technologies than originally specified in the code. That is a sensible change, which we support. I am particularly pleased to hear of the flexibility for future use of new technologies, so that we shall not have to return for new orders every time there are improvements in technological expertise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Laird: </B>   My Lords, again, I am happy to offer the approval of my Ulster Unionist colleagues for this order. As a strong supporter of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, I am delighted that these provisions will offer much needed protection to officers from allegations of heavy-handedness from detainees, and they should be welcomed for that reason. It goes without saying, of course, that detainees themselves will be offered similar protection. If that leads to a resultant increase in the community's confidence in the PSNI, that is a good thing.
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para0"></a>I note that the other principal effect of the order is that, at the request of the PSNI, more advanced technologies than those originally specified in the code of practice can now be used. I support the order.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-28_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their support. I share with the noble Lord, Lord Laird, the hope and belief that the order will help to strengthen confidence in the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Perhaps I may say to the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, that a brand new centre is to be opened in Antrim this week. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, for her support and say how <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-28_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Thornton </B>   moved Amendment No. 79:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 6, line 37, after "involve" insert "the taking or making of"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-28_para6"></a><P>

<a name="30401-28_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a small amendment, and it could be that I put it down because I am being dim. I could not make sense of the clause unless it had something in it which was related to what was actually happening&#151;whether a photograph was being taken, made, seen or whatever. So I decided that "taking or making" the photograph might make that clear. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The purpose of the marriage exception in Clause 16 is to make sure that the criminal law does not interfere unnecessarily with the right of individuals to engage in sexual activity within a lawful marriage. Marriages may be lawfully contracted overseas by individuals who then visit or come to live in this country, but who none the less are below the age of consent here.
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para8"></a>The exception clause has been carefully drafted with the intention of making sure that the criminal law does not interfere with "normal" sexual behaviour within marriage, while ensuring that it does not inadvertently legalise abusive sexual behaviour within marriage. In order to protect children from being coerced into what many would consider to be abnormal sexual activity, the marriage defence provides that where the sexual activity complained of involves a third party, or involves photographs or pseudo-photographs of a third party engaging in sexual activity, the fact that the defendant and complainant are lawfully married will not absolve the defendant of criminal liability. That means in practice that if, for example, for the purposes of his own sexual gratification, a man makes his 15 year-old wife look at pornographic images as he downloads them from the Internet, or makes her look at pornographic photographs in a magazine, or makes her watch a pornographic movie, he will be guilty of the offence of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"causing a child to watch a sexual act".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-28_para9"></a><P>

<a name="30401-28_para10"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, would have the effect of broadening the scope of the marriage exception, so that it would only not apply where the activity complained of <P>


<a name="column_1256"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1256</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>involves a third party, or where it involved the "making or taking" of photographs, or pseudo-photographs of a third party engaging in sexual activity. If the amendment was incorporated in the Bill, a man who, for his own sexual gratification, made his wife look at pornographic images that he had downloaded from the Internet, or made his wife look at photographs or videos he had taken of a third party engaging in sexual activity, would still probably be committing an offence. However, it would no longer be an offence for him, for the purpose of sexual gratification, to make her watch pornographic movies or to look at photographs taken of a third person. That would reduce the protection from abuse that is offered within marriage.
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para11"></a>There is a technical problem with the amendment, although it is in a different order. I do not believe that there is much point in going through the technical difficulties, because the noble Baroness is after some clarity on the point of principle. I believe that we have the balance right in the marriage exception, in that it does not interfere unnecessarily with mutually agreed activity, but it still protects children from behaviour within marriage that is abusive. I hope that helps the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-28_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Thornton: </B>   I am not sure whether it helps. However, I shall read the Minister's words with care. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30401-28_para13"></a>Clause 16 agreed to.
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para14"></a>Clause 17 [Meeting a child following sexual grooming etc.]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-28_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton </B>   moved Amendment No. 80:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 7, line 3, leave out paragraph (a) and insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-28_para15"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(a) having met or communicated with another person (B) on at least two earlier occasions, he&#151;
<br>
(i) intentionally meets B, or
<br>
(ii) travels with the intention of meeting B in any part of the world,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30401-28_para16"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: Clause 17 is intended to cover situations in which an adult establishes contact with a child&#151;for example through meetings, telephone conversations or communications on the Internet&#151;with the intention of gaining the child's trust and confidence so that he can arrange to meet the child for the purpose of committing a sexual offence against him or her.
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para17"></a>The communication or contact between the adult and the child can take any form. However, the offence will be committed only if the adult meets or travels to meet the child with the intention of committing a sex offence against the child at the meeting or on a subsequent occasion. It stems from work undertaken by the Government's Internet task force on child protection. On indictment, the maximum penalty is five years, but we would seek by way of amendment to persuade the House to agree to seven years.
<P>


<a name="column_1257"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1257</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para18"></a>There is presently no offence with which such a person could be charged and this important measure fills that gap. This new offence enables earlier intervention than is otherwise possible. It is designed to intervene at an earlier stage in the preparatory process which adults may use to gain access to children to abuse sexually. I have indicated the intention of the offence.
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para19"></a>It is our intention that the adult should commit an offence wherever the meeting he is travelling to is intended to take place. The offence would be committed provided that some part of the journey to the meeting takes place in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. So a person commits an offence if he uses a computer at home in England to communicate with a child in, for example, Thailand and sets out to travel to that meeting provided that the travel or part of it takes place in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. The government amendment makes that explicit. This is because we see no reason to distinguish between situations where a person travels to meet in this country or abroad. However, the offence as drafted does not make that specifically clear.
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para20"></a>I thank my noble friend Lady Thornton for tabling Amendment No. 81 to that effect. I confirm that we entirely agree with the objective she is trying to achieve and have tabled a government amendment to that effect. In the light of the government amendment prompted by her amendment, I trust that she will feel able to withdraw her amendment and support mine. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-28_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Thornton: </B>   I greatly welcome the amendment. I spoke on the matter at Second Reading of the Bill. It is an important amendment and it sends an important message to men who would prey on children in other countries. I am most pleased that the Government have tabled the amendment and I shall not move my amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-28_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I, too, welcome the amendment. I re-read the occasion on which I introduced these amendments to a Bill in this House and I re-read the arguments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, most cogently and elegantly put, as to why they could not and should not be included in the statute. I shall not say, "I told you so", but I am hugely pleased that they are now part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para21"></a>Clause 17 is a major step forward in addressing the mechanism whereby paedophiles seek to befriend children and lure them into situations where sexual activities can take place. It is important to address grooming in the context of the Internet and the enormous range of opportunities it presents to the determined paedophile. By tabling the amendment, the noble and learned Lord has sent a message that the Government are taking the matter extremely seriously.
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para22"></a>The new grooming offence would enable the police to arrest the predator before the child was physically or sexually abused. That was always our concern. Under the law as it stood, the child had first to be attacked or abused before the police could take action. The police will be able to make an arrest once the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>predator met or travelled with the intention of meeting a child under 16 with the intention of committing a sexual offence. The intent will be drawn from a course of conduct; either the communication itself or other circumstances such as going to a meeting with pornography or condoms.
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para23"></a>I am aware that Liberty, in its briefing, talks about,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"criminalisation of an act that is not in itself criminal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-28_para24"></a>
It goes on to state,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-28_para25"></a><P>

<a name="30401-28_para26"></a>That is an extraordinary approach. We are talking about someone who has embarked on a course of conduct designed to result in the commission of a child sex offence. That includes actual contact with the child victim that is linked, incontrovertibly, to arrangements for meeting with the purpose of committing a sexual crime. In order to be prosecuted the person must have set out on his journey to meet the child in order to perform his particular sexual fantasies upon that child. I regard that as much more than thought.

The Met also say that the penalty should be increased from five to seven years, commensurate with other sentences in the Bill. So I am pleased to see that the Government have lent their name to Amendment No. 96 in the name of my noble friend, which appears to agree with that view.
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para31"></a>Amendment No. 80 is a sensible amendment that tidies up the drafting of subsection (1)(a) and extends the protection to cover cases where the perpetrator is travelling to meet a child abroad. There is no reason why a man who uses the Internet to seduce a child in Portugal or in the USA should be able to set out on his journey to meet the child free from the reaches of this new law. That is especially true given the Bill's other provisions tackling sexual abuse of children abroad by people operating from within the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30401-28_para32"></a>Amendment No. 81 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, which also extends the new offence to protect children abroad, has effectively been adopted by the Government. I welcome that too.

<a name="30401-28_para33"></a>I strongly support the new offence and I support its extension in this way. However, I have concerns, as the noble and learned Lord will have noticed from the Marshalled List, about whether Clause 17 goes far enough. I shall address those concerns when speaking to my Amendments Nos. 82 and 86. I am truly grateful for what the Government have done in this respect.

<A NAME="30401-29_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   From these Benches we welcome this part of the Bill and the Government's amendment to it. The noble and learned Lord will be aware that at meetings about the Bill off the Floor of the House we raised concerns about the quality of the evidence that would be required for a conviction of someone under this new offence. The amendment clarifies matters considerably. We are delighted to know that the police have experts who can get into computers and find e-mails as their contents may make the accused's intention clear, which is important. Initially we had considerable sympathy with the concerns of Liberty, but the reassurances that we have received from the Minister have set our minds at rest. We shall have to see how the Bill works in practice. However, we certainly welcome the new offence which is an advance in child protection.

<A NAME="30401-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 83:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 7, line 5, at end insert "and subsection (1A) applies"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-29_para2"></a><P>

<a name="30401-29_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: I welcome Clause 17 because it attempts to deal with sexual grooming. Amendments Nos. 83, 84 and 87 have been tabled to explore the preparatory nature of the activity essential for this offence. The Minister will be aware from the Second Reading debate that Clause 17 does not refer to sexual grooming as such. I was concerned to ensure that it encompasses an element of preparation. The offence just requires that a person has met or communicated with a child on at least two occasions before meeting the child or travelling with the intention of meeting the child. Nothing there is preparatory to the act that will involve a sexual offence.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para4"></a>Most communications and meetings with children, whether face to face or via the Internet, have no evil intent but all such communications potentially fall within the clause. My noble friend Lady Blatch and I were briefed by the Metropolitan Police, who believe that Clause 17 is essential preventive medicine. We heard how the Metropolitan Police deal with paedophiliac offences, which was something of an eye opener. The Metropolitan Police say that they will prove evidence of the intention that is required by Clause 17(1)(b) to commit a sexual offence in part by <P>


<a name="column_1260"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1260</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the content of the messages or communications. They have examples that clearly show that the communication is sexual or where sex is not mentioned but the phrases used plainly demonstrate the intention.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para5"></a>A ploy used by persons involved in grooming is to pretend to be someone much more like their intended victim or to allow trust to build up. Amendment No. 87 tries to capture those two possibilities where the communication is of a sexual nature or the offender has used impersonation to make the child believe that it would be safe to meet the person. If other words would capture the essence of grooming, I shall be pleased to consider them.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para6"></a>My noble friend Lady Blatch said that the offence under Clause 17 is essentially a thought crime that penalises a state of mind. The intention to commit an offence actually triggers the offence. I have no fundamental problem with that concept, provided that the clause offers sufficient safeguards. The Criminal Bar Association believes that safeguards are needed because of the potential that the earlier communications were entirely innocent. The CBA has suggested the words in Amendment No. 84, which requires that there be proved the intent to commit a sexual offence at the time of the two earlier communications. While that is different from Amendment No. 87, the intention is the same&#151;to require more evidence about the defendant's behaviour or intentions before the meeting or the travelling that triggers the offence.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para7"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, mentioned that Liberty has expressed concern about prosecuting individuals not for what they have done but for what someone thinks that they might do. Liberty believes that people will become afraid of talking to children and that the impact on neighbours or communities will leave children less safe than at present. My noble friend Lord Astor of Hever pointed out at Second Reading that the Climbie inquiry taught us that we have to encourage neighbours to look out for children. We must not by this Bill make people scared of talking to children for fear of false accusations of paedophiliac offences.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para8"></a>As I am sure that the Minister is aware, Liberty would prefer the complete removal of Clause 17 but, failing that, supports Amendment No. 87. I stress that I have no desire to make the offence of sexual grooming any less effective; I am merely trying to ensure that the offence is clearly aimed at sexual grooming behaviour and, by doing so, does not become a trap into which the unwary innocent may fall. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-29_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   First, I am sorry that I was unable to move Amendment No. 82. Normally, we are told at the outset when an amendment is moved whether it pre-empts other amendments. I should have spoken to Amendment No. 82, if only to persuade the Minister to consider including its provisions in a later part of the Bill. Perhaps I shall have to reconsider that.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para9"></a>I want simply to pose some questions about the amendments. Amendments Nos. 83 and 87 would make it more difficult to convict under Clause 17, <P>


<a name="column_1261"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1261</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because they require proof that the communications with the child were sexual or that the predator pretended to be someone else to win the child's trust. The problem is that that excuses a paedophile who is honest about who he is, or who simply does not say anything about his identity or age. As long as the communications remained romantic rather than sexual, he would escape conviction, although the end-game may be the same.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para10"></a>Amendment No. 84 would also make it unnecessarily difficult to convict for grooming. It requires the prosecution to prove that on two earlier occasions where the perpetrator met or communicated with his victim, he intended to commit a sexual offence. The offence already requires the prosecution to prove that there was an intention to commit an offence at the time of the meeting in question. To add to that a burden of proving a similar intention on two earlier occasions would drastically reduce the number of prosecutions and convictions.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para11"></a>The fact that two examples are required gives rise to the dreadful scenario that a single, blatantly sexual advance would not suffice for a conviction under the clause. In fact, it could be a single, very long contact with the individual. A paedophile may have a series of entirely innocuous communications with a child which, unbeknown to the child, are intended to lull him or her into a false sense of security. That is a particular tactic of paedophiles. If he then sends a single e-mail asking the young person to meet him to perform specific sexual acts, he could escape conviction, since that falls short of the two examples required by Amendment No. 84. I ask the Minister to confirm that that would be the effect of the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Three amendments are grouped: Amendments Nos. 83, 84 and 87. Amendments Nos. 83 and 87 would restrict the offence of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Meeting a child following sexual grooming etc.",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-29_para12"></a>
to those situations where the prior communication between the adult and the child is either explicitly sexual or involves the adult impersonating another person in such a way as to lead the child to believe that it would be safe to meet the adult.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para13"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said, the offence would be committed only where it could be proven that an adult, having communicated with a child on at least two previous occasions, travelled to meet or met that child with the intention sexually to abuse the child at the meeting or subsequently. The sexual intent at the final meeting must be proven in order for the offence to be made out. It would, therefore, seem unwise to limit the communication to only those of an explicitly sexual nature or where the adult had impersonated someone&#151;for example, a person of similar age to the child&#151;in order to lead the child to believe that a meeting would be safe and appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para14"></a>In some cases, where adults are seeking to gain the friendship and trust of children so that they can abuse them, they may not lie about their age or their identity. <P>


<a name="column_1262"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1262</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>They may not be explicitly sexual in their communication. However, if there is evidence which proves the intent to commit a sex offence&#151;for example, something said to a third party&#151;it is difficult to understand why they should not be liable for the offence. So it is difficult to understand the logic behind Amendments Nos. 83 and 87.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para15"></a>Perhaps I can test that by way of example. A man in his 20s may communicate with a child of 13 or 14. The man may talk on the Internet to the child about his favourite pop group, or what he likes to watch on television. In this way he may befriend the child and travel to meet him with the intention of committing a sexual offence against him. He may even communicate, as happens, details of the sexual offence he is intending to commit to another adult with similar sexual interests to his own, but he has neither tried to impersonate someone else nor been remotely sexual in his communication. That man would not be guilty of a Clause 17 offence. Is that what we want? I do not think that it is. With respect to the noble Baroness, I believe that these are unwise amendments.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para16"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 84 would be to make, in some cases, prosecution under Clause 17 for the offence of meeting a child following sexual grooming extremely difficult. The effect of Amendment No. 84 would be that the intention would have to be present before each of the meetings. I assume that the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, have tabled the amendment in order to prevent wrongful prosecutions against adults who have innocent non-sexual communications and intentions towards children and that the offence should be committed only where the future sexual intent can be proven at the time of the earlier communications as well.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para17"></a>In fact, such innocent and altruistic communications where there is never any sexual intent would never bring conviction, as the offence is committed only following those communications where the adult travels to meet the child and a sexual intent at that stage can be proven. It should not matter, when an adult travels to meet a child with an intention sexually to abuse that child, whether or not you can also prove that he had that sexual intention in previous communications with the child. It is enough that he has befriended that child and now travels to meet him or meets him with that intent.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para18"></a>I understand why the amendment has been tabled, but in effect it creates great difficulties. All you would have to prove to get away with the offence would be that one of the occasions was entirely innocent. That would be enough, even though there might be conduct or communications, for example, with a third party that indicated that the meeting was intended to lead to illegal sexual activity.
<P>

<a name="30401-29_para19"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, referred to pre-emption and asks why there should be two occasions rather than one. This is a sensible, effective but quite far-reaching offence. It depends upon a course of conduct before the meeting. The course of conduct would not be established by just one meeting; you <P>


<a name="column_1263"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1263</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would need two. I fully accept that one can envisage circumstances, as the noble Baroness says. Let us compare, for example, a chat room conversation on the Internet that lasted eight hours with one e-mail. There needs to be some basis upon which one can establish a course of conduct. We think that two is the minimum number which can form the basis of such a course of conduct. I was not clear about the noble Baroness's final example. It appeared to involve some contact followed at the end by an e-mail. That seems to me to satisfy the two meetings or communications requirement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-30_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My second example refers to where there have been many communications of a non-sexual nature. The relationship between the person sending the e-mails and the young child receiving them lulls that person into a sense of false security. The final e-mail is sexual in nature, and they meet. On the back of all that grooming, which on the face of it was non-sexual in nature, there could not be a conviction because there has to be another e-mail of a sexual nature. The person creating over a period a friendship with the person, followed by one very short e-mail about meeting for a sexual encounter, would not be convicted because there would not have been two e-mails of a sexual nature.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I misunderstood the noble Baroness's point. It appears that the attack was on the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and not on the Government's position. That is fine. I thank the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-30_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I had realised that my noble friend's attack was aimed at me; indeed, that is something that I have become quite used to this evening.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para0"></a>I thank the Minister for his reply and for explaining his position on the concerns raised. I can paraphrase the concerns that he expressed and those mentioned by my noble friend Lady Blatch by saying that it is difficult to convict paedophiles. I approached my amendments from a slightly different direction by pointing out that one element of this offence involves potentially innocent activity. Most communications with children are innocent communications, which could themselves bring this offence into effect.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para1"></a>I am not perhaps concerned that innocent people would be prosecuted and convicted. I have always been concerned about innocent people having false accusations made against them. Through ignorance, we know that quite frightening reactions often occur in communities whenever people suspect that a paedophile is in their midst. That is the nature of my concern.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para2"></a>The clause is not about sexual grooming; it is about going to meet someone with an intent to commit an offence. There is a fig-leaf of grooming at the beginning of the clause, followed by the reference to two communications. That is the part of the provision <P>


<a name="column_1264"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1264</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about which I am most concerned. However, I shall not press the amendment this evening. I should like to consider the matter further. I remain concerned about the potential effect on innocent people. I put that alongside the difficulties as regards convicting paedophiles, who we really want to convict under this legislation. I thank the Minister for his response, and beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30401-30_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 88. These amendments would extend the new grooming offence outlined in Clause 17 to include adults with a mental disorder or a learning disability.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para7"></a>Our amendments focus on a different aspect of the new offence and one that I feel has been neglected by those who have been lobbying for the new offence to be introduced. The Bill clearly sets aside two groups who could be classified as "vulnerable"&#151;those who cannot readily consent to sexual activity and for whom sexual abuse may be a very traumatic experience, and one that they have problems reporting or admitting. For these reasons, sexual offences committed against children and those with a mental disorder or learning disability are dealt with separately in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para8"></a>Like children, the Bill admits that vulnerable adults with a mental disorder or a learning disability need special protection against sexual abuse. Their trust can be won easily. They may have a confused sense of what is wrong and what is right in sexual terms. I believe that not including them in the Bill, along with the under-16s, would be tantamount to a huge loophole in the legislation. They may have unrestricted access to computers and telephones, just like children. We know that they are often specifically targeted by sexual offenders.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para9"></a>I should be grateful if the Minister could outline the reasons for not including vulnerable adults under those who can be victims of the offence in Clause 17. I beg to move.

I have been a bit of a thorn in her side for most of the day. It would have given me great pleasure to have said that to her.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para10"></a>Most of us can think of individuals who, although over 16 years in age, have a much younger mental age or could have a serious mental condition. It is right that the welcome new protection of Clause 17 should be extended to them. My noble friend Lord Astor made the point extremely well.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para11"></a>The Bill contains offences to protect people with mental disorders from unwelcome sexual advances and from abuse by care workers. These provisions, in some way, mirror the protections for children. It does therefore seem odd that the grooming offence in Clause 17 does not also apply to them in the same way as it applies to minors. Certainly, such people can be very prone to being led by sex abusers. They can be very trusting. We must protect that trust in every way. I believe that trust is very special in young people with this kind of disability. Including them within the protection of this offence can only be extremely welcome. I hope that the Minister will take the amendment seriously.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-30_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I, too, support the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever. It would be a great pity if we lost the opportunity to include vulnerable adults in Clause 17. They have exactly the same problems as children. I shall not go through the list again because the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, gave all those examples. To leave this issue to later in the Bill would be a pity because, particularly in schools and in special schools, young people, including young people with learning disabilities, are being encouraged to learn how to use computers. Using computers gives them greater confidence and they are often able to use those skills to enhance their quality of life, which otherwise would be even less. That puts them into the same category as others who are vulnerable because they have that access. Therefore, it would be a pity to lose this opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Obviously there is a lacuna in the Bill and I support my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-30_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   This is difficult. In relation to those young adults who do not have the capacity to consent, one can see fairly easily a comparability with children. We should consider that carefully. For those who have a capacity to consent, it is much harder to decide whether it is the right course to treat them as being similar to children or people who do not have the capacity to consent. In effect, what one is saying is that even though the right of those people who have the capacity to consent is recognised&#151;albeit with some form of mental impairment&#151;nevertheless they are entitled to especial protection and they should not be able to make the kinds of judgments that the rest of us are entitled to make.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para12"></a>My current inclination is to think that those without the capacity to consent might well need this protection. But because of our profound concern not to prevent people who do have the capacity to consent to be able to court and be courted in the way that other adults <P>


<a name="column_1266"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1266</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are, I am not sure that it would be right to extend this protection to those who do have the capacity to consent.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para13"></a>We shall certainly consider this amendment. We shall particularly focus on those without the capacity to consent because that is where the particular focus should be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-30_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I have considerable sympathy with this amendment. However, we take the point that the Minister made about capacity to consent. We wonder if, at the next stage, this could be brought back with a slight change in the last line with words to the effect that B is suffering from a mental disorder which means that they do not have the capacity to consent. In that case, I think that we should be willing to support the amendment. But, as it stands, it has the flaw highlighted by the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-30_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Blatch, my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, for their support.

In the light of that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-30_para15"></a><P>

<a name="30401-30_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 86 seeks to investigate the question of whether the police are prevented by the wording of Clause 17 from entrapping paedophiles.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para17"></a>The offence requires that, "B is under 16". Clause 17 covers the situation where there is a specific potential victim who is aged under 16. A mother might discover that her 14 year-old daughter has fixed up a meeting with a stranger over the Internet. She contacts the police. When the paedophile arrives for the meeting with B, he is met by police officers, who then arrest him. A Clause 17 offence has been committed because the paedophile is intending to meet B, and B is under 16. The fact that B will not be there for the meeting is irrelevant.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para18"></a>The problem arises if a police officer acts on his own initiative where there is no threat to a particular victim. If a policeman goes online and pretends to be under 16 in order to entrap a paedophile, the offence will not be made out because the officer is B, and B is not under 16.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para19"></a>Entrapment can be a necessary law enforcement measure, particularly in cases such as these. The police may be aware of an adult trawling teenage websites and engaging in suggestive communications with children, and they may see evidence in a chat room of attempts to arrange meetings, but they may not be able <P>

They should be able to engage him in correspondence and wait for him to arrange a meeting, where they can then identify and arrest him. They should be able to do this without having to involve a child in the process, otherwise they will have to leave this unidentified individual until he commits a sexual offence and hope that they catch him then.
<P>

<a name="30401-30_para21"></a>It would be most unsatisfactory if the wording of Clause 17 prevented entrapment. I shall be most interested to hear what the Minister has to say about this. I hope that history will not repeat itself whereby I make a reasonable point now which in four or five years' time will be incorporated in a future Bill. It is particularly difficult to gain a conviction&#151;or even to gain the identity&#151;of someone who is up to no good with young people. If the result of entrapment is a conviction, it will have been an honourable task and another shot in the armoury for the police to track down these awful people. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30401-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The amendment would make explicit that the offence of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Meeting a child following sexual grooming etc.",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-31_para0"></a>
covers offenders who think they are communicating with a child under 16 when in fact the "child" is an undercover police officer who has assumed the identity of the child&#151;for example, in an Internet chat room. I sympathise with the intention of the noble Baroness that the police should be able to carry out the kind of sting operations that she suggests. However, that situation is already covered in law and the amendment is not necessary.
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para1"></a>The situation covered by the amendment would constitute an attempt to meet a child following sexual grooming. Section 1(2) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 makes clear that a person may be guilty of attempting to commit an offence even though the facts are such that the commission of the offence is impossible&#151;for example, because the person with whom the person is communicating is a policeman. Section 1(3) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 makes clear that, in assessing whether the person has the relevant intention, it is assumed that the facts are as he believed them to be&#151;that is, that the person to whom he was talking was a child rather than, as was in fact the case, an undercover policeman.
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para2"></a>So in this case the defendant would be deemed to have the intention to meet a child under 16 and to commit a sex offence because that would have been his intention if the facts had been as he believed them to be. The maximum penalty for an attempted offence, which it would be in the sting hypothetically proposed by the noble Baroness, is the same as for the substantive offence. So the law already provides for the kind of situation to which the noble Baroness <P>

<a name="30401-31_para8"></a><P>

<a name="30401-31_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: Government Amendments Nos. 90, 92 and 94 to Clause 17 of the Bill are to change the definition of a relevant offence if the offence is committed outside England, Wales or Northern Ireland. The criminal law in England and Wales and Northern Ireland is different. Sometimes particular behaviour is an offence in Northern Ireland but not in England and Wales, and vice versa.
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para10"></a>As currently drafted, the effect of Clause 17(2)(b)(v) is that a person could intend to commit an act abroad or in Scotland and if that act is an offence in Northern Ireland, but not in England and Wales, he could still be prosecuted for it in England and Wales. This is not an effect that we had intended.
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para11"></a>As a consequence of Amendment No. 90, a person will be able to be prosecuted in England and Wales for an offence committed abroad or in Scotland only if it is an offence in England and Wales.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: I rise to move Amendment No. 91 which seeks to delete subsection (3) of Clause 17. This is a probing amendment about the application of the Bill to Northern Ireland. We have reached the first substantive part of the application of the Bill to Northern Ireland, which is why the amendment is targeted at the subsection.
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para15"></a>The Minister will be aware that many differences still exist in the law applying to Northern Ireland and as it applies in England and Wales. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, made that point just a moment ago. In due course we shall come to the achievement of gender neutrality specifically for the abolition of homosexual-specific offences.
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para16"></a>In a Written Answer, the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House has informed me that consideration is being given to addressing issues concerning offences that target only homosexual activity in Northern Ireland. If the Minister could say anything further about that, it would be most helpful.
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para17"></a>The amendment seeks to remove the higher age of consent of 17 in Northern Ireland from the particular offence of sexual grooming, but the main issue underlying the amendment is the broader canvas of differences between the laws in Northern Ireland and those in England and Wales. In his Written Answer, the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House also stated that any changes in Northern Ireland must await a review and consultation. However, we believe that the law should be the same unless good reason can be demonstrated for different treatment. Furthermore, if the Bill is ultimately effective in terms of improving the operation of the law covering rape&#151;although, as the Minister knows, on the basis of our Committee discussions to date, that is an open issue&#151;why should not Northern Ireland benefit from that?
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para18"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to say when we can expect the review in Northern Ireland to take place and thus within what kind of time-scale we can expect the people of Northern Ireland to benefit from the changes that are being proposed in this Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-31_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   Would it not be better to leave matters of this kind until they have been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-31_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I think that the noble Baroness is entitled to an answer to her question as regards the position in relation to Northern Ireland. There is no question of having to wait in that regard.
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para19"></a>The law on sexual offences in Northern Ireland differs from that in England and Wales and was not included in the review that underpins the changes we are making in this Bill. The wholesale reform of the law in Northern Ireland does not form part of the Bill. Northern Ireland is conducting its own review of sexual offences. That review has already begun and a consultation paper will be published in the near future.
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para20"></a>However, we are taking the opportunity in this Bill to make some changes to the law in Northern Ireland. We are extending a relatively small number of the offences <P>


<a name="column_1270"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1270</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>set out in Part 1. We are also ensuring that the reforms set out in Part 2 of the Bill on the registration of sex offenders continue to extend to Northern Ireland without there being any question of such offenders being able to view Northern Ireland as some kind of safe haven.
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para21"></a>We are also keen to remove as soon as possible the inequalities from the law on sexual offences in Northern Ireland between the heterosexual and homosexual population. We are currently examining what remedial amendments we can effect in advance of the substantive reform represented by the review, specifically to deal with certain inequalities which have been identified. We are considering the issues carefully, together with the police and the Department of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para22"></a>We have also sought parliamentary approval in the draft of the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 to make some changes in the law on sexual offences in Northern Ireland in order to be compliant with certain obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="30401-31_para23"></a>I have not dealt specifically with the amendment because I have regarded it as a legitimate pivot on which to discuss the Northern Ireland position overall.

<A NAME="30401-31_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Before my noble friend decides what to do with the amendment&#151;and I am sure she will withdraw it&#151;let me say that in my limited and out-of-date experience of Northern Ireland, I would be very surprised if the result of the consultation to which the noble and learned Lord has referred were a general wish to reduce the age of consent in Northern Ireland from 17 to 16. After all, it is by far the most Catholic part of the United Kingdom and follows to a great extent, although not totally, the attitudes in the Irish Republic.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-31_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The Bill does not purport to change the age of consent in Northern Ireland. I would be extraordinarily unwise to venture a guess as to what public opinion might be in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-31_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My noble friend has predicted that I shall withdraw the amendment. It is a probing amendment, as I informed the Minister's officials.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-32_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 95:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 7, line 31, leave out paragraph (a).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para4"></a><P>

<a name="30401-32_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 95, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 96. It may in fact be easier if I start with Amendment No. 96, because I am pleased to see that the Minister's name also appears on the amendment, hence it is non-controversial.
<P>

<a name="30401-32_para6"></a>We believed, and are glad that the Government believe as well, that five years was too short a maximum sentence for the offence of meeting a child following sexual grooming. Seven years is a more realistic sentence.
<P>

<a name="30401-32_para7"></a>Amendment No. 96 again raises the issue of what circumstances could lead the CPS even to contemplate a summary offence under the sexual grooming provisions. We are talking about a person who has been convicted of grooming a child with a view to a sexual offence. I talked in an earlier group of amendments about the difficulties with Clause 17 but my problem there was with whether innocent people, foolish or otherwise, might become entangled in it. But if the Crown Prosecution Service is convinced that it can prove this crime, it is a very serious matter. I simply cannot see how the summary procedure could ever be relevant. Like being pregnant, I do not think one can be a little bit of a sexual groomer&#151;one is either a dangerous sexual predator or one is not.
<P>

<a name="30401-32_para8"></a>My concern about leaving the summary conviction route on the face of the Bill is that it may be used in borderline cases in the hope of getting a guilty plea. People on the borderline may well be the innocent fools I have been concerned about. I am concerned that the option, which should not be a real option for conviction for an offence of serious sexual grooming, is on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   We are agreed as regards the change from five to seven years. I do not think there is a problem there. As regards the possibility of a summary charge in relation to grooming, the vast majority of cases will be so serious as to merit the Crown Court. Is there a case that might not be? Possibly that of a 19 year-old talking to a child of 15 years and 11 months. However, it is sensible to include the provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-32_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. I still maintain that sexual grooming is a very serious offence. If the CPS thinks it is worth bringing a prosecution, we are talking about a serious offence which should receive an appropriate sentence. I do not think that there are borderline cases. Earlier I made a joke about that. However, I am not sure that there is borderline sexual grooming. Either we want to prevent the people we are discussing harming young children or we do not. I believe that the provision is unlikely to be used as regards 19year-olds talking to 15 year-olds. If a prosecution were to be brought in such a case, it should occur because a serious offence has been committed.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para15"></a><P>

<a name="30401-32_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: We move to a section of Part 1 headed:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Abuse of position of trust".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para17"></a>
Before we get too involved, I point out that Clauses 18 to 22 set out the offences; Clauses 23 and 24 deal with the interpretation of a position of trust; and Clauses 25 to 27 contain exceptions.
<P>

<a name="30401-32_para18"></a>Before I come to the series of amendments which are common to the criminal charges in Clauses 19 to 22, I should point out to the noble and learned Lord that in the section where we were concerned with child sex offences, in Clauses 9, 10, 11, 13 and 17 and in government Amendments Nos. 48 and 50, the words that are used over and over again are,
<P>
<br>

Members of the Committee who were present during yesterday's debate will remember the great controversy that arose between the Government and these Benches about whether we should invent the reasonable person or whether it would be far simpler and more direct simply to include the words "reasonable belief"&#151;words which appear in the part which the Committee has considered most of the day with almost all the lawyers silent.

<A NAME="30401-32_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I certainly did not, but all the others seem to have done. I am now in a rather lonely position in considering with the noble and learned Lord technical amendments which do not really involve any point of principle. I should prefer to see some sensible mechanism to prove the various offences. Clauses 18 to 22 demonstrate the obsession of those who have drafted the Bill with moving the burden of proof around in all directions quite regardless of the problems that we discussed <P>


<a name="column_1273"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1273</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>throughout yesterday of trying to direct a jury or to inform magistrates of how these burdens of proof should be regarded, what they mean and so on.
<P>

<a name="30401-32_para20"></a>Let me, for example, take Clause 18(2) to demonstrate a quite simple problem. If the four points in subsection (1) are proved&#151;the burden is on the prosecution to prove them beyond reasonable doubt&#151;the persuasive burden passes to the defendant to prove,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that he believed that the other person was 18 or over".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para21"></a>
If he can prove that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"he is not guilty of the offence unless it is proved that his belief was unreasonable".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para22"></a>
Who has to prove that his belief was unreasonable? Clearly it is the prosecution.
<P>

<a name="30401-32_para23"></a>The jury has to be told, "Look at Clause 18(1). The burden of proof is on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt, so that you are sure. Then look at the defendant. He has to prove in a balance of probabilities that he is not guilty because he believed that the other person was 18. But once you have got to that position, you then have to consider whether the prosecution has proved, so that you are sure, that his belief was unreasonable." It is that leap required in the brain that is so difficult and open to criticism.
<P>

<a name="30401-32_para24"></a>Everything gets even worse in subsection (3), which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where in proceedings for an offence under this section it is proved that a position of trust existed because of circumstances within section 23(2), (3), (4) or (5)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para25"></a>
That places the burden on the prosecution to prove that those circumstances existed. The subsection continues,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and the defendant proves that he did not know of those circumstances".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para26"></a>
That gives him the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that he did not know. The subsection goes on to say that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"he is not guilty of the offence unless it is proved"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para27"></a>
the burden passes back to the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that he could reasonably have been expected to know of those circumstances, or . . .  that a position of trust existed because of other circumstances".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para28"></a><P>

<a name="30401-32_para29"></a>The purpose of my amendment is not at all to change the essence of what the Government are driving at, but to try to make it understandable by those who have to come to a particular decision. What I propose in subsection (2) is that, before "believed" in line 43, we insert "reasonably", and that we simply leave out,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unless it is proved that his belief was unreasonable".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para30"></a>
In such circumstances, once the essential facts in subsection (1) have been proved, the burden passes to the defendant to establish that he reasonably believed that the other person was 18.
<P>

<a name="30401-32_para31"></a>The words "reasonably believe" have appeared all through Clauses 9 to 17, which Members of the Committee have considered in the absence of the lawyers. However, all of a sudden we come back to a <P>


<a name="column_1274"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1274</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clause that might have been drafted by someone completely different, in which we have all the problems about which we talked yesterday.
<P>

<a name="30401-32_para32"></a>Similarly, my amendments to Clause 18(3) would exclude all the words from "unless it is proved" to the end, include "solely" before "because", and add after "know" the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and had no reason to believe".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para33"></a>
In the end, that subsection would therefore read, very simply:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where in proceedings for an offence under this section a position of trust existed solely because of circumstances within section 23(2), (3), (4), or (5)"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para34"></a>
that puts the burden of proof on the prosecution to establish that&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and the defendant proves that he did not know and had no reason to believe of those circumstances, he is not guilty of the offence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-32_para35"></a>
That would be the case if the defendant were acting reasonably. The burden of proof certainly shifts, but it does so only once. Although the jury may have difficulty in fully comprehending the difference between the prosecution having to make them sure and the burden shifting to the defendant to say that the decision is made on the balance of probabilities, that is much simpler than shifting the burden back again to the prosecution.
<P>

<a name="30401-32_para36"></a>As your Lordships will appreciate, I am simply trying to clear up the situation. If one amended the provisions as I have proposed, that would strengthen the Bill rather than weaken it. My formulation in no sense weakens the principle that the Government are seeking; it in fact strengthens it.
<P>

<a name="30401-32_para37"></a>I have studied those two provisions specifically to illustrate the fact that the same or virtually the same principles arise in Clauses 18 to 22. The same points arise and the same amendments can be made so as to put into this part of the Bill the concept of reasonable belief that is in the previous part and for which we contend&#151;we will come back to this&#151;in relation to rape and all the other matters that we discussed yesterday. The amendments are sensible and would not do anything that the Government would not want. It will be interesting to see whether they will be resisted. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30401-33_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   We share the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, about the way in which the abuse of trust clauses are constructed. Those clauses are very important and it is a major concern to us that they are workable and effective.
<P>

<a name="30401-33_para0"></a>The noble Lord ably demonstrated how under Clause 18(2) and (3) the burdens of proof shift backwards and forwards. If that is not complicated, I do not know what is, especially if both defences are being run in the same trial. We heard yesterday about the complexity of various formulations for trial judges and juries. All parties claimed superiority, whether defending the status quo, the Bill or an amendment, in terms of simplicity for juries. I defy the Minister in this instance to defend the Bill in terms of simplicity when instructing a jury about how to reach a decision under subsections (2) and (3) and later similar provisions.

<a name="30401-33_para1"></a>If we cannot be confident about getting it right with regard to instructing juries, we are concerned that we cannot be confident that we have offences that are workable and effective. It is difficult to judge whether the amendment's formulations are right. They are certainly much simpler and I congratulate the noble Lord on that. As he pointed out, they make the approach more difficult and there is a higher burden on the defence. I am concerned that the amendments to subsection (3) would require the defence to prove two negatives: first, that the defendant did not know and, secondly, that he had no reason to believe. That is a detailed concern and lawyers who are cleverer than me can sort that out. I am pretty simple minded in this regard. I was struck, as was the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, by the difference in formulation between the child sex offences and the abuse of trust offences in terms of relying on the prosecution proving an appropriate reasonable belief. Why was that formulation not adopted? It would not involve the formulation proposed by the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="30401-33_para2"></a>I hope that the Minister will also explain why the Government found it necessary to change the approach from the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000. The current law has another formulation again in that legislation. I hope that he will explain why the Bill's formulation is effective. I rather suspect that he will find that difficult. I hope that he will be prepared to consider alternative formulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   In supporting the amendment I am clearly not privy to what is in the noble and learned Lord's brief. However, before he responds to the amendment, perhaps he would cast his eye up the page to the formulation in Clause 17(1)(d) which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A does not reasonably believe that B is 16 or over".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-33_para3"></a>
Why is there a difference between that formulation and this formulation in Clause 18?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   As the noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Thomas of Gresford, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, are aware, in child sex offences and in Clause 17 the burden is on the prosecution at all stages in relation to those identified. In this formulation the burden is on the defendant to prove that he believed that the child was of a different age from that which he was. That is perfectly ECHR compliant because that is within the knowledge of the defendant. We are advised that it would not be ECHR compliant to place the burden on the defendant to say that it is reasonable because that is not specifically within his knowledge. It should be for the prosecution to prove that it is unreasonable under the circumstances. That is why it has been done in that way.
<P>

<a name="30401-33_para4"></a>Does that lead to impossible comprehensibility for the jury? Can one put to the jury the question, "Has the defendant proved on the balance of probabilities that he believed that the other person was 18 or over?" If he has proved that, it is for the prosecution to prove that that belief was unreasonable. That is perfectly <P>


<a name="column_1276"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1276</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>manageable as far as concerns the jury. It has been done in that way because of the ECHR. If noble Lords think that it would be better to shift the burden back to the prosecution on the defendant's belief, perhaps they should think again between now and Report. That seems to me to be putting on to the prosecution a burden which is unrealistic. It is for the defendant to come forward with why he thought the belief was unreasonable. Perhaps I may say with the greatest diffidence that I believe that both the noble Lords, Lord Monson and Lord Thomas, underestimate the ability of the jury to understand that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I do not underestimate the ability of the jury to understand anything. I have had the experience of directing juries on many occasions. I know from a recent case that if juries are provided with a series of complicated questions to solve, they get it wrong. The simpler the issues which can be put before them the better.
<P>

<a name="30401-33_para5"></a>I am interested in the noble and learned Lord's comments on the impact of the European Convention on Human Rights. I shall consider that and discuss it with some of my noble friends who are deeply involved in that sort of litigation. It strikes me as curious that the reason for the formulation in Clause 17, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, where the prosecution have to prove that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A does not reasonably believe that B is 16 or over",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-33_para6"></a>
is because it is compatible with the ECHR.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The reason why it is ECHR compatible is that it could not possibly be unfair to the defendant to place the burden of both on the prosecution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-33_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the noble and learned Lord why in the 2000 Act it was phrased that he did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that B was under 18, or that B was a person to whom he was in a position of trust. The Government have chosen to change the formulation from the abuse of trust offence as enacted only just over two years ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   You have not indicated from the passage to which you referred where the burden lies&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-33_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I thank the noble Earl whose contribution to the debate so far, rightly, has been to ensure that we remember our manners. I apologise to the noble Baroness, who in referring to the 2000 Act did not indicate where the burden of proof lies. I am not sufficiently acquainted with that Act to know where the burden of proof lies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-33_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I believe the burden is on the defence. I shall consider the matter further.

<FONT SIZE=3>not satisfied with his explanation. There are things that we need to look at&#151;the compatibility with the 2000 Act and with other parts of the Bill. I have a sneaking suspicion that this part was drafted by somebody other than whoever drafted earlier parts of the Bill. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw.

<A NAME="30401-33_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford </B>   moved Amendment No. 98:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 7, line 43, leave out "the other person" and insert "B"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-33_para8"></a><P>

<a name="30401-33_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: These are the "B" resolutions. There is a raft of them, which your Lordships will see over the page in the Marshalled List. Again, it is purely a question of drafting. If we are going to use "A" and "B"&#151;an innovation in statutes that is not many years old&#151;they should be used consistently. That would make matters clearer when there was more than one person mentioned in a clause. That happens in some of the instances that are listed in my series of amendments. It is to alter the words "the other person" to "B". I would be interested to hear what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, has to say about it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-33_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The amendments, Amendment No. 98 and others seek to remove references to "the other person" in the abuse of trust offences and the familial child sex offences, and replace them with references to "B". I understand that the amendments are intended to achieve consistency of drafting. The reason for the different terminology is best explained by way of an example. In Clause 29(1), the references are to "A", the person committing the offence, and "B", the victim of the offence. They are hypothetical people, used to explain what is and what is not acceptable behaviour. In Clause 29(2) and (3), however, the references are to the defendant and the other person. That is because Clause 29(2) and (3) apply when criminal proceedings are under way. The people in question are no longer hypothetical. There is a real defendant, and it makes sense to refer to him as a defendant. We could refer to that other person as "B", but there is no need to complicate matters. Having referred to the defendant, it is perfectly obvious who the other person must be. For those reasons, to achieve consistency, the amendments are not necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-33_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   Clause 31(1) states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Conduct by a person (A) which would otherwise be an offence under section 28 or 29 against another person (B) is not an offence under that section if they are lawfully married at the time . . .  In proceedings for such an offence"&#151;

There is an inconsistency that runs through this, and for clarification, the letters should be used consistently. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30401-34_para6"></a><P>

<a name="30401-34_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 107 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 120, 129, 138 and 148.These all concern abuse of trust offences and are probing amendments related to the option of using summary procedure.
<P>

<a name="30401-34_para8"></a>For all of those offences, the Government have included the option of a summary conviction carrying a six-month sentence or a fine instead of the five-year sentence available on indictment. We will be returning to that five-year sentence in the next group of amendments, but at the moment I shall focus on the circumstances appropriate for using summary conviction.
<P>

<a name="30401-34_para9"></a>I have previously mentioned consistency within the Bill. I was looking to compare the abuse of trust provisions with the care worker provisions of Clauses 43 to 47. It seems to me that we are talking about the same kind of abuse of a relationship which is created in the abuse of trust provisions in relation to children, in relation to care worker offences and in relation to those who are mentally disordered.
<P>

<a name="30401-34_para10"></a>For the care worker offences, there is no option of summary conviction. My question to the Minister is: why are these two groups of offences treated differently? Is it in some senses always regarded as a more heinous offence if it involves a care worker with a mentally disordered person compared with the abuse of trust in relation to a child? If the Minister believes that it is appropriate to have the summary route, will he indicate in which circumstances that would arise?
<P>

<a name="30401-34_para11"></a>When we talked earlier about the options available for the "basic" sexual offences, we talked about a potentially wide range of activities within the clauses. When we are talking about the abuse of trust, we are talking about a particularly nasty aspect of sexual abuse. I find difficulty in seeing why that should have the option of the extremely lenient sentences available by way of summary conviction. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   These are probing amendments tabled by the noble Baroness in relation to why we should have summary offences. I shall deal with them in turn. The abuse of trust sexual activity <P>


<a name="column_1279"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1279</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>could plainly involve sexual intercourse between a 30 year-old nurse and a 17 year-old patient in his or her care in hospital and is plainly suitable for the Crown Court. It also covers the case of a nurse intentionally touching a patient's genital area in a sexual manner through his clothes entirely consensually. Is that suitable for the Crown Court? Sometimes it will be; in other cases it will not be.
<P>

<a name="30401-34_para12"></a>The noble Baroness moves her head not in agreement but indicating that that is tricky and she is right in relation to that. Surely, the CPS should be able to have the option in relation to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-34_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I am prompted to rise to indicate that I was not thinking that it was tricky but that it was not the kind of case that should be appearing in the courts at all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-34_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   A skilful answer. On that basis, I assume that she would not envisage the case appearing in the Crown Court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-34_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I agree.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-34_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The offence of abuse of position of trust causing a child to engage in sexual activity could cover the case where, for example, a Connexions adviser on one occasion caused a child to touch her own breasts in a sexual way, the child being at the high end of the age range. The abuse of trust inciting a child to engage in sexual activity could be, for example, a teacher asking two 17 year-old pupils to strip and they both refused or a teacher who shows 17 year-old pupils a sex video during a geography lesson. How serious are those? They could be charged in the Crown Court. Sometimes the case will not be serious enough to merit that and it is right that the CPS should have the option to bring it summarily.
<P>

<a name="30401-34_para13"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, says that the care worker offences are treated differently, but they are triable each way as well. That is my answer about a distinction being drawn; there was no distinction drawn, in effect. I hope that that helps and that the noble Baroness will be satisfied about the range of offending behaviour that justifies all these offences being triable each way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-34_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   Before the noble Baroness makes up her mind about the amendment, I wonder whether I can probe further on the abuse of positions of trust. It seems clear to me that all staff employed in residential institutions are well covered in this clause and the clauses immediately following. That would include part-time staff, caretakers, ancillary workers and such people. Is the Minister satisfied that workers of all kinds in non-residential establishments are covered and that social workers who come into contact with children as part of their professional duties are covered? Even people like social services inspectors who in the course of their duties have some contact with some children are covered. One could include <P>


<a name="column_1280"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1280</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>teachers and other workers in non-residential educational establishments. Can the Minister throw some light on those situations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-34_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Those are legitimate questions. We shall come to them in detail. Positions of trust are dealt with in Clauses 23 and 24. They are not restricted to residential situations. A position of trust can arise, for example, in educational settings and also in some kinds of care settings that we shall expand by way of amendment, where the person providing the care does not provide it in a domiciliary or residential setting. The question is well judged. Perhaps I may answer it when we come to Clauses 23 and 24, where the relevant provisions are to be found.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-34_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for his ever-more inventive examples of how the clauses will operate in practice, which I shall read carefully. I apologise for confusing him about the care worker offences. That actually relates to the next group of amendments. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30401-34_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 108:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-34_para15"></a><P>

<a name="30401-34_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: I now turn to the abuse of trust offences, the care worker offences and the sentences to be imposed. On conviction on indictment the sentence is five years for abuse of trust and seven years for the care worker offences. I want to tease out that comparison. I can see no real difference between the gravity of those two offences. Both involve the sexual exploitation of vulnerable people. I cannot see that the abuse of children under 18 by those in a position of trust is less heinous than abuse by a care worker of a mentally disordered person. In terms of long-term psychological trauma, I could make a case for the abuse of trust of a child being worthy of a stiffer penalty. The purpose of Amendment No. 108, together with Amendments Nos. 121, 130, 139 and 149, is to tease out the differences in approach between the two sections that mystified me. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-34_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   As the noble Baroness said, these amendments have the effect of increasing the maximum penalty to seven years. In drafting the Bill we have been assisted by the noble Baroness in a number of respects and we have been at pains to ensure that the maximum penalties for similar degrees of offending behaviour are proportionate and consistent.
<P>

<a name="30401-34_para17"></a>The primary purpose of the abuse of trust offences is to provide protection in criminal law for young people aged 16 and 17&#151;that is, above the legal age of consent&#151;who are considered to be particularly vulnerable to exploitation by those who hold a position of trust or authority in their lives. The offence is not designed to deal with other sexual offending behaviour&#151;such as sexual intercourse with a child under the age of consent or a non-consensual activity that falls within the scope of other sex offences.
<P>


<a name="column_1281"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1281</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-34_para18"></a>Although we consider such relationships to be wrong because of the abuse of trust involved, the offence relates to sexual activity that is ostensibly consensual. We feel that a maximum five-year penalty is sufficiently severe for sexual activity that was mutually agreed between an adult age 18 or over and a young person who was over the age of consent. Although the offences extend protection to children under the age of 16, where a child in that age group is involved we would expect the Crown Prosecution Service to charge one of the child sex offences instead, which carry a higher maximum penalty.
<P>

<a name="30401-34_para19"></a>While we want to send a clear message that sexual activity within relationships of trust is wrong, we do not think that the offence as I have described it merits a seven-year maximum penalty. The noble Baroness rightly drew attention to the more severe maximum penalties for breach-of-care offences, which are designed to protect persons with a mental disorder or learning disability. That particularly vulnerable group of people merit the extra protection offered by the deterrent of a higher maximum penalty.
<P>

<a name="30401-34_para20"></a>The young people protected by the offence to which the noble Baroness draws attention are essentially aged 16 or 17. We do not feel that they fall within the same category of vulnerability as those in the care offences with a mental disorder or learning disability. A seven-year maximum penalty on that basis for the offence of abuse of trust is disproportionate.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-35_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   It comes as news to me that the offences are intended only for 16 year-olds and 17 year-olds. From reading the clause, it is clearly intended to apply to children below the age of 13. The construction of the offences appears to apply to all children. I understand that the offence was originally introduced in response to unpleasant cases involving children's homes and so were clearly not intended only for 16 and 17 year-olds. I will reflect on the Minister's remarks. They seem perfectly reasonable but nevertheless, it is clear from the Bill that the abuse of trust provisions are designed for more than 16 and 17 year-olds. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

The younger one is not necessarily vulnerable or exploited, as the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, suggested.

<a name="30401-35_para4"></a>On Second Reading, I instanced the case of a strapping 17 year-old intelligent young man, possibly even a woman, in hospital with a broken wrist&#151;in other words, fully in possession of all his mental faculties but physically injured&#151;and an 18 year-old nurse in the same hospital and ward falling for one another. Even if no more than a kiss were exchanged, under the clause the nurse could end up in prison for a substantial period&#151;shades of the Taliban, or at least Saudi Arabia.
<P>

<a name="30401-35_para5"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, was kind enough to write to me after Second Reading to explain in so many words that the Government had no intention to be heavy-handed in the matter and, earlier today during our debate on child sex offences, he hinted that the law will be applied with a light touch. However, rightly, the Director of Public Prosecutions is chosen independently of the Government and the Government have no control of whether prosecutions are brought.
<P>

<a name="30401-35_para6"></a>So the amendment, which requires the consent of the Attorney-General when the age gap is tiny&#151;where the older person is under the age of 21&#151;would ensure that prosecutions were brought only in genuinely serious cases. As I interpret what was said earlier, that accords with the Government's broad intentions in the matter.
<P>

<a name="30401-35_para7"></a>I have not sought to apply that safeguard to other clauses for good reason. Clauses 19 and 20, which we shall debate in a moment, are somewhat ambivalent and need clarification. Clauses 21 and 22 are by no means ambivalent but deal with perverted rather than normal sexual behaviour, which has nothing to do with mutual affection, so the safeguard that I urge for Clause 18 is neither necessary nor desirable for them. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   This is another example of a case where the noble Lord identifies circumstances in which it would plainly be inappropriate to bring a prosecution. He suggests the unique protection of the Attorney-General stepping in compared to all the other sexual offences in the Bill, in relation to which prosecution is at the discretion of the Crown Prosecution Service.
<P>

<a name="30401-35_para8"></a>Although the new offences of abuse of trust are drawn slightly more widely than the offence enacted by the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000, this offence does not raise any new issues about prosecution. Decisions about whether prosecution is in the public interest are made by the Crown <P>


<a name="column_1283"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1283</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Prosecution Service. I am unaware that that has given rise to any difficulty. We expect the CPS to continue to exercise its discretion wisely. We in Parliament cannot define how that should be done. The Attorney-General's time would be unnecessarily spent considering such prosecutions. The code for Crown prosecutors contains detailed guidance about the circumstances in which prosecution is in the public interest. They will be updated as a matter of standard practice following the Bill's enactment.
<P>

<a name="30401-35_para9"></a>Although I fully understand why the noble Lord moved the amendment, the protection that he proposes goes too far to deal with the problem that he identifies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-35_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his reply; it is rather as I expected. However, I am slightly heartened by it. The Government's heart is obviously in the right place on this one. I hope that their expectations are fulfilled and that no "rogue prosecution" takes place. I of course reserve the right to consider the matter before Report, but with that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-35_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the noble and learned Lord to clarify Clause 19 and, to save time, Clause 20, although technically we have not yet reached it. Clause 19 deals with causing a child to engage in sexual activity. At first glance the provision seems to indicate that it covers causing a child to engage in sexual activity with a third party, but it does not actually say so. I suppose that it could be extended to cover causing a child to engage in sexual activity with the instigator, so to speak. Similarly, as regards <P>


<a name="column_1284"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1284</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 20, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, the same slight doubt arises. Can the noble and learned Lord confirm or otherwise that both clauses are confined to causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity with a third party and not with the older person, so to speak, or the person in a deemed position of trust?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-35_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Clause 19 not only covers cases where the adult makes the child engage in sexual activity, for example sexual intercourse with the adult himself, but also where he makes the child engage in such activity with a third party, so it covers both. Similarly, in relation to Clause 20 the offence will cover situations where the offender incites the child to engage in sexual activity with him as well as with a third party.

<A NAME="30401-35_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton </B>   moved Amendment No. 150:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 22, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-35_para34"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "ABUSE OF POSITION OF TRUST: ACTS DONE IN SCOTLAND
<br>
 Anything which, if done in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, would constitute an offence under any of sections 18 to 22 also constitutes that offence if done in Scotland."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30401-35_para35"></a>The noble Lord said: The primary purpose of the "abuse of trust" offences is to provide protection in the criminal law for young people aged 16 and 17 (that is, above the legal age of consent) in circumstances where they are particularly vulnerable to being manipulated into an ostensibly consensual relationship by an adult (over 18) who holds a position of trust or authority in their lives.
<P>

<a name="30401-35_para36"></a>The existing offence in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 has not yet been implemented in Scotland. It is the intention of the Scottish authorities to implement that offence rather than the wider offence that we are now introducing in this Bill. This gives us some cause for concern. We are anxious that there should not be a loophole in our legislation <P>


<a name="column_1285"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1285</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that would enable someone to evade prosecution by committing the act in another part of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30401-35_para37"></a>We are concerned to protect, for example, the 16 year-old who goes on a school trip to Scotland and agrees to have sexual intercourse there with one of his tutors. We are closing this gap by introducing Amendment No. 150, which provides that any act that would constitute an abuse of trust offence if committed in England and Wales will also be an offence under the law of England and Wales if the act takes place in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="30401-35_para38"></a>In the interests of enhancing the protection offered for young people under the criminal law, I respectfully ask the Committee to accept the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Can the noble Lord say how that provision dovetails in with the Scottish jurisdiction? I have in mind an offence actually committed in Scotland&#151;perhaps even by a Scot, who is resident in Scotland&#151;against a child who happens to be on summer camp or taking part in a Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme, or whatever, but who is in fact resident in England. Can the noble Lord say how that squares with Scottish jurisdiction? My understanding is that it is a reserved matter for Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The noble Baroness asks a good question. The best course for me would be to write to the noble Baroness on the subject.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   The noble Baroness has made a very good point. If the position of trust arises in Scotland as regards a person who lives in Scotland and he is in that position only because he is running a summer camp, I do not see how England and Wales would have jurisdiction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister for his response. He quite honestly said that he did not have the answer, but that he would write to me on the matter. With no malign intent whatever, I ask that this clause should not stand part of the Bill until the next stage of the proceedings. At that point we shall all be satisfied with the technical answer as to why this would work under such jurisdiction. There is a sufficient question mark over how it would work. Therefore, I believe that the clause should not stand part of the Bill at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am not sure that there is that big a question mark over the status of this part of the legislation. I ask the noble Baroness, and the noble Lord who echoed her concerns, to accept that we shall write to clarify the point. When I moved amendments earlier this evening similar provisions were made. Therefore, I believe we probably are on good ground: it is simply a technical matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am sorry. It may be a technical matter, but it is also possible that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, is right in saying that this <P>


<a name="column_1286"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1286</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will not work. Nothing will be lost by not passing the clause at this point and leaving it to the next stage of the proceedings. It will be a simple, technical matter of accepting it as part of the Bill on Report. Given the fact that the noble Lord does not have an answer to my question, it would be quite inappropriate to consider whether it should stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I support my noble friend in her argument. As the Minister is unable to provide an answer to a clear question, it would not be proper to pursue the amendment until that aspect is clarified. If it is a simple, technical matter, the amendment can be dealt with straightforwardly on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   We have had a very good natured and tolerant discussion this evening. It is probably a very simple matter. No harm will arise from leaving the situation as it is. I am sure that we can satisfy all Members of the Committee in the course of correspondence. Indeed, that is probably the best way to leave the matter at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Does that mean that the noble Lord wishes the amendment to stand part of the Bill? If that is so, I shall object. The noble Lord is goading us into voting on the matter. It should not stand part of the Bill. The noble Lord has nothing to fear. It is the convention of this House that, once a clause is deemed part of the Bill by the whole House, we do not put it back in or take it out again as it is deemed to have been determined.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Perhaps it may help that I now have an answer to the question, or at least part of the answer. My understanding is that the new clause gives extra territorial jurisdiction to England and Wales courts. If the acts undertaken also constitute offences in Scotland, Scottish courts would also have jurisdiction. I think that that clarifies the point. In those terms, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am sorry, but the noble Lord argued that the rationale for including this clause in the Bill was to prevent a gap, with the Scottish Parliament introducing the law into their own land. Therefore, it will not have jurisdiction because there is a gap, which the noble Lord admitted. This is merely a stop-gap. If the noble Lord insists on his amendment, I shall oppose it.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para0"></a>It seems perfectly reasonable and civil&#151;and the Minister has nothing to lose by doing this&#151;to leave this matter to the next stage of the Bill so that we can all be assured that the technical explanation that he is not giving at this moment is acceptable. If the noble Lord is as confident as he appears, it will be almost on-the-nod acceptance at the next stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   It is not a question of losing the whole clause; it is simply a matter of the Government withdrawing their amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   We are confident of our position. If the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, wants to <P>


<a name="column_1287"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1287</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>press it, it is entirely a matter for her. But that is not a sensible way to proceed. It would be unfortunate and would make poor use of time that we should be spending on more important parts of the Bill that are still to be considered today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-36_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The noble Lord has no answer to our question. The answer that he read out made no sense whatever. He said that the matter could be dealt with by Scottish jurisdiction. In the mean time, we have been told that the whole point of this amendment is to cover a lacuna between the period of this Bill going on to the statute book and Scottish law coming into effect when they could deal with this in Scotland. I do not think that this amendment should be accepted.

<a name="column_1288"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1288</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para6"></a>In considering why the abuse of trust provisions should cover youth groups, I believe that it would be helpful to recount how it was that the Government first came to introduce them. The amendments seek to bring consistency to the clauses covering abuse of trust.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para7"></a>I turn first to the Utting report which looked into the safeguards relating to children living away from home. In 1997 Sir William Utting concluded that child abusers were,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"frequently in a position of responsibility, authority and trust".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-36_para8"></a>
Paedophiles often seek out positions of trust over young people. We have seen many examples of that, in particular in the North Wales case. In the February 2000 report of that case by Sir Ronald Waterhouse, abuse of trust was uncovered on a massive scale. The Waterhouse inquiry found that the notorious paedophile, Reginald "Gary" Cooke, abused children while he worked in a children's home. Cooke had also worked as a nurse and as an assistant warden in a probation hostel.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para9"></a>The 2000 Act which followed the Waterhouse inquiry introduced abuse of trust legislation to cover all these positions; that is, social workers in children's homes, nurses who look after children, and probation officers. But as far as Cooke was concerned, what was significant was that the Waterhouse inquiry found that most of his proved abuse took place under circumstances where children were not in care. It took place through friendships developed in youth groups. Cooke abused children first by using his position as a youth group leader and then as an instructor in the Army cadets. Those are two positions not covered by the existing law or by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para10"></a>Some of the worst abuse uncovered by the inquiry was perpetrated on boy B, whose life was wrecked by abuse which took place through meeting Cooke in two youth groups. A paragraph in the report draws the case to the attention of Parliament. In his evidence to the inquiry, B argued that Cooke,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"took advantage of him when he was in need of friendship".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-36_para11"></a>
The abuse started within two weeks of meeting Cooke at a youth club, when B was aged 16. Later on when Cooke was an instructor in the Army cadets, he also abused B. The abuse continued until B was 18 years old. Cooke also "farmed out" boy B to be abused by other men.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para12"></a>It was because of cases like this that I and my late noble friend Lady Young sought to move amendments to the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill which would have brought youth group leaders into the category of holding a position of trust.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para13"></a>As I said at Second Reading, I am disappointed that provision has not been made in the Bill to protect young people in youth groups such as the scouts and guides. Three years ago, the Lord Privy Seal, when Attorney-General, was sympathetic to extending abuse of trust provisions to youth group leaders, but the Home Secretary has failed to act. I wonder why. What is the argument for not using his order-making powers?
<P>


<a name="column_1289"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1289</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para14"></a>Amendment No. 157 defines the new position of trust as youth worker A in a specialist organisation who looks after B who attends the group. I accept that community groups which include a mix of adults and young people would not be covered by the amendment as they do not offer a specialist service for young people. The leader of a local ramblers' group would not be covered, but a scout group leader would be.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para15"></a>No doubt the resources of the Home Office could come up with a better amendment. In order to encourage this, my Amendment No. 162 adopts an alternative approach, leaving it to the Home Secretary to define positions of trust held by youth and community workers and to use his order-making powers under Clause 23(1)(b). It would give the Home Secretary six months in which to act after the Bill's commencement.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para16"></a>Amendment No. 161, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, brings registered sports coaches within the abuse of trust provisions. The Government are very keen on encouraging young people to become involved in sport, and various coaching schemes are available. If more and more children are to be involved in such schemes, it is right that an attempt is made to extend the protection of the clause to them. I welcome the amendment for that reason. The noble Lord will know that there is some very impressive work going on with football clubs linking up with schools and working with not just vulnerable children but all children.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para17"></a>Three years ago, I moved two amendments to the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill, which I am delighted to find now form part of subsections (6) and (7) of Clause 23. My amendments, now accepted by the Government, extended the abuse of trust provisions to learning mentors, otherwise known as Connexions personal advisers and personal advisers for children leaving council care. I welcome the Government's change of heart. The reason they have acted is because they now accept that Connexions personal advisers and advisers for children leaving care are situations in which the relationship of trust is particularly strong. Because of this, there is a potential vulnerability to exploitation.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para18"></a>I argue that this same strong relationship of trust is also true of supervisors appointed under the Children Act 1989 who have a legal duty placed on them to befriend children. When parents are in dereliction of particular duties, the court can make a supervision order under Section 35 of the Children Act. Supervisors appointed under the order may help ensure that medical care is obtained or help to provide access to friends or a non-resident parent.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para19"></a>A supervisor has a specific duty under Section 35(1)(a) of the 1989 Act,

the child. That is the legal obligation on supervisors. Surely that is a strong relationship of trust.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para21"></a>Supervisors can be social workers or probation officers. My amendment also covers supervisors appointed as a result of an education supervision order&#151;or ESO&#151;also made under the Children Act, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>usually because a child is not being properly educated. Such an order may seek to secure the child's attendance at school. In paragraph 12(1)(a) of Schedule 3 to the Children Act, the duty of the supervisor appointed under an education supervision order is also to advise, assist and befriend the child.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para22"></a>The Waterhouse report noted that no less a figure than Derek Brushett, a highly esteemed social worker who later became the deputy head of the social services inspectorate in Wales, turned out to be a paedophile. He is serving a 14-year sentence for abusing children. If such a case is possible, surely it is reasonable to bring supervisors under the abuse of trust provisions.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para23"></a>At times of great emergency in the life of a child, a court can appoint a person to safeguard the child's interests under Section 41 of the Children Act 1989. Until 2000, these officers were known as guardians ad litem. Now they are known as officers of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service. The role of the officer is to represent the child and his interests in legal proceedings. In practice this involves consulting the child as to his wishes and attempting to gain the child's confidence. In extremis a child can become very trusting of those whose advice he or she depends upon. How could it ever be acceptable for an officer of the court to become sexually involved with a child he is appointed to protect? Surely there is a case for bringing them under the abuse of trust provisions.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para24"></a>My Amendment No. 160 brings registered childminders within the scope of the Bill's abuse of trust provisions. Childminders are in a position of very real trust as they are clearly in loco parentis. They may look after a child in the child's own home. They may do so several days a week. They will usually be unmonitored for most of the time that they are with the child. That gives huge scope for abuse. Childminders have to be registered under Part XA of the Children Act 1989. Failure to register is an offence. This, therefore, represents a clearly defined category of persons to whom the abuse of trust offence can be applied.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para25"></a>The NSPCC surveyed almost 3,000 young people about sexual abuse. Of those who reported sexual abuse by a non-relative, 2 per cent said they had been subjected to penetrative acts or oral sex by a babysitter. By comparison less than 1 per cent reported the same type of abuse by a teacher. Some 2 per cent reported voyeurism with a babysitter. Less than 1 per cent report voyeurism with a teacher.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para26"></a>In May 2001, a childminder was gaoled for a year for sex with a boy of 13. Ann Timmins, a 40 year-old, carried out more than 40 sexual acts on the boy, often while her own children were present. She admitted indecent assault and gross indecency. In September 2002, Brian Park, a registered childminder, was remanded into custody after pleading guilty to making an indecent image of a child and possessing child pornography with intent to distribute. His wife, also a childminder, had taken a photograph of a child in her care which Mr Park then doctored to include a sexual photograph of himself. It is true that not all babysitters will be covered by this amendment, only registered childminders.

<P>

<a name="30401-36_para27"></a>In February this year, Robert Ireland, a 56 year-old, was sentenced to 15 months for indecently assaulting two girls. He had babysat for the girls while their mothers were out socialising. The two girls were aged nine and 11. Peter Hatchett, 23, conducted a campaign of sexual abuse against young girls while acting as a babysitter. He admitted 12 offences of indecent assault and seven of taking indecent photographs of a child. He assaulted six girls between three and 11 years of age over a three-year period. He also took more than 250 indecent pictures of his victims. Clearly, abuse by babysitters is a problem which must be addressed.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para28"></a>Clause 23(5) addresses abuse by teachers&#151;a recognised problem. The NSPCC survey at the very least demonstrates that the abuse of trust provisions must also tackle abuse by those who look after children at home. It may be that the Home Office could improve the drafting but the amendment describes a precise category of persons&#151;those registered under Part XA of the Children Act 1989, which lays down a detailed scheme for the registration of childminders.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para29"></a>Nannies and au pairs, for example, would be caught only if they happened to be registered. Not all babysitters would be covered but the measure begins to address the problem and does so in reliance on an existing statutory definition.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para30"></a>It is difficult to catch every person in a category. For example, not all teachers are covered by Clause 23(5). Only if the victim is a full-time pupil and the teacher teaches regularly at that child's school will the abuse be caught. I have tabled later amendments that will widen those provisions. But a real attempt is being made to address an identified problem of teacher abuse.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para31"></a>The issue of babysitters may be an even bigger problem. Clearly, some attempt must be made in this clause to address it. Some will say that childminders tend to deal with children under 16 where other sexual offences will catch them even without applying abuse of trust. That may be true but the point of the abuse of trust offence is that it works in tandem with other sexual offences in order to ensure that the abuse of a position of trust to facilitate sexual crime is reflected both in the definition of the offence and in the sentence.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para32"></a>The Government rightly do not limit abuse of trust to victims over 16. There is an overlap between abuse of trust and the age of consent offences and, indeed, with non-consensual offences. That ensures that the seriousness of breach of trust is recognised.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para33"></a>In any event, over-16s also need protection. A childminder may be employed to look after all the children in the home. A family with five children aged two to 16 might decide that the 16 year-old is not quite responsible enough to look after his younger siblings, and so employ a childminder to look after all of them. The 16 year-old is therefore in regular contact with the registered childminder, even though he is not the primary reason why the childminder is there.

<A NAME="30401-36_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   I added my name to Amendment No. 151, and I speak particularly to my own amendment, Amendment No. 161, which provides an opportunity to specify that sports coaches should be included in the categories of positions of trust.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para35"></a>The coach holds an influential position with a young athlete. In many situations, he will have the power to determine the events or competitions in which an athlete will participate, and indeed the athlete's long-term career opportunities. Many young athletes, particularly those participating at county and national level, will spend long periods with their coach away from home and from parental or other forms of external supervision. The high level of dependency that the young athlete has on the coach creates a high level of vulnerability. Regrettably, there is significant evidence that some coaches have exploited their position of power and influence over the young athletes in their charge.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para36"></a>The establishment of the NSPCC's Child Protection in Sport Unit has provided sport with a simple referral point for concerns about abuse of trust. The unit works in close partnership with Sport England, the Sports Council for Northern Ireland and the Sports Council for Wales. In the past 12 months, a number of sports have reported cases where an inappropriate and abusive relationship between an adult coach and a young athlete has developed and led to serious concerns.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para37"></a>Many young athletes participate in sports at a county or national level. Some 1,400 young people are on the UK world-class star performance programme, funded directly by the lottery. Young athletes need the protection afforded to other 16 year-olds and 17 year-olds where there is a situation of trust, to ensure that national sport can develop and provide top athletes without the fear of sexual exploitation.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para38"></a>The NSPCC has brought several cases to my attention that underline the importance of strengthening the law in the area. As the hour is so late, I shall refer to only two of them. The first is that of a 17 year-old national champion who reported a number of sexual assaults committed by her coach at the residential training centre, and at a number of international competitions. The coach admitted having sexual intercourse with her but claimed that that was consensual, and no criminal action was taken. Following her complaint to the national governing body, it was disclosed to the NSPCC that a number of allegations had been made previously by other female athletes, but again no action had been taken. The coach continues to work and the athlete has now left the national squad.
<P>


<a name="column_1293"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1293</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para39"></a>The second case concerns a national governing body that received a number of complaints against a national coach by members of an under-21 national squad. The allegations were that the coach was exploiting his position and having sexual relationships with team members. Internal disciplinary action was taken, although again the coach retained his position.
<P>

<a name="30401-36_para40"></a>The issue deserves a good deal of consideration in the Bill. I hope that my noble and learned friend will give some indication that the Government are prepared to widen the position of trust provision to include athletes and sports coaches.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-37_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   The amendments in this group were tabled by my noble friend Lady Blatch but they also appear in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Astor. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lady Blatch for making such a powerful case when the abuse of trust provisions were first introduced. On that occasion, her pleas did not result in the amendments that she sought but she is again seeking to secure them.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para0"></a>We support the amendments. The abuse of trust provisions are extremely important but they are very narrowly conceived. They are basically conceived only for institutions. While the most notorious cases of sexual offence against children&#151;in the Waterhouse report, for example&#151;largely concerned activities in institutions, it is important that the Act goes as far as possible to deal with those situations in which positions of trust, positions of authority or other opportunities arise in relation to children. That is why we support the amendments tabled by my noble friend. The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, made a powerful case for extending the provisions. We also support that.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para1"></a>The abuse of trust provisions need to have the maximum possible impact on as many potentially harmful relationships as possible. That is why we believe that they should be extended widely. Amendment No. 162, which requires the Secretary of State to specify conditions for youth and community workers, is particularly important because it will allow an even wider group of people to be brought in.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, and the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, have proposed powerful reasons for extending the positions of trust in Clause 23. I expect that when the noble and learned Lord replies, he will tell us precisely what is meant by subsection (1)(b). What mechanism will be in place to widen positions of trust? We are in principle in favour of the amendments and in particular of Amendment No. 162. Whether it is right to attempt to specify every single position is a matter about which we should like to think more. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord can help us in that regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I support the general direction of the amendments. I believe that the law concerning abuse of trust should be as comprehensive as possible. The Minister may reflect on whether mentoring, for example, is covered. That is a rather fashionable <P>


<a name="column_1294"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1294</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>remedy for many problems affecting people under 18. No one wants to make recruitment more difficult than it need be in relation to responsible and much-needed posts and volunteers who engage in socially important work. However, employers have a duty to make clear to candidates for such posts and to volunteers what is and what is not a position of responsibility involving trust.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   These are very important provisions. It is worth emphasising that the primary purpose of the abuse of trust offence is to provide protection in the criminal law for young people who are over the age of consent&#151;16 or 17&#151;and who are considered to be particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse within an ostensibly consensual sexual relationship.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para2"></a>The drafting of the offence covers young people below the age of 16 but it is hard to imagine that an offence would ever be prosecuted in relation to someone who was under 16 because that would involve sexual activity with someone who was under the age of consent, and one would never need to deploy the abuse of trust clause because that would lead to a lower maximum sentence.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para3"></a>The reality of these offences, rightly, is that they focus on 16 and 17 year-olds. The offence is not designed to catch other sexual offending behaviour, such as sexual intercourse with a child under the age of consent or non-consensual activity which fall within the scope of a range of other sex offences. It is important to focus on that. One has to keep it within some bounds because the law has decided that with persons over 16, while trust should not be abused, they are capable of forming sexual relationships.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para4"></a>In determining the positions of trust that merit intervention by the criminal law, some principles need to be set out. We have been guided by three criteria: first, the individual who is particularly vulnerable, for example on probation or in residential care; secondly, the location and/or lack of access to other adults and absence of countervailing influence makes the individual particularly vulnerable; and thirdly, the special influence of the adult: the relationship is in loco parentis.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para5"></a>We believe that the categories we are now adding to the offence&#151;Connexions and personal advisers and those supervising young people in the community in pursuance of an order made in the criminal justice system&#151;meet the criteria in full. They additionally merit inclusion because the state appointed them and compelled the young person into the relationship not through the young person's or their family's own choice.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para6"></a>I shall deal with the particular classes suggested. The first, as proposed by the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, is that of childminders. The question is whether a registered childminder of a 16 or 17 year-old should be regarded as in a relationship of trust which requires this particular special protection. Applying the tests, is the individual particularly vulnerable; does the location and/or lack <P>


<a name="column_1295"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1295</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of access to other adults and absence of countervailing influence make the individual particularly vulnerable, and is there a special influence of the adult? We believe that it is difficult to see that the tests are made out in relation to childminders.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para7"></a>Secondly, I refer to sports coaches. My initial reaction to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, was that they would not fall within the category. However, presumably without knowing what my notes state, the noble Lord seemed to hit the spot in respect of a large number of the criteria, particularly as he described a picture in certain circumstances of the vulnerable adult being isolated because of the control that a sports coach has. I am not in a position to give any guarantees or assurances to the noble Lord. We need to consider the matter. I see the force in what he said. I also see difficulties in how one defines a sports coach to try to capture what he describes.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para8"></a>Thirdly, I refer to voluntary youth workers. This is very wide. It seems that the three criteria do not apply as clearly as in relation to sports coaches. As regards the appointment of guardians ad litem or supervisors under the provisions of the Children Act 1999, such persons are outside the control of the child or his family. They cover children up to the age of 18. I fully accept the points made by the noble Baroness that in such cases one would try to establish a relationship of trust, particularly in circumstances where the child might be vulnerable. Those seem worthy of further consideration. I shall further consider those between now and Report.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para9"></a>Therefore, we shall consider sports coaches, guardians ad litem and supervisors but can give no assurances. On the basis of the criteria we are applying, voluntary youth workers and childminders do not seem to me to be appropriate, remembering that we are focusing on 16 or 17 year-olds. Perhaps I may return to the issues I identified on Report as they certainly merit further consideration.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para10"></a>Amendment No. 162, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, would require the Secretary of State to make an order under the provisions of Section 23(1)(b) to specify conditions relating to youth and community workers. They will not be needed for the reasons that I am rejecting that particular part of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para11"></a>On the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, on when the Secretary of State will apply his powers under Clause 23(1)(b), I hope that by indicating what the criteria are, I am indicating the approach that he would take in relation to it. In the light of the assurances that I have given, I hope that all the amendments will either be withdrawn or not moved.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I find the Minister's arguments convincing&#151;in particular, his references to childminders. It is almost inconceivable that a 16 or 17 year-old would have a childminder. If a childminder was employed in the household, it would surely be to <P>


<a name="column_1296"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1296</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>look after the younger brother or sister of the 16 or 17 year-old. If a relationship were to develop between the older child in the household and a childminder, that would not be the state's business.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-37_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am grateful for the thoughtful reply of the noble and learned Lord. I will start with childminders, as they have just been mentioned. I count myself among those mothers who would not regard their 16 year-old as the right person to look after smaller children. I have three smaller children, twins and a single child. I would not have asked my 16 year-old to look after them. So it was not uncommon for me, and I suspect many other mothers, to have a babysitter to look after the children if we were not at home.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para12"></a>I must also say that, because of the lowering of the age of consent, if a sexual relationship had been established between the person babysitting and my daughter, or the babysitter and my son, and he or she was 16 or over, then that would have been entirely legal. There would be no protection whatever. I and my husband would have gone out, leaving this person in loco parentis over my children. That corrupting relationship would have been legal. I would have seen it as a corrupting relationship, because I would not have left the babysitter behind to have a sexual relationship with one of my children, whatever the age. That is an argument that needs to be returned to.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para13"></a>Regarding sports coaches, I am grateful for the Minister's response, because it is not just the instances cited by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester; there is a great deal of one-to-one coaching in the sports field. There are personal trainers and all sorts of special relationships. There is some impressive work, almost social work, taking place between some football clubs and schools, where there is a close relationship with some children who are perhaps not supported well at home, and the club knows about that. So I am grateful to the Minister. I am also grateful for him referring to the guardian ad litem relationship, because that can be a particularly sensitive relationship, at a particularly sensitive time in the life of the family and the child.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para14"></a>I am very surprised at the Minister's reaction to the voluntary provisions for community workers. I do not know how much knowledge the noble and learned Lord has of the field of youth and community workers. I know from my own county, and having been involved with young people for many years, that some interesting relationships are struck between youth workers and the young people who come before them. There are weekend camps, trips into the country, boating arrangements, sailing, climbing and walking. They are gatherings when, again, young 16 and 17 year-olds are in relationships that can be taken advantage of. If it was one's daughter or son, and a sexual relationship was struck between that person who was in a position of trust, then the parent would look to have some protection for their children&#151;when they have paid money and allowed them to go away for <P>


<a name="column_1297"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1297</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the weekend in the charge of such a person. I hope that the Minister will not close his mind entirely on that example.
<P>

<a name="30401-37_para15"></a>There are so many people outside the provisions that I have asked for. The three tests that the Minister gave&#151;vulnerability, location and lack of access for young people in a particular situation, and the special influence of the adult&#151;are three that I had in mind when I was thinking of youth and community workers. Certainly the voluntary sector, including people who take young people away on Duke of Edinburgh Award expeditions, are in a position of trust. Families, in good faith, allow their children to go away in the charge of these people, knowing that they will be protected. If they happen to have passed that magic age of 16, then there is no protection. Whatever happens, whatever sexual activity is involved, at that point it is a legal activity and I believe the parents deserve more of a guarantee of the safety of their children. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage, but shall return to some aspects of it.

<a name="30401-38_para12"></a>There can be absolutely no doubt at all that the numbers of young people aged 14 or over who study part-time will greatly increase. Many more of them will study in school for three or four days a week and take extra courses in other institutions or gain vocational training with employers.

<a name="30401-38_para13"></a>If this happens, under the Bill these young people will no longer be in a position of trust in relation to their teachers. They may spend most of their time at school, but not all of it. Because of this, they will cease to be full-time pupils and therefore be outside the abuse of trust provisions of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-38_para14"></a>The situation post-16 already includes substantial provision for young people to study part-time in sixth-form colleges or in school sixth forms. None of these young people will be protected by the Bill.

<A NAME="30401-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I intervene helpfully to indicate that I shall accept the amendment in principle for all the reasons that the noble Baroness is about to explain; namely, that between the ages of 16 and 17 the anomaly between full time and part time is difficult to maintain. Sitting next door to each other in the same class there will be some pupils who are full time and others who are part time. The definition of full time is for funding purposes and not for relationships with teachers.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-38_para18"></a><P>

<a name="30401-38_para19"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: The abuse of trust offences are primarily designed to protect young people aged 16 and 17 who, even though they are over the age of consent for sexual activity, are vulnerable to being manipulated into a sexual relationship by an adult who holds a position of trust or authority in relation to them, and thereby has a considerable amount of power and influence over their lives.
<P>

<a name="30401-38_para20"></a>Clause 23 provides a full list of circumstances in which a position of trust exists, including a number of institutions where children are looked after by adults. Thus, for example, the offence would criminalise a consensual sexual relationship between someone who teaches in an educational institution and a pupil receiving education at that institution. In an educational institution it is possible for some students to be over the age of 18 and for them to adopt a certain level of trust in relation to other students who are still under 18; for example, a head boy, or head girl or a prefect who supervises homework or detention periods.
<P>

<a name="30401-38_para21"></a>It was suggested at Second Reading that as drafted the abuse of trust offences would criminalise a consensual sexual relationship between, for example, the 18 year-old head boy of a school and his 17 year-old girl friend who attends the same school. That was never our intention. We have tabled Amendment No. 155 so that the offence will not apply where A and B are both pupils receiving full-time education at the same institution. I am aware that an amendment has been tabled in relation to part-time students, but perhaps I can deal with that point separately. I beg to move.

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 11, line 25, leave out "regularly"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-38_para27"></a><P>

<a name="30401-38_para28"></a>The noble Baroness said: It is common for staff or temporary staff to be employed for a whole host of reasons in the public services. They may be employed to cover for illness or staff who are away on training. Clause 24(2) states that a person in a position of trust,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"looks after persons under 18 if he is regularly involved in caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of such persons".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-38_para29"></a>
Clause 24(3) stipulates that the offender must be,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-38_para30"></a>
the victim.
<P>

<a name="30401-38_para31"></a>Does that requirement rule out a supply teacher? Does it protect children from temporary social work staff who work in children's homes? I suspect that the Minister cannot give a definitive answer because the word "regularly" is open to interpretation. I asked that question at Second Reading and among all the letters sent to noble Lords who spoke in the debate, there was no answer to my particular question on the definition of "regularly".
<P>

<a name="30401-38_para32"></a>Child protection should not turn on the definition of one word or be left to chance. My amendment would delete "regularly" because wherever abuse occurs in Clause 24, it affects all those in positions of trust under the Bill. The abuse of trust offences all hinge on the definition of what it means regularly to look after a young person.
<P>

<a name="30401-38_para33"></a>A supply teacher or other temporary worker who abused a child in their care could claim that the section does not apply simply by arguing that their involvement with the child was not regular but occasional, infrequent or irregular. Some supply teachers work just one day at a school in a period of several months&#151;but could commit an offence.
<P>

<a name="30401-38_para34"></a>I am particularly concerned about schools because they routinely use supply teachers&#151;never more so than now. They are not covered by the provisions in Clause 23(5) because the supply teacher does not regularly look after a pupil. Social work departments use agencies to provide social workers to cover for absences or staff shortages. Children's homes and detention centres likewise employ temporary staff.
<P>

<a name="30401-38_para35"></a>The three amendments seek to bring temporary or non-regular staff within the definition of a position of trust in Clause 23: temporary staff who look after young people in Clause 23(2); temporary staff in children's homes in Clause 23(3); temporary staff in care homes or hospitals in Clause 23(4); supply teachers in Clause 23(5); temporary mentors in Clause 23(6); temporary personal advisers in Clause 23(7); and temporary staff in youth offending teams in Clause 23(8).
<P>

<a name="30401-38_para36"></a>Some of your Lordships will remember the supply teacher Amy Gehring, who was in the headlines a year ago. She was cleared of indecently assaulting two brothers age 14 and 15 but after the trial owned up to having sex with other pupils. In an interview on <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>"Today", Ms Gehring&#151;a 26 year-old supply teacher&#151;admitted to a sexual encounter with a 16 year-old pupil. She claimed that she had been too drunk to remember whether she had also had sex with a boy of 15 at another school at which she had taught. Gehring was quoted as saying:

<a name="30401-38_para37"></a><P>

<a name="30401-38_para38"></a>Amy Gehring admitted her involvement with boys at several schools. Her case proves that young people need protection from supply teachers&#151;just as they do from any teacher.
<P>

<a name="30401-38_para39"></a>If Amy Gehring had been a full-time teacher, the boys would have been protected by the abuse of trust legislation. Only by deleting "regularly" can we be sure that supply teachers are covered. Other temporary staff in positions of trust ought also to be covered. When a young person in school is abused by a teacher, it should not matter whether the teacher is full time or part time. If the person is in a position of trust, they ought to be caught by the Bill's provisions. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-39_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My name and that of my noble friend Lord Astor of Hever also appear against this amendment which we strongly support. It cannot be sensible to make the offence dependent on regular contact. The nature of the position creates the relationship that can be abused&#151;and that relationship can begin from the outset of the child's exposure to the individual.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-39_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I want rapidly to add my support to my noble friend Lady Blatch. On Second Reading, I said that she ought to consider bringing part-time teachers within the clause. I am delighted that she has done so and hope that the Minister is too.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I hope that I can reassure the Committee. What constitutes "regular" will depend on the particular factor or individual situation, but is obviously expected to cover not only the full-time class teacher or matron in a children's home but, for example, the peripatetic teacher who takes a child for music lessons once a week; the supply teacher who provides cover during the maternity leave of the regular teacher; or the physiotherapist who treats a child daily during a short period of convalescence in hospital. The distinction chosen in the Bill is not between part or full-time, it is "regular".
<P>

<a name="30401-39_para0"></a>If the requirement that the adult looks after the child on a regular basis were to be removed, as the noble Baronesses, Lady Blatch and Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, propose, the offence would prohibit sexual relationships between, for example, a 17 year-old and the supply teacher who covers for only one day while the regular teacher is off sick. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, argues that it is the position of authority that is important. It is for her to consider whether she wants 16 and 17 year-olds <P>


<a name="column_1302"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column 1302</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to have that degree of restriction. In the Amy Gehring case, the supply teacher was, I believe, teaching for more than a full term.
<P>

<a name="30401-39_para1"></a>As for the nurse who looks after a 17 year-old during a one-day stay in hospital, is there to be no allowance for a relationship to occur after the stay in hospital comes to an end? The intervention of the criminal law in such cases should be proportionate to the protection required. Would that be an undue interference in a relationship between two consenting adults? The effect of removing the word "regularly" would be to achieve that conclusion. As I said, the Bill is not intended to exclude supply teachers; the question is whether they have a regular relationship with the individual victim on the basis of their job?
<P>

<a name="30401-39_para2"></a>Codes of conduct and disciplinary guidelines are the appropriate means of controlling consensual relations where existing requirements of the breach of trust offence are not met. To broaden the offence's scope would seriously undermine its true purpose and considerably weaken its credibility. It is a matter for the noble Baronesses and the noble Lord, but I earnestly ask them carefully to consider the credibility of the provision before they come back.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-39_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The Minister can be sure that I shall come back, because his answer was hugely unsatisfactory. The Minister asks whether the young person wants that degree of restriction. I should argue it the other way round: does that young person deserve that degree of protection? I expect nurses not to sexually abuse children in their care. I am one of those old-fashioned mothers who regards her 16 year-olds as children. We do not send our children to hospital or school to risk their being abused by the very person who is acting in loco parentis.
<P>

<a name="30401-39_para3"></a>The way in which the Minister dealt with the definition of "regularly" is highly unsatisfactory. There was no definition. There was not. I am a governor of a school in London. The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, who is in his place, will know of the problems in some of the more difficult parts of our inner cities&#151;but especially in London&#151;where people pass in the night. Teachers come and teachers go. In fact, teachers arrive in the morning and have disappeared before the end of the day because they simply cannot manage the tasks that they have been given&#151;perhaps with a very dysfunctional class of 14 year-olds.
<P>

<a name="30401-39_para4"></a>All that I am saying is that abusers are often fly-by-nights, people who flit from one thing to another. The idea that if abuse had taken place, people would be caught by the Bill only if they were "regular", in some definition to be determined in future, is not reliable enough. I shall certainly return to the matter because the answer was unsatisfactory. I am grateful for the support that I have received and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-39_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 22:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 9, line 12, after "board" insert "or from an adjacent main river under the provisions of a current Water Level Management Plan"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-39_para23"></a><P>

<a name="30401-39_para24"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment would create an exemption from the need for an abstraction licence where there is a water level management plan already in place. The Bill will require all sites to have an abstraction licence for more than 20 cubic metres a day. Where there are internal drainage boards, abstraction from rivers is currently managed under the Land Drainage Act 1991, which requires consents to cover abstraction.
<P>

<a name="30401-39_para25"></a>This is a probing amendment to discover the relationship between the water level management plans and the proposals in the Bill. Also, we believe that in some areas, such as those covered by water level management plans, a large number of new licences will be required. Far from streamlining the regulation process, those new licences would be in competition with the water level management plan. The imposition of the licences would not add anything to an already complex process. The management plans are negotiated at length and discussed with all the interested parties. That seems to be an adequate way of managing the abstraction of water because of high levels of flow in the river. That is what water level management plans are designed to address.
<P>

<a name="30401-39_para26"></a>The abstraction licences are appropriate where they try to impose a volumetric limit, but if the river is already full, we do not believe that the extra imposition of a licence would add anything to the way in which water is managed. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-40_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  I recognise the noble Baroness's desire for a co-ordinated approach to water management, but the reality is that at a higher level the amendment would inhibit the ability of the Environment Agency to manage water resources sustainably in the future. The clause ends all exemptions. All significant users of water will be covered to allow for control of the total use of water when resources may not be as plentiful as they are now, given our expectations of climate change. The Environment Agency will need to be able to rebalance the needs of all abstractors and the needs of the environment. To exclude a significant amount of water from that would not be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30401-40_para0"></a>We recognise the view of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, that we should not change unless we need to. We have retained the exemption for transfers within internal drainage districts. New subsection (1A) achieves that continued exemption. That reflects our confidence in the ability of internal drainage boards to manage the districts for which they have responsibility. The amendment would leave some transfers of large quantities of water outside control now and in the future, when our resources may be more scarce. That is contrary to the purpose of the Bill. The intention of the Bill is to ensure that transferring water into internal drainage districts, for whatever purpose, is not done at the expense of the supplying river, of its users or of the environment that is dependent on it.
<P>

<a name="30401-40_para1"></a>We recognise the intention behind the amendment to ensure that water resources and flood management are more joined up. However, those two issues are covered by separate areas of legislation and are there for different purposes. From a legislative point of view, they are best not confused. The water level management plans referred to in this respect do not have a statutory basis. It would not be appropriate to use plans that do not have an explicit legal base.
<P>

<a name="30401-40_para2"></a>I understand what the noble Baroness is trying to do, but it thwarts the overall purpose of this part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-40_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I am sure that the Minister remembers my suggestion that he should give a pound to WaterAid for every bad pun in the Bill. What will be the relationship between water level management plans and all the other mechanisms that the Bill will bring in, and the Water Framework Directive? If, as he says, the water level management plans have no statutory basis, how will the people who <P>


<a name="column_GC95"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are taking part in the negotiations about them know where they then fit in? Why should they devote their time to those negotiations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-40_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The water management plans for these purposes deal with flood management rather than water supply. The people who participate in drawing up those plans and managing the water levels understand their role. Transfers into the internal drainage board areas do not take place only during flood periods when there are high flows on the donor river. They could take place at any time. The exemption relating to the existence of a plan to deal with floods is not a relevant consideration. At all times the Environment Agency needs to be able to control all movement of water to balance the system, whether it is to deal with excess or drought or for ongoing water management purposes. The flood dimension deals with one aspect. It is an important aspect, but it is only one.

<P>

<a name="30401-40_para6"></a>The amendment would add a paragraph (d) to new subsection (1A), which lists specific circumstances in which abstraction is allowed without a licence. I want to probe the Government on whether this is an appropriate place for special pleading on behalf of trickle irrigation. I realise that there will be a longer debate on trickle irrigation later, but I am bringing it up at this point to see whether this is an appropriate place to put in a special mention. We need to pay particular attention to trickle irrigation and prioritise it over other means of irrigation and other uses of water. In particular, it is used for food production. This part of the Bill refers to transfers of water. In some circumstances there may be an inadequate water supply. It refers specifically to districts. Trickle irrigation is a specific function to enable food <P>


<a name="column_GC96"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC96</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>production, which is a vital renewable resource and should be higher on the list of priorities than many other aspects. I wonder whether this is an appropriate place for a reference to specific circumstances for allowances for trickle irrigation. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-40_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Once again, I am slightly hesitant about speaking on this amendment. There is no doubt but that trickle irrigation is the most efficient way of using water for irrigation. It should be encouraged and it would be very nice if it could be exempted. However, large horticultural units can abstract large quantities of water. To exempt a whole class of irrigation might lead to an inconsistency in the Bill. Somebody using spray irrigation, who would have to have a licence, might be using far less water than someone using trickle irrigation, who would have an exemption. That seems a little hard. Of course, it gives the person using spray irrigation every incentive to change his system if that is possible, but it is not always possible. Spray irrigation may be the only way in which some people can work.
<P>

<a name="30401-40_para7"></a>I am hesitant about the amendment and I look forward with interest to the Minister's response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-40_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I was going to make the same point in a different way. Paragraphs (a) to (c) all preserve the stock of water, whereas paragraph (d) proposed in the amendment would use it up. The noble Lord is probably correct that this is not the right place in the Bill, because it does not run with the rest of the clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-40_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I should like clarification of the intention behind the amendment. My understanding is that transfers of water within IDBs are exempt from the provisions of the Bill. The clause would be appropriate only if there was abstraction for trickle irrigation. I should like to press the noble Lord to clarify his intention.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-40_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I make a special plea for trickle irrigation because Section 29(1A) says that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"restriction on abstraction shall not apply to any abstraction of water from inland waters within the district of an internal drainage board".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-40_para8"></a>
Specific exemptions are then set out. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, about whether this is the right place for this provision. Trickle irrigation is a very efficient method, but is this right place in the Bill to put it when one compares it with the other aspects mentioned there?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-40_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I support my noble friend. We should like to see what judgment the Government think can be made. The Environment Agency may not make value judgments about whether food production is a more important use of water than, for example, car washing. We may wish to return to that theme. I am pleased that the Prime Minister has decided to add his weight to those who have pressed British institutions to supply, where possible, British <P>


<a name="column_GC97"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC97</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>food. We want to explore as fully as possible what weight is given to the importance of agriculture as a user of water.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-40_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   This provision is probably in the wrong place. The section deals with transfers made by internal drainage boards, whereas the noble Lord is thinking more of abstractions. Transfers within IDB areas will continue to be exempt. But abstractions above a certain level are licensable. Therefore, some trickle irrigation above the threshold&#151;for example, the large horticultural premises to which the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, referred&#151;will be licensable for abstraction purposes, but this deals with transfers.
<P>

<a name="30401-40_para9"></a>If those transfers are to be exempt, they will be subject to the conditions set out by the clause. Therefore, adding this aspect to them would have the opposite effect to that which the noble Lord seeks. It could narrow the exemption to trickle irrigation by the drainage boards. It would be a narrower exemption than that provided by Section 29(1A). No doubt we shall return to the supply of trickle irrigation in general terms, but the amendment will not help the noble Lord's cause. He may therefore wish to reconsider it.
<P>

<a name="30401-40_para10"></a>The noble Baroness raised the question of whether the Environment Agency can make a judgment on these matters. It depends on what one means by a judgment. One role of the agency is to decide whether quantities required for a particular use are reasonable. That is not an issue of whether one use is more important than another, but whether it is reasonable to use that quantity of water for that purpose. Therefore, a number of judgments must be made by the Environment Agency in that respect, but they are not subjective value judgments in the sense that the noble Baroness refers to.
<P>

<a name="30401-40_para11"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will think better of the amendment and return to this matter in a general discussion on trickle irrigation.

<A NAME="30401-41_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   The purpose of the amendment was to probe. That has been exercised in the arguments which have been deployed. I refer in particular to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, about the differences between trickle and spray irrigation and whether both should be treated the same. I suspect that as trickle irrigation is more efficient it probably has pride of place. None the less, I accept the Minister's argument that the fight for this issue may not be in the correct place. I believe the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, wishes to say something before I sit down.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   It is not really a probing amendment. A better way to deal with efficiency of irrigation, rather than through an exemption in the need to have an abstraction licence, would be through a charging system. I am sure that will be picked up.

"or for the purpose of alleviating imminent flooding of domestic or commercial property."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30401-41_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 25. Amendment No. 24 is under the clause headed "Rights to abstract for drainage purposes, etc". I again question the need for any discouragement of people who, for good reasons, are trying to take water out of a river at times of high flows. I do not believe that spilling water over river banks or spillways is defined as abstraction. I am not sure whether it is the Bill's intention to redefine it as abstraction. If it is not abstraction, it should not need licensing.
<P>

<a name="30401-41_para3"></a>In times of heavy precipitation, river managers will wish to open sluices. Usually they are used for warping or irrigation, but in this case they are to be used to remove water from the river and to alleviate flooding in towns and villages downstream. Amendment No. 24 is designed to make sure that that activity is exempt from licensing and that the owners or operators of those sluices are not discouraged from using them, bearing in mind that the Environment Agency does not have any powers to make them apply for a licence or use them.
<P>

<a name="30401-41_para4"></a>Amendment No. 25 would add a provision to the list of emergency abstractions that I am amazed is not there already. It would add the danger,

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"of flooding to domestic or commercial property".
<P>

Therefore, Amendment No. 25 is designed to make sure that damage to property is also included in the Government's list. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-41_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   It might be helpful if I intervene at this stage. I think that these amendments are based on a misunderstanding. The noble Baroness assumes that the current exemptions are altered by the Bill, whereas it does not do anything to remove those exemptions relating to abstraction for the purposes of protecting land against encroachment by water, by floods or whatever kind of river overflow. The existing exemption under the Water Resources Act 1991 is <P>


<a name="column_GC99"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC99</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>retained. It applies to property on land as well as to land itself. All activities associated with the prevention of flooding are therefore exempted from the need for an abstraction licence. That is provided for already under the Water Resources Act, and does not need to be spelt out in this new legislation. Therefore, I think there is no necessity for these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-41_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. It is probably reassuring on the first point. On the second point, why do the Government need to list the emergency situation under new subsection (2A)?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-41_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Other emergency situations could be lack of supply of water or diversion of water as well as flooding.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-41_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I shall return to the amended Bill the Minister kindly gave us and check exactly what he is saying.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-41_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   For the benefit of the noble Baroness, it is Section 29(5) of the Water Resources Act&#151;to which I believe she has a Keeling schedule&#151;which is retained and the revised definition is substituted in Clause 7(6).

<P>
<P>

<a name="30401-41_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to the associated amendments. These are minor technical changes. I shall go through what each one does. Amendment No. 26 provides that the Environment Agency can serve a notice on an operator that what started off as an emergency abstraction is no longer considered to be one because the circumstances have changed. That will allow the agency to establish control as part of its control over the use of water resources over abstractions that otherwise could go on for ever, having started as an emergency.
<P>

<a name="30401-41_para13"></a>As written, the clause would amend the Water Resources Act with a provision that could never arise in practice. Amendment No. 27 restores the current wording in the Act.
<P>

<a name="30401-41_para14"></a>Amendment No. 32 changes the number of subsections to bring them into line. Amendment No. 33 brings the definition of flood defences for the purposes of defining minimum river flows in Section 21 of the Water Resources Act into line with that used for flood defence purposes in Section 113 of that Act.

<a name="30401-41_para15"></a>Amendment No. 35 provides that the Secretary of State may delegate to a third party&#151;the planning inspectorate&#151;appeals against a water conservation notice, which brings it into line with other provisions in the Water Resources Act.

<a name="30401-41_para16"></a>Amendment No. 47 provides that where a variation to a licence is being considered at renewal, the variation element is considered as if the expiring licence were to continue. Amendment No. 63 ensures that a protected right is not given to the new abstractor where a transfer licence falls away by virtue of being apportioned. That is consistent with the policy that abstractions for transfer do not benefit from protected right status. I beg to move.

On Amendment No. 26 regarding the changed circumstance, are there rules already laid down&#151;forgive me, I did not check this&#151;in current Acts that cut in when an emergency is no longer an emergency or when circumstances change? If not, who will judge the changed circumstances and how?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-41_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   All previous legislation defines when an emergency arises but not when it finishes. There will necessarily need to be some guidance to the Environment Agency on whether it can declare the emergency over and therefore subject to the normal abstraction licensing systems. That guidance does not currently exist, but the situation clearly would arise as a result of the new Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-41_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for that, but I register a slight concern that again we are allowing the matter to be dealt with in secondary legislation. It will be in guidance, regulations or call-it-what-you-will. It is unfortunate that it is not on the face of the Bill. Perhaps the Minister might consider the issue and return to us at a later stage. It would help the Committee because the provision gives the Environment Agency&#151;not the Secretary of State, if I understand correctly&#151;the power to decide the changed circumstances either way. I am not pressing the Minister now, but I should be grateful if perhaps between now and the next stage we can give the matter some thought.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-41_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   In his reply to my most recent amendments about the sort of emergency situation that we might face, the Minister said that it might be not just flooding but all sorts of other things, including drought. That led me to focus on the title of Clause 7, "Rights to extract for drainage purposes, etc". What is included in the "et cetera"? What sort of emergency situations fall into the "et cetera" bit of the title?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-41_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   What a good question. Parliamentary counsel should be advised not to put "et cetera" into the title of a clause; "and related matters" would be more appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30401-41_para17"></a>The nature of emergencies is clear. They could arise from a lack of water, from an excess of water or because water is seeping through areas through which it is not supposed to go.

<a name="column_GC101"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>emergency is over. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, made that point. I am not sure that detailed guidance is appropriate; emergencies will differ in nature.

<A NAME="30401-42_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am happy with the Minister's explanation, although I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, that the use of "et cetera" is not good. Can I just establish the fact that, before the Bill becomes law, the decision on the emergency would be made by the Secretary of State? When the Bill becomes law, that responsibility will pass from the Secretary of State to the Environment Agency, so that is a new circumstance. If the responsibility still lay with the Secretary of State, we could bring the matter before Parliament. Once the responsibility passes to the Environment Agency, we will be at arm's length. Normally, we can question the Secretary of State on the Floor of the House, but we cannot call in the Environment Agency in the same way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-42_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The Environment Agency is already responsible for managing this. It is a new exemption and does not relate to anybody in those terms at the moment. In future, it will relate to the Environment Agency, not the Secretary of State. That is not changing the situation. In practice, that is the situation already, but the amendment will make it the responsibility of the Environment Agency in legislation.

<a name="30401-42_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: I rise with some trepidation about whether I have understood what it is intended that the Bill should do about warping. On the basis that I have got it right, I will continue.
<P>

<a name="30401-42_para5"></a>The Bill includes warping in the definition of land drainage. Other Bills did not include it. Warping falls into two categories. I discovered that the word first appeared in the dictionary in 1799. There is "fortuitous warping", which happens when, after extensive floods, silt and nutrient-laden flood waters spill over the riverbank on to farmland. I know that the Chairman will be particularly familiar with that in Somerset, but there has been a tradition of fortuitous warping in many lowland parts of the country. The second sort is "managed warping" which means that, historically, sluices have been in place to allow the flood water to overflow the bank. It has two benefits: first, there is the advantage that silt and nutrients pass on to the farmland and, over time, raise the level of the land slightly, which is important in lowland areas; and, <P>


<a name="column_GC102"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>secondly, such warping prevents the floodwater from making such fast progress downriver and affecting villages and towns downstream in times of great flood.
<P>

<a name="30401-42_para6"></a>The Bill should not include warping. It is a useful and sustainable way of fertilising land. Amendment No. 30, tabled by the Conservatives, is sensible and, to some extent, addresses the issue. I believe that DEFRA and the Environment Agency have already had correspondence from the Association of Drainage Authorities, which does not agree that warping should be in the Bill. My amendment covers that point. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-42_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I support the amendment, although I have not seen warping done in our part of the world for a long time. It used to be a regular practice, and one can still see river meadows laid out with the channels all present and waiting for somebody with the energy to divert the river into them. Unfortunately, we do not have water-mills anymore, and, because of that, rivers are generally maintained at a lower level than was the case when we did. The water-mills kept water back for reasons other than flooding land. Because the rivers were maintained at a higher level to power the mills, they could also be diverted more easily into the channels.
<P>

<a name="30401-42_para7"></a>Now that water-mills have passed into the history books, the gates are generally left open, with the result that the system is not used. Environmentally, warping is a beneficial process, but I would be interested to know whether it is practised anywhere in the country nowadays. I suspect that we may be discussing something that has been consigned to history.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-42_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   If, as the noble Baroness suggested, warping is a natural phenomenon that brings advantages, should we not keep it in the Bill? I can see no point in taking something out if there is scope for any environmental advantage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-42_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I shall address the issue of whether warping is now a matter of history. It may have fallen into disuse throughout the country, but, as the Water Framework Directive comes into effect and there is more river basin management planning, more issues will arise about the sort of fertiliser that ends up in river water. There may be a wish to return to more natural forms of fertilising the land.
<P>

<a name="30401-42_para8"></a>The structure to allow warping to happen is still in place in many areas where it did not just happen due to overflowing of the riverbank. Although it may have fallen into disuse in the past 30 years, it might well come into wider use over the next century. We should try, with the Water Framework Directive particularly in mind, to consider the use of water as a whole. That is why I tabled the amendment.

<A NAME="30401-42_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   The physical structure for the system that the noble Baroness describes might be there, but where will she find the drowners to work the sluices? The job requires great skill.

<a name="30401-42_para9"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said, water meadows are a good thing environmentally, so it is strange for me to be counselling caution in the use of warping. However, although warping can be an environmental benefit to a particular meadow, abstracting water to run through several meadows can deprive the donor river of a significant volume of water, while the meadow or subsequent chains of meadows are being filled. That would make the blanket exemption for warping suggested by the amendment rather risky.
<P>

<a name="30401-42_para10"></a>We must also look to the future. As has been said, water meadows will, one hopes, become more prevalent under some of the provisions in the Water Framework Directive that will be of benefit to conservation, so we could be talking about substantial volumes of water. I urge the Minister to exercise considerable caution with the amendment. Specific "meadow-explicit" agreements, if I can coin the term, might be a more effective approach than simply removing the reference from the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-42_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, was specific about some circumstances. Does she agree that the situation in chalkland areas, where there is a lot of natural spring water that sustains most of the rivers and where there are quite a number of water meadows, might differ from the situation in, for example, East Anglia?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-42_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   The noble Lord is right to say that there are big differences throughout the country. However, there are also big differences across the seasons and from year to year, depending on the state of the ground waters. Although there are high levels of ground water and large spring-fed wetlands in some counties, they have a distressing habit of drying up in drought periods. It is only because we have a regulatory framework that covers everything that balanced decisions can be made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-42_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   There is hugely greater knowledge about warping among Members of the Committee than I can bring to bear. There are two sorts of warping, and I suspect that, even when the mills were in operation and more water was held back, most warping was done in flood conditions. Effectively, it is controlled inundation of the land, when there is excess water, and, in that sense, it is natural. However, in those circumstances, there are no controls, and no controls are proposed in the Bill because that would be for flood control. It is in that situation, in the past, present and future, that warping takes place.

<a name="30401-42_para11"></a>If we are talking about the artificial provision of warping, there is no reason why the use of water in that way should be treated any differently from the use of water in other ways. It would have to involve a significant amount of water before it came under the licensing regime. As the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, said, we must consider the total environmental impact, not simply the environmental and nutritional benefit to the meadows immediately affected. Most warping is already exempt, and I am not convinced that we should exempt specific abstraction above the normal threshold outside a flood situation for that purpose rather than any other.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-42_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I understand what the Minister is saying. I think that he said that warping that happened because a river overflowed its banks&#151;fortuitous warping&#151;would be exempt anyway, as no one could prevent that. Fortuitous warping will not be included in the Bill. Historically, however, if it has been clear upstream that a river will overflow its banks and create problems downstream, structures have been built to encourage warping. Those practices will fall within the ambit of the Bill, but that does not seem to make sense.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-42_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The noble Baroness refers to fortuitous warping. Warping can happen as a result of a river spilling over. When it is used for flood-control purposes, whether in the immediate vicinity or downstream, it is already exempt. But where water is deliberately held back and abstracted primarily for irrigation purposes, there is no reason why warping should not be subject to licensing above the threshold when all other uses are subject to such licensing. It is not a question of whether the warping is fortuitous but of whether the water is used for flood control or for the explicit purpose of irrigation.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-43_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the Minister for that explanation. It indicates why a total river basin management approach is most needed. It will sometimes be difficult to define the benefit of the operation. Much of the time the benefit will be both flood management and field irrigation.
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para0"></a>I thank everyone who contributed to the debate. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Young, for supporting a perhaps limited exemption. I was not sure whether the Environment Agency had the power to create limited licensing exemptions if the circumstances were not defined in the Bill. I shall look at the issue again.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment to find out the exact meaning of the phrase that we suggest should be deleted. I have read it many times. On the face of it, land drainage does not include transferring water from one source of supply to another. But transferring water from one source of supply to another mainly to augment the latter will certainly affect land drainage, possibly adversely. With that in mind, we tabled the amendment to clarify the Government's intention in this phrase. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-43_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I would welcome further clarification of what is in the Government's mind as regards this subsection.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-43_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The overall intention of this part of the Bill is to bring all major transfers into the scope of the licensing regime so that there is a means to control them in future. That means restricting some current exemptions. Amendment No. 29 would allow the current exemption of transfer for the augmentation of water levels to remain. That would mean that a significant transfer could be exempt from licensing. I refer not to emergency transfers but to a general one within the internal drainage board. By changing the definition of internal drainage, as this amendment would do, we could exempt significant transfers.
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para4"></a>If we are to establish the Environment Agency's control over the whole water supply, the needs of all abstractors need to be balanced, particularly in times of reduced water availability, rather than simply allowing transfers by abstractors for this purpose. That is why we are restricting the number of exemptions and taking a more comprehensive approach to licensing than at present. Any uncontrolled transfer can affect overall water availability. We see no reason to retain that exemption. It would be possible under a licence, but that is not the point. It should not be treated differently from other forms of abstraction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-43_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am grateful for the explanation. Transferring water from one source of supply to another does nothing to alter the total quantity of available water. I accept that it might remove it from one river where there is a pumping station for supply and transfer it to another where there is not. But I cannot imagine that the internal drainage board would risk moving water unnecessarily from one stream to another. If it moved water to a river of restricted flow that required help, that would probably be beneficial, because it would balance the needs of the two streams. I accept that there is a potential water supply issue. In the light of the explanation, I see that circumstances might arise where the Environment Agency would need to know exactly what is happening. For now, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30401-43_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Byford </B>   moved Amendment No. 30:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 7, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-43_para7"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "CONSULTATION ON EXTENSION OF SCOPE OF ABSTRACTION LICENSING
<br>
 Before the introduction of any scheme for extending abstraction licensing to warping or irrigation by virtue of section 7(5) above, the Agency shall consult such bodies appearing to it to be representative of persons whose business interests are likely to be affected by the proposed scheme."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30401-43_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment deals directly with trickle irrigation. I expect that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, will wish to contribute following her earlier comments. It is a straightforward amendment, which would require the agency to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"consult such bodies appearing to it to be representative of persons whose business interests are likely to be affected by the proposed scheme".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-43_para9"></a><P>

<a name="30401-43_para10"></a>Clause 7 brings trickle irrigation within the abstraction-licensing regime for the first time. Although farmers and growers who trickle irrigate are not opposed to that in principle, they have genuine concerns about the implications for their businesses and how the new controls will be implemented. Trickle irrigation is a sustainable and efficient method of water use, but many trickle irrigators fear that their abstraction licences will be revoked or seriously modified, especially in catchment areas that the Environment Agency deems already to be fully licensed or over-abstracted.
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para11"></a>I have received letters from people concerned about the changes. I shall outline some of the potential undesirable effects. The importance of trickle irrigation to unsupported producers of high-value crops such as fruit and vegetables cannot be overstated when the upstream or downstream dependant businesses are taken into account. One soft-fruit producer in East Anglia who is heavily dependent on trickle irrigation estimates that his business contributes some £3.4 million to the local economy. A further example is a soft-fruit grower in Kent who has a wage bill of approximately £2 million. We are therefore not talking about people picking the odd bit of fruit or some vegetables. Without access to adequate water, much of that type of production could be lost.
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para12"></a>I received a letter from an organisation in the Norfolk area expressing concern about the particular plan for trickle irrigators as it stands in Grand Committee. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Elliot Morley has stated that Defra are still considering whether trickle irrigators could be provided with time limited licences automatically when the current exemption ends. However unless the present rules are amended trickle irrigators have two years to apply for a licence in our case and many cases like ours, the Agency is likely to refuse on the grounds that there is insufficient water".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-43_para13"></a>
Given our discussions today and in previous Committees, I accept that the restrictions will not necessarily affect all areas of the UK equally. But it <P>


<a name="column_GC107"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC107</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would be a disaster for this producer and his 64 employees. It is not just one producer and one employee, but a big rural enterprise. The producer's letter continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Bill offers the possibility of the Agency granting a licence in these circumstances, but they need to be willing to use these powers, and what they really need is some clear guidance from the Government on how trickle irrigators should be treated".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-43_para14"></a>
There is nothing worse for businesses than to be uncertain about those changes&#151;as noble Lords who have employed people will know&#151;and to be unable to make definite plans.
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para15"></a>The producer also gave evidence to the Environment Select Committee, which stated in its Ninth Report into the draft Water Bill,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"where resources are scarce the needs of trickle irrigators whose use has been notified to the Agency must be considered equal to those of existing licensed abstractors".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-43_para16"></a>
The producer states that he hopes that at Committee stage he will be able to ask the Minister to agree to provide trickle irrigators with an automatic time-limited licence so that trickle irrigation licences could subsequently be reviewed on a par with other abstractions as part of the catchment abstraction management strategy (CAMS).
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para17"></a>The industry has expressed genuine concerns. I know that areas of the country are affected differently. For example, I was speaking to someone whose son has a horticultural farm in Lincolnshire in an area that does not need trickle irrigation because the land is retentive enough. But dryness in other areas has a great effect on the crops.
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para18"></a>My noble friend mentioned that trickle irrigators use a good deal of water. We seek clarity and some steer so that those whose businesses may be affected can plan accordingly. I am sure that the Minister will not be surprised to hear me express yet again my hope that we enable UK producers to compete in a global market rather than restrict them and make things more difficult for them. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-43_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   I support the amendment. Trickle irrigation will be brought into the abstraction licensing system for the first time. That is causing much concern among those who have invested in that horticulture system. My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith pointed out that trickle irrigation was perhaps the most efficient form of water management in agriculture and horticulture. I am sure that the Environment Agency will bear that in mind when negotiating with trickle irrigators for the first time.
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para19"></a>We will return to the issue many times when debating the clauses relating to abstraction. But we must take into account businesses' levels of investment, borrowing and business plans. As my noble friend Lady Byford suggested, some of the businesses affected have made substantial investments. Those investments hang on horticultural producers' ability to extract water and use it for trickle irrigation. It is not surprising, therefore, that many involved in the industry are extremely concerned about their future.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para20"></a>I wish to reiterate a point that I made at Second Reading about encouraging local food production. I can see that the Environment Agency could have difficulties if the Countryside Agency were actively encouraging local production while it found itself in the difficult situation of having to make a decision. But we must not forget that, if a horticultural business employing many people and producing a good deal of fruit or vegetables is put out of business because it no longer has access to water, production will be exported abroad, which will contribute to the balance of payment deficiencies on the product in question. A hugely important point is that that situation would involve the transportation of goods and would therefore create increased pollution. All those issues must be taken into account.
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para21"></a>In many cases, that will not be an easy decision for the Environment Agency to take. However, it is essential that the various issues that noble Lords have mentioned are taken into account. Given the circumstances and very real concerns, we should take Amendment No. 30 very seriously. I hope that the Government will accept it.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-43_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I, too, support my noble friend, but I do so in a slightly different way. Amendment No. 30 calls for consultation with representatives,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"of persons whose business interests are likely to be affected".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-43_para22"></a>
I should not put words into my noble friend's mouth, but the reality is that we are asking for rather more than that. I think that we are really asking for an assurance that existing users who will come within the scheme in future will be treated similarly to those who already hold an abstraction licence. We have already discussed, although not specifically, whether licences should be automatically renewed unless there are very compelling reasons not to do so. However, if a large or a small business is already a very efficient water user and the resource is already catered for, if not actually licensed, there should be a presumption under the licensing scheme in favour of that business.
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para23"></a>It would be another matter if there were subsequently an application for an additional abstraction, for trickle irrigation. That would be a new abstraction and could be treated absolutely fairly and squarely on the basis of whether there was sufficient water for that abstraction to be practical. I think that that is very different from the situation of someone who is already established in business and has the equipment and who has made the investment and got the system working.
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para24"></a>I think that there is a very strong point there. I welcome the fact that, as we are in Grand Committee, we shall have to return to this issue. I think that we need to think carefully about the wording of the provision and about what we really want. As I said, I definitely want something more.
<P>

<a name="30401-43_para25"></a>There is another side to the issue. Someone who wanted to start up trickle irrigation might have a neighbour who uses spray irrigation. If he could persuade that neighbour to switch to trickle irrigation, <P>


<a name="column_GC109"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC109</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>perhaps enough water could be saved to allow his trickle irrigation too. That would be an amendment of licence. The Environment Agency could perform a very useful function in such situations. I think that we need to think this issue through a little. I support absolutely the principle of what is being said, but I think that we need to determine precisely what we want to do.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-44_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I support the suggestion that we explore further the issue of trickle irrigation. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, that we may need to consider options that are more proactive than simply consulting. That point was reinforced for me by a leaflet produced by the National Water Demand Management Centre which includes a very useful map. That map outlines in red the areas where abstraction is unsustainable or unacceptable; in yellow, where no additional water is available; and, in blue, the areas where some additional water is available. As the Committee will not be surprised to hear, the map indicates very few areas in England and Wales where additional water is available. Indeed, vast swathes of the South East are marked in red.
<P>

<a name="30401-44_para0"></a>Bearing in mind that no additional water is available in an awful lot of England, it seems that trickle irrigators will be in a difficult position if the Environment Agency is not able to make a value judgment on the needs of agriculture as opposed to those of other forms of industry. I say that advisedly. Noble Lords may say that everyone has a right to their business, and of course I agree. However, I have been impressed by the actual amounts of water required by various businesses. Being a printer's daughter, I was particularly struck by the water usage of the Beacon Press. It now requires absolutely no water in its printing process. That is never likely to be the case for agricultural growers. Horticulturists in particular cannot manage without water. With new technologies, however, some industries that have historically relied on water have been able to change their systems to end their need for water.
<P>

<a name="30401-44_para1"></a>I believe that we will have to revisit this issue in one form or another. If the Environment Agency had a duty to consider the efficient use of water, perhaps it could start to make a judgment about the position of businesses that cannot operate at all without water as against those that could operate with much less water or no water at all but have chosen not to invest in the necessary technology.
<P>

<a name="30401-44_para2"></a>Finally, I associate myself with the remarks about the importance of the local production of food. I believe that that is extremely important. There is a great demand for, particularly organic, vegetables and fruit that is not being met by British producers. If we make life any more difficult for that sector, that demand will increasingly be filled from abroad.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-44_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We have had a wide-ranging debate. However, this amendment is about consultation, which I shall try to deal with first. The amendment requires consultation before the introduction of Clause 7. I think that there is a problem with the <P>


<a name="column_GC110"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>drafting of the amendment in that it should relate to Clause 7(6). Nevertheless, the principle and proposals to bring irrigation and warping into the licensing regime were part of the 1998 consultation and review of the abstraction licensing system. The subsequent decisions, set out in Taking Water Responsibly, were published in 1999. Therefore, on the principle of the issue, we have already had substantial consultation with all parties concerned.
<P>

<a name="30401-44_para3"></a>However, if the question is whether we are having consultations with bodies representing users and others on how they will be affected by the changes and on the detail of how licensing will be introduced in practice, that is a somewhat different matter. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, asked whether they will be consulted. They will be consulted about how the Environment Agency will approach licensing. If we are focusing on that, that is where a commitment to consultation is probably appropriate. However, it would not be appropriate on the face of the Bill itself.
<P>

<a name="30401-44_para4"></a>We will no doubt return to the broader issues raised in this short debate. However, we recognise the value of trickle irrigation. We recognise also that it can be an efficient way of using water in horticultural and certain other applications.
<P>

<a name="30401-44_para5"></a>The arrangements will operate as follows. All trickle irrigators above a threshold will have two years from enactment of this part of the Bill to apply for a licence. At that point, the agency will either grant an abstraction licence valid until the next review, or refuse a licence because the abstraction is causing environmental damage and try to work with the abstractor to try to find a more suitable alternative. In carrying out the assessment of any licence application, the Environment Agency must have a duty to take into account the costs and benefits of taking that decision, not only on the immediate business but on the rural community as a whole. It will therefore take into account some of the issues raised in this debate.
<P>

<a name="30401-44_para6"></a>It is not true that trickle irrigation is always more efficient than spray irrigation&#151;it depends on how the trickle irrigator operates his system. It is possible for trickle irrigators to use water inefficiently. One may think that trickle irrigation is always more efficient, but that is not so. Moreover, because of the amount of water involved, it can also have an adverse effect on other licensed use of the water which the Environment Agency would have to take into account. Therefore, the needs of trickle irrigators and the impact of their abstractions need to be considered against those of other abstractors.
<P>

<a name="30401-44_para7"></a>This is a new area for licensing, but there is no presumption that trickle irrigators will be treated any less favourably than existing abstractors or other applicants for licences. We expect the Environment Agency to ensure that decisions are fair to all, and it is under a duty to act reasonably in that respect. I have no doubt that we will return to some of these wider issues, as we will to the issue of consultation. As the <P>


<a name="column_GC111"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has already threatened us with alternative wording, I have no doubt that this will not be the end of the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-44_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   As it would not be proper for me to ask the Environment Agency this question, can the Minister tell us how the system currently works? In managing a catchment area, or whatever one calls it, does the agency take into account in its calculations of water usage and capacity whether there is already a large amount of trickle irrigation? It would seem a gross dereliction&#151;and I am sure that there is no such thing&#151;if a large water user, even one outside the existing licence regime, were outside the calculations of water use for a catchment area. I just do not believe that that is what is happening. If that were taken into account, it would reinforce the case for treating the existing user as the licence holder on his first application for a licence. It would be a roll-over situation rather than a totally new application for a totally new abstraction. We are talking about an existing set-up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-44_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I think that the noble Lord has partly made my case. Where there is an existing trickle irrigator, that irrigation has clearly made a contribution to the current balance, excess or shortage of water within that area. It will already have been taken into account in performing the calculations. It is therefore not a new situation. What is new is that, should the situation require, that abstraction will be brought with other abstractions into licensing for future management purposes. That includes a situation in which the overall supply of water and the overall demand on the water system may deteriorate. That means that large trickle irrigators need to be brought into that system.
<P>

<a name="30401-44_para8"></a>Part of the consultation has to do with how we apply the arrangements. In practice, most large trickle irrigators would immediately be given a licence. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, referred to various remarks by my colleague Elliot Morley in that respect. However, the whole system, as well as the individual case, will still require the Environment Agency to take into account the effect on the environment and on other abstractors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-44_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I do not think that there is anything between us in principle. I accept entirely that the issue has to be included in the overall calculation of water availability and water use. There is no difficulty with that. We are talking about trickle irrigators being in a rather specific situation because they are being brought into the scheme. For them, the situation is new and they must apply for a licence.
<P>

<a name="30401-44_para9"></a>I am happy that when all the licences are reviewed together in 2012, or whatever the date may be, the trickle irrigators will be part of that review. I have no difficulty with that. What concerns me is the possibility that their circumstances will be reviewed with their licence applications. We shall be enacting this Bill and that will not alter their physical circumstances vis-a-vis their water supply, their <P>


<a name="column_GC112"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>employment or anything else, but it will alter their legal situation quite dramatically. That is why I believe that trickle irrigators deserve specific information at that stage in their licence applications.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-44_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Before the Minister replies, I want to press him on the point about the map from the National Water Demand Management Centre, which states that there is no additional scope for licences in the areas coloured red or yellow and, in particular, in the areas coloured red. If there is no scope for additional demand, how will the trickle irrigators' licences be granted in the face of that advice?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-44_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Where there is an existing trickle irrigator, the calculations that help to define whether the colour is red, blue or yellow on the map already take account of licensed and unlicensed de facto use. Therefore, the calculations have already been made. However, I believe we all agree that a new threshold abstractor should be judged against any other applicant for a licence. But, in terms of the map, the calculation has already been made.

<a name="30401-44_para10"></a>I also make the commitment that trickle irrigators will be treated no less favourably than any other applicants, whether they have been brought into the system anew or whether they have always required a licence. That will apply from the start of the new system. Therefore, although I understand the concern&#151;obviously there is always concern when one is brought into a system for the first time&#151;I believe that no detriment will be suffered by those who use trickle irrigation efficiently. I hope that that gives some assurance and that more assurance is given by the commitment that the way the provision is applied will be subject to further consultation.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-45_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank all those who contributed to this debate, which, by its very nature, was always going to spread wider than the original amendment. I do not believe that one could consider the amendment without going wider than the written words. Therefore, I hope that, when I have finished speaking, the Minister will say to the noble Baroness opposite him, "I am very grateful and glad to accept your amendment", which, at present, he has not been too inclined to do. "Not today", I am being told. Perhaps I shall try again tomorrow.
<P>

<a name="30401-45_para0"></a>I turn to one or two of the points raised. I know that they went wider than the amendment but I believe it is important to reflect upon them. My noble friend Lord Peel spoke, in particular, about the level of investment. I tried to raise that matter in my opening remarks. Several noble Lords spoke about local food production. I consider that to be a hugely important subject. Those of us who are concerned about pollution, which is part of our wider brief, are anxious to see whether we can achieve a greater reduction in what I call "food miles". Our food travels miles and miles and pollution is produced in the process.

<a name="30401-45_para1"></a>My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith&#151;I shall come back to his comment in a moment&#151;referred to the fact that the amendment calls for consultation. In reply, the noble Lord said rightly that the Government had already consulted over the years. He said that the results of the consultation were drafted in 1998 and published in 1999. Therefore, the Government feel that consultation has already taken place. However, when I read Hansard&#151;I hope I am right&#151;he went on to say that we shall have to consult now about the effects that the provision will have on businesses. That seems to me a little strange. I should have thought that, as part of the consultation exercise, the effect on businesses would have been considered in the first place and that that would be part of the original exercise. I simply put that down as a marker because I find it most strange.
<P>

<a name="30401-45_para2"></a>I accept that people will have two years in which to make an application. From what the Minister said&#151;again, we cannot question the noble Baroness, Lady Young&#151;I understood that licences would be granted unless environmental damage had occurred or unless there was a very good reason why they should not be granted.
<P>

<a name="30401-45_para3"></a>We then had a short debate on the subject of costs and benefits. The Minister recognised the importance of local rural businesses to the whole community rather than to the country as a whole. As I pointed out in the example that I gave of the gentleman, Mr Place, who manages a very good business, 64 people might well be put at risk. That number of people in a conurbation is a drop in the ocean, but when there are not many other options for employment, 64 people do not constitute a drop in the ocean. Therefore, I am glad that the Environment Agency will have to take that into consideration. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said that the agency will have to make a value judgment. Indeed, a value judgment is important and we establish that at some stages of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-45_para4"></a>I am sure that all Members of the Committee agree that food is an important commodity, but it could be placed at risk. The difficulty is that if, as my noble friend Lord Peel suggested, we export our business&#151;a matter that I have talked about often&#151;then we become dependent on food supplied from overseas. Sadly, we all know what is happening at present in the battles overseas. There is no genuine and long-term guarantee that food will be supplied forever. If food costs were to go up, that would have long-term implications for the country as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30401-45_para5"></a>I turn to a final comment of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty. He said that when the applications were considered by the Environment Agency, they would be considered no less favourably. I do not believe that that is what we were trying to establish. We were asking that they should be considered favourably. My noble friend muttered to me the word "meaningless"; I uttered the word "useless". But we have digressed, and the noble Baroness is rightly shaking her head. However, that may help us to establish one or two points before we return to these matters later.

<a name="30401-45_para6"></a>I return to where we should be, which is my reply to the Minister's response. I do not believe that the Minister replied directly to my request that the bodies should be consulted. Perhaps the Minister will reply to that point because that is the part of the amendment that we are debating and it is the only part to which he did not respond.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-45_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I thought that I had responded to that point. I said that, in our view, the existence of that clause and the bringing into play of the clause have been dealt with by the previous consultation. However, as regards the way that the clause is applied in practice, we would expect the Environment Agency to consult bodies representing those affected by the changes and to inform them and involve them in the detail of the way that licensing would be introduced in practice. If I did not get that right when the noble Baroness checked it on the previous occasion in Hansard, I hope that I have done so on this occasion. To that extent, I recognise the importance of consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-45_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   The Minister has always been very generous with regard to consultation.

<a name="30401-45_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: I realise that this amendment was debated last week during a series of discussions led by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland. I shall give a brief explanation as to why I am here as opposed to the noble Lord. It is because he was looking at the Bill through the eyes of the Quarry Products Association, with which I have a friendly but not a financial relationship. I have come off the bench in his absence to look at the Bill from the same standpoint. In doing <P>


<a name="column_GC115"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>so, I declare a kind of interest. I am not directly associated with the Quarry Products Association but, as someone with a lifetime connection with the construction industry, I have used a great deal of the quarry industry's products while trying my best to cover the country in concrete. I am still at it.
<P>

<a name="30401-45_para10"></a>Having said that, I understand that, in order to make one very small comment on the amendment, I have to move it so that I can withdraw it. We were very pleased to have the assurances which my noble friend Lady Farrington gave last week. But, on second thoughts, we believe that Clause 25 may not fit entirely into the scheme of things. I do not, under any circumstances, want to debate Clause 25 now. I merely wish to say that at some stage in the process we may well come to Clause 25 and we may have to think again. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-45_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   We have one query about the amendment. We have debated this matter already. In her reply, the Minister mentioned that the Government proposed to make transitional measures to ensure that compensation would be available in the circumstances described in the amendment. Can the Minister tell me a little more about that? It is not clear to me whether the compensation payable will come from other licence payers. Has any assessment been made of how much the compensation would amount to if a substantial number of quarry owners were affected?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-45_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   The compensation would come from the total abstraction budget. Therefore, in that sense, it would come from other abstractors. The circumstances under which compensation would be payable would be where a mine, quarry or engineering works operator was refused a licence or granted a conditional licence and, as a result, could not take full advantage of any planning permission granted for that operation. That was the policy to which I referred. It is already publicly stated at paragraph 3.17 of the document, Taking Water Responsibly. I hope that that answers the noble Baroness's question.
<P>

<a name="30401-45_para11"></a>I note the interest declared by my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon and his warning that it will be an enduring interest. I note that he intends to return to this subject later, but perhaps I could offer to reply to any complex technical questions that he wishes to put in writing between now and Report. That might be more satisfactory and it would ensure that other noble Lords could read them.
<P>

<a name="30401-45_para12"></a>I warn my noble friend that irony in politics is not always understood to be humour, and in a debate on a Bill from DEFRA it may be ill-advised to refer to covering the country in concrete. Someone may believe that he meant it and not realise that it was a joke.

<a name="30401-46_para11"></a>The noble Duke said: The amendment is in some ways a probing amendment. It would remove "be counted cumulatively with" and insert "separately from".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-46_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   In the context of the clause, "cumulatively with" means in relation to amount. Under the clause, the Secretary of State would have the ability to make regulations to introduce further exemptions from licensing, which would lighten the regulatory burden. Those propositions could either be counted cumulatively with or separately from, so an amendment that changes one set of words for the other does not make a huge amount of difference. A particular proposition may be counted cumulatively with, in terms of calculating an amount, or it may have to be dealt with separately.

<A NAME="30401-46_spnew5"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   It begins to sound to me as if the amendment should read both "cumulatively with" and "separately from" to cover all possibilities. However, in view of the Minister's reply, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30401-46_para16"></a>The noble Duke said: In moving this amendment, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 38 to 40.
<P>

<a name="30401-46_para17"></a>The problem to which Amendment No. 37 relates is that "any order made" may refer to any tense&#151;past, present or future. Even the Explanatory Notes do not clarify the situation. The amendment would at least identify one possible tense, as it limits the time to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"prior to the commencement of this section".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-46_para18"></a>
Will the Minister explain to us whether there are other areas in which the Government wish the clauses to have effect? My comments also cover Amendment No. 38.
<P>

<a name="30401-46_para19"></a>Amendment No. 39 is a probing amendment. The difference in wording between subsection (4)(a) and (4)(b) needs to be explained. Does the latter mean that local and private Acts will be ignored from now on in relation to "underground strata"? Some businesses depend heavily on extraction from underground strata, and it would be detrimental to those businesses if the clause were to create uncertainty as to source of supply.
<P>

<a name="30401-46_para20"></a>Amendment No. 40 is a probing amendment. Subsection (5) allows the Secretary of State to use the clause as authority to act as he would were he taking action under Section 27A(1) of the WRA. The subsection allows the Secretary of State to close the circle by using it to revoke something already done under Section 27A(1).
<P>

<a name="30401-46_para21"></a>My problem may be that my brain has become waterlogged, because I live in a part of the country in which our winter rainfall has risen by 40 per cent and our overall rainfall has risen by 25 per cent, so that we are suffering from over 70 inches of rainfall per year or, in round terms, two metres plus. However, the combination of sections would almost qualify for the elimination heats for the plain English campaign. Will the noble Baroness explain the meaning?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-46_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Clause 10 gives the Secretary of State the power to remove exemption orders made under Section 33 of the Water Resources Act 1991 and to impose a threshold for abstraction licensing. It also repeals Section 33. Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 would not have any practical effect because Section 33 is to be revoked, so no new orders will be <P>


<a name="column_GC118"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>made anyway. Neither is it proposed to make any other orders before then. I hope that assurance satisfies the noble Duke.
<P>

<a name="30401-46_para22"></a>The noble Duke spoke to Amendment No. 39 as a probing amendment. We welcome the way in which the amendment deals with issues that we would like to consider. It appears that the amendment would remove a limit to the application of the new clause that would make it difficult to operate the clause effectively. We shall take the amendment away and look at it.
<P>

<a name="30401-46_para23"></a>Amendment No. 40 would set a threshold that could not be varied in future, which would seriously inhibit our ability to set an appropriate threshold for licensing in future should the availability of water reduce or, as the noble Duke said, increase as it has at times in various parts of the country.
<P>

<a name="30401-46_para24"></a>We hope that, with those assurances, Amendments Nos. 37, 38 and 40 will not be pressed to a Division. The Government will take Amendment No. 39 away for careful consideration.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-46_spnew8"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. We are grateful for her clarification when speaking to Amendments Nos. 37 and 38.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30401-46_para30"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment would restrict those who can apply for licences to those who have an efficiency programme in place. That programme should be,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"regarded by the Agency as encouraging best use of the water resource".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-46_para31"></a>
That would leave room for the programme to be proportionate, depending on the size and scale of the user. The agency has some discretion in that matter. It should be a basic requirement of licence applicants that they have some form of programme in place.
<P>

<a name="30401-46_para32"></a>I was encouraged in my thinking on this matter when I read the "Water Efficiency Awards", published by the Environment Agency and Water UK. Those awards show what can be done when sufficient thought has been given to the matter. We have discussed horticulture and agriculture in our debate. In that context, an award was given to Osberton Grange Farms, where efficient ways were developed for watering pot-grown shrubs. That reduced water <P>


<a name="column_GC119"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consumption by 60 per cent and increased profits by 20 per cent. Of course, that scheme also introduced associated environmental benefits.
<P>

<a name="30401-46_para33"></a>On the same page of the publication, there is reference to a nursery that achieved an,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"84 per cent reduction in mains water use through rainwater recycling".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-46_para34"></a>
The nursery cut its water consumption by 58 per cent an acre. The scheme improved the whole regime and the quality of the nursery's business.
<P>

<a name="30401-46_para35"></a>The case for such programmes has been well made by those who have been motivated and brave enough and who have received awards. It should be a basic requirement of licence applicants that they produce some form of plan about how they intend to use the water efficiently. If they have nothing much in place in that regard, there might be a requirement for a year-on-year improvement. That may seem a little onerous to them in the beginning. However, the examples of businesses that have had efficiency programmes, of which I have quoted only two of many, show that considerable cost savings may result. That is what is known in the jargon as a classic win-win situation.
<P>

<a name="30401-46_para36"></a>I remind Members of the Committee, although they may not need reminding, that under the Bill small users will be excluded completely from the abstraction requirement. The Bill applies only to larger users, which are the ones that we hope will start to consider efficiency savings. Therefore, the amendment is important. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30401-47_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I shall add a couple of comments. I hope that the Minister will not say that the amendment is not necessary, although I imagine that he will. I should not prejudge what he says, but the Government may be reluctant to add to a Bill of more than 200 pages.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para0"></a>The noble Baroness gave good examples of how efficiency programmes could aid in saving water and help businesses. My comment is in the form of a question. I had presumed that such a programme would be required by the agency as part of the proposed system. That is why I wondered whether the Minister might be saying no. We support the better use of water resources. That is key for all of us. The more water we can save, conserve and re-use in other areas, the more it will help not just local communities, but the wider community. Does the agency already require that? I think I am looking at the Minister, although I am also looking at the noble Baroness, Lady Young. I am not sure who will respond. I think it will be the Minister.

<P>

<a name="30401-47_para1"></a>First, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for her kind words about the agency's water efficiency awards. However, I shall incur yet again the wrath of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, in similar terms to the wrath that I incurred in the previous Committee sitting on the Bill. We are going to talk about water efficiency at a number of points throughout the Bill. As I said on the previous water efficiency amendment, this one expresses an admirable sentiment. We all want water to be used more efficiently for a variety of reasons&#151;for the environment, but also so that there is water available for all the many and varied needs of water users.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para2"></a>The amendment addresses the technical point of whether an application is made by an entitled person&#151;I do not mean Members of the House of Lords; I am talking about whether the application is properly made. That is not the right point on which to be considering water efficiency. It would be more appropriately considered when we are discussing general issues of whether the licence should be granted, rather than simply whether the person making the application is the right one to do so. The amendment would add bureaucracy without necessarily delivering the water efficiency benefits that we are all looking for. The issue will come up on a number of occasions. There are other points in the Bill when water efficiency will be far more pertinent and could be more successfully delivered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-47_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We all recognise that when the Environment Agency is determining a licence application it will need to assess whether the applicant has a reasonable requirement for water. That requires an assessment of the efficiency of the use of that water. The amendment would make an undefined water efficiency programme a precondition. More clarity about what that means would be needed were we to amend the Bill in that way. Because the efficient use of water is a key element, we need to make sure that what we put on the statute book is the appropriate way of dealing with the issue.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para3"></a>I suspect that we shall return later to how water efficiency is judged and the duties of the Environment Agency in considering licences. The amendment is not appropriate in its present formulation. It could lead to arguments about what is and is not a water efficiency <P>


<a name="column_GC121"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>programme rather than allowing the Environment Agency to make a judgment on how the abstractor was likely to use the water. I would not like to pursue the amendment in this form at this point in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-47_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank noble Lords who have spoken and the Minister for his reply. By having several different amendments, we are at least narrowing it down to a point in the Bill where the issue will be acceptable. Maybe I have been misled by the titles of the clauses. I wanted to define who may apply for a licence with this amendment. I hear the argument of the noble Baroness, Lady Young, that it is better to consider whether the person has a programme of water efficiency later when their licence is being considered. I remind the Committee that we are talking about larger users, not all the small ones, who have been removed from the Bill. It is more appropriate for that to be considered as the first thing before the licence is applied for. That is why I tabled the amendment at this point in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para4"></a>By Report I am sure we will have honed down the perfect place for the perfect amendment to achieve what many of us want. I hope that we shall also define a water efficiency programme. I am sure that the Government might feel inclined to help us with that task. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) the willingness of the applicant to have regard to efficiency and sustainability in their use of water;
<br>
( ) the likely effect of any abstraction on soil management."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30401-47_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are on the same subject again, although in a different context. The amendment would insert in Clause 13 a similar requirement that an applicant should be willing to have regard to efficiency and sustainability in their use of water.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para11"></a>The amendment is slightly different from the previous one in that it refers to the sustainable use of water. I am testing whether this is a more appropriate place in the Bill for such an amendment.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para12"></a>The second part of the amendment is slightly more specialised, referring to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the likely effect of any abstraction on soil management".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-47_para13"></a>
That is a reference to some of the thoughts in the Water Framework Directive. For example, an applicant's management of their soil may have compacted it to such an extent that it does not retain water well and needs more irrigation as a result. Whatever is sprayed on to the soil runs off fast. The direction of the ploughing and any subsequent way in which soil can be managed after that all leads to a need for ever more water to be abstracted and sprayed on to the soil to achieve ends that, were the soil managed properly, would require much less water. We have not debated <P>


<a name="column_GC122"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those soil management issues so far, but I believe that we should do so. Were the Water Framework Directive part of the Bill, we would most certainly be debating them at length. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-47_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 43 and 44, which are in this group. Through the Minister, I shall also respond to the quiet rebuke of the noble Baroness, Lady Young, for my reaction to her comments at the previous sitting. The amendment then was not about efficiency, but about conservation. There is a great difference between conserving water and using it efficiently. They often run side by side, but there is a distinct difference that we shall return to.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para14"></a>Clause 13 provides for three forms of licence&#151;transfer licences, temporary licences and full licences. Following an application for an abstraction, the Bill allows the agency to decide which licence type is most suitable for the applicant. The implication of Amendment No. 43 is that, in deciding the most suitable licence type, the agency should have regard to the needs of the business requesting the licence. The NFU considers it vital that the Bill ensures that the agency has regard to the operational needs of the businesses and the likely effect of any variation in licence when deciding which type of abstraction licence will be the most suitable.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para15"></a>On Amendment No. 44, I understand that the Water Resources Act gave national parks special rights relating to appeals against decisions on applications, which would be of special concern, according to page 41 of Butterworth. The clause seems to suggest that these special rights will not extend to appeals on the agency's decision on the types of abstraction licence. If so, why the change?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-47_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Clause 13 allows the Environment Agency to decide the type, number and groupings of licences that should be granted, based on the likely effect of the abstraction. That is the only issue relevant to that decision. Amendment No. 42 would add additional factors relating sustainability to those that the agency may consider in those circumstances. However, the type or groupings of licences are not relevant to matters of sustainability. When finally determining an application, whichever type is eventually issued, the agency must already have regard to sustainable development, which would include soil management where relevant. It must also take costs and benefits into account. Water efficiency is an essential element of considering the reasonable requirements of an applicant.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para16"></a>I hope that the intention of the amendment is therefore fully met and that, with those assurances, the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw it.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para17"></a>The factor mentioned in Amendment No. 43 is already considered by the agency. In any case, the applicant will have a right of appeal against a decision on the type of licence if he believes that it will adversely affect his business interests.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para18"></a>The national park authorities are currently involved in the appeals process for licensing decisions in their area. That is right, because the licensing decisions can <P>


<a name="column_GC123"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have implications for water resources in that area and, in turn, for the nature of the local environment. However, their involvement in decisions on the type of licence, as proposed by Amendment No. 44, would have no direct bearing on that and would involve the national parks in additional effort to little effect. I hope that clarification satisfies the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para19"></a>Amendment No. 42 would add subjective matters to the determination of licence type, such as the willingness of applicants to use water efficiently. If the agency considers that water efficiency conditions should be imposed, it will impose those conditions and the abstractor will have to comply with them. I hope that reassurance satisfies the noble Baroness, Lady Miller.
<P>

<a name="30401-47_para20"></a>The Environment Agency must have regard at all times to relevant considerations. The potential relationship between the water and soil to which the noble Baroness referred, such as absorbency and potential run-off, will be relevant considerations.

<a name="column_GC124"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>websites. Amendment No. 45 inserts the idea of using websites into the Bill in order to test the proposition. Amendment No. 46 suggests that the prescribed means of publishing should,
<P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-48_para8"></a><P>

<a name="30401-48_para9"></a>I believe that there is still a requirement for advertisements to appear in places such as the London Gazette. Many noble Lords may regularly see that organ, but I am not one of them. The Minister tut-tutted when I said that&#151;I am sure that the London Gazette is very informative. However, we should consider the use of websites and more modern ways of notifying interested parties of what is happening. Will the Minister say something about the appropriate places in which to publish information? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-48_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I support the amendment. This kind of amendment is almost in the nature of a hardy annual, as it appears at every season in every Bill. I remember it arising during the passage of the Greater London Authority Bill. We suggested that that authority should publish some details of its consultations and decisions on a website as a way of supplying sufficient information. I wonder about that.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para10"></a>Nowadays, anyone running the sort of business in which they might be involved in water abstraction is almost bound to be computer literate. I shall immediately hear howls of protest and shall probably receive letters from people throughout the country saying that they have never seen a computer&#151;such is life. Even I, albeit after a few years of drumming in this House, have had to become somewhat computer literate. I would not describe myself as completely computer literate, but I get by. I would have thought that, if the Environment Agency published on its website what was going on, that should be sufficient publication. For information of this kind, the London Gazette is a trifle antiquated. The information needs to be spread throughout the country, and my strong suspicion is that, in the provinces, the London Gazette is not widely distributed of a Friday afternoon. I am glad that the amendment was tabled. If the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, had not put it down, I would have done so myself. I am happy to support it.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para11"></a>It is perhaps a little unnecessary to suggest that the process should be reviewed regularly by the Secretary of State. If Amendment No. 45 were agreed to, it might be wise for the Secretary of State to make sure that the system was working adequately. However, once he had determined that it was, as I suspect he would, he probably would not need to review it again.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para12"></a>All the indications are that society is becoming more, not less, computer literate. If the publication of information were satisfactory at one point in time, it is unlikely that it would become unsatisfactory at some point in the future, unless someone devises a novel way of communication that we have not yet dreamt of. That may happen, given the changes taking place in communications. The information might come up on the television screen or something similar.

<FONT SIZE=3>and transfer abstraction licences and for impounding licences. The way in which that information is advertised is important.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para13"></a>We intend to make regulations that will provide the Environment Agency with the flexibility to use its website to provide the information, but we would not necessarily wish to confine it to using the website, as the amendment, by implication at least, would do. Other technologies&#151;older and newer&#151;might provide better or, at least, complementary ways of communicating the website. If we put the matter into regulations rather than into the Bill, we shall have the kind of flexibility that Amendment No. 46 was intended to provide without referring the matter to the Secretary of State. That is probably a better way of going forward on that front.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para14"></a>Not wishing to be outshone by the technological frontiersmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, I think that we must prepare for the future. We must also recognise, however, that some colleagues and some people involved even in this business may still be slightly behind the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-48_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, for his contribution and the Minister for his reply. I do not believe that the amendment confines publication to the website. It simply adds that in and leaves open the definition of "prescribed way". As the Minister said, that is likely to appear in regulations. I do not believe that it is a confining amendment. But I hope that this debate will encourage in the review of the regulations the use of websites and appropriate newspapers, not simply those that have always been used, which few people now read. In the light of that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

We are actually talking about the renewal of licences&#151;where water is already being used&#151;therefore I realise that I am arguing against myself, which is not what I intended. I hope that the Committee will bear with me as I speak to the amendments and interpret them as I hope to later. The amendment would provide that,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there shall be a presumption in favour of the grant of a new licence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-48_para25"></a>
It relates to the renewal of a licence; therefore, it is hugely important.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para26"></a>It is important that businesses have continuity for planning purposes. The NFU is one of the organisations that believes that the Environment Agency should offer a presumption in favour of renewal, especially in circumstances where the lifespan of plant and equipment might be greater than that of the licence available. Such factors must be considered when making decisions on borrowing capital. The NFU believes that a licence should be refused only if the Environment Agency can show that the water resource is fully used. As I explained, that is the aspect on which I have a problem with my amendment, so I shall move on to other points.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para27"></a>The CBI in its briefing expressed concern about how licences are granted. The British Soft Drinks Association, which I referred to during the previous Committee session, is equally concerned about the time lag on licences. It wishes us to consider introducing a 20-year licence. Soft drinks companies work on a long-term licence. They seek a presumption in favour of renewing those licences. When we debated quarrying, a presumption in favour of renewal was sought. So the amendment does not deal with any particular area; it relates to the general consideration of licence applications. We should bear in mind the issues raised.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para28"></a>Amendment No. 53 deals specifically with the term of licence that one might expect or hope for.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para29"></a>In our considerations last week, the Minister indicated that a 12-year lifespan might be selected. However, as we mentioned then, it is impossible for many businesses to work in such a short timescale. The amendment would provide for a 25-year licence. I shall be interested to hear what other noble Lords have to say about such a term. I might have proposed a period of 30 years or left it open-ended, but I think that the Government understandably wish to reconsider giving open-ended licences. Therefore, I understand their decision to tighten up the present procedures.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para30"></a>Clause 19 imposes an expiry date for all new abstraction licences. Although no likely time is set in the Bill, initially the Government and the agency have suggested that they are contemplating a 12-year lifespan. As I have already said, if a time limit is to be imposed on abstraction licences, it is important that the limit is sufficient to allow horticulture, agriculture and other businesses&#151;I include them all&#151;to recoup investment in their necessary capital equipment, <P>


<a name="column_GC127"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which, by its very nature will be medium to long term and not short term. We also had a debate about water companies.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para31"></a>It is a clear example of the importance of giving adequate time limits. They can be seen in the process of many different kinds of businesses. If one takes a big business such as watercress farming, which is entirely dependent on the right to abstract water, most of its assets would have little value without this right. A supply of high-quality ground water is essential to commercial cultivation of items such as watercress. Safe, hygienic production standards are required for the cultivation of the crop, which is carried out on constructed beds, and associated works. It has a life expectancy of more than 50 years&#151;one would not have thought so.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para32"></a>The practice of one of the largest companies in this field is to write off its capital assets at 2 per cent per annum, which is equivalent to a 50-year write-off period. There are many other examples that I could give. Certainly, many have raised queries and concerns as to the possibility of moving to a 12-year turnover.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para33"></a>The CBI is concerned about that. The Bill introduces a right to revoke a licence without compensation if it has not been used for four years. Mineral operators need to be able to plan their operations over long periods. They have given periods of 25 years and above in order to justify the high capital investment involved. That needs to be included in securing abstraction licences well in advance of any that may be required. A short time limit is unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para34"></a>We have touched on the issue earlier. It is sometimes difficult when one is working through a Bill on which, by its very nature, one keeps returning to the same argument. As I have tried to reflect, the amendment does not apply to one particular little group. It applies to the sectors that I mentioned and many others&#151;CBI, the soft drinks industry, quarrying, water companies and farming. Their needs are very different. One would not have thought that watercress worked on a 50-year cycle, but one would naturally have assumed that water companies do, by the nature of their infrastructure.
<P>

<a name="30401-48_para35"></a>We hope that the Government will deal with the amendments sympathetically. I am prepared for the Minister to come back to me on Amendment No. 48. I shall return with a shorter version of that amendment, because I shot myself in the foot in arguing the toss on that matter. That certainly was not my intention. I beg to move.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-49_para1"></a>
The principle behind the amendment is that the period is probably equivalent to half a working lifetime&#151;although for those who like me who have had the good fortune or misfortune to work for 45 years before coming to this place, one could multiply that period by three.
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para2"></a>The amendment is closely related to Amendment No. 55, which tackles the investment question, the write-off of equipment and the depreciation in value of equipment that may be installed. It also relates to Amendment No. 60, which was tabled by the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Members of the Committee. It is an important amendment, because it presumes that licences can be renewed.
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para3"></a>I realise that we are not debating Amendment No. 60, but there is a close relationship between the two amendments. If a licence were granted for 15 years, there is a good chance that the licence would stand for 30 years, if Amendment No. 60 became law. I understand why the CBI and others have lobbied for a longer licence, and I note that Amendment No. 53&#151;which was spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford&#151;asks for not less than 25 years. However, given that we have intractable environmental problems such as global warming, even if there is an almost automatic renewal, we should be able to review a licence after a period of time. Good reasons should be given if a licence is revoked at any point. I press the Minister, as the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, did, whether it is intended within the purview of the Bill that a licence should last for 12 years? We are really debating whether renewal should take place at 12, 15 or 25 years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-49_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I intervene from the Back Benches to support the amendment. On Second Reading I declared my interest as chairman of Vivendi Water UK, which is a water supply company. I apologise to the Committee for not having been present when some of these matters were debated last week. I support the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, particularly on the presumption of renewal. Twenty-five years would be an appropriate period.
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para4"></a>There are other amendments on the subject and I do not want to speak for more than a few moments. Having a water company interest, I am particularly impressed by the argument about capital expenditure and the impossibility of imagining that people will be willing to put the sort of money that is needed into the infrastructure without an adequate period within which the money can be recovered. That is a strong argument for a lengthy period of licence.
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para5"></a>I support what the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, has said and I hope that the Government will offer some help.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-49_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   It would help me in responding if Members of the Committee could stick to the amendments in the group. I am getting slightly confused, because people are now speaking to <P>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a wider group. As the Government Whip, I am happy if Members of the Committee wish to group 12 amendments together.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-49_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   One of the worrying aspects of the Bill from my standpoint, which I mentioned earlier, is that a large part of it deals with the abstraction of water to be used as water, although there are other elements in the Bill as well, such as abstracting water as drainage from deep excavation. Westminster Tube Station might be an example of that.
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para6"></a>Many years ago I was engaged at the entrance loch to Grangemouth harbour on the River Forth. It was a big project consisting of two parallel lines of caissons with a coffer dam at each end. This left inside a quadrangle a very big hole, after excavating the soil, which filled with water. That is no use if you are trying to build something at the bottom of it. We de-watered the hole, and in so doing we reduced the water table on the outside of the hole, which disturbed some of the buildings around the harbour&#151;or at any rate caused them some alarm. We then put the water back into the outside at the same time as we were taking it out from the inside. Engineers do that kind of thing because they think it is useful, but it does not fit this Bill terribly well.
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para7"></a>Something similar applies in draining a quarry. You take the water out of the quarry because you have to do the workings and you put it somewhere else&#151;probably back into the aquifer nearby or into some other nearby water course&#151;without having used it. You have just shifted it over a bit.
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para8"></a>When you deal with a quarry, you have a problem. You have planning permissions for the abstraction of the rock, gravel, sand or whatever it happens to be, and, under the new proposal, you will need a licence for the removal of the water. That is fine as far as it goes, except that the lifetime of a quarry might be very long. I am acquainted with quarries which have been there&#151;and are still working&#151;all my life, which is now a considerable time.
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para9"></a>A problem arises if the licence to de-water does not coincide with the planning permission. Twelve years has been suggested. Twelve years is hopeless for a quarry that might last for 50 years, 60 years or even longer. Fifteen years has been suggested. It is an improvement, but only a trivial one. Twenty-five years is beginning to look right, but only like half the thing. What really is required is for the extent of the licence to be as long as or nearly as long as the extent of the planning permission. Therefore, for the kind of reasons put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, the quarrying companies can invest, plan ahead and run their businesses in a proper capitalistic manner.
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para10"></a>I hope that the Minister will pay some attention to Amendment No. 54A, which stands in my name. We hope that whatever happens there will be a substantial opportunity for appeal against the length of a licence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-49_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I apologise for not being here at the beginning of the Committee, but, like other Members of the Committee, I have to cut myself into two and attend the Select Committee on Economic Affairs, which is dealing with minor matters such as Finance Bills. However, I came into the Committee and thought, "Goodness gracious, there is some repetition", because we dealt with quarrying last Thursday, which was highly educational and very interesting.
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para11"></a>I return to the point. I support absolutely the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, who spoke on this point as chairman of Vivendi. I also must declare an interest as a director&#151;not a chairman&#151;of a water-only company. The position must be stated that since the privatisation of the water industry there is a regulatory procedure whereby Ofwat will allow a certain amount against investment. However, if Ofwat allows investment and takes it on board that the infrastructure produced by water companies will last, say, 30 years, not in its wildest days would it allow water companies to write it off against five, 10 or even 15 years. The Government must try and get their head around this. The investment requirement in terms of length of investment and return on investment is huge in this industry, and in particular in the water supply industry.
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para12"></a>As I mentioned in my Second Reading speech on the issue, thankfully we still have Victorian pipes, which are 150 years old. Indeed, some of the wonderful investments made in the 1960s in PVC pipes now have to be replaced because they are not as good as the Victorian ones. Such problems have arisen with the infrastructure, and no one is really aware of them. I hope that DEFRA will keep close to the people who actually know the ins and outs and the problems of the infrastructure. That is not special pleading, it is pleading on behalf of all of us as water consumers. The last thing we want is to have no water running out of our taps.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-49_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   I support my noble friend Lady Byford's amendment, Amendment No. 48. I am glad that my noble friend has confirmed that she appears to have got herself into some muddle over the amendment. I have read it more times than I care to recall and I still cannot make any sense of it. I thoroughly support and understand the principles that my noble friend is getting at; that is, a presumption of renewal.
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para13"></a>We had an extensive debate on Amendment No. 30. We addressed the need for consultation. If there was a presumption in favour of renewal, to a large extent Amendment No. 30 would be negated. One other key issue is that if an amendment to the effect that my noble friend seeks could be accepted, it would require the Environment Agency to explain carefully and in a robust fashion why a licence was not going to be given. That would be quite an advantage. It would add transparency to the way that the operation was going to be conducted. In essence, I am very much behind what my noble friend is trying to extract with Amendment No. 48.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-49_para14"></a>I briefly speak to Amendment No. 53. We have had clear examples from a number of noble Lords as to how the 12-year lifetime for licences simply will not be enough for businesses to invest with confidence. My noble friend suggested 25 years. I suspect that at the end of the day there will have to be some degree of flexibility. Clearly, 12 years is not enough, and 25 years is probably more than enough in most cases. To hold it firmly at 12 years will quite frankly not be acceptable.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-50_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I shall keep my remarks about the length of the licence and associated investments for later amendments. I wish to make some remarks on Amendment No. 54A, which stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Howie. It is a particularly sensible amendment, given the complexity for planning authorities trying to weigh up all the different issues. I have in mind, for example, the issues surrounding Whatley Quarry's extension in Somerset. Those were whether it would be able to quarry extra minerals and the feared effects on waters as far away as under the city of Bath, which, obviously, is dependent on its spa waters, having recently invested considerably in renewing its ancient system.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para0"></a>If planning permission is not tied in with the length of abstraction licence granted, it could lay the ground for the payment of compensation where a planning permission was granted but could not be fully effected because, for example, the period of water abstraction licence was too short. I think the Minister earlier said that a payment would have to be made by other licence abstractors, which seems particularly unfair on them. It is not their fault that the two permissions were not coterminous. Therefore, I very much support the spirit of the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-50_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I comment briefly on Amendments Nos. 53 and 54 in order to highlight how there are considerable investments in assets by water companies and others that do not seem to cause problems in terms of renewal of discharge licences as well as abstraction licences. Previously in Committee and at Second Reading, I drew a parallel with licences granted to sewage undertakers on discharges, which are reviewed at between four and six-year intervals without any difficulty. Indeed, the water resources strategies that are drawn up between the economic and environmental regulators of the water industries with the water industry are, I think, an extremely good 25-year framework for such issues to be worked through.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para1"></a>The Water Framework Directive will set a rolling six-year review period and therefore 12 years seems a sensible balance between the concerns of people about long-term assets and the needs of the Water Framework Directive.
<P>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para2"></a>I also comment on Amendment No. 54A, standing in the name of my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon. I shall probably repeat what I said when the issue arose when last we were in Committee. However, he was not here to hear it in person, so I shall say it again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-50_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   I read it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-50_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   There is no doubt that planning permission for mineral workings and for quarries can take an extremely long time and in some cases are not time-limited, or they are dependent on aged minerals permissions of which it is difficult to see the origins. Quarry and mineral de-watering is also incredibly unpredictable as quarries expand and go deeper. The new point that I want to raise with the noble Lord is that, if quarry de-watering is simply going to return water to the environment in the way he described with the hole in Scotland, I suggest that he need not be concerned about the withdrawal of the licence because it demonstrably would not have an impact on the environment&#151;if indeed what he describes is the situation that was being licensed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-50_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   If that was so, then what is my noble friend worried about?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-50_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   The problem we face is that we have a country with a growing population, we have a growing economy, and, although unquestionably there are economies and efficiencies which can be made in the use of water, the likelihood and the reality is that water consumption will increase. The issue is how we deal with it.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para3"></a>One thing that bothers me about the whole licensing regime is that most of major water infrastructure in the country was produced long before licences were even thought about. We see the licensing regime as a means of managing the water supply. It may be; it is a tool. But the real question we must ask ourselves, and which we have not really addressed is this: what we are going to do to enhance the volume of usable water? There is a great deal of usable water and we let an awful lot of it run out to sea.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para4"></a>If we return from that broad perspective to a specific catchment area, which is finding itself in difficulty, the real question we must ask is: do we start to restrict users, who have a jolly good reason for needing the water, or do we tackle the problem from the other end and see what we can do to enhance supply? That is the big issue that really lies behind the questions raised by so many Members of the Committee who have already spoken. I am very grateful for the words, in particular those of the noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Howie, and of my noble friend Lady O'Cathain in making this point.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para5"></a>What worries me a little is that if the licensing regime is seen as a tool for managing water, we may miss the real point, which is how we enhance the required volume of water. If one asks that question, then one finds oneself in slightly difficult territory because the question is: whose responsibility is that? We can say that perhaps it goes with the major water utilities. But their real interest now is to provide for their own <P>


<a name="column_GC133"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>security of supply. I am not quite sure whether their remit&#151;and perhaps the Minister in his response will reassure me on this&#151;really runs to this wider issue of enhancing the national available water resource, because there is plenty of water there but we do not do perhaps enough to conserve it.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para6"></a>When we come back to how we deal with that problem, we come back to the huge timescale mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. There is a 20-year planning process that must be gone through, before we can begin to find major solutions, such as Rutland Water or Graffham or whatever it is now called. That issue must be faced. If such solutions are to be found, people will need certainty.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para7"></a>We can review what happens in a catchment area every 12 years, or we can review it every six years, but we do not need to review the licences as part of that process. The licences can continue. They are the measure of the demand that must be met. Fiddling around and withdrawing licences or reducing amounts by 5 per cent because an area is under pressure is not the solution. If an area is coming under pressure, the solution is to enhance the available water. That is the approach that we must adopt.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para8"></a>One accepts that global warming might make the situation impossible. I went to a fort in Oman that was in pristine&#151;almost unused&#151;condition. It was built for defensive reasons when there was a jolly good water supply, but, within only a few years, the water went and the area became desert, leaving that magnificent building useless. If we had that sort of shift, there would be nothing that the Environment Agency could to about it, and I would not blame it. Going by the projections about global warming that I have heard, I am concerned that it is likely that precipitation will increase. It will become more seasonal and more freaky. If that is the case, it enhances my argument.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para9"></a>We must think about security of available water. That is the big issue that lies behind the amendments. I support what has been said. It is not sensible to have licences lasting for 12 years. We shall come to the question of the presumption of renewal later.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-50_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I must respond to the debate on Amendment No. 54.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para10"></a>The problem is that we have different types of water user and different types of industry consuming water. We have been discussing depreciation, in one sense, and I can give a few examples. In the Elan Valley complex, which supplies Birmingham, the pipes are 100 years old and are still in use, although, by accounting methods, they were written off some time ago. There may be some mileage in examining accounting conventions for depreciation. For example, the water bottling industry may have equipment that can be written off over a 25-year period. There may be other industries connected with water for which shorter periods would apply.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para11"></a>We must not neglect advances in technology. After all, in accounting or business, it is not always a good thing to write off equipment over a long time. In some <P>


<a name="column_GC134"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>industries, there are grants made as tax allowances that depend on the short-term writing-off of equipment, so that industries can keep up with technology. There may be a case for publication&#151;it is only an idea&#151;of an accounting convention for different parts of the water industry that could be related to licences. That is particularly important.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para12"></a>I make one other point. At the time of water privatisation, the assets of the water industry were reduced from £30 billion to £7 billion&#151;at a stroke.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-50_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I begin by thanking noble Lords for eventually dealing with the group before us. To the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, I say what, I believe, I said in answer to a point raised on the first day in Committee by the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain: the Environment Agency has responsibility for water resource management in total. I stress that it is not a case of either/or; it is both that and many other things as well.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para13"></a>In spite of all that has been said, the Water Bill does not fix the duration of any new abstraction licences. It simply requires that a time limit be placed on licences. It does not prescribe. There is a clear presumption of renewal, as set out in Taking Water Responsibly.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para14"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, admitted that there were some difficulties with Amendment No. 48. It would significantly limit the ability of the Environment Agency to refuse to renew a licence to a very narrow set of circumstances and would affect its ability to manage our water resources sustainably. The agency has set out three tests for a request for renewal: environmental sustainability must not be in question; the need for the licence must be demonstrated; and water extracted under the licence is being and will be used efficiently. The agency will determine whether environmental sustainability is in question. In certain circumstances and if there are concerns about local conditions, the applicant may be required to supply supporting information. Demonstrating that the water is used efficiently and that there is continued justification of need will depend on the provision of information.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para15"></a>The agency is required to give reasons for decisions, in cases in which a licence is granted or not granted or departs in any material way from the form in which it was sought. That said, a presumption of renewal will apply to all time-limited licences. That commitment was given by the Government and by the agency in its recent guidance. Time limits are there to provide an opportunity for review in the light of climate change. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, made the point that there could be dramatic change over a certain period, but the 25-year option would be too long to allow such changes to be taken properly into account. Having said that, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, that the 12-year period is not fixed either. Other durations are allowed. If, as I have said, an applicant objects to the duration, not only is there a right of appeal but the agency must have considered costs and benefits in the licence that it granted.
<P>


<a name="column_GC135"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para16"></a>We worry that it would be dangerous to stipulate the duration of licences in the Bill. Licences could be of longer or shorter duration, or there may need to be investigations over a few years. As the noble Earl, Lord Peel, said, flexibility is necessary. We believe that we have built that flexibility into the Bill. It is up to the Environment Agency, as the licensing authority, to decide on duration case by case. Incorporating a criterion such as a minimum duration, as proposed in Amendment No. 53, or a fixed period, as proposed in Amendment No. 54, could override other criteria, to the disadvantage of all.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para17"></a>Amendment No. 54 would remove from the Environment Agency the responsibility for determining the time limit to apply to all licences for de-watering activities. I reassure my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon that quarry and mine operators will have the same opportunities as other abstractors to submit to the Environment Agency a business case in support of their application. That business case could address issues relating to the proposed lifespan of the licence. The time restriction on the operator would form part of the submission, which the agency must take into account.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para18"></a>I was fascinated by my noble friend's account of his experience of the return of water to the same source. However, although it is not a common experience, if de-watering in mining has taken place, it is not always possible to return the water to the source from which it came, although the total water available to the community may be the same at the end of the process. I think that that was the point that was made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, who spoke of the impact on other abstractors of quarrying in a situation in which there could be a dramatic change in the water table. That is why the Environment Agency should have the opportunity to take into account all those factors.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para19"></a>The lifetime of the infrastructure inseparably associated with the authorisation will extend over the exact and desired period of validity. That is one of the choices that the Government insisted in Taking Water Responsibly must be included. The agency's original guidance, Managing Water Abstraction, published in 2001, picked that up, along with the various points that it used in support.
<P>

<a name="30401-50_para20"></a>Throughout our debates, noble Lords have expressed concerns&#151;occasionally, they are opposing concerns&#151;that have equal validity. That underlines the need for the Environment Agency to have the flexibility to meet the diverse circumstances that arise. I hope that my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon will join us later on, because I am sure that he will learn that there is a wide range of knowledge here and the diversity that has underlain this debate will also be a feature of later stages.

<A NAME="30401-51_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   I am not certain where the figure of 12 years came from. It may be a recommendation that emanated from some government advisory document. <P>


<a name="column_GC136"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I suggest that, if 12 years is written down somewhere, it should be removed, and some flexibility should be built into the guidelines.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-51_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I believe that it is two review periods that are indicated. As I said, there is enormous scope for variation in the licences issued. Each case must be considered on its merits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-51_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   I accept that, but the point that I am trying to make is that the flexibility on which the noble Baroness puts such stress&#151;I concur with that&#151;is being undermined by the figure of 12 years that seems to have emerged. We seem to be getting stuck on it. Can the noble Baroness assure us that that figure can be eliminated?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-51_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   There must be a deemed review period, in order for people to have a working strategy. There is enormous value in not going through the Bill and trying to dot every "i" and cross every "t", which is what would happen if there were a presumption of a fixed term for all types of licence or for all types of licence in a particular area, such as quarrying.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-51_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sits down, I wish to press her on my question about the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Howie. If a quarry is granted planning permission for the extraction of a certain volume of minerals where the work might continue for 20 years but, say, 12 years later it has its application for an abstraction licence denied and cannot extract the material for the remaining eight years, who is liable to pay compensation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-51_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Obviously, it comes from the pool of money available from the proceeds of abstraction. Such a situation would occur where there has been a radical change in water availability. A refusal of permission to continue abstraction would not be an arbitrary decision. An abstraction licence would be refused because the impact of changes to the water resource in the locality was so great that the quarry could be denying any water at all to others with abstraction rights.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-51_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for her kind remarks and for her invitation to return to the Committee. I have tabled further amendments, so I shall return. It will be interesting to hear the diversity of views. But the Minister must realise that I have been in the Labour Party for 50 years and am quite used to a diversity of views. I have seldom heard anything else, so there is nothing new in that.
<P>

<a name="30401-51_para0"></a>I take some encouragement from what the Minister says, but I impress upon her that water abstraction in quarrying is different from water supply. I assume, therefore, that the Environment Agency, which has kindly been in attendance throughout, will observe the <P>


<a name="column_GC137"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>difference. When the agency grants licences with the flexibility that my noble friend mentions, she will realise that the difference is acute.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-51_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I would not like my noble friend to interpret my remarks as meaning anything other than that the Environment Agency must have regard to all the individual factors on a case-by-case basis. There may be occasions when the inference drawn by my noble friend is deemed correct; equally, there may be instances when it is not.

<A NAME="30401-51_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Howie, that he should not think that he will sleep well over the next few weeks. He ought to go further into the Bill, where he will find that there are many other problems. I support his points, but I also support those of the Environment Agency. There are ways and means of getting over the problem. We are talking about sustainable development, environmental impact and all such issues, but sometimes we cannot see the wood for the trees. The situation is not as easy as the noble Lord says. I do not think that he has received any sort of satisfaction from the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-51_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   Sometimes you cannot see the trees for the wood.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-51_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank everyone who contributed to this crucial debate. On a lighter note, the Minister said that it was interesting to hear many differing views from all sides of the Committee&#151;that is what democracy is supposed to be about. The Minister did not suggest otherwise, but the comment made me smile wryly, because that is exactly why we are here.
<P>

<a name="30401-51_para1"></a>It is lovely to see the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, in his place. The Committee was aware that he could not attend our deliberations last week. He highlighted a problem mentioned by other noble Lords&#151;a lack of willingness to invest if the time-scale is too short. The noble Baroness said that she felt there was no need for that consideration because there was a presumption of renewal. If there is such a presumption, it should be in the Bill. If the Government are not willing to include it, I, and, I suspect, many other noble Lords, would infer that there must be some reason for its absence. I wish to establish that immediately.
<P>

<a name="30401-51_para2"></a>The question of whether the period is 25 years, 15 years or whatever is important to different industries, as we discussed. I am sure that the Environment Agency will take that into account. I support the suggestion of several noble Lords that a degree of flexibility is needed. However, the Committee faces the challenge of writing into the Bill provision for flexibility on the one hand and long-term investment on the other. We shall definitely return to the issue on Report. It is important to realise that certain industries require longer-term investment. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Howie. We reflected during our deliberations last week that planning permission and licensing for quarries is perhaps a sensible approach. It may well be the same for water companies, but I do not wish to deal with specific areas at this stage.

<a name="30401-51_para3"></a>Everyone who spoke agreed that the timescale was a problem. The Minister acknowledged that also, but she said that a presumption of renewal was already taken into account. Most members on all sides of the Committee would like to see that written into the Bill. If the Committee could divide, I would ask that it do so on this amendment. The wording may not be perfect, but the principle has been established today and was reflected last week. I hope that the Government will think about the amendments and return on Report with a way to meet the concerns that were so clearly expressed.
<P>

<a name="30401-51_para4"></a>On the 12-year licence, no Member on this side of the Committee questions the requirement of the need to review. Nobody objects to a six-year renewal period or whatever it is. But, within that, there is no use in creating uncertainty. It may be pointed out to a company in the review that there is a growing concern about water availability or climatic change, for example. But businesses must be able to make long-term plans. I hope that I have reflected that clearly. My noble friend Lord Peel and others rightly said that flexibility was needed.
<P>

<a name="30401-51_para5"></a>The most important aspect to emerge from the discussions on these amendments is timescale. A balance must be struck as regards what is possible or what is not possible. I have not seen anything written down, as far as the Government are concerned, to suggest that they are looking at 12 years. But the difficulty is that "12 years" has been picked up in the general domain and therefore people and businesses are looking for a 12-year cycle. So if the Minister could in some way clarify that there is nothing about 12 years, that would be sensible and would, as I hope that I have indicated, show that there is a degree of flexibility and an acknowledgement that reviews need to be held.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-51_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I stress that 12 years is not fixed&#151;other periods are allowed. I hope that that reassures people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-51_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   It is immensely helpful to have that recorded again. I hope that the Government will look at the amendments to see whether they can return on Report with suitable words to reflect the concerns expressed by the Committee. We seek a common-sense ability for long-term investment, a degree of flexibility for those who do not require as long a period as others, and a presumption in favour of renewal. Had I not had a more satisfactory answer from the Minister, and if the Committee could divide, I would have called for a Division on this amendment. I will be grateful if those few words spur the Government to meet some of our concerns. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

Many affected businesses have made investments and use specific amounts of water to sustain their businesses.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-52_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I shall not repeat everything that I said about existing use. I support the principle of these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-52_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We have discussed this point. Existing use by licensed and unlicensed users must be taken into account. The Environment Agency already has a duty to have regard to all relevant considerations, as subsection (3) indicates. If it does not do so, it could be challenged. Likewise, reasonable demands will have to be taken into account. In that sense, the amendment is unnecessary. It would be odd to pick out a consideration applying to one group of abstractors without dealing with others.
<P>

<a name="30401-52_para0"></a>The noble Lord requested a list of the abstractors. An abstractor is anyone who exceeds the threshold. Trickle irrigation has been picked out because previously a special exemption applied to it. But anyone exceeding the threshold will come within the purview of the licensing system. The use of the water, the efficiency of water use, its relevance, the impact on other abstractors and other such aspects must be taken into account. That is but one of the relevant issues that the Environment Agency will have to address, and it will address it. I hope that all Committee members understand that. Pursuing this specific amendment would not be helpful.

I suspect that they already know. However, I would not like to think that they would wake up one morning and find that they are covered by the controls of this legislation. Perhaps we can return to this issue and consider the whole range of those who will be affected by the Bill. One thing that I have noticed in other legislative processes in which I have been involved is that, however careful we are and however much we nit-pick in regard to certain provisions, people will discover whether they are covered by the legislation only when it is implemented. As we have plenty of time left to consider the provisions, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-52_spnew3"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose </B>   moved Amendment No. 50:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 20, leave out lines 10 to 14.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-52_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30401-52_para6"></a>The noble Duke said: This is another probing amendment. It perhaps also demonstrates again a slight inability on my part to make practical sense of some of the wording&#151;which may be plain to other noble Lords. It seems to me that when the environment authority issues a licence, it will also be issuing a right. The mention of a "protected right" seems to bring into play the possibility of two classes of right. Some who have a licence may find themselves without a right if it becomes necessary to empower only those with a protected right.
<P>

<a name="30401-52_para7"></a>I am puzzled by one other matter. Why does this clause talk of only exactly 20 cubic metres? How many licensees extract exactly 20 cubic metres, as is suggested by the wording in the provision? Why should they be more entitled to a protected right than is someone extracting, say, 21 cubic metres?
<P>

<a name="30401-52_para8"></a>What does new Section 39A mean? Under Section 27A, the Secretary of State has power to vary the small quantity threshold. Is the effect of new Section 39A to ensure that he cannot reduce it? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-52_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I think that we have already touched on this issue as well. The issue of protected rights relates to those who are protected prior to the previous legislation. We do not want to interfere with that. Nor are we attempting to create new protected rights under this legislation. The approach taken in the Bill is therefore to keep the protected rights as they were under the earlier legislation.
<P>

<a name="30401-52_para9"></a>The implication of Amendment No. 50 is that there would be more protected rights if the threshold were increased and, despite previous legislative protection, fewer rights if the threshold were decreased. That does not deal with what is effectively only a residual problem, albeit a significant one, concerning those who had rights prior to 1991, whose rights will continue to be protected under this legislation. Anything that alters that would unravel the previous protection. It would threaten that protection or suggest that there are additional protected rights which are not an extension.
<P>

<a name="30401-52_para10"></a>I therefore believe that the amendment is misconceived. It would not help those who currently have protected rights or provide clarity on the future licensing system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-52_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   What about 19 cubic metres or 19.5 cubic metres? The provision seems to deal with exactly 20 cubic metres&#151;or am I being completely stupid about this?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-52_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The abstractors are able to take no more than 20 cubic metres without a licence. Their protected rights in the previous legislation are therefore limited to that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-52_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   The provision refers to abstractions,
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-52_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   To which wording is the noble Baroness referring?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-52_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   Lines 11 and 12 on page 20 refer to a,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"series of abstractions amounting in aggregate to 20 cubic metres".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-52_para12"></a>
Do they always have to hit the total of 20 cubic metres?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-52_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   No. There is a protected right to an abstraction,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"amounting in aggregate to twenty cubic metres".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-52_para13"></a>
In other words, if you exceed an aggregate of 20 cubic metres, you would lose the right. If you are below that, then you are still within the protected right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-52_spnew11"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I thank the Minister. I think that it would be much clearer if the Bill stated that the amount was up to 20 cubic metres.

<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-52_para15"></a><P>

<a name="30401-52_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 51 I shall also speak to Amendment No. 64. Although the two amendments affect different parts of the Bill, both deal with the proposal to reduce the time limit from seven years to four years. There are many concerns about the effect of the time limit, one of which is to do with agriculture. The Minister will know well that the Government are encouraging farming to make a come-back and perhaps to develop in a more sustainable fashion. One of the ways of achieving that is to ensure a longer rotation of crops. As many noble Lords will know, infection can recur from one crop to another. Longer rotation periods and greater crop diversity can decrease re-infection.
<P>

<a name="30401-52_para17"></a>A reduction in the time allowed for non-use would affect unsupported sectors in agriculture that habitually do not use an irrigation licence for a seven-year period, for example, in order to meet crop protection standards. If the Bill implemented the reduction in the time period, many businesses would find it no longer commercially viable to continue to produce an irrigated crop. It would not be possible to reduce a crop rotation to only four years because of the risk of crop diseases such as potato cyst nematode and because of the requirements in assured produce contracts and with customers such as producers or supermarkets. At a time when we are trying to encourage and promote UK food production, it would be unfortunate to introduce legislation that disadvantaged such production.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-52_para18"></a>Potato growers in various parts of the country, including Humberside and Lincolnshire, have supplied us with examples of the potential implications for their businesses. The schedules to the Plant Health (Great Britain) Order 1993 provide for the conditions under which the land can be declared free of potato cyst pest. For seed potatoes, DEFRA guidance which must be adhered to prior to certification states that there should be a rotation period of a full seven years.
<P>

<a name="30401-52_para19"></a>Furthermore, the European and Mediterranean plant protection organisations provide a standard that should be used for soil testing for such diseases. That standard confirms that there are cases where land should be left free of that particular crop for at least 10 years to ensure that it is disease free. Additionally, requirements in supermarket contracts with growers stipulate that onions require a six-year rotation period. If memory serves me correctly, the pea industry is subject to a cycle of more than four years. We must take into account both crop rotation and climate change.
<P>

<a name="30401-52_para20"></a>I have a few questions for the Minister. Why has four years been chosen rather than seven? Why not five or six? Will this change be made by other EU countries? Have they implemented it? Why are they doing it? If they are not doing it, have the Government considered asking for a derogation for agriculture and horticulture? If not, why not? My comments directly apply also to Amendment No. 66, which will be considered later.
<P>

<a name="30401-52_para21"></a>It is hugely important that the Government explain the reason for the proposed change. I look forward to the Minister's reply. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-52_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I strongly support the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, in this amendment. It is very important that her comments on rotation and disease are taken fully into account. As she said, there is a big difference between four years and seven years in sound rotation practice. Who has DEFRA consulted in deciding the reduction? Has it consulted the organisation LEAF, which has a function in this respect, or others who can offer sound advice? They might think that four years is too short a period for sound crop rotation and good quality production.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-53_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   Perhaps I can offer some examples which might cast light on why the reduction from seven to four years is sensible. I very much take account of the needs of the agriculture industry, in particular the horticulture industry, pointed out by noble Lords. I am sure that there is no intention to get in the way of legitimate agricultural rotation, which would simply be nonsensical. However, there are other water users who apply for licences but subsequently do not use them. They may, for example, be new entrants to the water market, particularly as water competition increases. They may even be speculative water users who set off in the direction of creating a business enterprise but then discover that they cannot quite pull it off. Although they may not need their water licence at that point, <P>


<a name="column_GC143"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column GC143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they may, under the provision of seven-year licences, hang on to it and thereby deny other water users the ability to get at that water supply.
<P>

<a name="30401-53_para0"></a>The catchment abstraction management process reviews all users or abstractors around a catchment area on a six-year basis. If a seven-year licence were unused for seven years, then the whole period of the catchment abstraction management plan would be working under the assumption that the licence could be used but that, effectively, water would be denied to the process of review when it could be reallocated to a user who was in need of the licence and the abstraction right.
<P>

<a name="30401-53_para1"></a>I hope that noble Lords can be persuaded that this provision is not intended to hit the agriculture industry. Indeed, it is intended to ensure that water is available for other users, some of whom will be farmers, at the time that they need it rather than being frozen in licences which are simply speculative and unused.

<A NAME="30401-53_spnew1"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   It may help the Committee as much as it would help me if we could be told exactly what is meant by the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"does not carry out any such abstraction as would have been authorised".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30401-53_para2"></a>
Let us suppose that someone had been authorised to use a large volume of water. If for a period of four years he used only 50 per cent of that water, would that be considered as not using what had been authorised? Perhaps he had used only 5 per cent of the water. Would that count as not being authorised? It seems possible to me that if an agricultural enterprise felt that it would lose its licence, it could turn on the pump for a day and pump the 20 cubic metres, or whatever amount had been authorised. Would that then mean that it had used its licence within the four-year period? What will trigger whether the licence has been used?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-53_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   This part of the Bill deals with protected rights. It does not deal with other issues which may appear to be similar, such as sleeper licences or the reduction of the period over which compensation would be paid. As I tried to explain previously, protected rights have come about as a result of trying to protect people's positions under previous legislation.
<P>

<a name="30401-53_para3"></a>The non-use of those rights could, in certain circumstances, deny other legitimate abstractors access to the water. Therefore, the intention of this part of the Bill is that, if the protected rights are not used over an extended period, the granting of a licence to someone who needs the water should not be obstructed.
<P>

<a name="30401-53_para4"></a>The fact that the protected right has gone does not necessarily mean that the abstraction is not lawful. Therefore, I believe that we are considering the wrong target here. Protected rights, which are grandfather rights, are a legitimate part of the system but they are not the key issue concerning how abstraction licences will work.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30401-53_para5"></a>If failure to use protected rights over a period of time prevents the Environment Agency considering the possibility of a neighbouring farm or a neighbouring business having access to that water, then there must be a cut-off period. In our judgment, the previous seven-year period was too long and we can reduce that to four years. But the provision will not affect people who are already using their abstraction licences and doing so on a rotational basis.
<P>

<a name="30401-53_para6"></a>Some of those issues arise later in the Bill, as the noble Baroness said, but here we are talking about protected rights. I hope that that attempt at clarification will mean that we do not pursue this dimension of the argument, although we shall return to some of the points later.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-53_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister. Obviously he will not be surprised if I say that I am not satisfied. I understand what he is saying, but I believe that he of all people, because he is the Minister responsible for food and farming, knows very well the tremendous pressure that the farming community is under at present.
<P>

<a name="30401-53_para7"></a>I believe that we shall be seeking changes. At present, some of those changes relate to matters that the farming community does not have control over. As the Minister knows, we are waiting for the CAP reform to come into fruition this summer. We are also waiting for the WTO talks to take place and are awaiting the outcome of the review of the way that DEFRA works by the noble Lord, Lord Haskins. We are also awaiting the report of the Curry commission. The fact that all those things are coming together at the same time is bringing huge uncertainty to an industry that has been struggling enormously over the past few years.
<P>

<a name="30401-53_para8"></a>One thing clearly recommended by Curry, and which the Government are encouraging, is that the agriculture industry should consider ways of using land other than for food production. It is being encouraged, for example, to consider the possibility of non-food energy crops. I know that this Government have at last&#151;that seems ungracious; I do not mean it in that way&#151;accepted that such crops can play an important role.
<P>

<a name="30401-53_para9"></a>Therefore, if we are to move away from a system that has been in place for many years to a new system which is still unknown, I believe that it would be even more unfortunate if, at this stage, the Government withdrew the seven-year protected right and put in its place a four-year protected right. I am sure that the noble Lord understands my argument, even though he probably cannot agree to it. I accept that. However, I believe that there are very good reasons why, at present, these proposals are unfortunate at the least and, at the most, unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="30401-53_para10"></a>At this stage, I shall withdraw the amendment. I suspect that it is a matter to which we shall return because of the very uncertain current situation in which the industry finds itself. It is aware of the difficulties that it faces. I would hate to think that some of the new ideas and new possibilities that may come up over the next year or 18 months would be closed to <P>

But it is not at all clear how that will work, apart from the fact that the Government say that the register will be available for inspection by members of the public. Can the Minister tell us how people will know that the register exists if they are not already on it? How will new entrants know about its existence?
<P>

<a name="30401-53_para17"></a>I believe that if competition for abstraction rights is likely to increase, it will be very important for people to decide at what volume they should enter the register. Will a person apply for an abstraction licence with a usage of more than 20 cubic metres or will he apply for it with a usage of less than 20 cubic metres? People will not only need to know, and see, who else is on the register; they will also need to know of its very existence. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-53_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   First, clearly the Environment Agency will start the system with a record of former licence holders who now no longer need a licence because the threshold has fallen. Secondly, I draw the noble Baroness's attention to Schedule 6, which provides a procedure for the setting up of the register. That will require us to bring in an order, which we propose to do, to establish a register and for the register to be advertised in the local press. That mechanism will be required of the agency and will provide access both to those who should be on the register and to those who are seeking to find out what rights already exist. Therefore, I believe that that point is already covered in the procedures in the schedule.

I asked him what other countries might be using this initiative and whether they had considered seeking any derogation for horticulture. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-54_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   Over the past 15 minutes or so we have been given some documents from the Environment Agency about the time-limiting of licences. They specifically state that the normal renewal period for time-limited licences is 12 years. For each catchment area in England and Wales there are published dates when the time-limited licence will come into effect. The documents also state that, in exceptional circumstances, a time limit for a period longer than 12 years will be considered.
<P>

<a name="30401-54_para0"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, said that there was no reference to a period of 12 years and that there was no time limit. I simply want to place on the record that this information comes from the Environment Agency for circulation and is headed:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Time limiting of licences: Guidance for stakeholders&#151;draft for Water Bill".

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="30401-54_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I do not know where the disturbing comment made by the noble Baroness comes from. She is privileged in a way that I am not. The information may have been sent to some Members of the Committee but it was not sent to me. Therefore, I am puzzled by those remarks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-54_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   Perhaps I may help the noble Lord. It is a document published by the Environment Agency entitled, Time limiting of licences: Guidance for stakeholders. It is in the public domain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-54_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   That concerns a matter to which we referred earlier. I am not sure what the point is, but we said that the Environment Agency had indicated that the period of 12 years relating to two review periods would seem to be the most appropriate, as my noble friend Lady Farrington said. That piece of paper, which I have not seen&#151;I am sure that I have seen it at some point but I do not have it before me today&#151;reflects the Environment Agency's view that, in reference to the Water Framework Directive, the double six-year period would lead one to conclude that the normal period would be 12 years.
<P>

<a name="30401-54_para1"></a>However, first, that is not on the face of the Bill, and we are not proposing to put it on the face of the Bill because we require flexibility. Secondly, even the extract which the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, read out indicates that there is flexibility in that 12-year period, as my noble friend said. I believe that we are two clauses away from considering the subject of time limits again, but at present I am not clear whether we shall reach it tonight. However, I am not sure that that alters what my noble friend said to the Committee at an earlier stage.

<P>
<A NAME="30401-54_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I was left with the distinct impression that there was no 12-year time limit. Perhaps I am the only one in this Committee who has been left with that impression.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-54_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   I wonder whether I could add just a threepenny bit to the question. I have not seen the interesting document referred to, but I was interested in my noble friend's comments on flexibility, which may mean an extended period. That throws a certain doubt into my mind, and I suspect that my amendment, Amendment No. 54A, is beginning to look a little otiose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-54_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My noble friend is rarely, if ever, otiose.
<P>

<a name="30401-54_para2"></a>The record should show that my noble friend Lady Farrington referred to the double six-year period as being the norm proposed by the Environment Agency, but that there was flexibility. In any case, nowhere in the Bill does it refer to a specific time limit, and we are not intending so to amend the Bill or to agree to amendments that agree to that directly or indirectly. We spoke on that matter several times.
<P>

<a name="30401-54_para3"></a>Amendment No. 53 deals with the duration of the licence on a case-by-case basis. The minimum criteria required by that amendment and by Amendment No. 54 would achieve what we are not intending to do, which is to place a fixed period in the Bill.

<a name="30401-54_para4"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, asked about derogations in other countries. I cannot tell her about them in detail, but I am not aware of any derogation as sweeping as the exclusion of the whole of agriculture or horticulture. I would be surprised if any member state was intending to transpose any part of European legislation in that respect. However, that deals with matters beyond the issue of the Water Framework Directive, while not dealing with all the issues covered by it. A direct analogue with what other countries are doing is not necessarily the best guide, but I am not aware of any such derogation. If I am wrong, I shall write to the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401-54_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister. In his last few words, he has shown again how difficult it is to deal with a Bill that deals with another Act, which in turn dealt with several other Acts. However, time is up, as they say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What were the main results of the recent Small Arms Conference, jointly sponsored by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development and Ministry of Defence; and why there was no agreed communique. [HL2196]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister for Trade   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  I refer the noble Lord to the Answer I gave my noble friend Lady Golding on 20 January (WA 74).
<P>

<a name="30401w01_para0"></a>A few states attending the conference could not agree the proposed consensus communique, despite a clear majority in favour of the recommendations and great efforts by the chair to find common ground. Therefore, the chairman, having consulted the participants, decided to issue a chairman's summary that outlined the key findings of the conference.
<P>

<a name="30401w01_para1"></a>Her Majesty's Government are keen to build on the notable gains and momentum of the conference. In addition to a follow-up meeting, under UK auspices, to exchange information in the margins of the UN biennial meeting in July, we are also supportive of other efforts in this field, such as the Dutch-Norwegian conference on brokering in Oslo in April. Over the next few years, the UK aims to forge partnerships across regions, promoting common understanding and widening and building support for the UN process in this important area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w01_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will agree with the British representatives to the European convention that (a) the new treaty should enhance the powers of the committee of the regions and give stronger recognition to the regional and local dimensions of Europe; and (b) the new treaty should contain positive and negative mechanisms enabling national parliaments to uphold subsidiarity. [HL2198]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   The Government agree on both counts. We submitted a paper to the convention on Europe and the Regions which proposed a number of ideas for strengthening the role and recognition of regions and localities. The paper also identified the need to make the Committee of the Regions more effective. We have also pressed for a strong and credible mechanism to enable national parliaments to monitor and enforce compliance of EU legislative proposals with the principle of subsidiarity.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   The work of the Committee of the Regions and the European Parliament on the future role of regions in the EU are important contributions to this debate. The Government's position on the matter is set out in the paper we submitted to the Future of Europe Convention on Europe and the Regions. This is available on the convention's website at http://european-convention.eu.int.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w01_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   The Future of Europe Convention's Working Group on Subsidiarity recommended that the Committee of the Regions be given the right to bring, ex post, actions before the European Court of Justice for violation of the principle of subsidiarity as regards legislative acts on which it was consulted. The Government's thinking on this matter is set out in our paper on Europe and the Regions, which was prepared in consultation with the devolved administrations. The paper was submitted to the convention and is available on its website (http://european-convention.eu.int).
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w01_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they consider that membership of the Committee of the Regions should be reviewed; and, if so, what improvements they would suggest. [HL2224]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   The Committee of the Regions has itself expressed the desire better to reflect the diversity of local and regional governance by ensuring a better balance of regional and local representation in the composition of national delegations.
<P>

<a name="30401w01_para2"></a>The Government acknowledged this in our paper on Europe and the Regions which we submitted to the Future of Europe Convention. There, we set out our belief that the Committee of the Regions would function more effectively if regional and local authorities selected their delegations at a senior political level.

As a state party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the US would have its own laws and procedures to enable breaches of the conventions to be prosecuted there.

<P>

<a name="30401w01_para3"></a>Previous administrations have not considered it appropriate to publish information on individual licensing decisions.

<P>
Further to the Written Answer by Lord Sainsbury of Turville on 11 March (WA 179), which statement of minimum data transfer speed should be relied on as their definition of broadband, 384 kbit/s (WA 115, 19 November 2001), 512 kbit/s (WA 77, 4 November 2002), or no specified minimum (HL1851).[HL2125]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The Answer given on 19 November 2001 (WA115) referred to the initial assessment of a minimum data transfer speed to define higher bandwidth technologies, as made in UK Online: the broadband future, published in February 2001. Since then, we have taken advice from the broadband stakeholder group which defines broadband as "always on access, at work, at home or on the move provided by a range of fixed line, wireless and satellite technologies to progressively higher bandwidths capable of supporting genuinely new and innovative content, applications and services and the delivery of enhanced public services". [BSG Second Annual Report and Strategic Recommendations, November 2002].

<A NAME="30401w02_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Bach): </B>  The Ministry of Defence's vaccines interactions research programme is studying whether the combination of vaccines and nerve agent pre-treatment (NAPS) tablets used to protect United Kingdom personnel during the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict can give rise to adverse health effects. The study involves four groups of 12 marmosets. One group was given the full range of vaccines which could have been administered during the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict (anthrax, plague, pertussis, yellow fever, cholera, tetanus, polio, hepatitis B, typhoid and meningitis); one was given pyridostigmine bromide, which is the active ingredient of NAPS; one was given both vaccines and pyridostigmine bromide, and the last was the control group, which received neither. The marmosets are being monitored over a period of 18 months and a number of indices, such as cognitive performance, EEG, sleep, endocrine functioning and immune responsiveness, are measured at regular intervals.
<P>

<a name="30401w02_para6"></a>Preliminary results from the first three months of the study are now available and are being presented by means of scientific poster at the British Toxicological Society's annual conference at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh. These preliminary results provide data on behaviour, sleep, EEG, body weight, cholinesterase inhibition and muscle function and indicate no apparent adverse health consequences three months following the administration of vaccine and/or pyridostigmine bromide. We have placed copies of the abstract and poster in the Library of the House. They will also be available on the Ministry of Defence's website.

<A NAME="30401w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bach:  </B>  A new call-out order has been made under section 56 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 to allow reservists to continue to be called out into permanent service to support operations in the former Yugoslavia. This replaces the existing order that expired on 31 March. The new order is effective until 31 March 2004.
<P>

<a name="30401w02_para9"></a>Since 1995 when NATO operations commenced in the former Yugoslavia, the reserve forces have historically provided around 10 per cent of the total UK manpower in theatre. At present, there are around 230 reservists from all three services serving in Bosnia and Kosovo. They are providing specialist skills in fields such as logistics, signals and medical support.
<P>

<a name="30401w02_para10"></a>I am also announcing two compulsory mobilisations under the new order. One is an extension of the existing deployment of small numbers of specialist medical personnel (anaesthetists and surgeons) to provide critical support to our forces in theatre. Since April 2002, we have called out 17 personnel to serve three-month tours. This will continue for another 12 months. We anticipate a requirement for around six personnel at any one time. Given the small numbers involved and our intention to spread the burden across the NHS, we are confident that the impact on patients in the UK will be minimal.
<P>

<a name="30401w02_para11"></a>The second compulsory mobilisation will be of further specialist medical and logistics personnel from the Territorial Army. They will provide general practice, ambulance, and postal and courier capabilities in theatre. In total, we will call out 150 personnel from 251 and 253 Field Ambulance (Volunteers) and up to 20 personnel from 87 and 88 Regiments Postal and Courier Services. Personnel will serve for up to seven months, with the first deployments in June.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bach:  </B>  Defence Estates (DE) is being relaunched today as an agency of the Ministry of Defence with new responsibilities. This follows consideration, within Project Alexander, of how the defence estate should best be managed as a corporate asset. In particular, the new arrangements will clarify customer/supplier relationships.
<P>

<a name="30401w02_para12"></a>The changes are in line with the overarching and comprehensive strategy for the defence estate set out in In Trust and On Trust in June 2000 and also represent a further application of the principles of Smart acquisition within the department.

<P>
<A NAME="30401w03_wqn0"></A><B> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>Whether there are plans to replace the exceptional leave system.[HL2367]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Filkin): </B>  On 7 October 2002 my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced the ending of the routine granting of exceptional leave on a country basis and a review of its use and scope to focus it on those who really need special humanitarian protection but do not qualify as refugees.
<P>

<a name="30401w03_para0"></a>In the past, exceptional leave has been used far too widely. It was only ever intended to be granted to those able to demonstrate compelling compassionate or humanitarian reasons for staying in the United <P>


<a name="column_WA121"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column WA121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Kingdom. Instead, the widespread use of exceptional leave has acted as a pull factor, encouraging economic migrants to apply for asylum in the United Kingdom in the belief that they will be given exceptional leave when their claim is rejected.
<P>

<a name="30401w03_para1"></a>That is why we have decided to replace the exceptional leave system with a new humanitarian protection system. From now on the UK will only offer international protection to those who really need it.
<P>

<a name="30401w03_para2"></a>From today humanitarian protection will be granted only to those who, though not refugees would, if removed, face in the country of return a serious risk to life or person arising from the death penalty, unlawful killing or torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
<P>

<a name="30401w03_para3"></a>Under the new system those who qualify for humanitarian protection will be granted leave for three years, at which point a person with a continuing need for protection will be eligible to apply for settlement in the United Kingdom. A person with no continuing need will not get any further leave.
<P>

<a name="30401w03_para4"></a>The Secretary of State will also retain the discretion to grant limited leave to those who do not qualify for humanitarian protection or leave under the Immigration Rules. The circumstances in which discretionary leave will be granted will be defined and tightly focused. This leave will normally be granted for two periods of three years, but there is scope to grant shorter periods depending on the individual circumstances. Again, it will not be renewed unless a person continues to qualify for such leave.

<P>

<a name="30401w03_para5"></a>Both the humanitarian protection and discretionary leave systems will be far more focused and clearly defined than the exceptional leave system. Failed asylum seekers who do not fall into one of these categories will not be granted any leave and will be removed. We are determined that the asylum system will no longer be a short-cut to work or settlement in the UK. I believe that these measures, when taken alongside the provisions in the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, will take us even further forward in our efforts to reduce the number of unfounded asylum applicants seeking to abuse our immigration system.

<P>
Why, when there is transfusion plasma currently available in the United Kingdom which is licensed in the United Kingdom and sourced in the United States, the National Blood Service is still unable to implement its recommendation to provide the majority of patients born after 1 January 1996 with United States-sourced, virally inactivated fresh frozen plasma.[HL2134]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   To date, there is no evidence worldwide that variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (vCJD) has ever been transmitted through blood. As a precautionary measure, all fresh frozen plasma (FFP) produced by the United Kingdom blood service uses single unit plasma from UK blood donors which has been leucodepleted to remove the white cells which <P>


<a name="column_WA124"></a>

<B>1 Apr 2003 : Column WA124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>evidence suggests may carry the greatest risk of transmitting vCJD. Although most UK FFP is not virally inactivated, high levels of safety are achieved by using single unit, as opposed to pooled plasma, by screening out potential high risk donors and by testing every unit of donated blood for the presence of infections such as HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C before it is released to hospitals.
<P>

<a name="30401w03_para8"></a>The decision taken to import FFP from the United States for young babies and children born after 1 January 1996 will provide additional protection to the most vulnerable group who will not have been exposed to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy through the food chain. The National Blood Service is currently involved in negotiating for supplies of FFP for this group of patients and plans to have it available later this year. A commercially produced FFP product, sourced from the United States, is also available for the National Health Service to purchase.

The guidance made a number of recommendations intended to achieve the most clinically and cost-effectiveness use of PPIs. NICE estimated that its advice, if fully implemented, could lead to a reduction in the use of PPIs. Such a reduction has not yet occurred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30401w04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   We are today publishing Making Change Happen, the Government's annual report on learning disability services. The report describes progress made in implementing the programme of action set out in the White Paper Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century (Cm 5086) and contains a response to Making Things Happen, the first annual report of the Learning Disability Task Force, published in January this year.
<P>

<a name="30401w04_para0"></a>People with learning disabilities are among the most socially excluded and vulnerable groups in society. In March 2001 we published Valuing People, which set out an ambitious and challenging cross-government programme to improve the services they use. Over the last year we have been able to report good progress with the Valuing People programme and are now pleased to be able to report that progress is continuing. Since Valuing People was published: more advocacy groups are receiving funding and councils are spending more on advocacy; more people with learning disabilities are receiving direct payments; more people with learning disabilities are in employment; more families with severely disabled children are receiving family support; the National Forum of People with Learning Difficulties has been set up to give people with learning disabilities a national voice. The forum has members on the Learning Disability Task Force, which is itself co-chaired by someone with a learning disability.
<P>

<a name="30401w04_para1"></a>Today's report describes the setting up of the basic framework for the implementation programme&#151;the Valuing People support team, learning disability partnership boards, the National Forum of People with Learning Disabilities and the Learning Disability Task Force. We are now building on that framework.
<P>

<a name="30401w04_para2"></a>Earlier this year we were pleased to welcome the task force's first annual report. The report we are publishing today includes a response to the task force and confirms our readiness to work with it as it continues to monitor the implementation of the whole Valuing People programme.

<a name="30401w04_para3"></a>Today's report is written in an accessible form, using pictures and straightforward, jargon-free language. It is important that people with learning disabilities can see for themselves what is being done to improve the services they use.
<P>

<a name="30401w04_para4"></a>The Valuing People Support Team has made an excellent start in developing links with learning disability partnership boards and supporting them as they implement the White Paper's proposals at local council level. We can confirm that the support team will continue its work until 2006. We can also confirm the continuation of the Implementation Support Fund and the Learning Disability Development Fund.

<a name="30401w04_para5"></a>Valuing People said that it would take a minimum of five years for its programme to be implemented. We have made good progress towards that target in the two years since its publication.

<A NAME="30401w04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Andrews:  </B>  We are publishing today the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency's annual business plan. Copies have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30401w04_para6"></a>The business plan highlights the agency's achievements in 2002&#150;03 and sets out the key tasks and targets for the coming year.
<P>

<a name="30401w04_para7"></a>This comprehensive plan has been formulated within the context of the agency's ongoing remit to lead the modernisation of the NHS purchasing and supply function. The agency has a strategic role to set out a major development agenda for purchasing and supply in the NHS and to develop a co-ordinated implementation plan for doing so. The business plan sets out clearly how the agency will achieve these aims.

<a name="30401w04_para8"></a>Letter from Nick Matheson, Chief Executive of the Government Car and Despatch Agency, dated 1 April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30401w04_para9"></a>The right honourable Lord Macdonald of Tradeston, Minister for the Cabinet Office, has asked me in my capacity as the chief executive responsible for the Government Car and Despatch Agency to reply to your Parliamentary Question about the number of Cabinet Office vehicles converted to use both petrol and liquid petroleum gas (LPG); the cost of these conversions; the amount of each type of fuel used; and the average cost per mile of the fuel used by each vehicle before and after conversion.
<P>

<a name="30401w04_para10"></a>There are three vehicles provided to Cabinet Office, a car and two light vans, that run on both petrol and LPG. The car came into service in 2000 and the vans in June 2002. These vehicles were purchased already converted by the manufacturer to run on dual fuel so there were no after-purchase conversion costs incurred by this agency. A before and after comparison of running costs would be unhelpful and misleading because the vehicles did not replace similar models.
<P>

<a name="30401w04_para11"></a>All dual fuel vehicles switch automatically between petrol and LPG during their use as determined by their fuel management systems. It is impossible therefore to say with any accuracy what consumption against each type of fuel is. However since February 2002 I have spent &#163;2,461 on petrol and &#163;2,105 on LPG. There are <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>two reasons for the apparently high petrol costs. Firstly, the two LPG vans were introduced in the summer of 2002 and had to run on petrol only for the first 3,000 miles for technical reasons and secondly, a litre of petrol costs roughly twice as much as a litre of LPG at the pump.
<P>

<a name="30401w04_para12"></a>I am constantly looking at ways to lessen the impact of our operations on the environment. In addition to the three vehicles mentioned above I also provide two electric-powered light vans and a hybrid petrol/electric car to the Cabinet Office. All our electric and duel fuel light vans are registered with the City of Westminster's environmentally friendly vehicle scheme. This agency also participates in the THINK @bout London electric car project. This vehicle also operates from the Cabinet Office.
