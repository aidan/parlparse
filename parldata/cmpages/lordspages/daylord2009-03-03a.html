The detailed individual inspections carried out by HMCIP provide valuable insight into a range of key operational issues. The issues set out in the report have all previously been raised as a result of individual prison inspections. Each inspection report results in a detailed action plan with progress monitored by NOMS senior managers.</p>

Is he aware of one of the chief inspector&#146;s conclusions based on an analysis of 52 inspections; namely, that small prisons perform better than large ones and, in particular, that they are safer? The report says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030336000290"></a>&#147;large prisons are more likely to be unsafe, and to need to rely more on force&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030336000227"></a>What influence will this evidence have on the Government&#146;s plans to build three Titan prisons, each holding 2,500 prisoners?</p>

We are currently in discussion with it about this report, but we are not yet in a position to comment on the methodology and the results. With regard to Titans, clusters or large prisons, we will publish the Government&#146;s response to the consultation shortly. The response will set out at high level our thinking on large prisons and we will be looking to continue to talk with those interested about how these prisons can be developed to support improved outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="09030336000005"></a>With the caution that the inspector inspected only 52 of the 139 prisons, the noble Baroness will remember that in her opening comments the chief inspector said that the number of self-inflicted deaths has decreased this year from the extremely high level of last year. Among other points, she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="09030336000241"></a>&#147;This year, more than 70% of our assessments, against our four tests of safety, respect, purposeful activity and resettlement, were positive&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030336000228"></a>In other words, the prison was performing at least reasonably well in that area. We take some comfort from that part of the report.</p>

Does he remember the words used by Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons in her report when she said that there is &#147;little room for complacency&#148;? Will the Minister comment on the fact that some 80 of the 139 prisons in England and Wales are seriously overcrowded? What will the Government do about that?</p>

Too many prisons are currently overcrowded and that is why there is a prison-building programme and why we are consulting on ideas about large prisons. I think it is fair to ask the noble Lord sitting opposite exactly what his party&#151;</p>

The chief inspector puts this down to a lack of cultural awareness in prisons which are a considerable distance from prisoners&#146; homes. To buttress what the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, said, the chief inspector finds that in local prisons which are nearer to where prisoners live, the trend is reversed, with the percentage of prisoners expressing concern dropping from 59 to 21. Therefore, does the Minister agree that more local, smaller prisons are the only answer when looking across the range of prisoners, irrespective of their sentences?</p>

However, in her introduction to the report, she says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="09030336000242"></a>&#147;Though there is still much to be done ... our prisons are, in general, undoubtedly better-run, more effective and more humane places than they used to be&#148;.</p>

Will he give this matter his urgent attention, particularly in the context of assistance in relation to mental health and detoxification, and especially in relation to women under 21?</p>

Indeed, to be fair, the inspector refers to them in her report and the initial legislation in particular. Additional funding was provided for the implementation of offender management in prisons in 2007-08, particularly in relation to indeterminate sentence prisoners, and a further &#163;3 million was made available last year and the year before. However, I am conscious that there are difficulties concerning these prisoners, and that is one reason why we changed the law in relation to them last year.</p>

A great deal more is being provided at local and regional levels, and we are satisfied that, if the investment is co-ordinated efficiently, it is sufficient.

How can they do that without granting additional funding, without a national marketing campaign and without additional promotion of tourism in the run-up to the Games? Is it any wonder that the chairman of the Tourism Alliance has described the decision not to grant any special funding in the run-up to the Olympics as short-sighted and damaging?</p>

Our view is clear: after due consideration of the request for additional funds for marketing we believe that they are, first, not available and, secondly, in our judgment, not required at this stage. We have made significant investment in many other areas of the tourist industry, whether in training or in our commitment to bringing new signature events, major sporting events and global events, as well as commissioning the strategic review of the industry. We have said that for the period of this Comprehensive Spending Review, the budget for marketing is as it is. We believe that more value could be extracted from the budgets that are available, and we will revisit the question in the next review period.</p>

I am not sure that I would go as far as to use the greed word, but none the less, our view is the same as his. There has been significant investment. Frankly, this is a rather arcane debate about marketing budgets and other investment. The scale of investment in this area has been significant.</p>

As the noble Lord will know, we are pitching for an unprecedented decade of sport, including golf and the Rugby World Cup&#151;four world cups, in fact. I take his point that there is a significant part of the market for whom sport is not necessarily the most attractive reason for visiting this country. The programme for promoting tourism is not dependent on the investment in sport, but that does not undermine the fact that the Olympics are an enormous opportunity to promote this country more broadly, beyond the sporting activities associated with the Games.</p>

This goes back to the question of how narrow an attraction sport is. The Olympics are an opportunity to bring a wide community of people into the process of welcoming visitors to this country. The Sydney Games were a shining example of how to do it well, and they were exploited by Australia as an overall marketing event as well as a hugely successful global sporting event.

It is all done on a voluntary basis and, in England, depends entirely on donations. It seems ridiculous that the service, which, if the Government had to step in and replace it, might cost &#163;6 million a year, is subject to VAT on its equipment and most of its spending, when the equivalent service, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, is not. Discussions have taken place recently between national representatives of mountain rescue, assisted by my honourable friend Tim Farron, Member of Parliament for the Lake District.

I assure him that it is not. We cannot expect a ready change to VAT. We do the best that we can with VAT reliefs for certain aspects of mountain rescue equipment, as I have indicated. I agree entirely with the noble Lord that the rescue service is greatly valued wherever it operates in the United Kingdom. I had personal experience of the Oldham service in the Pennines.

In England the issue is devolved to the local authorities and their partnerships with local mountain rescue arrangements, where they have them. Of course there is a degree of public support. This country is different from the rest of Europe and, if people wonder why the rest of Europe does not give the respect that it might to mountain rescue, I should say that the countries that have responsibilities in the Alps all operate state-owned schemes, not the voluntary arrangements that we have in the United Kingdom.</p>

The Minister in the other place met a delegation the other day and we are looking at the matter to consider ways in which we can give support. I am reflecting the perspective of the Treasury that the representations relating to relief on VAT are not realisable. Therefore, we are looking at other areas of support. There is no question but that we recognise the value of the mountain rescue teams and the fact that the country gets a great deal of this support through voluntary effort. But that is also true of the lifeboats, which are also a voluntary organisation.</p>

I emphasise again that the representations that suggest, for instance, that the equipment used for mountain rescue should be free of VAT raise significant issues, both in relation to Europe and the provisions on VAT and in relation to the fact that the kind of equipment that mountain rescue teams use&#151;for instance, four-wheel drive vehicles&#151;are also used by other members of the community, which means that giving special relief to mountain rescue teams would be quite difficult.</p>

First, the institution predates the development of the European Community by more than 100 years and we therefore were able to negotiate particular VAT reliefs for the RNLI at the inauguration of our membership. Secondly, the European Community has a strong interest in lifeboats and sea safety because it exports a great deal of goods by sea. It makes its own arrangements with regard to those countries that have mountains.</p>

We have had a comprehensive discussion in previous debates about the need to inform local authorities about licence applications, particularly those that might impact on their areas of responsibility. These amendments are similar and have been suggested by Network Rail. They highlight the concern that other bodies, not just local authorities but public bodies and stakeholders&#146; private bodies, might also benefit from that information. As the Bill is drafted, they might find themselves excluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09030336000058"></a>If we use Network Rail as an example, many licences relate to matters that might impact on the use of existing rail infrastructure. The early indication of likely licences would allow the transport infrastructure providers to anticipate and prepare for any likely increase or decrease in traffic on the infrastructure. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me that licence authorities will keep the lines of communication open, not only between public bodies but also with interested parties in the private sector.

His amendment would introduce a requirement on the licensing authority to consult transport infrastructure providers that may be affected by a marine licence application He mentioned Network Rail in particular. We have already talked in previous debates about statutory consultees and I have given our reasons for not wanting to have a list. However, he raises a very interesting and important point and I hope to give him the reassurance he requires. I certainly accept that the nature of geological, coastal and estuarine issues and marine processes mean that works at one location on the coastline can have long-term effects many miles away. It is clearly important that the owners of rail infrastructure are consulted on applications that might not be in the immediate vicinity, but I can assure noble Lords that this is something that we envisage licensing authorities doing on a regular basis and I want to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that we will make that clear through guidance, because he has raised an important point.</p>

I thought that we had touched on it so extensively in previous sessions in Committee that it did not need me to go into great detail. Amendment A10 is really trying to establish that those elected bodies that have a legitimate and proper concern in this area should not be excluded from the licensing process under this part of the Bill. I hope, therefore, that, before the Minister completes his analysis of this group, he will respond briefly to that point. It is simply to make sure that local authorities are not excluded. He will be well aware that, throughout the Committee and on all sides of the House, there has been anxiety that local elected bodies, which will be so

The Minister will recall that, on the issue of planning, we discussed the Bristol Channel and he said that we could not resolve it in any other way because it was a devolved matter. Amendment A10 refers to the appropriate inshore fisheries conservation authority. I wonder if the Minister is aware that, in meeting members of the various sea fishing committees who are over in Brussels today, the EU Fisheries Commissioner, Mr Borg, is advocating the extension of the Brittany maritime charter approach to the whole of the Channel area, including fish, and that the Commission is intending parallel work in the Baltic to establish joint policies. Could not the same be relevant to the Bristol Channel area? All it will take is talking to the Welsh devolved authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09030336000064"></a>I am aware that Defra has just put out for consultation the shape that the IFCA areas should take. I believe that three different options are listed on its maps and no doubt all have their merits. But I have to come back to the same point as regards the Bristol Channel: given all the other pressures, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, reasonably to decide where the IFCAs should begin and end, even given that some of the territorial waters fall to Wales and some to England. A joint approach is really the only one, and if the commission is looking at this for other joint areas, could we not lead the way with a pilot between England and Wales?</p>

Obviously, it would be interesting to see the outcome of any discussions in Europe, and I can assure her that I will ask my officials to find out more information. I also take her point about IFCAs and how they should operate in the Bristol Channel, a point that I suspect is also relevant to the current committee relating to north Wales and part of England. She will probably know that the decision of the Welsh Assembly Government clearly indicated that they were going to make different arrangements from those being proposed for England by the UK Government. We are in the process of consulting on a number of options for IFCAs, and I shall certainly make sure that her comments are considered, but of course we do come across the issue of the relationship between the respective responsibilities of the UK Government for England and the Welsh Assembly Government.

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09030336000067"></a>On the wider question of local authority involvement, I fully accept that local authorities have a vital role to play in many of the arrangements related to this Bill, and we see them as very important partners. Under the current legislative regime put in place by the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, the Marine and Fisheries Agency, as a matter of good practice, consults the relevant local authorities on the applications in which they are likely to have an interest. I would point out to noble Lords that Clause 65 places a licensing authority under an obligation to publish a notice of any application in a manner calculated to bring it to the attention of any persons likely to be interested in it and must take regard of the representations it receives. I can confirm that this will naturally include local authorities for development activities that affect their area, while the same reasoning applies to inshore fisheries conservation authorities and many of the other bodies proposed by noble Lords in earlier debates. We stand ready to meet at any time representatives of local authorities through the LGA, particularly to discuss any issues that those local authorities may have because we want to ensure that there is as close co-operation as possible. It is clear that local authorities can have a hugely positive role to play in a lot of the matters we are debating.</p>

The effect on local communities of what happens under the Bill will probably be most keenly felt where operations near the shore involve taking material out and carting it away to somewhere else across the country. The effect of decisions about quarrying is very strongly felt in local authorities. The idea of lorries passing endlessly, day and night, full of dusty material worries people very much. Indeed, anyone who has served on a local authority will know that quarrying is a hot issue so far as planning is concerned. I presume that this material will be wet. It may not be dusty but there may be lorries night and day passing some communities. There will also be an enormous number of trains required to take the material wherever it has to be taken. British Rail is right to worry about them. I wonder whether the noble Lord is right not to think about transport as something that should be in the Bill in order to make sure that it is a major consideration when that kind of activity is going to happen at sea.</p>

The Marine and Fisheries Agency, which is currently responsible for regulation, is not aware of any particular difficulties faced by Network Rail in obtaining licences where needed. I do not believe that there is any disagreement in principle about the need for consulting the appropriate rail

I hope that the Minister will be able to respond: this is the third time that this confusion has occurred. It is mismanagement by the government managers, after the assurances that we have been given, that this should coincide. It is a curious way to secure agreement, at least from these Benches.</p>

<a name="90303-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09030336000076"></a>On Clause 71 and this group of amendments, our concern is that there should be a level playing field between the criteria on which exemptions are discussed, assessed and granted with the original issues of licensing. It is important to have consistency between those two sets of decisions. So the controls and safeguards for exempted activities, with which Clause 71 is primarily concerned, seem extremely important.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_625"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 625</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90303-0003.htm"/>


<a name="90303-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09030336000077"></a>We believe that there should be exemptions; Clause 71 is necessary. However, the way in which it is set out in the Bill is not conducive to good management. We all understand that we want to reduce the regulatory burden&#151;we are all in that business these days&#151;but the Bill does not provide sufficient environmental safeguards, controls or checks in relation to the exemptions; for example, none of the requirements that we have agreed are necessary for determining applications under Clause 66 is included for determining exemptions, hence my concern about the level playing field. There is no requirement for assessing impacts prior to exemption nor description of the types of activity that can qualify for exemption, and no proper concerns are set out in the Bill to ensure that consultation on exempted activities is sufficiently strong; indeed, it is not mandatory at all.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09030336000078"></a>The process for exemptions set out in the Bill is vague and creates possible loopholes for environmentally damaging activities to proceed unchecked. The Minister will recall that the Government&#146;s associated document, <I>Managing our marine resources&#151;</I><I>licensing under the Marine Bill</I>, which we have all considered carefully, states that they will work with stakeholders to identify where low-risk activities can be exempted from marine licensing, but this limitation to, and assessment of, those low-risk activities are simply not in the Bill. We therefore believe&#151;and this is the common concern of many of the outside organisations considering the Bill&#151;that there need to be amendments, hence this group.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09030336000079"></a>It should be mandatory, first, to ensure that any exemptions do not compromise the licensing authority&#146;s purposes in Clause 66; that is, to protect the environment and human health and prevent interference with legitimate uses of the sea. Secondly, carrying out the appropriate environmental assessments under, for example, the strategic environmental assessment process, which assesses the Government&#146;s proposed plan for exemptions in secondary legislation, should be a matter for consultation with stakeholders. The process is referred to in the Government&#146;s response to recommendation 29 of the Joint Committee&#146;s report on the draft Marine Bill under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Greenway. Additionally, how are environmental impact assessments affected by exemptions? Thirdly, we surely need a process of assessments, where appropriate, where an activity is likely to have an impact on a site protected under the birds or habitat directives. Finally, an impact assessment or, indeed, a cost-benefit analysis of each proposal should surely be carried out as stated in paragraph 26 of the impact assessment for this Bill.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09030336000080"></a>It is extremely important that a process for consultation and obtaining advice from experts should be in the Bill as it is for the licensing process as a whole. That, too, seems to be addressed under Clause 71(4). Taking account of the advice of those experts and the representations received for interested parties should be a matter of common practice when making any decision on whether to allow an exemption.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09030336000081"></a>Where such expert advice is not followed, the reasons should be published, and, where an order is granted for an exemption, the licensee must get approval and/or

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09030336000082"></a>We believe that it is critical to monitor and review the exempted activities to ensure that conditions are being met and that unintended environmental damage is not occurring. That will be particularly important in the early years of the new legislation.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09030336000083"></a>In the same group, Amendments 61 and 63 address a slightly different aspect of those anxieties that we, and others, have expressed before. We continue to think that the Bill does not adequately address them. It is surely absolutely explicit&#151;as the Bill should be&#151;that in records of any activity exempted activities should, equally, be recorded. The same sort of regime should apply; again, it is about an even playing field. At the very least, it should be compulsory for the licensing authority to be notified each time an exempted activity is carried out and for the proposed register of licensing information to include that, which is why we refer here to Clause 98.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09030336000084"></a>The amendment would ensure that licensing and planning authorities could, as a minimum, base decisions on a complete record of all licensable activities&#151;including those exempted from licensing as such&#151;if they happen to take place in the marine area at any time. That would allow them to properly determine the cumulative effects of those activities on the marine environment. The Minister will surely recall that, in their response to taking the Marine Bill forward after the Joint Committee&#146;s report, the Government stated that they would be consulting extensively on their approach to exemptions. Options that could be covered include requiring a licence for exemptions, removing the requirement for a licence altogether and in-between options such as a simple registration scheme. Those were in the Government&#146;s response to recommendation 29 from the Joint Committee.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09030336000085"></a>My noble friends and I believe that, to ensure informed decision-making at sea and to deliver sustainable development in the marine area, a notification and registration scheme is a minimum rather than simply an optional requirement. We would like it noted that the option proposed in the Government&#146;s response to recommendation 29, which was simply to require a licence for exemption to be potentially obsolete because Clause 71(1)(a) allows the licensing authority to specify an exemption order that a licence will not be needed, is not adequate.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09030336000086"></a>On Amendment 63 to Clause 98, we believe that the statement in the Bill is frankly inadequate. The statement allows exclusion of information from the licensing register on the grounds that it,</p>
<ul><a name="09030336000291"></a>&#147;would be unduly prejudicial to any person&#146;s commercial interests&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030336000230"></a>The term &#147;unduly prejudicial&#148; is certainly not clear or adequate to its task. Indeed, in this context its meaning could be interpreted very widely. For example, there are no limitations provided on what is, or what would not be, &#147;unduly prejudicial&#148;. We believe that it would be more appropriate to use existing language, such as  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_627"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 627</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that in Regulation 12(5) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, which states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030336000292"></a>&#147;a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect ... the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic interest&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030336000231"></a>That is much more definite and does not weaken the Government&#146;s case for confidentiality; it makes it clearer.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09030336000087"></a>I apologise for my lengthy explanation of this group of amendments, but they are, to our mind, extremely important. They are certainly so to the alliance of organisations&#151;professional, quango and NGO&#151;that have been looking at this part of the Bill. As I said at the outset on this group, it is extremely important that there should be a level playing field between the consideration of criteria for the licensing process and, equally, the consideration of all exemptions. I beg to move.</p>

Regular maintenance dredging is of vital importance to coastal marine businesses. Indeed, it is essential for the ongoing viability of coastal marinas and boatyards. I remind your Lordships that these small businesses employ a large number of people and generate something like &#163;3 billion of revenue, more than &#163;1 billion of which is for export. The British Marine Federation is concerned because the Explanatory Notes to the draft marine Bill stated that low-risk dredging activities such as maintenance dredging would become exempt under the new Bill and, although this Bill allows the removal of licensable marine activities from Clause 63(1), there is no definitive statement of intent to exempt such forms of dredging after they have become licensable 12 months from the Bill gaining Royal Assent. Amendment A24 would include the activity of maintenance dredging as one that would be exempt for licensing. Amendment A29 merely provides a definition of maintenance dredging as,</p>
<ul><a name="09030336000293"></a>&#147;the removal of accumulated sediments from harbour channels and berths to ensure a safe depth of water for navigational purposes and the removal of sediment to restore an adequate flow of water to mitigate risk of flooding or protect a sensitive habitat&#148;.</ul>

I understand the purpose of Amendments A24 and A29 proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway. However, in considering those amendments, the Committee should bear in mind the comments of the Royal Yachting Association. I declare an interest as a member of the North Devon Yacht Club. The RYA had considerable concerns that the draft marine navigation Bill might well concentrate only on commercial interests, to the exclusion of the interests of the RYA and other small boat users, because of the way in which the Bill decides who can dredge and keep areas clear. Those fears may or may not be grounded. However, with regard to what this Bill can license, particularly in relation to dredging, it is very unhelpful that we have not had the other Bill. I appreciate that it is a Department for Transport Bill, but it shares an awful lot of common ground with this Bill, particularly when we are talking about this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09030336000091"></a>I am sorry that the noble Baroness, Lady Young, is not in her place and will not therefore join in the debate. Her amendments, ensuring that exempted dredging does not breach any environmental objectives, seem very sensible. My Amendment A25 is designed to ensure that, too. I am sure that such maintenance dredging is environmentally unimpeachable but, given that these standards should not be hard for the harbour authorities to meet, does the Minister not think that an appraisal would be a useful safeguard?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09030336000092"></a>Amendment A63, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, would make the exclusions covered by Clause 98(5)(b) more subtle and less open to abuse. We would support it for that reason. On these Benches, we agree that it is important to exclude any information that could damage a proper economic interest. Nevertheless, for the purposes of transparency and to reduce the chances of corruption, we support the noble Lord&#146;s attempt to reduce the amount of information that could potentially be covered by subsection (5)(b). Finally, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, and his amendment: if the Government intend this clause to cover only maintenance dredging, why do they not specify that?</p>

It might be useful if I outline the general approach that we are taking in the Bill to marine licensing exemptions. The broad nature of licensable activities listed in Clause 63 means that the Bill captures some operations that are not currently licensed or activities that we do not intend to license because they pose little environmental risk or they are appropriately regulated under other regimes. We are exempting locally authorised dredging activities under Clause 72 and we intend to carve out some other types of activities using the order-making power under Clause 71. This can be done in two ways: either the exemptions order can specify activities that will not need a marine licence under the Bill or it can set conditions that, if met, would mean that the activity would not need a marine licence. The ability to set conditions in the exemptions order means that the licence authority can control more precisely the activities that will not need a marine licence.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09030336000094"></a>Amendments A16, A18 and A21 concern a consultation process on an exemptions order. Each authority when considering an exemptions order has a statutory duty under Clause 71(4) to consult those persons whom it thinks appropriate. We have already started work with interested groups and those with expertise in the marine field to help to develop our approach to exemptions. Secondary legislation will set this out in more detail. We intend to carry out a full public consultation in the spring on our early thinking.</p>

I can assure the noble Lord, in responding to Amendment A14, that all those activities will be fully taken into account when deciding what activities are appropriate to exempt from the need for a marine licence, as, of course, will be sound scientific evidence and wider sustainable development aims.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09030336000096"></a>In relation to environmental appraisal, any decision to exempt activities from the marine licensing regime&#151;and, if so, to what extent&#151;will be based on the evidence that is available, the science and the environmental impact of an activity.

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09030336000097"></a>On the question of commercial prejudice, Amendments A15, A22, A61 and A63 deal with details kept in the licensing register and the review of exempt activities. Clause 98 lists those particulars that must be placed on the licensing register. Other information can be contained within it, if that is appropriate. Amendment A22 is about keeping exempt activities under review. Let me reassure noble Lords that, once an order has been made, the licensing authority is able to amend it in light of, for example, new evidence or technological advances. We intend to consult whether it is necessary for all exempt activities to be formally registered, kept under review or recorded in some other way. Of course, we will take close notice of what comes out from the consultation on that point.</p>

<p><a name="09030336000099"></a>The wording that we have used in the Bill is based on that used in the Food and Environment Protection Act, whose public register requirements have been around since 1996. My understanding is that information under FEPA has been withheld only on a handful of occasions since the introduction of those requirements and only after careful and stringent assessment. I hope that that reassures noble Lords on that point to a certain extent.</p>

Without that clause, those dredging activities without associated deposits&#151;primarily maintenance dredging&#151;carried out routinely and with minimal environmental impact under local regulations or a harbour order would have to be authorised under a marine licence. I fully accept that the noble Earl made my next point, which is that we are trying to get the balance right between proper protection and overbureaucratisation. However, unless we recreate the current exception, this could pose a considerable regulatory burden on harbour authorities, which have to maintain safe and navigable channels, as well as on licensing authorities, including the new MMO, in regulating this currently exempt form of dredging. That is why Clause 72 is drafted as it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09030336000101"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, as ever, made very important points. However, ironically, his amendments would restrict the exemption to maintenance dredging activities only. The vast majority of dredging that falls within this exemption will be maintenance dredging. Those dredging activities covered by this clause that are not maintenance dredging, and which are likely to have an impact on the environment, will still need to undertake the relevant environmental impact assessment, thereby providing the environmental safeguards. Any historically permitted capital dredging and spoil disposal that is regulated under the current regime will continue to be regulated under consent for the disposal activity.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09030336000102"></a>As for Amendments A23, A25, A26 and A30, I appreciate that there is eagerness to ensure that environmental objectives that will be set to deliver the water framework directive requirements are taken into account, but I am not convinced that they are necessary or desirable to set down in this Bill before measures to deliver the water framework directive have been fully developed. When the implementing measures of the directive have been decided, we expect ports and harbour authorities to engage fully with the Environment Agency to help to achieve the successful delivery of the objectives set. I understand that much work is already under way in this respect and that close links with the ports and harbour sector have already been established. Measures to achieve or support good ecological status should already be included in harbours&#146; maintenance dredging and disposal strategies.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09030336000103"></a>We are trying to avoid double regulation. If a harbour authority is acting in accordance with a local Act or relevant harbour order and in compliance with its other environmental obligations, we would not wish it to have to apply and pay for a marine licence where it is not necessary. I make it clear that, ultimately, harbour authorities, as competent authorities, have a statutory duty to undertake activities in accordance with relevant environmental obligations. The onus is clearly on them to ensure that they are complying with the relevant regulatory regimes, but we want to avoid the problem of double regulation.</p>

<a name="90303-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09030336000104"></a>I understand the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and why she wishes the relevant Bill to be brought before Parliament as soon as possible. I wish for that, too, and the Government wish to do so as soon as parliamentary time allows. Much though I should like to give her more information on that, I am not in a position to do so.</p>

I listened with care to what he said about consultation that is already taking place, but I have to tell him that at least some stakeholders, particularly those who are members of the Wildlife and Countryside Link&#146;s marine task force, are not satisfied that this clause is sufficient to deal with exemptions. I hear what he says about the intentions, but intentions are not as cast iron as a clause dealing with this issue. I will read with care what the Minister has said, and my noble friends and I will look at this again.</p>

<ul><a name="09030336000295"></a>&#147;the appropriate licensing authority must have regard to ... the need to protect the environment ... the need to protect human health ... the need to prevent interference with legitimate uses of the sea&#148;.</ul>

<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_633"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 633</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It seems that the Government&#146;s position is that the MMO will only advise the IPC, but nothing in the Bill says what will happen if the IPC ignores this advice. I do not propose to go over the arguments yet again but the consensus of the Committee was that the MMO&#146;s position should be strengthened.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09030336000114"></a>There are similar arguments with regard to the Department of Energy and Climate Change when licensing oil and gas activities and carbon dioxide storage. Clause 74 currently completely exempts DECC from the provisions in this Bill. I fully concede that it should probably be responsible for the oil and gas and carbon storage activities, as it has the knowledge and expertise. I should like the Minister to tell the Committee how DECC will interact with this marine Bill, if at all, and I have a number of questions.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09030336000115"></a>First, will DECC be advised by the MMO and, if so, what will happen if DECC does not take its advice? Secondly, will it need to comply with the marine policy statement? Thirdly, will it need to comply with the marine plans? Fourthly, will it respect the marine conservation zones? Fifthly, who will ensure that DECC complies with the EU marine strategy framework directive? We believe that it should be the MMO. I remind the Committee that under this directive member states are required to deliver good environmental status, or GES, by applying,</p>
<ul><a name="09030336000296"></a>&#147;an ecosystem-based approach to the management of human activities, ensuring that the collective pressure of such activities is kept within levels compatible with the achievement of good environmental status&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90303-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09030336000116"></a>The Committee is fortunate that the noble Lord is the Minister not only for Defra but also for DECC and is therefore in an ideal position to say how these two departments will interact when it comes to offshore activities. We need to ensure that the activities of DECC are not incompatible with the marine objectives set out in the Bill.</p>

Perhaps I may respond, first, to the question of the IPC and the MMO. We have debated this matter on a number of occasions with regard to this Bill, and I remind noble Lords that we also had extensive debate on it during the passage of the Planning Bill, which led to this House enacting it only 12, 13 or 14 weeks ago. Of course, the MMO is in a strong position to give advice to the IPC. In the end, the IPC must make its own judgments, but it will do so within the context of the NPS. We have said that the marine policy statement and the NPS will be consistent. Although the IPC must clearly make its own decisions, that will be in the very strong context of agreed government policy in the marine policy statement and the national planning statement.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09030336000118"></a>I suspect we will come back to debate this at Report, but we are ensuring the integrity of the planning system so that there is consistency on land and in the marine area. We are also ensuring that the MMO&#146;s wisdom and advice is brought to the fore. It is worth making the point that any conditions attached to any consent given by the IPC would fall to be policed by the MMO, so we expect there to be a very close working relationship.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_634"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 634</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90303-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09030336000119"></a>It is true that under the Bill I propose to exempt myself as a Minister of DECC from its provisions on oil and gas. I well understand that noble Lords want to question me on that point. Essentially, that exemption reflects the key strategic importance of oil and gas. The Government took a decision at an early stage of the development of oil and gas licensing that, from an energy-security imperative, a stand-alone regime should be operated centrally. We think that that is consistent with the reservation of oil and gas matters to the UK Government. That means that we intend to maintain the current position whereby a tailored regime is operated by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Of course, we also discussed the strategic nature of energy-related issues during debates on the Energy Act. This exclusion is entirely in line with the strategic position in both the Energy Act and the Planning Act.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09030336000120"></a>I hope that I can reassure the noble Earl on the substance of the points he raised about how the Department of Energy and Climate Change will work within the more general requirements that he mentioned. The existing legislative framework for oil and gas is comprehensive, and the regimes are tailored to address the regulatory challenges posed by those activities and to ensure full compliance with stringent international obligations that govern the oil and gas industry. The existing technical specialists in the Department of Energy and Climate Change certainly possess the necessary skills to deal with those complex issues.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09030336000121"></a>The existing legislative framework for oil and gas has substantial environmental protection built into it, including the need to conduct strategic environmental assurance assessments, environmental impact assessments and, where appropriate, assessments as required under the EU habitats directive. A range of environmental permits is also required to control atmospheric emissions and discharges to the sea. In not transferring those activities to the MMO, we have taken account of the comprehensive nature of the existing legislative framework and reflected the current licensing and evolution arrangements in this area, while taking the opportunity to avoid duplication and overlap between the existing regulating regimes.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09030336000122"></a>Will the Department of Energy and Climate Change be advised by the MMO? The answer is yes. I can assure noble Lords that the department will consult the MMO on its marine activities. Will the department respect marine conservation zones? Yes, as a public authority, the department and the Secretary of State in particular will be bound by Clause 121, which imposes a duty on public authorities to further, or at least not hinder, the achievement of the objectives of marine conservation zones. Even if the noble Earl disagrees with the exclusion of oil and gas, I hope he recognises that we will ensure that there is consistency and read-across to the arrangements we are making in the Bill.</p>

They will of course be advised by the MMO. Our intention is to ensure consistency. Previous amendments would essentially have given the MMO a veto, but we disagree with that. It is right that the Department of Energy and Climate Change should make decisions on oil and gas. As for the Planning Act, there are thresholds under which planning matters of national significance will fall to the IPC. With regard to the IPC and the MMO, there will be consistency between the marine policy statement and the NPS. We will have consistency, but it is also important to understand which body will make the final decision.</p>

One of our arguments in moving the amendments on the IPC was that the Planning Act ought to be amended. The Minister said that we could not possibly amend that Act because it had just been passed, but on page 243 of the Bill I see more than a page of amendments to it. So, obviously, it is possible to amend it. I will not address that now.</p>

There are technical amendments which have to be made. My point is simply that we had a very good debate on this matter in our deliberations on the Planning Act, when I clearly stated government policy and its relationship to the forthcoming marine Bill. My argument is simply that the House had a very good discussion on this matter and, I thought, disposed of it.</p>

In any event, I do not want to continue that debate now. We thought that our amendments were technical, too. Be that as it may, on this clause, I thank the Minister for saying that DECC will be advised by the MMO, which is a useful step forward, and that it will respect the conservation zones, which is also useful.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09030336000128"></a>The Minister did not reply to the question of who will ensure that DECC, the IPC, and so on, comply with the EU directive where the cumulative effect of all these activities at sea is just too much. We have never really had a satisfactory answer to that. The Secretaries of State for three departments will each be rowing their own boat. There will be nobody to say to them that they are doing too much in an area at sea. It probably ought to be the MMO that, rather than saying, &#147;No, you cannot do it&#148;, flags up that there is too much activity in an area at sea.</p>

I speak in a spirit of optimism that the Minister is now very much in tune with the nature of our argument about the role of the MMO.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09030336000134"></a>We oppose Clauses 75 and 76, respectively affecting harbour works and electricity works, standing part of the Bill in order to generate a debate on the workings of the special provisions for which they cater. It is inevitable when dealing with an area as complex as marine licensing that there will be exemptions and special cases which will have to be taken into account. In relation to harbour works and electricity works, there are obvious problems because licences will be required not only under the Marine and Coastal Access Bill but also under the Harbours Act or the Electricity Act.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09030336000135"></a>We fully agree with the Government that this is a difficult deviation from their desire that the MMO should be a one-stop shop which would enable consents to be put through a simplified process and the Minister has already said that the Government are seeking to avoid double regulation. The one-stop shop is a sensible idea and we, too, would rather that the MMO was able to process all the competing demands and then come to an overall decision having taken all factors into account. In addition, it seems wrong that an applicant should have to undertake a dual application process for one project. Nevertheless, we have decided to table stand part objections to Clauses 75 and 76 because,  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_637"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 637</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>while we agree with the Government&#146;s sentiment that the MMO should be a one-stop shop for marine licences, we disagree with the method they have introduced in order to achieve it.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09030336000136"></a>We on these Benches believe that Clauses 75 and 76 as they stand threaten to undermine some of the benefits of the Marine and Coastal Access Bill. As the Bill stands, the Secretary of State has been given an order-making power to allow the procedures from the Harbours Act or the Electricity Act to be used instead in these specific situations. It could be argued that this is one solution to the problem. Nevertheless, does the Minister admit that this leads to an excess of discretionary flexibility in the Bill? Not only could this mean confusion for potential applicants but it could also be open to abuse from interested third parties. We would like to see this flexibility withdrawn.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09030336000137"></a>As Wildlife and Countryside Link has suggested, these provisions go a long way to making the process more, rather than less, complicated. Where once they looked to be favouring a simplified one-stop shop, now it looks as if the Secretary of State could be allowed to modify even the procedures of the Harbour Act or the Electricity Act. Does the Minister agree that this is not in line with the desire to simplify rather than complicate matters? Wildlife and Countryside Link has suggested that it would be more appropriate for the provisions of the Marine and Coastal Access Bill&#151;or Act as we hope it will become&#151;to take precedence, excepting only if the provisions of the Harbour Act or the Electricity Act are stricter. Does the Minister agree that this would achieve the Government&#146;s goal of a simplified regime with fewer complications? Can he tell us whether the Government have considered this approach and, if so, why they have rejected it? I look forward to hearing his response.</p>

We share with him the concern about complexity and confusion in this clause. I refer briefly to my experience as a constituency MP. The large number of relatively small harbours in my constituency were managed very effectively by a largely volunteer management operation of harbour commissioners, often with only one or two employees. My concern is that, under the regime that we are setting out here, the complexity involved will not produce the one-stop shop to which the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, referred. Indeed, there still seems to be some degree of potential duplication and confusion with the Harbours Act.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09030336000139"></a>To illustrate the way in which the management of relatively small harbours is at the moment extremely effectively and flexibly undertaken, I recall an occasion when a film company wanted to continue the effective series &#147;Doc Martin&#148; which I am sure many noble Lords enjoyed. It was filmed in Port Isaac, the most beautiful little harbour in the whole of the western world. There was a slight problem because the harbour commissioners had long been seeking to strengthen the harbour wall and had obtained from the ministry  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_638"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 638</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>then responsible, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the appropriate grant after a long and bitter lobby. Because of the way films are produced, there was a danger that the wall would go up and down in the background during the series, so I spent some time negotiating between the film company and the harbour commissioners. Eventually a sum was advanced, the harbour commissioners put off the work until the following autumn, the summer&#146;s filming went forward without any hitch and the result was delightful.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09030336000140"></a>My point is that often the smaller harbours need a simple administrative system to cope with this sort of thing. If the MMO is going to represent a genuine one-stop shop and the provisions of the Harbours Act are not going to apply, let us be open about it. We share the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, and we look forward to the Minister&#146;s response. In a sense we, too, are probing, but perhaps from a slightly different direction.</p>

<p><a name="st_98"></a>

I have to confess that I have no specific notes on that point, as the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, would expect.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09030336000142"></a>The changes that would result from these two clauses have been welcomed by industry and are part of our efforts towards better regulation in the marine environment. They will reduce the administrative burden on the developer, the regulator and the consultee alike, and help to prevent delays in obtaining regulatory approval for a harbour or offshore energy generation development.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09030336000143"></a>I shall defend the clauses by explaining more specifically how they work. Clause 75 enables an application for a harbour order under the Harbours Act 1964 and an application for a marine licence to be considered together through the same special procedure if they relate to the same activity or works. Clause 76 makes similar provision for offshore generating stations that require consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 and a marine licence.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09030336000144"></a>The special procedure will be the procedure outlined in either the Harbours Act 1964 or the Electricity Act 1989, but modified as necessary to take full account of the concerns of the Bill&#151;that is, the marine licensing regime&#146;s requirements&#151;by an order under subsection (6). The special procedure will be activated at the discretion of the harbour order or generating station authority. In the event that the Marine Management Organisation is the harbour order authority or generating station authority and the Welsh Ministers the marine licensing authority, the special procedure could be activated only with the agreement of the Welsh Ministers. In those instances the MMO will issue a notice to the applicant to that effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09030336000145"></a>Subsections (6) to (8) of Clauses 75 and 76 give the Secretary of State the power, by order, to modify the procedural provisions of the Harbours Act and the Electricity Act as they relate to the special procedure. I want to be clear about what the order will do; it will  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_639"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 639</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>set up a generic special procedure that will apply to all subsequent applications that take advantage of that procedure. An order will not be made in each and every circumstance where the procedure is to be applied. That will guarantee consistency of treatment across the board. Secondly, the order can modify the procedural provisions of the Harbours Act and the Electricity Act to enable it fully to consider marine licence requirements.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09030336000146"></a>Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the marine licensing authority will still need to have regard to the need to protect the environment and human health and prevent interference with other uses of the sea, just as with any other marine licence determination. I emphasise that it will not reduce the environmental safeguards enshrined in the marine licence.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09030336000147"></a>The end result of the special procedure is both a harbour order&#151;or Section 36 consent&#151;and a marine licence, issued by the relevant authorities that take account of the full range of considerations as set out in each piece of legislation. The marine licence that applies is enforceable just as much as a marine licence issued under the ordinary procedure that we have described in Clauses 64 to 68. With these two clauses we are seeking to reduce the regulatory burden in the marine environment. At the moment, a port could require a Food and Environment Protection Act licence, consent under the Coast Protection Act and a harbour order from two&#151;or, in Wales, three&#151;different bodies. Under the proposals in Clauses 75 and 76, however, the same works can undergo the full regulatory processes in one clearly understood procedure and to one timescale. It is a big step towards enabling a joined-up, holistic consideration of developments with environmental, navigation and socio-economic factors considered in the round at the same time.</p>

<a name="90303-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09030336000148"></a>That is the justification for this procedure. I recognise the noble Lord&#146;s anxieties, but he will appreciate that industry seems to be satisfied with the arrangements we are making. They provide essential safeguards with regard to the marine position and the crucial aspects of the protection of the marine environment while creating, out of the two Acts that otherwise govern these authorities, one procedure that is clearly understood and can be implemented. I appreciate the concern about these clauses, but I hope that noble Lords will recognise that this is driven by an attempt to create a straightforward and relatively simple process by which we can deal with these issues and bring together one clear regulatory step and thereby reduce the regulatory burdens on industry. That is the basis on which I hope the noble Lord will feel able to accept the clauses and withdraw his objection.</p>

It is in order to achieve that position that we are seeking, in Clauses 75 and 76, to reduce the regulatory burden and to create a position in which all the issues that need to be considered can be considered within this framework, because each of them, in each of the separate Acts, is an important provision that needs to be taken fully into account.</p>

I wanted to emphasise that this is a total procedure in which the provisions in this Bill will rank equally in terms of significance or of getting agreement.

Because this Bill is about marine issues, harbours are an important part of our client group, so I want to reassure the noble Baroness that, when I said that the industry supports this approach, I sought to include both categories of harbour within that framework.</p>

However, I emphasise that, within this framework, these are issues that relate to all the powers under the Harbours Act 1964, and I sought to be definitive in relation to that legislation.

I shall take the opportunity to explain our general approach to enforcement of the new licensing regime established by the Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_643"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 643</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90303-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09030336000163"></a>The regime is designed to allow development in the marine area, while also providing protection for the environment and human health and preventing interference with other legitimate uses of the sea. The primary aim of our enforcement proposals is to prevent harm. We want to bring people into compliance with the law, to avoid harm being caused in the first place. Experience with enforcement of the Coast Protection Act 1949 and the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 has shown that the only options for sanctions under those Acts&#151;warning letters or prosecution&#151;are too limited a range of enforcement tools. There is a compliance gap for offences that the licensing authority would like to enforce but which are judged as being not proportionate to prosecute. Apart from any minor harm that might result, this can mean that operators who abide by the terms of their licence may face costs that those who operate outside licence conditions do not.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09030336000164"></a>In the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, we are establishing a sanctions regime that provides a more proportionate range of tools for enforcement in the marine area. We have worked within the context and recommendations of the Hampton and Macrory reports and considered the provisions of the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008. Essentially, they provide for more proportionate and targeted enforcement tools, designed primarily to bring people into compliance, but with the teeth to penalise offenders where that is necessary.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09030336000165"></a>There are order-making powers in the Bill in Clauses 90, 92 and 138 to establish a civil monetary penalties scheme for enforcement of both licensing and nature conservation offences, similar to that established under the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008. There will be further consultation on the design of this scheme later this year. In essence, fixed monetary penalties are intended to address minor non-compliances with licence conditions. Variable monetary penalties are intended to address more serious breaches of licence conditions.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09030336000166"></a>On the statutory notices that we are making available to use under the Bill, the first, a compliance notice in Clause 87, may be used to bring an operator back into compliance where no serious harm has been caused. It will lay down steps with which the operator must comply to avoid any further penalty.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09030336000167"></a>Our Amendments A45, A46 and A47 insert a test of &#147;serious&#148; into the compliance notice for circumstances where the notice cannot be given. These amendments mean that an enforcement authority will be able to issue a compliance notice only where the harm caused by the breach to the environment and human health, or interference to other legitimate uses of the sea, is not serious. This approach is aimed at preventing harm. A notice will be issued to a licensee to bring that operator back into compliance with their licence.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09030336000168"></a>A remediation notice, which is covered in Clause 88, may be used for licensable activities where the operator has caused harm and does not have a licence for that activity or has breached the terms of their licence. This notice will detail steps that the operator needs to undertake to put matters right or may specify a sum of money that they must pay so as to allow someone else to remediate the harm that they have caused.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09030336000169"></a>Amendments A49, A50 and A51 remove &#147;serious&#148; from the test for issue of a remediation notice. They mean that the enforcement authority will be able to issue a remediation notice where harm has been caused, by the lack of a licence or a breach, to the environment and human health or where there has been interference with other legitimate uses of the sea, and not just when serious harm has been caused. This enacts commitments made by the Government following pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09030336000170"></a>Two emergency notices designed to prevent serious harm complete the set. First, the stop notice will be used to stop activities that the enforcement officer believes to be causing or likely to cause serious harm. The second notice, an emergency safety notice, will be used to prevent serious interference with other legitimate uses of the sea&#151;for example, ordering operators to provide navigational lighting to make safe navigational hazards. That last notice re-enacts a power under the Coast Protection Act 1949.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09030336000171"></a>Amendments A65 and A66 remove &#147;will&#148; and insert &#147;is likely to&#148; in the test for issue of a stop notice so that it can be issued if the activity is causing or is likely to cause, or is creating or is likely to create, an imminent risk of serious harm to the environment or human health or serious interference with other legitimate uses of the sea.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09030336000172"></a>Amendments A69, A70, A71 and A72 allow the imposition of an emergency safety notice without there already being a stop notice in place under Clause 101. The amendments allow the enforcement authority to issue an emergency safety notice where a licensable activity has led to a danger to navigation but without the requirement that a stop notice has already been issued, as there may be no activity to stop&#151;for instance, if adverse weather has led to problems causing something to collapse into the sea, thereby creating a hazard.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09030336000173"></a>These sanctions do not prevent the enforcement authority from using the tools that it already has: advice and warning letters, through to prosecution in the most serious cases. Under paragraph 10 of Schedule 7, the enforcement authority will develop and publish its enforcement guidance. Taken together, this new suite of enforcement tools will enable the effective enforcement of the marine licensing regime, which will not only protect the environment and human health and prevent interference with other legitimate uses of the sea but also make sure that operators who abide by the terms of their licence are not disadvantaged by the behaviour of those who do not. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09030336000175"></a>We shall come back to Clause 88, but I shall talk briefly about Amendments A54 and A55 to Clause 93. We agree that the enforcement authority should be able to modify the amount of variable monetary penalty  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_645"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 645</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and, furthermore, that there should be a mechanism for appeal against the amount as well as the penalty. This makes sense in the context of further information about the circumstances and effects of the offence and the condition of the offender. However, these executive powers should not be used as a replacement for criminal prosecution. It is in the courts that the real penalties should be imposed. While it may be quicker and easier to use an effective variable monetary penalty, that should not be allowed to take precedence over criminal prosecution in the courts. Will the Minister assure us that this will not be the case?</p>

They are consequential and in no way differ from the general thrust of the amendments on which he has given a fuller explanation. I am particularly concerned about Clause 112(2). It picks up the point about wrecks, which were referred to just now. While the Minister considers that, I can report to the Committee that at about this time yesterday I was off the Scilly Isles, having flown in a Royal Naval helicopter from HMS &#147;Cornwall&#148;&#151;so I was doing my homework, even though I was playing truant from your Lordships&#146; House. What struck me was the extraordinary number of wrecks there are around the Isles of Scilly. This is a particular problem.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09030336000177"></a>When it comes to the issue of enforcement and to seeing that there is proper protection for wrecks, it will potentially be very controversial to make sure that the Bill puts the right enforcement procedures in place and deals sensitively with the relationship concerning wrecks that are of considerable archaeological and historical interest, of which there are a great many around the Isles of Scilly. People should be brought into compliance, in the noble Lord&#146;s phrase, in an effective but not heavy-handed way. This is my best opportunity to raise the issue, because of the amendments to Clause 112: there may be other parts of the Bill to which I have not yet given my attention, but I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us generally that this extraordinarily important issue is being dealt with.</p>

<a name="09030336000178"></a><b><a name="90303-0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09030336000435"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> What an exciting life the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, lives. When he is not taking part in films&#151;or helping them to take place&#151;he is on Royal Naval flights over all sorts of things. He also lives in a most wonderful part of the country. The noble Lord is absolutely right that Amendments A110 to A112 are very technical indeed, but I take his point about wrecks. The noble Lord has already noted that Clause 112(2) deals with interpreting that matter, but might I commit myself to writing to him in more detail about how we might approach that interesting point? There is a relationship between it and some of our debates about what might be called cultural heritage. In one sense, wrecks have a contribution, but they might present difficulties too and we clearly have to get the balance right.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09030336000179"></a>Perhaps I may now respond to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor. First, there was the question of the enforcement authority&#146;s ability to choose whether to prosecute or to issue a monetary penalty.  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_646"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 646</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Part 4 of the Bill contains several offences: Clause 82 sets out that it is an offence to breach a requirement for a licence or a licensing requirement. The maximum penalties are,</p>
<ul><a name="09030336000298"></a>&#147;on summary conviction ... a fine not exceeding &#163;50,000&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09030336000234"></a>and</p>
<ul><a name="09030336000299"></a>&#147;on conviction on indictment ... a fine or ... imprisonment&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09030336000235"></a>for up to two years. There are also offences in Clauses 86, 89, 100 and 102, while Clauses 90 to 92 provide for a powerful licensing authority to establish civil sanctions for an offence under Part 4. Those sanctions embrace both fixed and variable monetary penalties.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09030336000180"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor is concerned that the enforcement authority has the discretion to decide whether and how to enforce the provision. I hope to give him some reassurance here, because the approach to that would be set in its enforcement policy and in guidance. It can choose to enforce by prosecution or taking matters short of prosecution, such as giving advice or warning letters. Alternatively, it can impose a civil sanction. Paragraphs 9 and 10 of Schedule 7 set out the requirement on civil sanctions. As now under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, the offence is set out in Schedule 9, but how the licensing authority enforces the legislation is not set out in the Bill. We think that it would fetter a prosecutor&#146;s discretion to set out when the prosecutor must or must not prosecute. Essentially, the civil sanctions statutory notices in Part 4 are designed to address the issue that the tools currently available under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 do not provide sufficient proportionality for enforcement. This is an attempt to have a range of sanctions available to deal in a proportionate way with the matters that arise, which is why we want the enforcement authority to have the choice that we give. However, guidance will be issued to ensure that it is used in a proper way.</p>

<a name="90303-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09030336000181"></a>In my stewardship as Minister responsible for the Health and Safety Executive, which is not always the most popular organisation, I was very impressed by the proportionate approach that it took in practice. It made considerable efforts to encourage people to do the right thing but, in the end, needed strong sanctions and ultimately that of prosecution if people either did something that was so dreadful that that had to happen or continually ignored the help and warnings that they had been given. I must be careful not to draw too many parallels, but giving the enforcement authority a range of options in relation to sanctions is helpful and proportionate. In the context, I see it as an example of better regulation.</p>

As has been made clear from the recent reference to the wreck of HMS &#147;Victory&#148; on the Casquets, a lot of these wrecks are not necessarily British vessels. I am concerned that there are some extremely entrepreneurial people from other countries who will see what they think is an interesting wreck in our jurisdiction and that we have no means of stopping them.

This is a probing amendment. I believe that the Environment Agency has been in productive talks with Defra over the past couple of weeks, and I have tabled this amendment in the hope that there has been a satisfactory conclusion. My new clause addresses an apparent overlap between the two licence regimes&#151;for an environment permit and for a marine licence&#151;that might both apply to activities in the intertidal zone. In this situation, if the successful application for one licence requires the necessary criteria for the other to be met anyway, it would be wholly unnecessary for the applicant and the Environment Agency to have to go through the motions again for the second licence. This clause would allow the requirement for the second licence to be disapplied and save everyone involved some time and effort. I hope the Minister will be able to accept this amendment.

Paragraph (a) brings forward a defence, when a person is charged, provided that the activity was carried out for the purpose of securing the safety of a vessel, aircraft or marine structure or for the purpose of saving life. My amendment would introduce the word &#147;cargo&#148; after &#147;vessel&#148;. This would ensure that a defence for failing to comply with licensing requirements was equally available where cargo in itself became a danger or had to be destroyed or rendered innocuous. For example, this could apply in the event of cargo shifting, or a spillage or leakage when it may be necessary to jettison some or all of the cargo to avoid loss or damage to other goods. Amendment A40 inserts a new clause headed &#147;Accidental loss overboard&#148;. It states:</p>

<p><a name="09030336000236"></a>Such a defence would arise where, for example, as a result of stress of weather or other conditions beyond the vessel&#146;s control, cargo falls or is washed overboard. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90303-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09030336000190"></a>I have been involved in the London insurance market for more than 25 years. I should like to think that the loss of cargo, together with the cost of clean-up and other related liabilities, was covered by insurance. When I read these amendments I was not sure where the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, was going with them, so I was pleased to listen to his speech on them. I have racked my brain to see how securing cargo can lead to a damaging activity that can be defensible, other than damage caused when acting in accordance with instructions given by the Secretary of State&#146;s representative&#151;otherwise known as SOSREP. I remind the Committee that SOSREP was an appointment set up following Lord Donaldson&#146;s 1990s report, <I>Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas</I>, whereby SOSREP manages marine emergencies. In the event of an impending disaster, after negotiation, SOSREP will issue instructions to minimise or avoid any damage. The instructions may be to run to port, or to run aground if the ship is about to break up. I seek an assurance that a person has a defence if he acts within SOSREP&#146;s intent, thereby trying to secure the cargo&#146;s safety.</p>

I am also grateful for the specific point that the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, raised. If the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, will forgive me, I shall address myself to the rather technical point which the noble Earl raised. As he indicated, the Secretary of State&#146;s representative (SOSREP) may make directions under Schedule 3A to the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, as amended, for someone to carry out a licensable activity without a licence in order to remove or reduce the risk of pollution, or more serious pollution. This may include the jettisoning of cargo from a vessel. Any person directed by SOSREP will have the defence of due diligence under Clause 106. In some circumstances they may also have the defence provided under Clause 83 if action is also taken in order to secure,</p>
<ul><a name="09030336000300"></a>&#147;the safety of a vessel, aircraft or marine structure ... for the purpose of saving life&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90303-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09030336000192"></a>It is highly unlikely that a prosecution would be pursued in either of those circumstances. The person appointed as SOSREP would carry out this function as a Minister of the Crown, and is answerable to the Secretary of State. In the circumstances described, it is just not credible that the Secretary of State would ever have proceedings brought against him either under this Bill or under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, as amended, which does not envisage any such situation.

<a name="90303-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09030336000193"></a>On the rather more general points that the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, raised, Clause 83 gives a person a defence against a charge brought against them if they carried out a licensable activity without a licence if they could prove that they did so,</p>
<ul><a name="09030336000301"></a>&#147;for the purpose of securing the safety of a vessel, aircraft or marine structure, or for the purpose of saving life&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030336000238"></a>The circumstances where the emergency defence is available are limited to those four possibilities. Licensable activities in all other circumstances should be undertaken within the terms of the licence in order to protect the environment and human health and to prevent interference with other uses of the sea, which is a cardinal principle underpinning this legislation.</p>

<a name="90303-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09030336000194"></a>For example, a deposit of a potentially dangerous or contaminated substance made to protect cargo is likely to be harmful to the marine environment. It is right that any such activity is controlled or carried out under the terms of the licence, if permitted at all by a licensing authority. Providing a defence as an emergency provision here would set an unwelcome precedent and cause quite severe damage to the objectives of the legislation.</p>

<a name="90303-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09030336000195"></a>We have tried and failed to think of other examples where a licensable activity would be undertaken without licence, or in breach of a licence, in an emergency in order to protect cargo that would not also be for the purposes of securing the safety of a vessel, aircraft or structure, or for the purpose of saving life, with the one exception to which I responded to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, where the instruction has been given to the people concerned. We would welcome suggestions of where this may not be the case. We think that the provisions give us total coverage on this matter, but I am always prepared to listen to Members of the Committee on such an important matter, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Greenway.</p>

<a name="90303-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09030336000196"></a>Under Amendment A40, the noble Lord suggests an additional provision in order to provide a defence if a person charged is able to prove that an unlicensed deposit was a result of accidental loss of cargo overboard. The Bill already contains the general defence of due diligence in Clause 106, which provides a defence against a charge if a person carries out a licensable activity without a licence but can prove that they,</p>
<ul><a name="09030336000302"></a>&#147;took all such steps as reasonably could be taken to ensure that no offence would be committed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030336000239"></a>If a person has taken necessary steps to make secure any cargo or other items on board, a defence would be provided under this provision in Clause 106.</p>

<a name="90303-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09030336000197"></a>The licensing provisions protect those who unwittingly commit an offence while taking all reasonable steps to stay within the law. We would not want someone who has lost items overboard, albeit accidentally, to have a defence available to them if that loss is as a consequence of their own incompetence or neglect. Where those factors obtain, that should not be a proper defence. I want to reassure the noble Lord and the Committee that in all cases the enforcement authority will take into account extenuating circumstances, such as force majeure, when it decides if any enforcement action is appropriate. When we approached the Department for

<a name="90303-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09030336000198"></a>For the reasons I have indicated, we think that we have thought about these issues seriously and have covered all eventualities where there could be a reasonable defence. I hope therefore that the noble Lord will feel that he has explored these issues sufficiently to be able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

On Amendment A38, what would be the position if a ship carrying drums of chemicals on deck caught fire and, in order to prevent that fire spreading to the rest of the ship, they were pushed overboard?

<a name="09030336000202"></a><b><a name="90303-0006.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="09030336000457"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> I tabled my opposition to Clauses 88 and 103 standing part of the Bill in order to ask some probing questions about the concept of remediation notices. I know that the Minister has already moved government Amendments 48 to 51 to Clause 88, but the clause is rather light on the detail of what remediation steps might be required of a licence holder and the Explanatory Notes do not go much further. In fact, the Explanatory Notes do not quite seem to mesh perfectly with the provisions of the Bill. The notes talk of remedying the damage caused, whereas the clause speaks only of steps to protect. I am sure the Minister would agree that restoring or remedying environmental damage and preventing or protecting from future damage are different things.</p>

<a name="90303-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09030336000203"></a>Can the Minister give us further information about what sorts of actions are likely to be encouraged? Will remedial notices be primarily financial, as made possible in subsection (7)(c), or will the offender be expected to participate in the steps? What would happen if the initial fine were found to be inadequate? Could a further levy be imposed for the same offence? Is there to be any sort of cap on how much can be levied by a remedial notice? Finally, if the licence holder is to undertake the remedial steps, what sort of assessment will be made of whether they have been effective?</p>

<a name="90303-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09030336000204"></a>There are wider questions about the effectiveness of remedial steps as a concept. Clauses 88 and 103 appear to assume that remedial action is a possibility in the case of all environmental damage. Of course, that is not so. Much environmental damage is irreversible, as has already been said. A species driven to extinction cannot be reintroduced. Damage to habitats is also extremely difficult to repair. For example, any Severn barrage will cause the loss of a stretch of intertidal

What remedial action could possibly compensate for that damage?</p>

<a name="90303-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09030336000205"></a>Remedial notices and actions could of course, in some cases, be extremely helpful. The cost of clearing up spills and pollution can be prohibitive, and it is right that the person who caused the damage should pay for it. However, we would not want to see the growth of an attitude of complacency, in which environmental damage is nodded at because of a mistaken belief that remedial action can always be applied.</p>

The Minister has on a number of occasions and again this afternoon referred to bringing those responsible for damage into compliance, which is clearly an extremely important objective of the Bill. It may well be that in some circumstances it will be a question of mitigation rather than full remedy. As the noble Earl said, often damage that may start as being relatively minor can have very long-term consequences and be very difficult to reverse. This is an extremely difficult and technical area where the expertise available to the MMO will be extremely important. We have had a number of discussions in Committee about the quality of advice and support that it will have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09030336000208"></a>We share the concerns expressed by the noble Earl and his objective of probing from the Minister and the Government clarity about exactly what they have in mind in the complicated area of remediation notices. I do not envy the Minister, because he will have to live with the consequences of the Bill long after it has left your Lordships' House and perhaps after he has left his current responsibilities. This may be an area where he will look back and wonder whether we got it right. It will be very difficult to get it right; I sympathise with him in that respect. Sometimes it is much easier to say &#147;Stop!&#148; than to say what should happen once something has happened and it is necessary to try to reverse the situation. That is especially true in the marine environment, so I say good luck to the Minister. I hope that he will not need it.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09030336000210"></a>Plainly, subsections (8) and (9) suggest that action must be taken to protect the environment, but not to restore it. Yet remediation must mean restoration. Clause 88 does not seem to address the need for a mechanism to enforce restoration, let alone to determine what level or type of restoration is acceptable and in what time frame. In that context, it is well to observe that European legislation demands either restoration at the damaged or destroyed site or compensation in the form of the provision, at an adjacent site, of an equivalent habitat. A similar criticism can be made of Clause 103, entitled &#147;Power to take remedial action&#148;.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09030336000211"></a>In reality, remedial action, either by restoration or providing a similar habitat, is very difficult to achieve in the marine environment. That is why regular and careful monitoring of the effect of licensed activities on biodiversity is so critical.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09030336000212"></a>I make one final observation in this context. Subsection (9) mentions the purpose of protecting the environment, but does that mean protecting what is left of the environment after the damage is done?</p>

<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="09030336000213"></a><b><a name="90303-0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030336000460"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> This is a very interesting debate. I shall start by describing how the Government see the two clauses and then come on to deal with the substantive points of the argument in the debate. I readily acknowledge that it is complex but it is consistent with the approach we have taken to give proportionate powers to the enforcement authority.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09030336000214"></a>Clause 88 enables the enforcement authority to issue a remediation notice to make someone put right the harm they have caused where they have carried out a licensable activity. The person might have breached the conditions of their licence and so damaged the environment or they might not have had a licence at all. We want to make sure that they can be made to remediate that harm to the environment or human health or the interference they have caused to other legitimate uses of the sea.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09030336000215"></a>Clause 103 provides the power of the licensing authority to take remedial action. It enables the authority to carry out any works, whether they are for the purpose of protecting the environment or human health, or for preventing interference with legitimate uses of the sea, where a licensable activity has been undertaken without a licence. This is not a new power; it already exists under the Food and Environment Protection Act. Both FEPA and the Bill make provision for costs to be recovered. The difference is that under this Bill, the mechanism by which this is achieved is the service of a remediation notice, requiring the person on whom it is served to pay the costs of work undertaken under Clause 103. I understand that the power under FEPA is rarely used, but the Marine and Fisheries Agency tells me that it has found the threat of taking remedial action a useful tool in previous years.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09030336000216"></a>As I said earlier, we are modernising the enforcement sanctions available for marine licensing offences under this Bill. The currently limited range of sanctions available&#151;advice, warnings or prosecution&#151;leads to what is considered to be a compliance gap where the licensing authority may have clear evidence that an offence has been committed but the seriousness of the case is such that it is judged not to be proportionate to  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_655"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 655</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prosecute it in the criminal courts. While the licensing authority works hard to ensure that the further harm or interference caused can be avoided or removed, this gap is unfair to the operators who abide by the law. They bear the costs of keeping to licence conditions while those competitors who do not save those costs.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09030336000217"></a>The aim is for the enforcement authority to issue a remediation notice to make sure that those who hope to profit by acting illegally can be made to put right the wrongs they have caused. I will come on to the practicality of putting right everything that has been wrong; I accept that it is a very important point.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09030336000218"></a>Amendments A49, A50 and A51, which we have already discussed, remove the word &#147;serious&#148; from the test for issue of a remediation notice. That is important because it means that the enforcement authority will be able to issue a remediation notice where the lack of a licence or a breach has caused harm to the environment and human health or caused interference to other legitimate uses of the sea, not just when serious harms have been caused. This enacts a commitment that the Government made following pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09030336000219"></a>Through Amendment A104, we have stipulated that only a licensing authority, and not an enforcement officer, will be able to issue a remediation notice. This is a safeguard, because it means that consideration of the measure, which might be required, will need to be carefully assessed. We would expect the enforcement authority to consult other expert bodies and those affected by the harm as to what actions might be required for remediation. We accept that this is an important issue.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09030336000220"></a>We want to be able to address offences proportionately. There may be instances where an operator has inadvertently breached their licence, caused harm or interference, and is keen to work with the enforcement authority to put right that harm or interference. We want to encourage that, and we think that issuing a remediation notice detailing the steps that need to be undertaken might be all that is needed to bring the operator back into compliance.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09030336000221"></a>As to what sort of remedial steps might be necessary, it very much depends on the case. That is why it is difficult to be precise. It might simply be a case of undoing what has been done, such as, for instance, removing a jetty that had been built without a licence. It might be impossible to undo what has been done. I readily accept that in some circumstances, it might not be possible to put right what has been damaged by such action. For example, if a habitat has been damaged or aquatic life killed, habitat construction or fish stocking elsewhere might be the appropriate remediation. It depends on the circumstances of the case. We would expect the enforcement authority, with expert advice, to assess whether the work has been done to a satisfactory level. If the offender was not capable of undertaking the work, the enforcement authority could use a remediation notice to recover the cost of the work.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09030336000222"></a>Remediation notices are intended as a proportionate way to get someone who has caused harm to put that right. I emphasise that the enforcement authority would look at all the circumstances of the case, and only after detailed examination of the case&#151;with consultation with interested parties, including the offender&#151;would  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_656"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 656</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it finalise the steps to be taken under the notice. The licensing authority will need to publish its enforcement policy, and its development of this policy will have to consider the nature of the offence and what it is appropriate to take into account about the offender when deciding to issue a notice. If the licensing authority decides that the behaviour of the operator is so poor that the business operation is called into question, it will have other methods at its disposal. It could, for instance, suspend, vary or revoke the licence. It could issue a variable monetary penalty and prosecute the offence if that was proportionate enforcement action in that case.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09030336000223"></a>As for costs, which noble Lords mentioned, remediation measures might entail, as I said, undoing what has been done. If a structure was built without a licence, it would be straightforward to require that the structure be taken down in a sensible and sensitive way. As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, pointed out, restorative action might simply not be possible in some cases. In such cases, remediation works designed to compensate for the damage may be ordered. I have already referred to the possibility of fish stocks being developed elsewhere. I am also advised that remediation might mean, for instance, running an education campaign to inform the public about a protected area.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09030336000224"></a>I readily accept that we have little experience of the costs of restoration of marine diversity damage in the UK. There is an example of work that has been undertaken to mitigate the impact of human activities on marine ecology in the development of codes of conduct. The estimated cost of one code of conduct, aimed at the full range of activities in a bay, was about &#163;150,000. That included developing the code; publishing it on sign boards, laminated cards and leaflets; and reporting and monitoring over a five-year period.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09030336000225"></a>There is some experience of creating artificial reefs, whereby a structure fulfilling the functions of a natural reef is deployed on the sea bed. I understand that this is one strategy used to promote fishery enhancement, create new habitat or restore damaged habitat. There are examples where this has been done in the UK, including in Poole Bay, where the estimated cost was &#163;200,000. There are other examples. In Plymouth, a wreck was deployed as an interest feature for recreational divers at a cost of &#163;600,000. Remediation will ideally mean that what has been put wrong is put right. In some cases, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in particular, pointed out, other remediation steps might be taken.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09030336000226"></a>I turn to subsections (8) and (9). In particular, subsection (9) needs to be seen in the context of Clause 66, which sets out the general principles for determining an application. As far as possible, remediation means putting right what has been done wrong. But if that is not possible, it means doing other things that will at least make amends for what has happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09030343000002"></a>Clause 88 goes right to the heart of the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to sustain biodiversity and enhance the sustainability of our seas. Unless we have  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_657"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 657</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an effective remediation system, we will not succeed in reaching, let alone maintaining, this objective.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09030343000003"></a>I agree with the Minister and other noble Lords&#151;I even said it myself&#151;that restoration in a marine context is very difficult once the damage is done; and there are circumstances in which restoration can never take place. It is even more important, therefore, that the Committee should scrutinise the monitoring capabilities of the MMO very carefully to make sure that damage is not beginning to be done. If it can step in at that stage, restoration will not be an issue.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09030343000004"></a>That is why I am worried, in particular, about subsection (9)(a), which refers to &#147;protecting the environment&#148;. Although I have not tabled an amendment at this stage, I shall contemplate tabling one on Report to substitute &#147;restoring the environment&#148; for &#147;protecting the environment&#148;. I am particularly alert to this problem because &#147;protecting the environment&#148;, in the end, could be interpreted by the courts to mean protecting what is left of the environment after the damage has been done.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09030343000005"></a>I invite the Minister, between now and Report, to reflect on whether Clause 88 needs tightening up and to look at the monitoring powers of the MMO to make sure that the best possible efforts are made not to let the damage start in the first place.</p>

I certainly undertake to look at this matter in the light of what has been discussed in this debate. The basis on which the enforcement provisions are put before the Committee is that we want a preventive approach. The noble Lord was not in his place when I drew parallels with the Health and Safety Executive. It is always rather foolhardy of me to draw such parallels, but I believe that most of its work is at the preventive end; enforcement comes only where it is absolutely necessary. If we are going to be successful, we will need early intervention to ensure that the marine environment is protected as effectively as possible.</p>

<a name="90303-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09030343000007"></a>I hear what the noble Lord says about subsections (8) and (9). Subsection (8) describes what &#147;remedial steps&#148; means. I take the meaning to be restoration as far as possible and that it has to take place within the context of the purposes mentioned in subsection (9). The reason for that can be found in Clause 66(1), which sets the overriding context. The noble Lord, with all his experience, said that he thinks that there may be a risk that we have not got this as tight as possible, so I shall take it back and have a further look at it.</p>

Clause 95 contains a great deal of detail, which we recognise as being necessary on this subject. It spells out in considerable detail precisely in what circumstances what types of functions can be delegated and, implicitly, to whom. We suggest a simple addition at the end of the clause:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a><a name="09030343000057"></a>&#147;The appropriate licensing authority may at any time revoke, suspend or amend an order made under this section&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030343000043"></a>The Government may say that that is implied but, frankly, it is better spelt out in the Bill. It is extremely important because, as I am sure all Members of the Committee will agree, this Bill, once enacted, will have to stand for a long time. It will have to move, to some extent, with the times and it will have to be sufficiently flexible to ensure that all those given responsibilities under the Bill have the powers that are needed to keep up with what could be a changing situation. The tide will come in and the tide will go out. In those circumstances it seems essential to spell out that the authority concerned should have, as part of its powers, the opportunity and the responsibility to revoke, suspend or amend an order made under the delegation arrangements. It is as simple as that. This is a tidying-up suggestion and I hope that the Minister will see fit to include it, because we believe that it would complete this clause and make it watertight.</p>

If the appropriate licensing authority is allowed to delegate functions relating to marine licensing, it is equally important that these powers are not alienated beyond control. The appropriate licensing authority must ultimately be in command and so must be able to revoke the delegation of its powers. Can the Minister tell us whether he agrees with the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and can he explain in more detail how he envisages the process of delegation and revocation of powers working? Does he agree that it might be useful to have the process set out in the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09030343000014"></a>Clause 95 provides the appropriate licensing authority, as defined by Clause 110, with the power to delegate any of its licensing functions by order to another person or body, referred to as the &#147;delegate&#148;. There are a limited number of functions that the licensing authority cannot delegate which involve the production of orders or regulations. These remain the preserve of the ministerial authority and are listed in subsection (6). Additionally, a delegate cannot subsequently delegate the licensing and enforcement functions to another body. This is specifically prevented by subsection (6)(g).</p>

<a name="90303-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09030343000015"></a>Subsection (2) provides for the order-making power to confer directly on a person the powers to impose fixed and variable monetary penalties that it may otherwise confer by virtue of an order under Clauses 90 or 92. That is drafted in such a way as to accommodate the different approaches that each of the UK Administrations is taking towards the exercise of their licensing and enforcement functions. The approach that we have taken to delegation provides the flexibility not only to accommodate the different approaches but also to change them in the future without the need for amending the Bill.</p>

<a name="90303-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09030343000016"></a>I understand why the noble Lord tabled his helpful amendment, but we do not think that it is necessary. Parliament has already legislated to the same effect in the Interpretation Act 1978. Section 14 of that Act states that, unless the contrary intention appears, a power to make regulations is exercisable in the same manner and subject to the same conditions or limitations to revoke, amend or re-enact any instrument made under that power.</p>

<a name="90303-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09030343000017"></a>In relation to &#147;suspend&#148;, the Bill aims to increase certainty for developers and users of the marine environment. Suspending an order delegating functions to the delegate&#151;the MMO in the case of England&#151;would lead to a period of great uncertainty for applicants and a hiatus in processing licence applications. Applications currently in the pipeline or under consideration could not be progressed. It is unlikely that the licensing authority would have the operational capacity and expertise to pick up where the delegate left off. Clause 97 creates a power of direction that will enable the licensing authority to instruct any delegate in the performance of its functions, which the delegate must comply with by virtue of Clause 97(3). This is an appropriate mechanism for controlling the performance of the delegate when exercising its licensing functions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09030343000018"></a>The noble Lord raised a substantive point and I know that he is seeking to give clarity to readers of the legislation. However, because this is covered by the Interpretation Act, we think that it is quite clear. The

She will know that the Government always consider carefully recommendations from the Delegated Powers Committee. Government Amendment A372 in Clause 306 addresses the recommendations of the Delegated Powers Committee where the order contains civil sanctions, which is the point that it raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09030343000021"></a>Your Lordships may wonder why we specify &#147;nano&#148;&#151;would that not fall under the chemical regime? I do not believe it does. The regulatory regime as it stands does not cover nanosubstances; indeed, back in 2005 Defra showed foresight in commissioning the Central Science Laboratory to undertake a scoping study into the manufacture and use of nanomaterials in the UK. The development of these materials is very quick, while our regulatory and legislative response is very slow in comparison. Defra recognised the urgency of this; as the Minister will remember, in 2006 Defra&#146;s R&amp;D budget suffered a serious number of reductions, but nanotechnology research received an exemption from the moratorium that year. I do not have the latest research figures&#151;perhaps the Minister will tell me&#151;but I think that it was intended last year that &#163;450,000 would be spent on research in this field. I would be grateful if the Minister would update us on where that research has got to.</p>

<a name="90303-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09030343000022"></a>Why is this important for the marine environment? Nanomaterials have a completely different way of being toxic to the ecosystem from the substances from which they come. One of the examples that I could give of where a substance has a different form in its larger life, so to speak, is silver, which is a well known substance. When you reduce it to its &#147;nano&#148; form, it performs a completely different function. We will probably all be using it in our washing machines in the next decade or so, as apparently it is one of the ways that you can clean things. I will not go into much more detail on that now.</p>

<a name="90303-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09030343000023"></a>The ecotoxicity of any material such as silver when used in that way is something that we should be concerned about with regard to the marine environment. If it is used in a washing machine, for example, it will go out into the water course, through the sewer system and eventually into the marine environment, where it could bioaccumulate in fish, in shellfish or in anything. We do not know what the effect of that will be, nor what the effect on us will be of eating those fish or shellfish when we are lucky enough to do that. I do not want to be alarmist, as there may be no ill effects at all; I am simply saying that at the moment we do not know the effects.</p>

<a name="90303-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09030343000024"></a>I realise that the clause containing this is very specific and is really talking about oil spills and so on. Equally, though, nanotechnology may have lots of applications in that area. I am not sure that the Bill as drafted would cover these substances, because it refers to &#147;chemicals&#148;&#151;nanoparticles may well be not chemical but mineral, although they have been re-engineered to produce a quite different effect, such as accumulating in shellfish, as I have explained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09030343000025"></a>The amendment probes where the Government have got to in their research and what they have commissioned and received in terms of the aquatic, particularly the marine, environment with regard to this technology, and to check with the Minister if he thinks that the regulatory regime has anticipated the force with which nanotechnology is going to hit it and whether this is a legislative gap that needs to be filled. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_664"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 664</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that may need addressing in the Bill. She is quite right that nanotechnology is certain to have a huge impact on all aspects of our lives in future. Research and development is constantly turning up new uses for and effects of this technology, and it is already making itself felt in those industries connected with the marine sector.</p>

<a name="90303-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09030343000027"></a>The potential of the technology is clear: the new anti-fouling paints that rely on nanotechnology rather than biocides will, hopefully, lead to a significant reduction in the environmental harm done by shipping. However, as the Royal Commission&#146;s report made clear, the dangers are considerably less well understood. It is vital that new products and technologies are properly assessed before being widely implemented. I share the noble Baroness&#146;s concern that the Bill draws too tight a definition around the areas in which the licensing authority can commission further research before considering a licence application. There is also the danger of shooting too far off in the other direction and preventing the application of a new technology because it is impossible to prove that it will be 100 per cent safe in all circumstances.</p>

<a name="90303-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09030343000028"></a>I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response to this amendment in the hope that he will be able to shed some light on the Government&#146;s thinking about the adoption of new and uncertain technologies. The licensing authorities will need to have clear guidance about how rigorous these tests must be before a new product can be considered safe.</p>

<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="09030343000029"></a><b><a name="90303-0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09030343000128"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I will certainly do my best to shed some light, but the noble Lord will appreciate as much as the noble Baroness who moved the amendment that we are discussing some unknown factors here, on which substantial research is still to be carried out. I understand the importance of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, but she will know that the clause enables the licensing authority, at anyone&#146;s request, to perform tests to ascertain the affected substances on the marine environment and to charge for that testing. Substances that she rightly identified as covered by the provision are those that have the purpose of treating oil, chemicals, algae or other living or dead organisms that may foul the surface.</p>

<a name="90303-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09030343000030"></a>The purpose of this clause is that, once tested and found to have an acceptably low impact on the marine environment, approved substances can be added to the exemptions order, meaning that they can be applied in emergency situations without the need for obtaining a marine licence first. The purpose for which these substances are put to use is therefore central to whether or not they should be tested by the licensing authority. To that list the noble Baroness is adding nanosubstances.</p>

<a name="90303-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09030343000031"></a>There are considerable uncertainties about the toxicity, behaviour and effects of nanomaterials in environmental media, and the UK currently has in place a moratorium on the use of these substances and applications for environmental remediation, because we are not certain about their impact. It may be that the future will demonstrate that nanosubstances can indeed be a helpful method for treating chemicals, oil or fouling material on the sea, seabed or structures under Clause 104.  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_665"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 665</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>They would then be classified under one of the terms in subsection (1) as a marine chemical treatment substance, a marine oil treatment substance or a marine surface fouling cleaner. That would allow the licensing authority to test the environmental effects associated with using nanosubstances for those purposes, with a view to exempting them from the need for a marine licence and the deployment in clean-up situations. Anyone who wants to deposit a nanosubstance in the marine environment for non-clean-up or emergency situations should require a marine licence, as they would for any other substance.</p>

<a name="90303-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09030343000032"></a>The noble Baroness sought to press the Government on how far we had got in resolving uncertainties. We are committed to the responsible development of nanotechnologies, and we will work with all interested parties to develop a suitable strategy that addresses both the exploitation of the technologies and the management of any potential risks to which they give rise. There is, however, continuing uncertainty over the properties and behaviour of manufactured nanomaterials, which make it difficult to determine accurately the extent of hazard and exposure. The recently launched second phase of the Environmental Nanoscience Initiative, a jointly funded research programme between the United Kingdom and the United States, aims to improve understanding of the fate and behaviour, ecotoxicology and ecological effects of engineering nanoparticles in environmental systems. The programme aims to develop conceptual modelling scenarios for environmental exposures, thereby identifying critical exposure points. As I have already had criticism this afternoon, in the social science context, on the basis that &#147;holistic&#148; is not entirely acceptable in this House&#151;what does it mean?&#151;I am wilting a little as I describe the nature of this research and the investigation we are carrying out. I am afraid that the House will have to accept these terms from me as I have no others to put in their place.</p>

I accept entirely the noble Baroness&#146;s point that we ought not to close off potentialities, but she will also recognise our anxieties about including in the Bill a specific reference to concepts upon which very substantial research is still necessary, on which the Government have not yet got a firm view and upon which there is still a moratorium on deployment.</p>

If nanotechnology does have such a bearing on possible maritime uses, a specific reference to it, to my mind, would not be out of order in this section and indeed, would very much reflect what the Minister says about potential development in this area.</p>

It is helpful that the Minister has told us that the response will be in late spring, and we look forward to that, because one of the themes of the Royal Commission was that there should be mandatory reporting about this. The Minister did not tell us how much money is being spent at the moment by Defra on research and I would be grateful if he would drop me a line on that between now and Report; nor was there any mention of the research commissioned in the marine area, which would be very interesting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09030343000038"></a>What the Minister did tell us was that there is a moratorium on the use of nanosubstances for environmental remediation, but I am not sure that, in the Bill, the term, &#147;wash-off substance&#148; would actually be covered. That is a bit different from environmental remediation, which is the term used in those other instances. I would want to look at that between now and the Report stage, unless the Minister can assure me that the moratorium does cover wash-off.</p>

The Bill deals with things that are happening at sea and substances that are used at sea, but given that the noble Baroness said that nanosubstances might be classified as a chemical substance, we are also talking about substances that might be washed down into the sea, not necessarily from the marine area. The authorities here would not have any powers to look into these effects.</p>

The complexity of the devolution provisions in this Bill is clearly highlighted in this area. As we have already discussed, not only do we have a multiplicity of licensing authorities based on territorial

<a name="90303-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09030343000042"></a>As my noble friend said earlier, these overlaps cause duplication and risk conflict. Clause 76 specifically acknowledges one area where licences are likely to be duplicated, and the appointment of the devolved Administrations as the appropriate licensing authorities for certain activities in certain areas of the sea will undoubtedly lead to many more. Does the Minister anticipate any degree of conflict between the various bodies involved that is likely to arise when multiple permissions need to be sought? I beg to move.</p>

My understanding is that the Welsh Assembly desires this power and, indeed, that it is a necessary one. I cannot follow the logic of removing it in these circumstances.</p>

I shall respond to it in slightly more careful terms than I might otherwise have done. The noble Lord is right to say that the amendment would prevent Welsh Ministers exercising any marine licensing functions in Wales for the Welsh inshore region when that is what they want to do. I am sure that with his amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, is stimulating the debate for the purposes of clarity and in order to ensure that we have the issues absolutely right between the several authorities involved in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90303-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09030356000003"></a>The licensing arrangements in Part 4 reflect as far as possible the current devolution of responsibilities for protection of the marine environment, and these are reflected in the arrangements set out in Clause 110. In essence, Scottish Ministers are the licensing authority in the Scottish offshore region; Welsh Ministers in Wales and the Welsh inshore region; the Northern Ireland Department of Environment in Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland inshore region; and the Secretary of State everywhere else. There are a number of reserved matters, activities relating to which will remain licensable by the Secretary of State even in areas that would otherwise have a different licensing authority.</p>

<a name="90303-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09030356000004"></a>Let me reiterate a point that I and, I am sure, my noble friend Lord Hunt have made before: it is not the intention of this Bill to renegotiate the devolution settlement. Where devolved Administrations currently have environmental protection functions under Part II of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, these have been preserved by the arrangements as laid down in this part. Clause 110 sets out these arrangements by defining the appropriate marine licensing authority accordingly.</p>

<a name="90303-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09030356000005"></a>I shall have some difficulty in convincing the Committee on this point, but the Bill does not make the arrangements more complicated so far as environmental protection is concerned. Scotland and Northern Ireland have  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_670"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 670</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legislative competence for marine environmental protection in their territorial waters. Scotland has decided to exercise this legislative competence and is producing its own Scottish marine Bill for the Scottish inshore region. Northern Ireland has decided not to produce its own Bill and is therefore brought within the scope of this Bill. That is why there is a difference between them.</p>

<a name="90303-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09030356000006"></a>Wales does not have legislative competence here and is therefore subject to the provisions of this Bill, which reflects, as far as possible, the existing executive devolution arrangements in the marine area. As I said, the arrangements primarily mean that in the Scottish offshore region, Scottish Ministers are the licensing authority; in the Welsh inshore region, Welsh Ministers are the licensing authority; in the Northern Ireland inshore region, the Northern Ireland Department of Environment is the licensing authority, and everywhere else it is the Secretary of State. But of course the licensing authority is also dependent on the type of activity being undertaken, and as the Committee will readily appreciate, there are reserved matters. Oil and gas are reserved, and the issuing of marine licences is also reserved in all areas except for the Northern Ireland inshore region. The Secretary of State is therefore responsible for issuing all marine licences for activities relating to oil and gas matters, except in the Northern Ireland inshore region where they will be issued by the Department of Environment, Northern Ireland. Defence matters are also reserved&#151;they are &#147;excepted&#148; in Northern Ireland&#151;and therefore the Secretary of State is responsible for issuing marine licences anywhere in UK waters for activities relating to defence.</p>

<a name="90303-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09030356000007"></a>I hope it will be appreciated that the Bill follows clearly the pattern of the agreed settlement on devolved matters. All the devolved Administrations are committed to the licensing reforms in this Bill, and we have worked closely with them in developing this legislation. We have to reflect the nature of the devolution settlement and the respective powers of the Administration, which is what the Bill does and why the provisions are different for Wales and Scotland.</p>

Under the devolution settlement, Scotland has full powers in the Scottish inshore area. However one of the things that is exercising me is mineral extraction. Under the FEPA regulations the Scottish Executive will have powers at the planning level in the Scottish offshore area, but will they have powers over the actual mineral extraction in that area? Perhaps the Minister would like to come back to me on that point.</p>

The Bill concerns the marine arrangements for above the surface of the sea bed. Extraction from the sea bed is not devolved and the Scottish authorities do not have powers for extraction, because that is a reserved position. In this legislation we are discussing not what lies below the sea bed but the marine environment above the sea bed, if I can put it in such crude terms.</p>

I would scarcely be doing so if we were to discuss what else lies under the sea bed. I do not think that I am in a position to answer the noble Duke&#146;s question directly at this point and I would not want to mislead the Committee. I will write to him and make sure that Members of the Committee know the position. However, he will appreciate that the extraction from the sea bed of the key mineral of coal is clearly not a devolved matter.</p>

The issue of dredging does not really come into it. Dredging is not excavation from below the sea bed in quite that form but the clearing of channels, not with a view to extraction but to make navigable the harbours. It is therefore under a different provision and relates to the clauses governing harbour authorities. I will have to write on the other point because I do not have a definitive answer on other minerals. I hope that the amendment can be withdrawn on that basis.</p>

It might interest the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, to know that I mentioned in another situation the huge helpfulness of his team in another department in producing the maps and all the rest of it.

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09030356000016"></a>We now start on an important part of the Bill: nature conservation, particularly marine conservation zones. This group contains 10 more amendments in it in addition to ours. It is inevitable that, at this stage, there will be a bit of what people call a Second Reading debate on nature conservation and nature conservation zones, although we hope that it does not go on for too long. Most of the Liberal Democrat amendments to this part are in the name of my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, who is a person of considerable distinction in this area. I have added my name to her amendments to give them the imprimatur of being the official Liberal Democrat amendments in this section. The fact that she is sitting a few Benches behind me is not to be taken as in any way significant. I thank her for her work as part of our team on this part.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09030356000017"></a>For many people, this part of the Bill is its raison d&#146;être. The setting up of the Marine Management Organisation, the new planning and licensing systems, the new regulation of fisheries and the other things in the Bill are all in general a good thing. A consolidation and review of the legislation in these areas, and, indeed, in the case of the planning system, the setting up of a completely new system, are all things that are very much required. However, for many people the purpose of all these other different provisions is to satisfy the need to stop the decline and degradation of the marine environment and marine ecosystems around our shores. That is what the Bill is all about. So Part 5 is at the very heart of the Bill, as is a consideration of how all this can be achieved while reconciling all the other important interests in the marine environment.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09030356000018"></a>When we talk about marine conservation zones, we are really challenging the Government to tell us how serious they are about setting up the network of conservation zones, how they will work and what their commitment is to them&#151;the number, size and scale of them. There will no doubt be debates about whether the proportion will be 30 per cent or more or less, and what that means and whether it is relevant; their location, the type of areas they will be in and the type of environment where they will be designated; the nature of the regulation regime in the conservation zones; and whether there will be a different regime in different zones and different degrees of intensity of environmental regulation and control in the different zones.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09030356000019"></a>Those are crucial factors that run through all the amendments in this group and through the majority of the amendments to this part of the Bill and the timetable. Our Amendment A120 challenges the Government to say whether they are going to have at least a satisfactory initial network of marine conservation zones set up by the end of 2012, which is a significant date because of European obligations. This and the other amendments in the group, and much of the debate that we will be having on this part, are about how committed the Government are to a system of marine conservation around our shores that will not only look good when the Bill is finally turned into an Act but will work in practice. With those general introductory remarks, I look forward to the other amendments in the group, which come from all around the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

He arrives at an auspicious moment. As he says, we are now at the heart of the Bill. These amendments address an important aspect of what the Bill is about. This group addresses an enormously wide range of topics. Our amendment in this group addresses merely one aspect of marine conservation zones: the question of by when they will be established.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09030356000021"></a>As we know, the Government have already indicated in their marine programme plan that they are aiming to receive recommendations in 2011 and so designate in 2012, as does Amendment No. 120, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. Our amendment would likewise firm up that intention and place it in the Bill. Three years does not seem an overly onerous timetable for the development and designation of a network of marine conservation zones, especially as the early work of establishing the consultation panels and so on is by all accounts under way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09030356000022"></a>Other amendments in this group address whether there is a duty on the Government to ensure that the MCZs establish a network, or whether it is just another intention. I, too, hope that the MCZs will be designated from the first instance with an ecologically coherent, ecosystem-based network in mind. A scattergun approach in the initial stages would be counterproductive, resulting in time-consuming and distracting reviews and adjustments to the objectives and boundaries of zones. It would result also in ongoing confusion among the wider public. The finer detail of what comprises an ecologically coherent network will change over time as scientific research continues and more information is gathered. However, will the Minister confirm that the Government and the conservation body being charged with the responsibility for organising the consultation panels have at least a working model of what they are seeking to achieve?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09030356000023"></a>The helpful briefings on the Bill which Defra has provided show a worrying vagueness about what a network might mean in different circumstances. This Chamber is rightly proud of its commitment to probing not just the intentions of government but also the consequences of drafting. I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to calls for the definition of &#147;network&#148; to be more fully defined in the Bill.</p>

The amendments grouped with Amendment A118 cover some of the ground touched on by the grouping of Amendment A114. I am interested also in a later clause, Clause 119, to which Amendment A157 has been tabled and which covers much the same ground. Perhaps I may say a few words about networks, because it seems convenient to take in the matter here, although I recognise that the same issues are raised, albeit with slight variations, in other parts of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09030356000025"></a>In one of its briefings on the draft Marine Bill, the Wildlife Trusts urged that, in its final form, the Bill should,</p>

<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_675"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 675</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09030356000085"></a>That point has already been made in earlier debates by my noble friend Lord Kingsland and others. It was strongly supported by the Joint Committee on the draft Bill, which stated on page 54 of its report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_125"></a><a name="09030356000110"></a>&#147;We support the opportunity for at least some MCZs, particularly where they are highly protected, to be designated areas to improve our scientific understanding both of the marine environment and of the effects of human activities on marine biodiversity&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030356000086"></a>Although science has moved a long way in recent years, I am sure that scientists in this sector would be the first to agree that there is still a great deal to be learnt. Our knowledge of marine ecosystems is still developing.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09030356000026"></a>The existing highly protected areas of our marine life cover a very small part of the world&#146;s oceans. Marine reserves where all fishing is prohibited are few and far between. I was very impressed, as I think I have mentioned previously to noble Lords, by the book by Professor Callum Roberts called <I>The Unnatural History of the Sea</I>, published in 2007. If noble Lords have not had the opportunity to read it, I strongly recommend it; it is absolutely fascinating. I take this opportunity to quote briefly from page 374. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_126"></a><a name="09030356000111"></a>&#147;The twentieth century heralded an escalation in fishing intensity that is unprecedented in the history of the oceans, and modern fishing technologies leave fish no place to hide. Today, the only refuges from fishing are those we deliberately create. Unhappily, the sea trails far behind the land in terms of area and quality of protection given&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030356000087"></a>Later, referring to protection on land, the book says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_127"></a><a name="09030356000112"></a>&#147;Twelve per cent of the world&#146;s land is now contained in protected areas, whereas the corresponding figure for sea is but three-fifths of 1 per cent. Worse still, most marine protected areas allow fishing to continue. Areas off-limits to all exploitation cover something like one five-thousandth of the total area of the world&#146;s seas&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030356000088"></a>That, as noble Lords will recognise, is a very small proportion of what should be in place and what we hope the Bill will help to come into place. The small degree of protection now granted to fish was highlighted simply and straightforwardly by the Wildlife Trusts in its briefing for the draft Marine Bill, in which it said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_128"></a><a name="09030356000113"></a>&#147;If only 0.001% of the UK&#146;s land area were protected, that would equate to a single nature reserve the size of Kensington Gardens&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030356000089"></a>That is the area that is now being protected for our marine animals, which highlights what a mass of work there is to be done and, therefore, arising out of that work, what a lot there will be to be learnt.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09030356000027"></a>The Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans highlighted the need to have protected areas in a network of reasonably close proximity, so that not only fish but also larvae and eggs can move from one to the other, which is very important. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_129"></a><a name="09030356000114"></a>&#147;In a marine reserve network, young and adults travelling out of one reserve may end up being protected in another reserve. Marine reserve networks provide more protection than a set of individual, unconnected reserves&#148;.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09030356000028"></a>As was highlighted in the Marine Information Network&#146;s briefing of February of this year, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution emphasised in 2004 the importance of designating areas as marine conservation zones to improve our scientific understanding both of the marine environment and of the effects of human activities on marine biodiversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09030356000029"></a>The great goal for which we should all aim and in whose achievement I hope that we will be helped through the medium of this Bill will be the establishment of fully protected areas which enable fish to grow in size and, as a result of that, to increase the rate of production and quantity of eggs laid, so helping to preserve the species, which otherwise will not happen. I am worried that we are limiting ourselves to the 12-mile zone. It looks to me as though the EU is dictating the course of future events, rather than our own national Government and Parliament. We should be going at least 30 miles out or even further, to 200 miles out into the oceans, to ensure proper protection for marine life. I hope that the amendments in this group and the next, and to Clause 119, will get a sympathetic hearing from the Minister, whose heart is, I know, in the right place, and that he will see that the Bill has the imperative written into it of establishing a network of marine control zones.</p>

<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="09030356000030"></a><b><a name="90303-0010.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09030356000139"></a>Baroness Young of Old Scone:</b> I shall speak to the amendments in my name in this group: Amendments A115 to A117, A119, A149 and A150, and A151 and A152. That sounds like rather a lot, but they achieve only a small number of outcomes. First, I apologise for not being in my place earlier when a number of my amendments came up, and for having to leave immediately after this group. If it is not unparliamentary language, Sod&#146;s Law and multitasking are working against me at the moment. The Minister may be deeply grateful for that: I think he feels that we ought to be moving faster, and the fewer people who contribute to the Bill, the better. The purpose of my Amendments to Clauses 113 and 119 are to make sure that there is a duty to designate marine conservation zones, not just a power&#151;and that, in doing so, an ecologically coherent network is created, not just a network of marine protected areas. I would endorse much of what was said earlier on this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09030356000031"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said, this is the Bill&#146;s centrepiece on conservation. The Government&#146;s response to the Joint Committee&#146;s report proposed that there would be a duty conferred on the Secretary of State and the Welsh Ministers to designate marine conservation zones,</p>
<ul><a name="09030356000117"></a>&#147;in order to contribute to an ecologically coherent network of sites which will include highly protected sites&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030356000090"></a>That commitment appears to have failed on all three counts: there is no duty, the Bill does not mention ecological coherence, and it does not mention the issue of highly protected sites&#151;so it is nought out of three for the Government there. The Bill is a bit ambiguous, as in Clause 113 it refers to a power. I therefore understand that to mean that the slightly stronger wording in Clause 119 only elaborates on how that power is to be exercised; it does not lay a duty to declare and designate marine conservation zones. I hope that the Minister will accept that, since the Command Paper in response to the Joint Committee indicated that would be the case, and that he will give way on some of these amendments.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09030356000032"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Eden, talked about the slightly idiosyncratic groupings. I know that one should comment in advance on groupings, but having arrived in mid-flow I fear I was unable to. However, I believe that my  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_677"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 677</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Amendments A156 and A158 would perhaps have been better grouped with these, because the second objective of my amendments&#151;Amendment A152, in particular&#151;is to elaborate on what an ecologically coherent network of sites might be. There are three parameters. First, the network should be representative, to include the full range of marine features: species, habitats and ecosystems. Secondly, it should embody the principle of replication, meaning that each feature should be represented in a number of sites&#151;so that not all of your eggs, as it were, are in one basket&#151;and that the sites are big enough and ranged widely enough that if there is the risk of damage, for a whole variety of natural and non-natural reasons, it is likely that those species and habitats will, nevertheless, remain protected in some element. Thirdly, on connectivity, the whole principle of having an ecologically coherent network is that it allows species to move between its elements to replicate their natural life cycle, and to allow dispersal, migration and regeneration. Although the Bill mentions representation and replication, it is light on connectivity. My Amendment A158, which is in the next group, would come in there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09030356000033"></a>Amendment A151 is also about the issue of ecological coherence and the types of sites that the network needs to include. As drafted, the list includes marine conservation zones and any European marine sites under the Natura 2000 designation, but omits two important sets of sites: Ramsar sites&#151;I note that the amendment misspells it as &#147;Ransar&#148;&#151;which are protected under the international convention on wetlands, and sites of special scientific interest in marine areas. All of those designated sites ought to be included in the marine conservation zone network to ensure ecological coherence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09030356000034"></a>I have now covered all of those amendments, but I will pass on my regrets&#151;although, in parliamentary terms, I want to misbehave here&#151;that, alas, when my Amendment A135A on socio-economic conditions comes up, I will not be here to speak to it. However, there is no doubt about it; if one were trying to create an ecologically coherent network of sites, simply striking a few out from time to time on the grounds that they are of socio-economic importance will almost certainly mean that we will be in no position to get one. I have now managed to speak to my Amendment A135A, without necessarily having broken the parliamentary conventions of taking it out of order.</p>

He is very welcome and he, in essence, posed the question that was reinforced by the noble Lords, Lord Taylor and Lord Eden, and by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, when he asked whether the Government were serious about this part of the Bill.

<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_678"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 678</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Eden, quoted the Wildlife Trusts: it is a fact that, at a conference last week, the Wildlife Trusts said that the Marine Bill is a pretty damn good Bill. We need to place this in context, and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is absolutely right that this part is the core of what we want to do. We have a vast marine area around the UK. If it remains largely untamed by human endeavour, that should not blind us to the significant impact that human activities are having on the marine environment. Nor will it be untouched by the increasing demands that are likely to be placed upon it.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09030356000037"></a>We need to balance the pressures upon it, if future generations are to enjoy the same benefits that we have, until recently, all taken for granted. The Bill therefore provides a wide range of tools for doing that, some of which we have debated and some of which are yet to come. Measures such as marine planning and licensing, reformed inshore fisheries management and modernising enforcement are essential, but on their own are not enough. We also urgently need to conserve the habitats and species in our seas to ensure that we have resilient ecosystems, and continue to benefit in future from the services that they provide. We need to provide areas of sanctuary for animals and plants where they do not suffer the pressures caused by our use of the sea. That is what Part 5 seeks to do. There is strong consensus and support for the general principles embodied in Part 5, both in Parliament and beyond.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09030356000038"></a>Part 5 sets out a proportionate evidence-based mechanism enabling us to meet the Government&#146;s marine nature conservation aims and objectives for the future. We are quite clear that the powers and duties in this part will help the UK to fulfil its EU and international commitments. Marine conservation zones are a new tool and type of marine protected area, which will help to protect the UK marine area. Marine protected areas are internationally recognised to improve diversity and ecosystem health, protecting or managing activities to prevent damage to habitats, species and ecological processes. Marine conservation zones will therefore be designated for the purpose of conserving marine flora and fauna, marine habitats or types of marine habitat, and features of geological or geomorphological interest.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09030356000039"></a>The UK is already required to establish and manage sites under European legislation, but those European sites, such as special protection areas for birds and special areas of conservation for other species and habitats, collectively known as Natura sites, can be established for only a limited range of marine habitats and species that are important on a European scale. We see the new marine conservation zone mechanism being used to protect a wider range of species and habitats that are important in UK waters. Together, marine conservation zones and other European sites will form part of an ecologically coherent network, which will ensure coherent and appropriate protection throughout the UK marine area. I endorse the comments made by noble Lords about the importance of the network itself.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09030356000040"></a>We have reached agreement with the devolved authorities on nature conservation under the Bill. The Secretary of State will designate marine conservation zones in the English inshore region and all offshore waters except those adjacent to Scotland. Scottish  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_679"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 679</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Ministers will designate in Scottish offshore regions, but those designations will be subject to the Secretary of State&#146;s approval, because it is an executive devolution. Welsh Ministers will designate in the Welsh inshore region. The nature conservation provisions do not apply to the Scottish and Northern Ireland inshore regions, which will be regulated under Scottish and Northern Ireland legislation.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09030356000041"></a>Together, marine conservation zones designated by the appropriate authorities in the devolved Administrations will form part of an ecologically coherent network. Clearly we do not want marine protected areas to function in isolation, as connectivity between sites will ensure that we have the appropriate level of protection for our seas. I agree entirely with the noble Baroness, Lady Young, and the noble Lord, Lord Eden, on those important points. I say to the noble Lord that the establishment of an ecologically coherent network of marine protected areas is vital in realising the Government&#146;s conservation aims and objectives. That is why Clause 119 places a duty on Ministers to designate marine conservation zones and to do so to contribute to the overall network of sites.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09030356000042"></a>What network of sites will that be? The shape of the network will clearly be driven by the science. We are starting a series of research projects with Natural England and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee on what UK ecological coherence should look like and we will issue further guidance setting out a more detailed definition in the next few months. The perfectly legitimate question to ask, as did the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is what proportion of our seas will be protected by marine conservation zones. We will very much be guided by the work that is starting to be undertaken. I am well aware of the figure of 30 per cent, as was initially suggested in the 25th report from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, which recommended that 30 per cent of UK seas out to 200 nautical miles should be managed as highly protected marine reserves, thus enabling the rebuilding of commercial fish stocks along with damaged marine ecosystems. This management approach, known as the ecosystem-based approach, seeks to protect the marine ecosystem as a whole.</p>

<a name="90303-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09030356000043"></a>The area of the sea that should be protected has not been universally agreed. I hope that noble Lords will not press me further&#151;</p>

The island of Brecqhou&#151;I hope that I have pronounced it right&#151;is part of Sark. Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man are not part of the UK, but are self-governing dependencies of the Crown. The Crown dependencies are not represented in the UK Parliament and UK legislation does not extend to them. In a sense, we have debated devolution matters and the one principle we have stuck to is that the Bill reflects the devolution settlement. I make the same point about the Crown dependencies. However, behind the noble Lord&#146;s rather mischievous intervention, if I may put it that way, is a serious point&#151;that it is as important to work with the Administrations of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as it is with the devolved Administrations. That is the challenge. I will go away and respond to him seriously in relation to how we intend to work with the Isle of Man Administration, if he would be happy with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09030356000055"></a>Before I was so ably interrupted by the noble Lord I was trying to respond to the question of what proportion of the seas would be covered by marine conservation zones. I have already acknowledged the extremely important work of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, which recommended the figure of 30 per cent of the seas. I hope I will not be pressed any further on this matter. I cannot give, and I think it would be wrong for me to give, a figure tonight. However, in accordance with Section 119, we have already started a series of research projects with Natural England and the JNCC on what UK ecological coherence should look like. Under the Bill, Ministers will be required to report regularly to Parliament on progress in designating the network, starting in 2012. Those reports must include the extent to which the network has been achieved. There is clear accountability and a reporting mechanism. I re-emphasise that marine conservation zones will be identified using the best available scientific evidence but the Secretary of State will be able to consider the social and economic consequences of designations. Later amendments deal with that particular matter.</p>

Surely that derogates from the purity of the scientific criteria that should be honoured in this case.</p>

Clearly, the science informs the work that would be undertaken towards the designation of marine conservation zones. The Secretary of State must have regard to a number of factors in marine conservation zone designation and they may include social and economic considerations. That surely is important if we are to ensure that we minimise the impact on society and maximise potential synergies. Let me give the example of an area that contains features that are rare, threatened or declining or which form what might be called a biodiversity hotspot. In coming to a judgment about whether designation should

However, there might be a choice of alternate areas which are equally suitable on ecological grounds for designation but, in that case, socio-economic factors might be more significant in deciding which areas may be designated as a marine conservation zone. I clearly understand where the noble Lord is coming from. However, there is a balance throughout this Bill, and social and economic considerations must also come into play, just as they come into play in any definition of &#147;sustainable development&#148;. We will come to this later.</p>

I am getting confused between marine conservation zones and marine reserves. Is it the case that there will be marine reserves within marine conservation zones and that the marine reserves will be fully protected and that no fishing and no intrusion, whether for social or economic factors, are allowed to take place?</p>

<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="09030356000059"></a><b><a name="90303-0011.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09030356000152"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> The noble Lord raised the question of what has been described as highly protected marine reserves. This term has been used by a range of organisations to mean a number of things. My understanding is that, in general, &#147;highly protected marine reserves&#148; equates, as he implied, to what are described as no-take zones where all licensable fishing activities are restricted. Some organisations have called for such no-take zones to conserve depleted fish stocks, while others have focused on the need to preserve the seabed and habitat features. When it comes to a marine conservation zone, the level of protection that would be given to any site would be determined by the features we wish to protect and the evidence we have available. We have flexibility within the designation of a marine conservation zone to place whatever level of protection necessary for a site without having to have another description or designation or a special category of highly protected marine reserves.</p>

<a name="90303-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09030356000060"></a>It is perfectly possible for the kind of reserve that the noble Lord suggests to be embraced within a marine conservation zone. There is a requirement in the Bill for the Secretary of State to report on the number of marine conservation zones designated where any licensable marine activity has been restricted and the taking of animals or fishing has been prohibited. This is intended to encompass sites which will have a high level of protection, but there will be other marine conservation zones where it does not occur. There is sufficient flexibility within the Bill to designate some marine conservation zones in the terms suggested by the noble Lord but others might be applied to totally different situations. The point about socio-economic factors is that the designation of MCZs and the work that will be done to build up submissions as to potential MCZs will be guided by the science and all the factors that the noble Lord raised. There is also a balance here involving socio-economic provisions; that is why we have that provision in the Bill.</p>

The purists would say that we should protect everything, and that that should take priority over any socio-economic factors. I do not think that my noble friend has a copy of the relevant recommendations. Recommendation 54 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_130"></a><a name="09030356000115"></a>&#147;We do not think it is appropriate to place any set percentage for highly protected areas on the face of the Bill. However, we recommend that the Bill sets out the need to establish Highly Protected Marine Reserves, and that their contribution to the overall Marine Protected Areas network and UK biodiversity targets should be reviewed after a stated period of time&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030356000091"></a>If you were thinking literally of biodiversity in its own right, you would not do anything, but, unfortunately, life has to be lived. A question that exercised some of us more than others concerned the feasibility of linking networks together. Some may not be linked in the way that certain people may wish. These difficult decisions will have to be taken in the future. I am trying to reinforce the point that the Minister made. I am reasonably happy with what we have at present.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, is right; this is a complex issue and there is a balance to be drawn. That is why at this stage it is not possible to come up with some of the answers that the Committee wishes. I am afraid that a lot more work, science and research need to be done before we can be sure about these matters. This is a new development for this country and there will have to be&#151;I am not sure that I should use the phrase &#147;trial and error&#148;&#151;learning as we go along.

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09030356000064"></a>Her Amendments A115, A116, A117, A119, A149 and A150 all seek to ensure that there is a strong duty on the Secretary of State to designate a number of marine conservation zones. I reiterate and state clearly that the Government are fully committed to creating a network that will include more than one marine conservation zone, and the Bill requires us to do so. We have learnt the lesson from the past that we need to provide clear measures that are strong enough to meet the Bill&#146;s aims and objectives. We acknowledge&#151;this point was raised in our earlier debates&#151;that the mechanism created by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 was not strong enough, which is why we have included a duty on Ministers to designate sites so that they form part of a network of sites. Clauses 113 and 119 together clearly place a duty on Ministers to exercise the power in Clause 113 to designate sites and, moreover, to contribute to the creation of such a network. I have sought legal advice on this point and it is categorical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09030356000065"></a>Amendment A152, also tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, seeks to insert a reference to the requirement for an ecologically coherent network of sites. Again, I

Subsection (3) sets out three design principles, as developed for the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which should underpin a coherent network of marine protected areas. We have worked hard to learn more about the marine environment and, as I said earlier, we clearly have some way to go. Ecological coherence and the definition of the UK network will be evolving concepts. So, here again, it is important that we do not fully define this legally in the Bill. We are looking to provide guidance in our draft marine protected area strategy, to be published for consultation around Easter. This will reflect the Government&#146;s thinking on what the network will look like. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, suggested, this is an evolving concept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09030356000066"></a>On Amendment A151, the noble Baroness, Lady Young, would be glad to know that I think her suggestion about Ramsar sites and sites of special scientific interest is helpful.

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09030356000067"></a>Amendments A114, A120 and A124&#151;to which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, spoke some time ago&#151;seek to insert in the Bill a timetable for designating a network of marine protected areas. We have specifically not included a timetable as we are worried that even requiring an initial network to be designated by 2012 would create a perverse incentive on appropriate authorities to compromise on designations or conservation objectives, and would risk leading to the designation of a sub-optimal network. A timetable in the Bill could also apply an end point in developing the network when, in fact, it will be subject to monitoring, review, amendment and, I am sure, improvement beyond 2012. I make it clear that the network of marine conservation zones designated by the end of 2012 will not be a fixed or static one because the marine environment is highly dynamic. Of course, the network will evolve after 2012 and even after 2020 as pressures on our marine environment change and develop. The important point about 2012 is that Clause 120 requires Ministers to report to Parliament on progress starting in 2012 and at least every six years thereafter. I see that report highlighting the achievement of precisely the type of initial network that these amendments seek to deliver. The report will not only provide details of designated marine conservation zones, including details on the level of protection, but will include any further steps that could be taken to achieve a network of conservation sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09030356000068"></a>Amendment A160 requires Ministers to define how they will comply with EU or international law in carrying out their duty to designate marine conservation zones in Clause 119. I have already referred to links between marine conservation zones and European sites. Indeed, that is why we have included Clause 119(4) in the Bill. This requires the appropriate authority to have regard to any obligations under EU and international

However, whether or not it is mentioned in the Bill, the UK is bound by these agreements and is committed to meeting them. The normal way for the UK to define how it will comply with EU legislation is through the process of consultation and policy development with which Members of the Committee are familiar. This has started for the marine strategy framework directive. Inevitably, we will ensure that our Bill and the implementing legislation are consistent with each other.</p>

<a name="90303-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09030356000069"></a>We do not think that it is necessary to write the requirement of 2012 into the Bill. Under the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international fora, our commitments demonstrate our undertaking to achieve the designation of the network, which will also include European sites by 2012. As I have said, that is just a start. This has been a lengthy debate, but it is on the start of Part 5, which many Members of the Committee think is the most important part of this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09030356000070"></a>I know that we will discuss amendments on some of the detail. I hope I have assured the Committee that within the context, as the noble Baroness has said so wisely, of considerable work still to be undertaken on the designation&#151;we have to do the science and the research&#151;the Government also consider this to be at the core of the Bill. We are committed to the designation of marine conservation zones and absolutely understand the need for coherence of networks. I hope that Members of the Committee will feel that, in responding to the amendments, I have answered the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on how serious we are. The issue is very serious.</p>

That will set out some general principles in which further work will need to be undertaken. The research mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, will also very much have a bearing on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09030356000075"></a>The noble Baroness asked a number of questions. First, will we carry people in the devolved Administrations? The discussions held in the past few months have been very warm. My understanding is that we are working closely together on research. Secondly, the noble Baroness asked when the research will become available. Obviously, there are various research projects with different deadlines, but there is no doubt that we hope to have more detailed information coming from some over the next few months. If it would be helpful, I am happy to write to Members of the Committee with an outline of all the research being undertaken and when projects are likely to be completed. That is as far as I can go on the designation of sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09030356000078"></a>Perhaps I may anticipate what the noble Baroness, Lady Young, might have said on the duty to designate. The Minister was very clear that the Bill as set out provides a duty to designate these areas. When we think of the training we have had on the use of words such as &#147;may&#148;, &#147;must&#148;, &#147;shall&#148; and so on, it does not read as though there is a duty to designate: it reads as though there is power to designate.

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09030356000081"></a>There was considerable discussion about the need for research, science and decisions on designation to depend on the science. I do not think that any of us disagree with that, which was put very eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Eden. But there are two stages to a decision based on research and science. There can be research and science, and different policies can be applied to that research and science with different outcomes. The policies do not come from objective investigation; they come from Governments, politicians and other people who are engaging in the debate. We want the science in order to know what is there and in order for the people designated by the Secretary of State to make sensible decisions. We also want to know the policies that would be applied to that science. This is the area of debate. This is not just a technical matter; it is also a policy matter. The Minister referred to being guided by the science and balance, which is fine, but what criteria will be used to guide and what are the criteria for where the balance lies?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09030356000082"></a>Perhaps I may throw one further thing into the pot which I think will be helpful. Before this Bill is passed by Parliament, more clarity will be needed on what the outcomes are likely to be. I do not think that we expect to see a map with a designation of marine conservation zones or anything like that, but we want a much clearer idea of what the system will look like on a broad scale. Scale is very important here. Taking the British seas as a whole, I believe that the Government can give a much clearer idea of the expected outcome, not in detail&#151;say, 30 or 35 per cent or whatever&#151;but on a broad scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09030356000083"></a>When it comes to detail, every site has to be looked at on its own merits, and it may well be, on the basis of the science, that one site is more valuable than a second site. The second site might be chosen above the first site because of other factors. If the first site is needed for commercial purposes and there seems to be no alternative, that may be the answer. However, if that is the case and it is being heavily used for commercial purposes now, the odds are that it will in any case be pretty degraded. Even so, there may well be sites of equal value and, at a detailed level, one will be chosen and another will not. However, that does not stop the Government trying to give us a better picture, or vision, of what the system will look like at the end of the process.</p>

In a sense, we are back to the old problem that we always have with legislation&#151;that is, on the one hand, what the words say in the Bill and, on the other, what the Government&#146;s intentions are. When we look at legislation, we are always being asked to believe that the Government have good intentions, that everything in the world is wonderful and that the legislation is going to work. One of our jobs is to ensure that it will happen, even if there is a change of Government. I must be careful what I say, given possible changes of Government, but

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09030365000002"></a>On 19 November 2001, I brought a team of scientists to give oral evidence to the Select Committee on Stem Cell Research. In our joint submission we said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030365000057"></a>&#147;it is now abundantly clear that adult stem cell research shows more clinical promise than embryonic stem cell research&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09030365000033"></a>and that it holds none of the moral dilemmas or hazards. After years of pouring resources into embryonic stem cells, one small glimmer of hope came, just a year ago, when &#163;0.6 million was offered to existing Medical Research Council grant-holders to support small projects with induced pluripotent stem cells&#151;iPS cells. Despite Professor Shinya Yamanaka&#146;s seminal paper published in Japan almost three years ago, nobody in Britain had hitherto published any work in this area. For too long, we have been stuck in a blind alley.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09030365000003"></a>The wisdom of the MRC&#146;s 2008 investment was illustrated by the announcement on Sunday last that Dr Keisuke Kaji at the University of Edinburgh and a colleague from Toronto have been among the first to get human skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells without needing to use viruses, and with the introduced genes successfully removed after reprogramming. As the MRC says on its website, research teams now state that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030365000058"></a>&#147;their discovery could ultimately spell an end to the need for human embryos as a source of stem cells&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030365000034"></a>I emphasise that statement. Bearing in mind the endless days that we spent last year being told that work with animal-human hybrid embryos was of paramount importance, it is also worth noting that in January the Medical Research Council turned down at least the first two applications for hybrid embryos as not worth funding. We should not be surprised by that. As long ago as July 2005, an editorial in <I>Nature Biotechnology</I> admitted:</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_689"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 689</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_131"></a><a name="09030365000047"></a>&#147;Of course, it will be many more years before cloned ES cells can be turned into routine clinical treatments for patients&#148;.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09030365000004"></a>It went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_132"></a><a name="09030365000048"></a>&#147;Meanwhile, forward steps continue to be made in the field of adult stem cell therapy. One estimate is that there are currently over 80 therapies and around 300 clinical trials underway using such cells&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030365000035"></a>I repeat: 80 therapies and 300 clinical trials. Three years later, we still have no stem cells at all from cloned human embryos, never mind &#147;routine clinical treatments&#148; based on cloning. This sharply contrasts with the burgeoning number of treatments using adult stem cells.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09030365000005"></a>So, to what extent has government funding for stem cell research over recent years been an accurate reflection of what is currently benefiting patients? In a press release on 13 September 2007, the Medical Research Council announced that it would be providing a total of &#163;760,000 in funding specifically so that women at Newcastle would receive financial inducements to provide their eggs for cloning. This sponsored egg-bartering in order to create and destroy embryos was already highly questionable on multiple ethical grounds. However, I found it all the more baffling in the light of the oral evidence given to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee by the chief executive of the MRC earlier that same year, when he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_133"></a><a name="09030365000049"></a>&#147;I find it difficult to see how anyone can be saying that the correct way forward is just to push on with the use of human oocytes, given the virtually zero success rate&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09030365000036"></a>I repeat: the virtually zero success rate&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09030365000059"></a>&#147;in using that technique, at least for somatic nuclear transfer, so far&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030365000037"></a>Given that the chief executive of the MRC expressed such strong doubts about human cloning with eggs from women, why on earth did he and the MRC then take the extraordinary step of sanctioning the effective purchase of women&#146;s eggs at Newcastle &#147;as an exceptional case&#148;? If this is an exceptional case, what have been the exceptional benefits of this research? Perhaps the Minister, when he comes to reply, can tell us.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09030365000006"></a>The House should contrast this approach with the work of Professor Geoffrey Raisman, director of the Spinal Repair Unit at the University College London Institute of Neurology. He leads a research team whose work could ultimately lead to the repair of spinal cord injuries in humans. An estimated 40,000 people in the UK live with spinal cord injuries, and his team&#146;s work offers significant hope that such patients will eventually be able to regain much lost movement and even the restoration of the lost ability to breathe unaided. He has been working for well over a decade on a method for the repair of spinal cord injuries by transplantation of cells cultured from the upper part of the adult nasal lining. This approach is similar to that already used by Dr Carlos Lima of Portugal&#151;I hosted a meeting on his behalf in the Moses Room of your Lordships&#146; House a couple of years ago&#151;to treat individual patients with spinal cord injuries that occurred between six months and six years previously. I might add that Dr Lima has never used human embryos to facilitate his work.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09030365000007"></a>It is worth noting that Professor Raisman&#146;s pioneering work remains underfunded. He told me that his work with adult stem cells is,</p>
<ul><a name="09030365000060"></a>&#147;struggling month by month to survive&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030365000038"></a>In addition to inadequate funding, he says that to develop further the real promise held out by his research it will also be necessary to support properly regulated clinical trials. He contrasted his approach with that of Geron, which wants to use embryonic stem cells but only in patients who sustained spinal injuries within the previous fortnight. Professor Raisman told me:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_134"></a><a name="09030365000050"></a>&#147;Over 40% of patients who are paralysed when they are admitted to hospital will walk out of the hospital and there are very few indicators to tell you which are the 40% and which will be the 60%. If Geron&#146;s patient trials are to assess the safety of the transplanted cells they should be used with patients who have long-standing injuries&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030365000039"></a>That is precisely what Professor Raisman is himself doing. I hope that the Minister would agree with that view.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09030365000008"></a>Professor Raisman has also expressed concern that the media hype over embryonic research as a coming miracle cure has put adult stem cell research programmes in the shade. These are his words:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_135"></a><a name="09030365000051"></a>&#147;Adult stem cells are much more promising therapeutically; they are already in use for such things as skin grafting, but they attract less funding and much less interest because they can&#146;t be patented&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030365000040"></a>The use of patents is an issue that we need to think very carefully about, given that they can be used to create commercial success for companies such as Geron, whereas adult stem cells do not carry the same kind of commercial benefit.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09030365000009"></a>Unlike some proponents of embryonic stem cells, Professor Raisman certainly does not want to raise false hopes for desperate patients. Although his work has shown so much promise for more than a decade, he told me:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_136"></a><a name="09030365000052"></a>&#147;I can&#146;t guarantee success, we are climbing a high mountain but this is a realistic approach&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030365000041"></a>Although he is himself agnostic on questions about the status of the human embryo, he believes that human embryonic research holds back medical progress by attracting funds that might otherwise go to adult stem cell work. These are his words:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_137"></a><a name="09030365000053"></a>&#147;The scramble to fund human embryonic stem cell experiments looks like the scientific equivalent of sub-prime mortgages. One wonders how long the large sums of money and hype can go on chasing such a distant goal before the bubble bursts ... Patients have for some years been putting ever increasing faith in the curative properties of embryonic stem cells far beyond anything justified by any current knowledge or treatments. The attraction of human embryonic stem cells lies less in their therapeutic than in their imagined commercial potential&#151;but is this justified by the science?&#148;.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09030365000010"></a>Despite that apparent folly, Professor Raisman told me that in contrast with speculative corporations, he remains a scientific idealist. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_138"></a><a name="09030365000054"></a>&#147;No patient that I am privileged to help will ever be charged a penny. My work is not about patents and trying to capitalise or exploit suffering&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030365000042"></a>I put it to him that perhaps the problem was that adult stem cells are seen as having Cinderella status. He disagreed, saying, &#147;No, Cinderella didn&#146;t die of starvation&#148;. That is what he says is happening to adult stem cell research. Surely this is what we should all strive to

Rather than pouring resources into the scientific equivalent of sub-prime mortgages, in Professor Raisman&#146;s striking phrase, our public policy priorities should reflect his enlightened approach.

My interest in adult stem cell research was born out of a terrible accident that happened to the newly married son-in-law of some of my dearest friends. On a moonless night in the Brecon Beacons, while on exercise with the Army, he fell over a cliff and was paralysed.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09030365000012"></a>Some months later, the family read in the newspapers of pioneering research being carried out at UCL by the very professor of whom the noble Lord, Lord Alton, spoke so knowledgeably, Professor Geoffrey Raisman, in which the spinal cord of a rat had been repaired using cells from the nasal cavity. Although Professor Raisman said that there was a long way to go and that he did not wish to raise false hopes in patients living with spinal cord injury, his work indicated that the spinal cord had the ability to repair itself and that the next logical step was human trials. He also said in the article that that work would open the door to treatment of other conditions where nerve fibres are damaged, such as some major forms of stroke, and blindness and deafness caused by nerve injury. With great anticipation, my friends contacted Professor Raisman. His reply shattered their hope. He said that they were a long way from human trials and that he did not even have enough money to buy next year&#146;s rats.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09030365000013"></a>We are nearly four years on from then and I had sincerely hoped that the situation had changed but, listening to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, I realise that it has not. In October last year, one of the UK&#146;s leading authorities on adult stem cell research, Professor McGuckin, who, with his team, pioneered working on stem cells from umbilical cord blood, said that he was leaving to work in France because there is not enough support for his work here.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09030365000014"></a>However, such strides are now being taken in the field. In November, groundbreaking collaborative work by researchers and surgeons across Britain, Italy and Spain gave 30 year-old Claudia Castillo a new section of her windpipe created from stem cells collected from her bone marrow. Several months later, Claudia is apparently fit and well, with no signs of her body rejecting the graft. Professor Martin Birchall at the University of Bristol, who led the team that constructed the windpipe tissue, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_139"></a><a name="09030365000055"></a>&#147;Surgeons can now start to see and understand the very real potential for adult stem cells and tissue engineering, to radically improve their ability to treat patients&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030365000043"></a>The construction of the windpipe makes it now the second organ produced outside the body using stem cells from the patient&#146;s own body.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09030365000015"></a>In 2006, a team from Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina, led by Professor Anthony  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_692"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 692</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Atala, revealed that it had fitted seven children with bladders reconstructed from their own tissue. Professor Atala said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_140"></a><a name="09030365000056"></a>&#147;We have shown that regenerative medicine techniques can be used to generate functional bladders that are durable&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030365000044"></a>He went on to say that that suggests that regenerative medicine may one day be a solution to the shortage of donor organs for those needing transplants.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09030365000016"></a>A number of other early clinical trials around the world involve adult stem cell therapy&#151;for example, for Parkinson&#146;s disease, stroke, heart attack, multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. My father had multiple sclerosis; I suffer from a chronic auto-immune condition; and many of my friends and their families live lives horribly affected by illness. Therefore, I fully understand the desire to find treatments, but I worry that the work in adult stem cells is losing out.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09030365000017"></a>I must make it clear, as part of the opposition Front Bench, although I am speaking from the Back Benches tonight, that I am not asking for more money. I am asking what percentage of moneys available for research into stem cells goes into adult stem cell therapy. At what stage do the powers that be look at the overall picture and, however much may have been invested in embryonic research, including academic pride, say that we need to redress the balance? I am not a scientist, but common sense would seem to say that through adult stem cell research we can make a real difference to patients&#146; lives and we can make it now.</p>

If I may say so, what she had to say was something that we need to ponder carefully.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09030365000019"></a>We have now had long discussions in this House on the subject of human fertilisation and embryology research. One thing that has come through very clearly is that there is a very strong received opinion in the scientific community. I should declare a distant interest as having been once been a Minister for science. I came across that received opinion on a number of other issues of controversy within science. There has now been a sustained received opinion that embryonic stem cell research is more valuable and is likely to prove to be more effective than other kinds of research into stem cells, despite the growing evidence&#151;and it is powerful growing evidence, as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, and the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said&#151;that adult stem cell research is leading to far more effective therapies than are associated with embryonic stem cell research. Indeed, the most recent figure indicates that some 80 effective therapies have come out of the study of adult stem cells, and not a single one, unless the Minister would like to name it, has so far operated at the level of being an effective therapy from embryonic stem cell research.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09030365000020"></a>Why, then, is so much adult stem cell research starved for lack of money? There are two arguments for that. One is what I have already mentioned: the received opinion, widely held in the scientific community in Britain&#151;not outside to the same extent&#151;that this is the right way to go. So strongly held is that opinion that the House will recall that when we discussed  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_693"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 693</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill in 2007, we were pressed to consider and indeed support the idea of research into hybrid embryos as a way of dealing with the chronic shortage of human eggs. So far, research into hybrid embryos has proved a very dead alley indeed. Dr. Lanza, reporting recently with the support of one of the outstanding laboratories in the world, Advanced Cell Technology Inc in Los Angeles, indicated that there was almost no future, apparently, in the use of hybrid cells. To use his words, there was evidence that the use of human oocytes&#151;human embryos&#151;in hybrid connections with animal oocytes&#151;animal embryos&#151;had so far shown no ability to get beyond 16 cells, when it effectively died off.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09030365000021"></a>However, we have pursued it, and one has to ask why the Medical Research Council and other research councils have decided that they will not pursue, too far, the use of hybrid embryos. I think that the answer is clearly given by what the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said. You cannot patent human adult stem cells, recovered from the human himself or herself. They have, of course, the huge advantage of not involving any immune reaction. They are accepted by the body because they come from the same cell structure as the body. Then one has to ask why it has proved so difficult for research laboratories to get the extra expenditure that they need. The evidence is clear: the inability to patent this kind of stem cell research makes it much less attractive to the pharmaceutical profession and the scientific establishment.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09030365000022"></a>I hope that the Government will take my concluding remark into account. I strongly support the question asked of the Minister by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, about what proportion of research money in the past year has gone to adult stem cell research from the research councils and for research overall. Given the astonishing steps being taken in this area of research, one moment&#146;s consideration will tell us that the savings to the National Health Service alone&#151;if adult stem cells prove to be an effective way of dealing with a very wide range of conditions, as is now emerging&#151;would be well into the millions of pounds and possibly beyond. One of the commercial considerations has to be the cost to the taxpayer of this country of sustaining research that requires patents that have to be paid for. That is necessary, and I am not against it; NICE has taken that kind of development into account. But why do we not take advantage of the huge savings that would be made to the National Health Service of research that does not require to be patented and which I would regard as a major benefit to this country and to its citizens? I think that the House has not considered that factor adequately, and I ask the Minister whether he has considered it adequately.</p>

Many of the women would not be able to afford private IVF but would be desperate to have children and would therefore be in a very vulnerable position.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09030365000025"></a>I also admit to being somewhat confused about the purposes of this research as described by the group now receiving substantial MRC funding. As I understand it, the original aim of the cloning licence granted to the group at Newcastle, led by Professor Alison Murdoch, was ostensibly to use patient-matched embryo stem cells to treat people with diseases such as type 1 diabetes. This was clearly stated, for example, in the <I>Lancet</I> in June 2004 and in <I>New Scientist</I> in August 2004. What did not seem to have been addressed, however, was the fundamental question of how cloning could possibly help an auto-immune disease such as type 1 diabetes. Notably, Sir Ian Wilmut, whose father suffered from diabetes, commented that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030365000061"></a>&#147;transfer of immunologically identical cells to a patient is expected to induce the same rejection&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09030365000026"></a>The aim was subsequently revised prior to the granting of a licence by the HFEA instead to use cloning for non-specified therapeutic ends.

However, in an interview broadcast by the BBC after the award of the licence, Professor Murdoch then said that they could use cloning to,</p>
<ul><a name="09030365000062"></a>&#147;make pancreatic cells that make insulin, inject them back into the patient and then effectively that could cure their diabetes&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90303-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09030365000027"></a>When news first broke regarding reports of a cloned human embryo created at Newcastle, Professor Murdoch stated,</p>
<ul><a name="09030365000063"></a>&#147;if you&#146;ve got a child with diabetes who is 10 years old, then I think we are realistically looking at something which will help them in the future ... We&#146;ve shown that it will work in humans. So it is now a realistic option that we will have treatments in the not too distant future&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030365000045"></a>Well, it is perfectly clear that we still have no cure for diabetes from cloning, and it is doubtful in the extreme whether one ever would.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09030365000028"></a>I must be frank: I am appalled that certain people, who have been recklessly raising false hopes such as these, should have been considered as an exceptional case for funding by the MRC. If government funding bodies are interested in developing a cure for diabetes, I would encourage them to invest elsewhere. Promising work has already been performed in this area by Julio Voltarelli and Richard Burt, who used immunosuppression and transplantation of stem cells from the bone marrow of patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. This apparently restored the function of insulin-producing cells in all but one patient, seemingly rendering a majority of the patients insulin-independent. Of course, this is still a preliminary trial, but it would surely seem to have a better chance of truly helping diabetics.</p>

<a name="90303-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09030365000029"></a>There is also the work of Professor Faustman from Harvard, who has used a similar approach in altering the immune system to treat type 1 diabetes successfully in animals. Will the Government consider supporting the funding of similar research and clinical trials for diabetes sufferers in the UK?</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09030365000030"></a>Cloning, however, has been touted as a miracle cure for just about everything from diabetes to Alzheimer&#146;s. For example, in speaking about the purported outcomes of her work, Professor Murdoch of Newcastle told the BBC:</p>
<ul><a name="09030365000064"></a>&#147;it can help just about any condition in which there is lost or damaged cells. Diabetes, Alzheimer&#146;s, Parkinson&#146;s, spinal injuries ... the list is almost endless&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030365000046"></a>How realistic is that? The chance of Alzheimer&#146;s being cured by stem cells was described by Ron McKay, an eminent Scottish stem cell researcher working in America as &#147;a fairy tale&#148;. Similarly, the noble Lord, Lord Winston, previously expressed concern about popular suggestions for treating Alzheimer&#146;s. He said that it was,</p>
<ul><a name="09030365000065"></a>&#147;going to be a hugely difficult problem and probably completely insoluble by stem cells&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90303-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09030365000031"></a>As regards spinal injuries, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has already highlighted the very encouraging work by Professor Raisman, which has seemingly been sorely neglected. Even if there were some genuine benefit to stem cell research from human cloning, this has surely been superseded by advances with iPS cells, such as those which we heard about at the start this week. Cloning research is simply wasting precious resources that would be better spent on genuinely promising and perhaps less ethically compromised research.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09030365000032"></a>Cloning in Newcastle should not have been made an exceptional case for funding by the MRC so that vulnerable women undergoing risky procedures are offered financial inducements, in order to obtain as many eggs as possible for cloning. I strongly encourage the Government to make greater funds available for studies with adult stem cells and clinical trials, so that patients can benefit as soon as possible. I look forward very much to the Minister&#146;s summing up.</p>

<a name="09030368000001"></a><b><a name="90303-0013.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09030368000037"></a>Lord Patten:</b> My Lords, I strongly agree with everything that the right reverend Prelate has said, in particular when he raised the flag of warning against scientific hype, a matter to which I shall return in the three points that I will make.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09030368000002"></a>My first point is a straightforward question to the Minister. It is my perception&#151;which is, perhaps, wrong&#151;that the Government seem deeply biased against promoting and funding research into the use of adult stem cells, which have been producing results, compared to all the money spent on embryonic stem cell research, which has not produced results. I well remember, as will other noble Lords, my discussion across the Chamber with the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, who is not in his place tonight. I asked him to name, in a straightforward way, any successful outcomes from stem cells. The noble Lord was good enough to say that so far he had nothing to report. My perception is that the Government are prejudiced against work on adult stem cells.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09030368000003"></a>Does the Minister, with his distinguished business and City background, not recognise that there can sometimes be a pell-mell and ruthless rush by competitive scientists for funds, matched by equivalent government support for embryonic stem  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_696"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 696</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cell research? There is nothing wrong with competition; I like competition. However, we may&#151;returning to the point that the right reverend Prelate has just made&#151;see the scientific equivalent of a much-hyped asset or stock market bubble, exactly like the heady, but eventually headless, days of the dotcom boom. It is a bubble that will collapse in exactly the same way, having wasted a lot of money. I choose the word &#147;waste&#148; very carefully.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09030368000004"></a>Secondly, I think the ground, in public opinion, is beginning to shift away from the miracle cures of foetal stem cell research. We are just beginning to see the first signs of that change. In the research recently published in <I>Nature</I> by the team from Edinburgh to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred, we begin to see people saying, &#147;Should we not spend our money on something that is pragmatic and real today, rather than much-hyped hope for, perhaps, tomorrow?&#148; Again, the right reverend Prelate pointed this out. Is the Minister aware of just how much recently&#151;and it is only really since Christmas and the new year&#151;commentators&#146; opinions have begun to reflect this sea change in public opinion?</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09030368000005"></a>I do not want to shock any of my noble friends on this side of the House, let alone cause my noble friend Lord Bates any fear that I might be wobbling, but I have recently taken to reading both the <I>New Statesman</I> and the <I>Guardian</I>. I had better &#146;fess up to both. I do this, first, because the <I>New Statesman </I>kindly sends its latest issue to me at the House, totally free each week, so it seems only polite to read it. I did so on 22 January this year, when it opined:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_141"></a><a name="09030368000031"></a>&#147;As the adult cells come from the patient&#146;s own body, the cells are not amenable to the imposition of intellectual property rights ... Both governments and industry (the pharmaceutical industry) are loath to invest or fund unless they can see the prospect of intellectual property rights&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030368000006"></a>Quite so; this is exactly the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, made. The <I>Guardian</I> then stepped into the argument on 2 February, thundering:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_142"></a><a name="09030368000032"></a>&#147;There is no market for the drug companies to exploit, and no market means no commercial funding&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030368000007"></a>It goes on to say that, as a result, these advances in adult stem cells &#147;may founder&#148;. I find myself agreeing with the <I>Guardian</I>.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09030368000008"></a>I end with my third point. I have raised a flag of warning, as did the right reverend Prelate, that we may see a bubble in front of us. I have also suggested that public and press opinion are changing. All Governments respond to this; whether Labour or Tory, we all listen. Thirdly, I remind the Minister that he is not, in the Government, &#147;cloneable&#148;. He is, in the proper sense of the word, in a unique position&#151;because of his own experiences&#151;to understand and deal with this situation and put it right. In the pharmaceutical world, the Minister has a notably distinguished record as someone who, with his scientific background, promoted the growth of a highly successful company, which did a lot of good for patients. I congratulate him on that. My City colleagues tell me that the company made excellent profits and repaid both investors and management handsomely, which was richly deserved. I applaud everything that the Minister has done.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09030368000009"></a>However, I understand that the advances made in his companies depended on the patentability of intellectual property rights being properly exploited. The Minister knows how much more difficult&#151;indeed, impossible&#151;it is to attract development capital equity injections when advances do not have this valuable intellectual property in them. It is only to the Government and to the Minister that those in this important world can turn for help, either for the money that is needed or for suggestions of where those companies should go for that money.</p>

I am not going to defend one type of stem cell research or another; nor am I going to speak for or criticise any of the stem cell researchers who might or might not have been mentioned, whether their work is bona fide or not. First, I declare an interest. I am a member of the Medical Research Council. I am also a fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences and vice-president fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. I hope to give a balanced view of where stem cell research is going, what needs to be funded and what does not. It is important to understand that in stem cell research there are some key fundamentals.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09030368000012"></a>Stem cell science is a fast-moving field, as evidenced by the recent publications of Professor Austin Smith from Cambridge in the journal <I>Development</I>; by Keisuke Kaji from the Regenerative Medicine Centre in Edinburgh, who is also a fellow of, and funded by, the MRC; and by Andras Nagy, from Toronto, in <I>Nature</I>. Their research has led to obtaining induced pluripotent stem cells without using viral vectors. That is a fantastic advance that may one day result in the development of therapy for a large number of patients, not only one or two being treated by autologous adult stem cells. The problem with adult stem cells when they are used for autologous treatment is that they are good for one patient at one time. They do not have immune challenge, but they cannot be used to treat a large number of patients.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09030368000013"></a>The promise lies in either embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent cells, which are adult cells, delivering that promise one day. That is why it is important to note that, despite the success, it is not clear at this stage which strand of stem cell research&#151;adult, embryonic or induced pluripotent&#151;will yield the best treatments. It may well be that different stem cell types are required to treat different diseases. We do not know yet. It is also true that it was science worked on in embryonic stem cells that delivered yesterday&#146;s publication on induced pluripotent cells without using any viral vectors.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09030368000014"></a>The UK&#146;s strict but facilitating regulatory framework allows for all forms of stem cell research. This broad-based

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09030368000015"></a>As for funding, on the whole the best research gets funded. In 2007-08 the MRC spent &#163;25 million, 61 per cent on adult stem cell research and 39 per cent on embryonic stem cell research. BBSRC, the biological science research council, spent &#163;12.3 million, 31 per cent on adult stem cell research, 42 per cent on embryonic stem cell research and 27 per cent on research using unknown, but possibly adult, stem cells. The Wellcome Trust spent &#163;3 million, 85 per cent of that in adult stem cell research. The total Research Council spend was &#163;36 million and the total government spend was &#163;61 million. In 2008, the MRC and the BBSRC pump-primed 13 groups to work on induced pluripotent stem cell research.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09030368000016"></a>On 17 April 2009, the MRC will hold a workshop to strengthen the UK&#146;s induced pluripotent stem cell science. A new MRC funding scheme for stem cell research of &#163;10 million per annum by 2010-11 will be for translational research. In January 2009, the MRC awarded &#163;3 million to address barriers to progress in preclinical stem cell research. The MRC has just signed a MoU with the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine whereby the CIRM will allocate $210 million and the MRC $5 million for 10 programmes of preclinical trials in four years&#151;in any stem cell types that will take us to the treatment of diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson&#146;s and other debilitating diseases. The MRC and the British Heart Foundation jointly call for developing centres in cardiovascular stem cell biology. In addition to the EPSRC, various disease-based charities also contribute significant amounts of funding.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09030368000017"></a>I have no time to tell the what the current stem cell research is directed towards, but I can tell noble Lords that the balance is more or less 50/50, if not more towards adult stem cell research. Many of the world&#146;s leading experts on IPSC are scientists who also work on embryonic stem cells. The major centres of excellence in stem cell research, including Cambridge and Edinburgh in our country, also work in adult stem cell research and embryonic stem cell research.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09030368000018"></a>I end by congratulating the scientists on the work published recently, which shows fantastic progress in induced pluripotent stem cell research by British-based scientists. The broad approach to stem cell research offers the greatest promise for medical advances. Let the best science be funded and, it is to be hoped, soon we will find treatments for many debilitating diseases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09030368000020"></a>First, will the Minister confirm that proportionate MRC funding for adult stem cell research has increased? In 2004 it was 51 per cent and in 2007 it was 61 per cent, so it is increasing. Secondly, will the Minister assure the House that government policies will uphold the Haldane principle that scientific research should be within specific programmes, and that individual projects should be approved on a case-by-case basis based on the quality of the science rather than by politicians? Does he agree that it is not insignificant

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09030368000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, is a strong advocate of adult stem cell research and he repeatedly uses the phrase that, while adult stem cells hold out great hope, there have been no therapies derived from embryonic stem cells. That is true, but I ask him whether he will concede today that adult stem cell therapies have been with us since the 1950s; that embryonic stem cell research has been with us since the 1990s; and that, given the normal scale of academic research, it is highly unlikely that there will be any therapies at this stage? It takes a minimum of 10 years to get from the point of basic research to the point where a therapy can be developed. When the noble Lord makes that comment so insistently, it is important that he should place it in its full context.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09030368000022"></a>Having said that, will the noble Lord also acknowledge that Geron, a company in the US, has just had permission for embryonic stem cell therapy research on acute spinal cord injuries to be carried out, and that in London the team led by Professor Peter Coffey is about to start early clinical trials of treatment for macular degeneration?</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09030368000023"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, is much more able to deal with the scientific aspects of this debate than I and he is right to say that this is a fast-moving field. It is right to refer noble Lords to our debates on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, when many of us conceded that there have been enormous and exciting breakthroughs in the field of adult stem cell research, but the scientists involved in those breakthroughs have themselves conceded that their work would not be possible without all of the research that has gone on, and which continues, into embryonic stem cells. The two need to co-exist. Even Professor Yamanaka is on record as saying that his work is dependent on that work.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09030368000024"></a>Other noble Lords and I came to understand, particularly during the passage of the HFE Bill, that research science is not linear; it is not a straightforward process. It is a process of pure research and therefore it can produce the unexpected, which can lead to breakthroughs which inform others in different branches of science and different disciplines.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09030368000025"></a>I ask the Minister whether he has taken to heart some of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Patten. There can be fads and trends in commercial funding but it is always the job of government to make sure that essential science is funded long before it ever gets to the point of translational research or research which is close to becoming a therapy. It is the duty of government to make sure that research continues on all fronts. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that it is not only adult stem cell researchers who are short of money; other scientists are equally short of money and dependent on charitable funding.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09030368000026"></a>We are at the point of an enormous breakthrough and potential, but it will only come to fruition, to the point where therapies are developed, if we continue to push forward on all fronts. I seek assurances from the Minister that that is what we will do.</p>

I am particularly pleased that adult stem cells are doing so well. Nearly 30 years ago I worked with a team at Guy&#146;s Hospital led by Dr Matteo Adinolfi. We used foetal stem cells to treat children with Hunter or Hurler syndromes, which are fatal diseases due to the congenital lack of two essential enzymes associated with mucopolysaccharides. The foetal stem cells were derived from the amnion membrane, which is part of the afterbirth, and were immunologically privileged since they did not express histocompatibility antigens and therefore would not be rejected. We hoped that if we transplanted them into these patients, they would produce the missing enzymes. Like the king&#146;s cup bearers of old who tasted wine to make sure it was safe to drink, we operated on ourselves to make sure this procedure was safe. We inserted pieces of amnion membrane under the skin of our arms and then re-operated a few months later to confirm that they had not been rejected. We then inserted fresh amnion into these children and small quantities of the missing enzyme were produced with some initial improvement. We were, however, always worried about the danger of inducing cancer; hence our pleasure at the success of transplanting adult stem cells which are safe and free of histocompatibility antigens. These advances seem to put a question mark over the initial enthusiasm for the use of foetal stems and hybrids, as the noble Lords, Lord Alton and Lady Williams, have already mentioned.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09030368000028"></a>A review article last year on page 937 of issue 451 of <I>Nature</I> drew attention to laboratory experiments and recent clinical trials suggesting that adult stem cells derived from the bone marrow of a patient can be used to improve the function of the heart of that patient and may well be used to prevent or even reverse the progression of heart failure. This was confirmed by that splendid rational and scientific Cochrane organisation, which published a systematic review of the medical and research literature on this subject last October. What are the Government doing to support this promising therapy for heart failure, which is, after all, the leading cause of death worldwide? The UK Stem Cell Foundation charity is funding a clinical trial at University College London, but this is only one trial. Are the Government aware of any other trials in this country to understand and improve such therapeutic benefits?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09030368000029"></a>In a review article in the <I>Journal of the Neurological Sciences</I>, Professor Neil Scolding at the University of Bristol draws attention to the immense and invaluable experience which haematologists have gained about the collection and delivery of bone marrow cells and their excellent safety record. Notably, in decades of delivering such cells to bone marrow transplant recipients, there has been no evidence of donor-derived malignancy. This contrasts with the risks of the much hyped embryonic stem cells, where transplantation of even a small residual population of undifferentiated cells can produce a tumour. It is well known that the long-term culture of human embryonic stem cells can cause them to gain or lose large sections of chromosomes, which further raises the spectre of cancer.</p>

In a paper published last month, he describes how patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis had stem cells transplanted from their own bone marrow. Not only did none of them deteriorate over three years but 81 per cent of them improved by at least one point on a scale of neurological disability. Moreover, none of the 21 adults deteriorated over a three-year period. So will the Government be turning more of their attention to funding the much more promising and safe adult stem cell research and development?</p>

<a name="09030371000001"></a><b><a name="90303-0013.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09030371000039"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Lord Drayson):</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for securing this debate. As I have said on several occasions before, although we may disagree in this House and elsewhere on some issues, the ability of this country to debate the challenging ethical issues that underpin stem cell research&#151;and, from that, the derivation of a carefully considered and highly effective regulatory system&#151;has contributed in no small part to this country&#146;s leadership in stem cell research. This House has contributed magnificently to the development of that regulatory system.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09030371000002"></a>It is no stretch to claim that the United Kingdom is the leader in stem cell research. The work, much of it funded by the Medical Research Council and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, is a testament to the quality of that research. Vitally, it gives many people new hope that the diseases and conditions from which they suffer will be treatable in the future, as was so eloquently described by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09030371000003"></a>It is therefore important for me to say why we believe the UK has been able to achieve that global leadership and, as I do so, to answer the noble Lord&#146;s questions and concerns in this area. First, as I have said, we have encouraged a full debate and developed a sense in this country that the public&#146;s ability to engage with this complex science is a model for many other areas of science. As Science Minister, I turn to the debate over stem cell research as a great example of the way that challenging ethical issues in science should be debated. We have public confidence in our scientists and vice versa, which strengthens the case for research of this kind.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09030371000004"></a>Secondly, through such debate, including the recent approval by this House of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, we have created an effective regulatory regime that other countries seek to emulate, particularly the United States, following the changes being put in place by President Obama. Most leading UK and international research centres work on all stem cell types. At the same time, no one can carry out any embryo research without a licence from the HFEA, in answer to the direct question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09030371000005"></a>The third strength in this area, which underpins all our scientific research in this country, is our adherence  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_702"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 702</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the Haldane principle that decisions about research projects are made on the basis of excellence in research by peer review by the scientific community, underpinned by the independence of the research councils, as eloquently described by the noble Lord, Lord Patel. I am happy to confirm that the Government will stick to the Haldane principle; we regard it as underlying our success. It is unfair and incorrect to accuse the Government of having any sense of moral bias or any interference from Ministers in the selection of projects relating to stem cell research.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09030371000006"></a>I note the concerns regarding whether or not the scientific community, in this area and in others, goes too far in raising expectations. That is a reasonable concern. It is important for the scientific community, particularly in these areas of significant unmet medical need, to be careful in the way that it communicates the potential of its science. I note the point made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, and I will write to noble Lords about my understanding of the specifics of the Newcastle case.</p>

<a name="90303-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09030371000007"></a>Scientists are clear that we need research into all forms of stem cell research to generate the breakthroughs in understanding that will translate into potential treatments. The scientific community&#146;s current understanding is that the best chance of progress will come from the cross-fertilisation of knowledge through research into all stem cell types. It is important to highlight, as the noble Lord, Lord Patel, just did, that recent breakthroughs in induced pluripotent stem cells, although representing an important scientific breakthrough, would not have been possible without the research that has taken place on other cell types.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09030371000008"></a>This is an area where UK scientists are again leading the way, as we saw from the announcements over the weekend. However, it is much too soon to assess the clinical impact of this development; IPS cells remain very much at the proof-of-concept stage, and it will be some time before it will be possible to consider developing them into clinical testing. A number of problems will need to be overcome before that can be contemplated.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09030371000009"></a>The situation remains that human embryonic stem cells remain the cells with the greatest potential for achieving progress in disease treatment at present. That is because they are truly pluripotent whereas adult stem cells have a restricted ability to form different cell types. They present fewer safety issues, since embryonic stem cells are not engineered and contain chromosomes with less damage or modification.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09030371000010"></a>Noble Lords asked a number of questions on the issue of funding. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Patel, for his enumeration of funding as part of research council support in this area. I want to state clearly that the balance of funding is not, as has been questioned, biased against adult stem cells&#151;quite the contrary. As the House has heard, within the MRC, for example, 61.3 per cent of funding goes towards adult stem cells versus 38.7 per cent, and that is increasing. The overall balance is 50:50, broadly speaking; it is slightly towards adult stem cells. However, I see no evidence at all for any bias against this cell type.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09030371000011"></a>Stem cell and regenerative medicine are a strategic priority for UK public funding. I absolutely accept the point made by a number of noble Lords, including the  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_703"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 703</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Lord, Lord Patten, that there is a very important role&#151;a vital role&#151;for support by government of fundamental research, particularly where it may not be possible to achieve patenting of the cell types, and where that fundamental research underpins the potential for breakthrough across the piece. That is why we are funding all types of stem cell research and why we have significantly increased our backing for stem cell research, rising from &#163;30 million in total in 2005-06 to more than &#163;60 million in 2007-08.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09030371000012"></a>This is not just about the research councils. We are also funding the process of innovation and the Technology Strategy Board, supporting several industry-led projects worth over &#163;30 million, with public-sector funding worth over &#163;10 million within that. Competition for public funding is strong. Although competition for funding in science is generally highly competitive, as noble Lords have said, this Government have significantly invested in funding for science, more than doubling the science budget over the past 11 years. Recently, in his speech on Friday, the Prime Minister reiterated that we will be continuing to support science as the ladder by which this country can get itself through and out of this economic downturn. We will therefore continue to maintain these substantial investments in science despite the downturn.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09030371000013"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord for highlighting my background working in the biotechnology industry. I declare that interest. I worked for 10 years grappling with the challenges of the commercialisation of medical research, with its long gestation periods and very high chances of failure in development. He and other noble Lords are absolutely right to highlight the fundamental importance of intellectual property and the ability to patent breakthroughs to give investors the opportunity to make an adequate return. However, there are areas in medical science where it is not possible, and it is right that it is not possible, to patent certain aspects. In my experience, however, there is the potential through consideration of the application of techniques to develop the patent estate in support of the development of a breakthrough new technology. We have seen good examples in the past, through orphan drug status or other mechanisms, whereby it is possible for very high quality research to receive funding and to be taken through development.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09030371000014"></a>In concluding, I want to stress two points that are relevant not only to the successful development of stem cell research in this country but to science research more widely. One is continuing this Government&#146;s absolute focus on funding scientific research on the basis of excellence. We have recently seen data which show that our scientific research is the most productive within the G8. The reason for that is the way in which we have managed scientific research over the past 11 years.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09030371000015"></a>The second point, alongside the importance of a focus on scientific excellence, is to develop science literacy in this country and an open and clear debate about issues which present challenging ethical questions. We know that the public have legitimate concerns about the use of stem cells, especially embryonic stem cells, in both research and treatment. That is why we have funded the Sciencewise programme to carry out

The results of that exercise, published in December last year, clearly show high levels of public support for both stem cell science and technology, from basic research through to development. It shows that the public are keen for the UK to continue on the path it is following and that they feel that the balance is broadly right. I share the public&#146;s wish for us to concentrate on research that has the potential to treat diseases which are currently causing such suffering world-wide, but to do so on the basis of the excellence and independence of our scientific community.</p>

The question for the Government is whether they want it to be a strong heart or a weak one. That is what these amendments seek to examine. They concern the highly protected marine reserves and the question of ecosystems. I recognise and share the frustration among speakers to the previous group of amendments that the groupings are quite difficult. I do not blame the staff who had to group them in this way because either we were faced with a group of 19 amendments or they had to be degrouped. Because of the confusion between the ecologically coherent sites that noble Lords spoke about before the dinner break and ecosystems, there is some confusion which I shall address later in my contribution. That is what led to the difficulties over the groupings.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09030371000017"></a>That said, we heard some splendid contributions. The noble Lord, Lord Eden of Winton, laid the ground very well. Again, the question for the Government is whether they want a strong or a weak heart for the Bill. I take the Committee back to the comments of the Joint Committee on the draft Bill to remind us of exactly what the difference is in the definition. I shall quote from paragraph 108:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_144"></a><a name="09030371000033"></a>&#147;Highly protected marine areas prohibit all damaging activities including, dumping, dredging, construction and the extraction of all resources. Multiple-use marine protected areas permit activities as long as they do not impact on the biodiversity interests of the given site&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030371000030"></a>It is clear that we have two kinds of site, one with much stronger protection than the other. A weakness of the Bill is that it does not recognise that there is a place for both. I think that the Government could make the choice. Indeed, their own advisers from Natural England have defined the difference, and I shall quote their definition because it is interesting:</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_705"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 705</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_145"></a><a name="09030371000034"></a>&#147;An MPA is an area of sea that is protected or managed to ensure that activities do not damage or cause disturbance to habitats, species and ecological processes ... Highly protected Marine Reserves (MPAs with no exploitation or development) are an essential component of an ecologically coherent MPA network&#148;.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09030371000018"></a>It might sound like an academic difference, but it is much easier to explain when we look at exactly how Defra intends to implement what we are calling marine conservation zones. In the helpful notes to Part 5, it explains that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030371000035"></a>&#147;the levels of protection are to depend on site-specific conservation objectives, and some MCZs are likely to require significant restriction of activities, effectively creating highly protected marine reserves&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030371000031"></a>The word &#147;effectively&#148; is critical. If we go with the current proposal that Defra licenses a system of MCZs in a less and less generous way, eventually when it denies all licences that will be the equivalent of a highly protected marine reserve. That is one way of doing it. However, there is a difficulty with that approach. It fails to recognise the science behind the fact that there is a strong case to be made for having some highly protected marine reserves simply in their own right, because, as Members of the Committee have said, the sea in conservation terms is in a bad state. It needs to recover.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09030371000019"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Eden, quoted from the interesting evidence gathered by PISCO, which is an international body drawing together scientists from all over the world. The science for having some highly protected reserves is irrefutable. Scientists from 124 marine reserves around the world studied and peer reviewed them and came up with these figures: that in the highly protected reserves, biomass&#151;that is, the mass of plants and animals altogether&#151;increased on average 446 per cent. The density&#151;that is, the number of plants and animals in a given area&#151;increased on average 166 per cent and the body size of animals increased at an average of 28 per cent. That is important because the size that the animal reaches is critical to how much it will breed. Finally, I turn to species diversity. The number of species increased by an average of 21 per cent in the sample area. It is impossible to obtain such incredibly dynamic results from an area that is suffering from a number of licensed activities. Scientifically, if we want to make a big impact on improving the ecological state of the sea, that is the way to go. I went to the Lundy highly protected marine reserve, where Natural England showed me some of the effects of it being a no-take zone&#151;effects that are agreed by the fishermen as well, who fish all around the zone on the outside of it, because the fish stocks have increased so dramatically. It is hard to see why the Government are resisting having some highly protected marine reserves.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09030371000020"></a>The other effect of carrying out what the Bill proposes, as the Minister will realise, is that all the commercial interests will carry on applying for licences only to find that they are rejected all the time and the MMO will have to keep receiving the licences only to find that it is having to carry out all this paperwork in rejecting them. How much simpler it would be to accept the science of the places that should be highly protected marine reserves and say that nothing will be

It is for the scientists to decide how many there should be and where they should be, but it would be a far better approach to say that there should be some.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09030371000021"></a>If we go back to the lessons of Lyme Bay, the Minister would agree that that started out as trying to protect the sea corals and the Minister tried to designate small areas. In terms of protection, that did not work and it created a much bigger argument about what could and could not happen. He ended up designating the entire area for the purposes of protecting what initially was one species.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09030371000022"></a>The difference between an ecologically coherent approach and an ecosystem approach is difficult to pin down. You could have an ecologically coherent system of marine conservation zones which were not highly protected. It might be one, for example, where basking sharks moved between the zones. A number of things might happen in the network, but it would be for a species that you were trying to protect. An ecosystem approach suggests that you are protecting the entire system, from the very smallest larvae or flora in it right the way through to the biggest creature. That is what an ecosystem is: the biggest creatures feeding off the smallest. If you fail to protect it all the way through, including the habitats, you will never end up with the ecosystem as it should be.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09030371000023"></a>The final amendment in the group, Amendment 207, is from Buglife. Although it might seem a very particular amendment, referring as it does to invertebrates, eggs and larvae, it is very important, because it underpins the idea that those small very things are the bottom of the food chain. The amendment simply probes whether &#147;animal&#148; as defined in the Bill includes all those creatures.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09030371000024"></a>This group of amendments asks that the Government make quite clear what their objection is to having highly protected zones as of right, because the approach which they have in mind of withdrawing the ability to issue licences gradually will make the whole process more opaque and more difficult to implement. I beg to move.</p>

They fit neatly into our discussion before the break on what comprises a proper conservation network. She is right, despite the fact that I have some reservations about the desirability of establishing a formal two-tier system where some zones are seen to be of less priority than others. However, I entirely sympathise with the need to ensure that the network of conservation zones is established with the protections necessary to achieve their objectives.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09030371000026"></a>We are dealing with dynamic ecosystems, which, as the Minister said, require a dynamic and adaptable conservation system. Indeed, the primary objective of zone designation needs to be at the heart of the process of evaluation and review. Furthermore, it will govern the nature of any restrictions placed on activities within the zone. Will the Minister give us some more information on whether the Government intend to  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_707"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 707</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>implement zones where there will be no extractive or damaging activities? Have the Government undertaken any analysis of the benefits of establishing some areas of pristine environment? Would it negate the whole purpose of this part of the Bill if marine conservation zones were not designated with a full range of powers in mind? It would not be good legislation to enable powers that do not have a hope of being implemented in practice.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09030371000027"></a>There appears to be great uncertainty about what the network of MCZs will eventually look like. I understand the Minister&#146;s reluctance to commit in an early-stage consultation paper to too much detail, but can he give us any idea of how great he expects the span of marine conservation zones to be? We would of course hope that zones would be properly targeted towards their objectives, but if there is to be a great variety of restrictions and by-laws, great attention will be needed to ensure that the objectives of each zone are properly understood both by the appropriate authorities whose actions will impact on it and by the public seeking to enjoy the sea in that area.</p>

She has mapped everything relevant out for us. Some particular amendments before us, such as Amendment A140, very clearly spell out the consistency and meaning of ecosystems. To build on what the noble Baroness said, I should like to consider the situation in Wales. The existing designations for marine protected areas in Wales already cover 30 per cent of its sea area. The Welsh Assembly Government have confirmed that, in Wales, the MCZ designation will primarily be used to establish some highly protected sites, because the present protected zones are fractured in different parts of the Welsh coast. The Assembly aims to link them up into a network giving coherent protection around that coast so we will see a very great commitment to highly protected sites.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09030371000029"></a>The important matter is that the Bill, as far as Wales is concerned, enables the Assembly Government to support the creation of these highly protected MCZs. To this end, the amendments are considered very helpful by, for example, the Countryside Council for Wales, which advises the Assembly and is the equivalent of Natural England where Wales is concerned. The provisions for designating MCZs in Amendments A118, A133 and A140 are extremely helpful in enabling Ministers in the Welsh Assembly Government to complete the work with a substantial network of highly protected MCZs around the coast of Wales. I certainly fully support the amendments and believe that they are extremely constructive in ensuring the quality of the marine environment for the benefit of seawater quality, the seabed and all that live on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09030375000002"></a>In referring to Amendment A118, I also want to stress the importance of Amendments A129, A133, A140 and A158&#151;and not to omit Amendment A207. The point raised by that last amendment is extremely important; the noble Baroness may not have laid much extra emphasis on it, but I would do so because we sometimes overlook the fact that we are talking not just about animals formed but about animals yet to come and still unformed. That is an important part of the process of conserving fish stocks.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09030375000003"></a>It was a long time ago&#151;in 1912, to be precise&#151;that a French fisheries scientist, Marcel H&#233;rubel, said, in reference to the theory behind marine reserves,</p>
<ul><a name="09030375000024"></a>&#147;choose a locality which is both a spawning-ground and a place where such fish as live on the bottom naturally congregate; delimit this area and make its position precisely known, then decree that all fishing shall be prohibited within its limits, and you will have a preserve wherein fish will multiply and grow, a &#145;stock&#146; of utilisable animal material, or, to use the word employed in France, a <I>cantonnement</I>. The utility of such reservations is proved by experience&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030375000004"></a>The experience of these reserves is growing the whole time. The reserves that have been established in various parts of the world, such as the Californian coast, in the Philippines and elsewhere, show that the fish stocks over roughly a 10-year period or more&#151;the 10-year period is the reasonable span that has so far been studied&#151;grow in abundance significantly. It is desirable that we focus on the opportunity of establishing no-take zones, as the Minister described them.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09030375000005"></a>When I said in a previous debate that I thought that the Minister&#146;s heart was in the right place, I should have gone further and said that the Government should be congratulated on this Bill. It is an extremely important step forward and it is likely to be the only step that we have available to us for a very long time to come. Unless we get it right this time, we will miss a great opportunity. That is why I keep coming back to this point. The primary purpose of this legislation is to ensure the conservation of our fish stocks to protect these animals so that they can develop and rebuild after centuries of depredation by man. That is the significance of this measure. We must not lose track of that in order to accommodate other interesting features in other walks of life. I know that they are all important and that we have to do them justice and take them into account; I do not belittle them in any way at all. However, I do not want them to damage the primary purpose of this legislation, or we will miss out on the great opportunity that I thought was a primary objective of the Government.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09030375000006"></a>We will be able to learn a lot from the development of the marine reserves. What the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said was absolutely right: we need to consider the movement of fish, which is not confined readily within a clearly defined area, because they will move beyond it. The fish stock that is built up successfully within the marine reserve area will spread out beyond that and provide happy hunting ground for fishers. It is natural that that should happen and I do not deny that it will happen.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09030375000007"></a>One question that arises from that&#151;although it does not reply, pace the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, to the point about the black hole or the white hole of the Isle of Man&#151;is that there may well be a gap between the  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_709"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 709</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>protected zones of the United Kingdom and the protected zones of the Irish Republic within the Irish Sea. What will then happen? Will other national fishing fleets enter the waters and make happy pursuit of the increasing fish stocks that our protected zones are liberating to the wider ocean? I do not know what debate or discussion is going on within the European Union on issues of that kind. This country in particular has had experience of the marauding instincts of other national fishing fleets when they trespass on our national fishing waters. That ought not to be allowed, particularly when we establish a sensitive network of fishing reserves. I hope that this can be addressed in some way at EU level and that we will ensure that the whole operation, when the zones are established, is correctly policed. I am assuming that on this latter point&#151;I know that policing comes up in other respects&#151;satellites will be used and that the MMO will have access to satellite information for marine reserve protection. I strongly support the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and I hope that the Government will give them their full support as well.</p>

She asked, as did the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, before supper, whether we wanted this core of the Bill to be strong or weak. Let me say again that we intend that this part of the Bill will be very strong indeed.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09030375000009"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Eden, that he is right to say that this legislation is likely to be on the statute book for a long time: legislation in the marine area does not come too often. When we started our debate a few weeks or months ago&#151;I suspect that we did so months ago; we had our Second Reading debate in December&#151;one of the criticisms made was that, although there are 300 clauses, this is described as a framework Bill. That is because we believe that we have to have some flexibility, as this needs to stand the test of time. We are going back and forth on this. Noble Lords at some times want flexibility and at other times want to be more precise; that is an entirely understandable debate.</p>

<a name="90303-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09030375000010"></a>I also say that, in terms of being strong, we want the MMO to be a very effective regulator, if I can put it that way, and to have all the techniques available to it to ensure that it is able to act. In our earlier debates about enforcement of licensing decisions, I very much agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that we want regulators to be proactive and to intervene at as early a stage as possible so that any possible damage is prevented, rather than the MMO having to pick up the pieces when the damage has been done.</p>

I hesitate to mention the common fisheries policy&#151;in fact, I know that I should not have mentioned it&#151;but it, too, comes into play. I very much take the point that we want consistency across Europe as much as possible  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_710"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 710</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and that we particularly need to work as effectively as possible with the Irish Government. As is the case with the devolved Administrations, my understanding is that working relationships are very good and very close indeed. Everyone recognises that to make this work we need consistency of approach between the UK Government and the devolved Administrations. We also need as far as possible consistency of approach with our European neighbours and allies.</p>

<a name="90303-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09030375000012"></a>I entirely understand what the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said on the question of groupings. It is clearly difficult to get a coherent grouping. However, degrouping has an impact: 10 groups were degrouped from today&#146;s list, which, by my reckoning, adds three-quarters of a day to our debate. The best that we have done so far is 14 groups a day. I recognise that if you have a huge group it is very difficult to do justice to the amendments but, in many cases, once you start degrouping, you lengthen the debate. There is a bit of a trade-off.</p>

<a name="90303-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09030375000013"></a>Amendment A140 would require the network to be based on the ecosystem-based approach. I have no argument whatever with the principle of what the noble Baroness seeks to achieve in that area. That is what the Government intend to do in putting the network together. We see the ecosystem-based approach as underpinning the regional projects that the Government have asked Natural England to set up to identify possible marine conservation zones. It will be a very important element of the guidance that we intend to issue to support those projects. Clause 119 already requires Ministers to consider how a network of sites will be representative of the ecosystem as a whole. The success of designating a network of sites relies on the Government considering the conservation objectives of the ecosystem as a whole.</p>

<a name="90303-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09030375000014"></a>The ecosystem-based approach also includes the concept of connectivity between zones that is encapsulated in the first part of Amendment A158. It is part of our understanding of what the phrase &#147;ecologically coherent network&#148;&#151;that is what we want to create&#151;means. Indeed, this is already recognised in the Bill. Clause 119(3)(c) specifically says,</p>
<ul><a name="09030375000025"></a>&#147;that the designation of sites ... in the network reflects the fact that the conservation of a feature may require the designation of more than one site&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030375000023"></a>I do not think that there is any disagreement in principle on this matter. However, we question the wisdom of setting this down in legislation. As I said, while we fully intend to use the ecosystem-based approach in constructing our network, I am not at all sure that we should tie it to a definition in EU legislation that has yet to be elucidated. I have no doubt that the network will contribute to our work to achieve good environmental status in our seas. Indeed, I say on behalf of the Government that we fully intend that it should do so. However, we must be clear that we are creating national legislation for our own reasons. It is not normal practice to use primary legislation to implement EU requirements for all the well rehearsed reasons of which the Committee is only too well aware.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09030375000015"></a>The second major aspect of this group of amendments ties the creation of a network of marine conservation zones to the designation of at least some zones with a

I am well aware that many people would like to see a requirement in law for there to be highly protected marine conservation zones. I have listened with great interest to the arguments made in relation to that. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, referred to the importance of recognising the science and to what she believes is the need for highly protected zones to be created in their own right, as she put it. However, she recognised that we can do that under the Bill, although she does not like the relevant provision. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, put his finger on it when he warned of the risks of having a two-tier approach to designation. At the risk of repeating what I said earlier, we do not think that there is a need for specific provision for highly protected marine reserves or zones because we believe that we are able to provide the protection that noble Lords require within the designation of marine conservation zones and the network, and that the&#151;</p>

Not only is there flexibility in the marine conservation zone mechanism to allow us to place whatever level of protection is necessary for a site, but the Bill makes it clear that there is a requirement for the Secretary of State to report on the number of marine conservation zones designated where any licensable marine activity has been restricted and the taking of animals or fishing has been prohibited. The Bill recognises that that will happen and requires the Secretary of State to report on the number of marine conservation zones designated where any licensed marine activity has been restricted.</p>

<a name="90303-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09030375000018"></a>We think that there is clear provision to allow the kind of protection that Members of the Committee require in a number of areas. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, thought that our approach to commercial developers might be rather bureaucratic, but it is fairly straightforward for a developer to determine whether a marine conservation zone exists in the area in which development is desired and then to look up what restrictions on activities are in place in the designating order. A phone call to the MMO or a look at its website should be sufficient to find out what a developer needs to know.</p>

<a name="90303-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09030375000019"></a>By not imposing a one-size-fits-all approach to high levels of protection, we may be able to allow some activities that would have no adverse effects on a protected zone because we do not want to lose the flexibility. However, I am absolutely clear that, where an extremely high level of protection needs to be given, there is nothing in the legislation to prevent that. It is very important that that is understood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09030375000020"></a>I was interested in the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, on what proportion of the sea will be protected by marine conservation zones. I was also very interested in the helpful remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, on the experience and intention of the Welsh Assembly Government. In the spirit of

However, because the Welsh Assembly does not have the legislative powers to create a highly protected zone, the only way in which it could do so is through this Bill. As Ministers in the Welsh Assembly Government would like to do that, does the Minister not feel a bit embarrassed that he might be preventing them from doing so?</p>

First, the noble Lord will get bored with me saying that this Bill is entirely consistent with the devolution settlement. Secondly, as I have already indicated, the legislation allows for an area&#151;it may be a marine conservation zone or a part of one&#151;to be highly protected in the way in which he has described. Although I fully accept that the Welsh Assembly Government might have preferred a different approach, none the less I cannot see why they cannot achieve what they want to achieve within the Bill. We will be very interested to see the outcome of the work of the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09030377000001"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, wishes me to give a more precise indication of how much the sea would be protected under MCZs. I really cannot go there at the moment as more work needs to be undertaken. As I said earlier, a publication will be available at around Easter, which I hope will give some general intent relating to the issues that will need to be considered, and I understand that a more technical document will be published in the autumn. I am afraid that I cannot go further than that. However, we would not bring this legislation before your Lordships&#146; House were we not committed to marine conservation zones, protection of the marine area and the network. This is not a matter to be taken lightly. We fully understand why it needs to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09030377000002"></a>Amendment A154 would insert a cross-reference to Clause 113 and the areas in which marine conservation zones can be designated. I make it clear that the purpose of Clause 119 is to place a duty on the appropriate authority to use its powers to designate marine conservation zones so as to contribute to a network of sites throughout the UK, including in Scottish and Northern Irish territorial waters. The requirement in Clause 119 to designate zones under the Bill does not extend to the Scottish and Northern Irish inshore areas, but we want appropriate authorities to bear in mind, as far as possible, the interactions of their designations with protected areas in those inshore areas and to work with the Scottish and Northern Irish Administrations to ensure that the UK as a whole fulfils its international obligations. That, we believe, is the effect of the Bill as it now stands. Amendment A154 would narrow that because, by cross-referring to Clause 113, there is a risk of narrowing the scope of the duty to designate a network to exclude

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09030377000003"></a>Amendment A207 would insert a definition of &#147;animal&#148; into Clause 136. My advice is that there is no need for this amendment, as the ordinary and natural meaning of the word will ensure that the term applies to animals in the general sense, including their eggs and other immature stages. All flora and fauna are potential &#147;features&#148; which can be protected under this part of the Bill and may therefore be subject to the general offence provision in Clause 136. However, I am prepared to reflect further on this matter in the light of comments that we have received this evening.</p>

It suggests something that is in no way despoiled. I also thank my noble friend Lord Livsey of Talgarth, who raised a very good example of where, not for the first time, the Welsh are ahead of us in their thinking. They want to have a number of highly protected sites. His point was that the Bill must support that.

Specifically, government Amendment A185 refers to the provision in Clause 125 on bylaws for the protection of marine conservation zones in England. It provides that a bylaw may be made which would prohibit or restrict,</p>
<ul><a name="09030377000035"></a>&#147;the doing of anything in the MCZ which will interfere with the sea bed or damage or disturb any object in the MCZ&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030377000029"></a>Amendment A185 would change &#147;will&#148; in that provision to &#147;would&#148;. The point I wish to make is that this relates to the protection of MCZs in England. There is an order-making power in Clause 130 to protect MCZs in Wales, but I can find nowhere in the Bill a provision that allows either a bylaw or order to protect MCZs in Scotland. No power is conferred on Scottish Ministers or the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<a name="90303-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09030377000021"></a>Clause 136 establishes offences but if I can go onshore and give a parallel, you can have an offence against a protected species onshore such as chopping down a tree. However, bylaws prohibiting people lighting fires in the vicinity of a wood might give greater protection as a preventive measure. Why is there not similar protection for MCZs in Scotland as provided for in Clause 125, to which government Amendment A185 refers?</p>

The inshore region of Scotland is entirely a matter for the Scottish Parliament and Executive to decide. I gather that because the bylaws apply to 12 miles out, there does not need to be provision for Scotland at all. That is the reason&#151;the bylaws apply to 12 miles out.</p>

The bylaws may not apply but should there be an order-making power? It is clear in Clause 125 that it is not intended that these should apply only up to the 12-mile limit. If an MCZ is established beyond the 12-mile limit, do bylaws apply there or not?</p>

We now come to the topic that my noble friends Lord Eden of Winton and Lady Carnegy have been dying to get their teeth into. The Committee has touched on this matter before. When we discussed Part 2, I raised the question of what powers we would have to protect the marine environment outside the six-nautical-mile limit. I do not know if, this evening, there is any way that I can persuade the Minister to discuss this in a little more depth because time is getting on. We have just had an interesting and useful debate on the levels of protection that a marine conservation zone might be able to offer various aspects of a marine environment. Along with my noble friend Lord Taylor, I welcome the Government&#146;s intention to establish a network of zones that will make a meaningful impact on marine ecosystems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09030377000026"></a>I was interested to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, in the debate on the previous group of amendments, mention flora and animals. I notice that in Clause 114 stipulates &#147;flora or fauna&#148;. I wonder if it would be a little more comprehensive to use &#147;flora and fauna&#148;. From my limited understanding of science, I believe that when you get down to the level of diatoms and plankton it is a little difficult to determine exactly which is which. However, the question remains of what power there will be to establish marine conservation zones outside the six or 12-mile limit. If they extend out there, to what level will they be effective?</p>

<a name="90303-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09030377000027"></a>The Government&#146;s marine programme plan notes yearly tranches of special areas of conservation, to be proposed to the European Commission. Defra&#146;s website notes the five sites that have already been submitted. I look forward to hearing how these sites are to fit into the ecologically coherent network that this Bill seeks to establish. Are they to be considered separately at the moment, consulted on and considered in isolation from the marine conservation zones; or are they to be integrated, year by year, into other parts of the network? Surely it would be simpler and more effective for there to be one system of conservation. As we have discussed, the Bill&#146;s provisions allow for a great deal of flexibility in the objectives of the marine conservation zones. There is equal flexibility in the restrictions and&#151;in inshore areas&#151;by-laws that can be imposed on them. What need is there for multiple and separate zones?</p>

<a name="90303-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09030377000028"></a>Do the Government have any intention initially to make designations within the six-mile limit, and then to start extending and overlapping into the area of the 12-mile limit, where we know that we have a realistic chance of being able to implement whatever regulations we put in place? The real question then becomes: are the Government prepared to suggest their intentions in the UK offshore area, and do they think that they would get any support from the operators from other countries in the absence of EU regulation? Can they expect backing from EU regulations before this magic date of 2012 that people talk about? How does the Minister intend to proceed if the recommendation process leads to suggested sites in offshore waters? What objectives will he be able to approve in these areas? How do the Government intend to further the objectives of a marine conservation zone when only a small fraction of the ships with access will have regard to them? I beg to move.</p>

The common fisheries policy is the elephant in the room&#151;or perhaps one should say the whale in the Jacuzzi. We clearly must cross-reference the Government&#146;s policy with the development of the CFP. When my noble friend Lord Teverson was a Member of the European Parliament he spent a huge amount of time trying to develop the thesis that the management of the fisheries around the European Union shores should be as far as possible a matter of subsidiarity, so that those most directly affected by those fisheries should be directly effective in their management. That is why this probing amendment is so important&#151;it deals with both consultation and implementation. If the Bill is to be a success, it is absolutely critical that those two processes go together.</p>

<a name="90303-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09030379000002"></a>The Committee deserves an explanation of how the Minister and the Government anticipate that the MCZs will be treated by EU fisheries management. Clearly it would be absurd if we tried to develop an effective degree of conservation management only to find that we were subject to quite different approaches by other member states with historic rights, either within the 12 nautical mile limit or beyond, to an extent which could completely undermine the purposes of the zones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09030379000003"></a>I support the attempt by the Conservative Members of the Committee to elicit from the Minister a statement on precisely how the Government see these two important policy objectives interrelating. If we do not get clarity there will be considerable scepticism, and, indeed, cynicism, about how best to manage these zones in the future.</p>

<a name="90303-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09030379000004"></a>The western approaches are but one area where this issue will be particularly sensitive. The noble Baroness referred to the fact that we have in the past had our fishing rights infringed by the French, Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets; it has long been a sensitive area. I am particularly concerned that the fishing communities all around the United Kingdom, especially in the south-west, should feel that the Bill is of general long-term value in conserving fish stocks, and that it will not be undermined by the short-term approaches of other member states. That is in no way incompatible with the long-term development of the common fisheries policy, nor does it undermine the purposes of the European Union, which is attempting to devote more attention to this important long-term strategic objective.</p>

<a name="90303-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09030379000005"></a>I hope the Minister will be able to give a positive reply. Without one, there will be an important lacuna at the very centre of this part of the Bill.</p>

I hope the Minister will be reasonably expansive in informing the Committee of the current thinking in the European Union in relation to the development MCZs and marine reserves. It is important that we know what the attitude of the European Union is today. My noble friend&#146;s amendment refers to the Council regulation of December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy, and I should like to know what that amounts to in relation to the marine conservation zones that the Bill seeks to establish.</p>

<a name="90303-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09030379000007"></a>The common fisheries policy has been responsible for some of the most awful depredation of marine life in our oceans. I hope that the obscene practice of the quota system, which compels the discarding of any catches exceeding the quota because they may not be landed, is coming to an end. It cannot in any way be regarded as a defensible activity. I hope that the Minister will illuminate our proceedings today, if he is ready to do so on this occasion, by explaining the EU&#146;s attitude towards the establishment of these important protected areas.</p>

Of all the things I have heard my noble friend ask the Committee to accept, this is a really pious hope. I cannot see this working when it comes to keen fishermen who do not always obey the rules anyway. The country has picked on the alleys with the most fish and made them conservation zones. These are hardly going to be places that the Spaniards and Portuguese will want to leave alone. I will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s reply. It would be wonderful if this could be done. Something will have to be done but I think it will have to stronger than this amendment is suggesting.</p>

I share the view expressed by my noble friend Lord Tyler that there is nothing inconsistent with what we are trying to do in establishing marine conservation zones, either with the conservation objectives of the European Union or with the concept of the European Union itself. But it would be unfortunate when there is a lot of criticism among fishermen that the common fisheries policy is anything but common to create yet another area where what applies to UK fishermen does not apply to those from elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09030379000010"></a>In an earlier debate this evening the Minister indicated to the noble Lord, Lord Eden, that there could be no-take zones. If these were only to be no-take zones for British fishing vessels but quite legal for any other flag, that would build up resentment. One of the features of this legislation and the parallel legislation that is coming forward in Scotland is the extent to which the fishing industry along with other stakeholders&#151;I hate the word but it is as good a shorthand as any&#151;with interests in the marine area have had a buy-in. There has been considerable consultation and the Bill goes forward with a lot of support from all those who have an interest in the marine areas. If that was in any way to be fractured or held back because of an apparent and real discrepancy and prejudice between what applies to UK fishermen and what applies to others, that could be problematic. That is why the Minister&#146;s response to this amendment is so important.</p>

This is crucial for all of us around the Chamber. We do not want to put into statute something that affects British trawlermen but does not have the same effect on others who come fishing within our area. This issue has already exercised the Committee. The comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Eden, about discards and trawling&#151;and I would include sand eels&#151;reminded me of all the reports we have had from the EU Committee looking at fishing and the CAP. Year after year we say that we all know where there is a problem and what ought to be done, but nothing gets done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09030379000012"></a>This is a very good amendment, as other noble Lords have said, because it highlights some of the practical problems of bringing in legislation specifically for your own country rather than it being common to everybody. How do you police it? We are back to square one. The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, mentioned the question of how you mark these areas, because people do not always do this deliberately. Doing it by default is bad enough but doing it deliberately is hugely damaging. I understand that there are historic rights. Can the Minister clarify what those are? If we have no-take zones, they should be no-take zones for everybody. There does not seem to be, if I am reading it right, as much of a problem within the six-mile limit; the limits beyond that cause the greatest problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09030379000014"></a>The amendment that my noble friend has moved has invigorated the Committee to bring back real and practical issues for the Government to think about, and in my few words I wanted to reinforce many of the issues that have been raised. We need to have a satisfactory answer. We may not be able to get an answer on the EU question from the Minister, but if he is not able to give it to us today then by Report we certainly need something concrete in that regard.</p>

At this comparatively late hour it has raised one of the most significant issues in the Bill. There is no doubt that the integration of our conservation policies with those on commercial fishing go to the very heart of the Bill, so I am not surprised that the amendment has brought forward a number of heartfelt contributions. Noble Lords have raised a range of questions, not all of which I am confident of being able to answer satisfactorily, but I will do my level best to give reassurance in crucial areas and bear in mind the points that have been made in others.</p>

<a name="90303-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09030379000016"></a>Our objective is clear: we want to create a legal framework enabling us to make the best use of our abundant marine resources over the coming decades, and we want to find space in our seas for all sectors of the marine economy while ensuring that the natural environment, which provides so much support to the marine economy, is adequately protected. If I had been in any doubt at all, several of the contributions to this short debate made it clear that in some cases commercial fishing can have an adverse effect on the natural environment, and that in the past commercial fishing has been subject to some imperfections in the overall policy that has sought to control it. The noble Lord, Lord Eden, made that point strongly. I believe his phrase was that there had been &#147;imperfections&#148; in the common fisheries policy, although I have heard things expressed even more trenchantly than that about the policy. Suffice it to say that we are not alone when we identify weaknesses in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09030379000017"></a>As the Committee will be aware, the common fisheries policy is due for a major review in the near future, by 2012.

The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, said that something needs to be done. That is the Government&#146;s view too, which is why we will be participating in that work on the common fisheries policy against a background where we will also have this legislation, indicating the role that we need legislation to play in terms of protecting the marine environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09030379000018"></a>The other dimension that came through strongly from the beginning from the noble Duke and was then reflected faithfully from all parts of the Committee&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, was as trenchant as any&#151;was  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_721"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column 721</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that we do not want to disadvantage our fisherman against those from other territories and countries. I will not be able to give total satisfaction on all those points, but I bear in mind the strength of the representations, and we will do a great deal of thinking about them.</p>

<a name="90303-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09030379000019"></a>We need to recognise that EU law, through the common fisheries policy, places restrictions on the measures we can take in some of the UK marine area. The authorities will, of course, assess these factors and many others and will make the best judgment on the available evidence and expert advice on the balance between fishing and the necessary conservation measures. The amendment would add two new subsections to Clause 113 which clearly recognise the tension here. It would oblige Ministers to seek agreement in Brussels, under the common fisheries policy, where any necessary restrictions on fishing activities need to apply to the vessels of another member state.</p>

<a name="90303-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09030379000020"></a>Let me reassure the Committee that, of course, the Government recognise that as a most crucial obligation and it is something we will do. It is obvious that we need to ensure agreement in Brussels for the totality of this legislation, together with other aspects of our fishing policy, to be effective. We are fully seized of those points made in the debate this evening and the strong representations that we need to take those points on board. But we are obliged to take them on board&#151;we are already legally bound to seek agreement for the six to 12 nautical mile zone, by Council Regulation No. 2371/2002 which is referred to in this amendment. It requires us to seek such agreement. Beyond 12 nautical miles, as we are all aware, the common fisheries policy applies in any event. So although I emphasise that not every marine conservation zone will necessarily entail restriction on fishing, it is inevitably the case that some work in this area will, and we will need to get agreement as far as the European Community is concerned.</p>

<a name="90303-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09030379000021"></a>What the amendment also seeks to do is to ensure that UK fishing vessels are treated in the same way as those of other member states. That is certainly the Government&#146;s aim too, but the Committee will know the realities of the situation and will expect me to be frank about those realities. We have the ability, under the common fisheries policy, if we so choose, to apply more stringent regulation to UK vessels than required by the common fisheries policy. If we did, of course, that would apply to UK vessels only, and I am all too aware of the strength of feeling on this point, which is contained in the amendment.</p>

These would, I think, fall within the area we are talking about. Presumably the measures that will apply to those have already been discussed with Brussels and agreed, or are these just proposals at the moment and an aspiration for the JNCC?</p>

Let me conclude the point I was making because it is important, and I shall try to develop the other issues that have been raised.</p>

<a name="90303-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09030379000024"></a>We could put more stringent regulations on UK vessels if we chose to do so, but I make the obvious point that exercising that power would not be undertaken lightly. If we have to use it to protect marine conservation zones, it would be only because there was a compelling case to use a measure of last resort. The idea that we would lightly apply to the British fishing fleet controls that we would not be able to operate in relation to other vessels is, as far as the Government are concerned, a matter of last resort. So I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and indeed it underpinned what the noble Lord, Lord Eden, and the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, were saying as well. We are not in the business of disadvantaging the British fishing industry, but with regard to certain aspects of these zones, we could not give an undertaking that we would do nothing about fishing if the only way to protect of the zones was in fact to do something.</p>

<p><a name="st_257"></a>
<a name="09030379000025"></a><b><a name="90303-0016.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09030379000050"></a>Lord Wallace of Tankerness:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for making his point so clearly, but it is not the other side of the same coin. It is not that we are only seeking comparable and fair treatment between British and other fishing vessels, but if the conservation argument is such that restrictions have to be imposed, that aspect could be undermined if there were not also comparable treatment between British and foreign vessels.</p>

The committee made the point then that this regulation was the most controversial of the 18 documents published about the outcome of the consultation process. What is the attitude of the European Commission today? The difficulty is that there is a gap between the declaration of intent and the implementation of the policy. Other noble Lords have talked about the need for consistency in the establishment of conservation zones. The consistency will come about only if the European Commission requires it to happen, and therefore the attitude of the main fishing countries such as Spain and France is very important. We need to know exactly where they stand.</p>

What the noble Lord is reflecting is the fact that there is a marine strategy framework directive which is the property of the European Commission. It requires member states to include spatial protection measures within their programmes of measures to achieve good environmental status, and therefore we have a plank on which to argue and negotiate the achievements scheduled in this Bill against a background of general European understanding of

Surely the Government must have made more progress in the discussions before the Bill came forward on this vital issue, which threatens to undermine the whole purpose of the legislation. If he cannot do it this evening, maybe he can find some way in which he can give us a more definitive answer about how precisely the zones are intended to interrelate with the CFP as is now intended by the Commission and by other member states. Without that, we are in a difficult situation in looking at the Bill. I appreciate that it is late in the evening but, given that the Bill has been in prospect for so long, it is not acceptable to be as vague as the Minister is now being.</p>

The network that we are establishing, which will include the marine conservation zones, will establish a network with all European sites. The objective of the network set out in Clause 119(2) ensures that the zones taken together with the European marine sites form a network. We have a framework within which these negotiations occur. We have a directive that enjoins on states the necessity of making progress in this area, which we are doing. I admit that 2012 is some distance away, but the reform of something as substantial as the common fisheries policy is not done at the flick of a switch. The noble Lord will recognise that that objective gives us time to do the revision against the background of necessary changes to the common fisheries policy as well.</p>

Within that framework, we are working with the grain of opinion in Europe, necessitating change in the common fisheries policy, and with the recognition that others will be jointly expected to do what we are doing. All I am able to add at this stage is the recognition of the point that has been made so forcefully tonight: the Government must not lightly take on as part of this policy decisions that would

The Minister will perhaps be quite pleased that it took place so late in the day, or we might have had a much larger body of noble Lords trying to intervene. I am not sure that I should be glad that my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour feels that I am capable of pious hopes, but some of the answers given by the Minister perhaps make me something of a common bedfellow as far as that goes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09030379000035"></a>The Minister said that we are obliged by EU regulation to seek agreement on matters within the 12-mile limit. We do not need agreement with anybody other than those within the UK, but we need to get on and get it done. Given the sense of urgency, I had hoped that the Government would give us some idea of what they see as the way forward in the areas over which we have power. The prospect of the Minister imposing on UK vessels restrictions that do not apply to others gives one visions of reactions perhaps even more violent than anything we have had to the current banking crisis.

In moving Amendment 189, I shall speak also to Amendments 190, 191, 192, 196, 197 and the Question whether Schedule 6 shall stand part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000004"></a>This group returns to the theme of where the role of the Secretary of State should end and where that of local authorities should begin. I also have a number of probing amendments, because I want to explore the Government&#146;s intentions. Amendment 189, on which Amendment 191 is essentially consequential, addresses the astonishing provision in Clause 86(1) that the Secretary of State would be allowed to seize the local authority&#146;s right to exercise its own functions and transfer that right to an economic prosperity board. I am afraid that I cannot see what justification there could be for central government to step in and mix functions around in this way. I agree that it may be useful and appropriate, if economic prosperity boards are to be established, for participating local authorities to pool their sovereignty, as it were. That is why my amendment allows local authorities to decide for themselves when and how to transfer functions to be exercised by an economic prosperity board.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000005"></a>I will listen to and read the response by the noble Baroness to this amendment with great interest, because at the moment I fail to see how the role of the Secretary of State in this matter is correct. Noble Lords will realise that this is certainly a matter to which we shall have to return, unless the Government reconsider their position. Until they do, I have a further question.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000006"></a>Amendment 190 narrows the meaning of &#147;functions&#148; to those relating to economic development and regeneration. Will the noble Baroness be prepared to accept that tighter definition and, if not, why not? If economic prosperity boards are to help local authorities  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC258"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC258</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>focus their economic development goals and address their needs, I can see no reason why unrelated functions of local authorities should be exercisable by the economic prosperity board. I would welcome clarity on the definition of &#147;functions&#148; from the Government, because at the moment the Bill does not really contain any assurance to those who are concerned that this new tier of quasi-democratic regional government will not accumulate powers and functions that it does not and should not need.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000007"></a>Amendment 192 is to ensure that economic prosperity boards cannot levy taxes or charges. In Amendment 196, I propose to delete a paragraph of Schedule 6 which I believe bolsters that viewpoint. I have done so to uphold the simple maxim that there should be no taxation without representation. I am afraid that, in my opinion, that semi-appointed, Secretary of State-beholden body does not fall into that category. I am sure that the Minister will appreciate this opportunity to reassure noble Lords that economic prosperity boards will not have these inappropriate powers.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000008"></a>Amendment 197 deletes the paragraph from Schedule 6 that amends the Local Government (Overseas Assistance) Act 1993, which would allow economic prosperity boards as well as local authorities to provide assistance to overseas bodies. I am aware that that Act precludes direct financial assistance, but I raise the issue as an example of the potential waste and duplication inherent in creating another tier. Will local authorities and economic prosperity boards compete for foreign influence? For example, will they both assist the same overseas body? If local authorities are able to do these things anyway, why should these new, quasi-elected bodies be able to muscle in and duplicate that work? The same is true of so many of the functions and provisions that are transferred to economic prosperity boards by virtue of the schedule, which I have signalled my opposition to standing part of the Bill. Is the duplication of all those powers necessary to help local authorities to share their expertise, which is the fundamental point of this part of the Bill?</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000009"></a>I want to use these amendments to tease out how the Government see the practicalities of economic prosperity boards. They tell us that the aim is to provide welcome assistance to local authorities helping struggling communities in this recession. They are not intended to form embryonic regional governments, apparently. I argue that, if the functions conferred on economic prosperity boards are not strictly necessary for the exercise of the former option, we run the risk of helping to create the latter.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000012"></a>From this side of the Committee, we had made clear our opposition to economic prosperity boards for reasons of democracy&#151;the transfer of local authority functions to a body that will not consist of directly elected representatives&#151;so I do not want to go through those arguments again. The amendments signal that opposition, but also probe some detail.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000013"></a>Our first amendment is Amendment 189A. The transfer of a function to an economic prosperity board would require the consent of the local authority whose function is being transferred. I am aware that the Minister will argue that the transfer will be voluntary, but would like to delve under that a little. What if one local authority in an EPB area is willing to see the transfer but another is not regarding the same function? Clause 86(1) states that the function is,</p>
<ul><a name="09030338000051"></a>&#147;exercisable in relation to an area within an EPB&#146;s area to be exercisable by the EPB in relation to the EPB&#146;s area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030338000044"></a>Does that mean that the Government would agree to a patchwork, as it were, within the EPB&#146;s area so that different entities exercise the same functions within it? </p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000014"></a>Amendment 190A would provide for functions not just of a local authority but of a regional development agency to be transferred to the EPB. If that were the design of the EPB, I might see a bit more argument for it. The RDAs exercise the functions. I suppose that this is not far away from the noble Baroness&#146;s Amendment 190, which seems to be what is in the Government&#146;s sights in this design.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000015"></a>Amendment 191A takes us to Clause 86(2), which provides that an order can be made by the Secretary of State if she,</p>
<ul><a name="09030338000052"></a>&#147;considers that the function can appropriately be exercised by the EPB&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030338000045"></a>My amendment would change that to a function &#147;best&#148; exercised by the EPB. Grammatically, perhaps that should have been &#147;better&#148; exercised; I am not sure. However, the point is to probe what &#147;appropriately&#148; means in that context. Perhaps one knows it when one sees it, but we might not all have the same perceptions. It is important that the Government put it on the record. From a query in a meeting with the Minister a couple of weeks ago she will be aware that this is exercising me, as it were. It is appropriate for the Government to explain what they mean by the drafting.</p>

Following my noble friend&#146;s comments about lasting the course depending on how long we go on, I may have to leave depending on the progress in the Chamber.

<p><a name="09030338000017"></a>Amendment 190B follows what underlies Conservative Amendment 190, spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, which would restrict the functions of an economic prosperity board to economic development and regeneration. My problem with her amendment is not that it is too restrictive but that it is not restrictive enough. Regeneration can cover a multitude of things. It can certainly cover new schools, which are vital for the regeneration of communities, and housing, which is often at the heart of regeneration schemes, as well as  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC260"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC260</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>various other things. My amendment, along with that of the noble Baroness, is intended to probe the kind of functions that the Government think that the EPBs ought to have. I suggest specifically, for the purposes of probing, that they should not be functions relating to a council&#146;s status as a local housing authority or a planning authority, whether we are talking about making plans, development control or anything else, and that the planning power should not be transferred to an EPB. It is particularly important that anything that an EPB does should be subject to the normal planning system otherwise there will be a risk of it falling into disrepute. People will say, &#147;These boards just get on with their schemes. They give themselves planning permission and do not listen to anybody, and the normal checks and balances in the planning system are not there&#148;.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000018"></a>Will the EPB have a role as an education authority providing new schools, perhaps? What about its functions relating to the promotion of tourism, which is a crucial part of regeneration in large parts of the country? What about environmental health functions or licensing functions&#151;those ought to remain firmly with the licensing authorities, with their quasi-judicial functions&#151;and, indeed, anything else that the local authority does not want to transfer? The local authority should be able to place conditions or limitations, including time limits, on the transfer of powers to the EPB. Unless it is very clear what the EPB can do and that local authorities can constrain it, we will be setting up a new quasi-local authority. If, as the Government might say, it is meant to be another way of local authorities working in partnership with perhaps a stronger base which gives more certainty and would be less easy to dismantle, nevertheless local authorities must continue to have the power to restrict the use of what are their own functions. If not, as I said, we will just be setting up another quasi-local authority.</p>

<p><a name="09030338000019"></a>Amendment 192B refers to funding and states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030338000050"></a>&#147;Provision under this section may not require or permit an EPB to levy a precept on the council tax&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030338000046"></a>It is clear that the funding of EPBs will come mainly from the constituent local authorities. Setting up new departments to do things that some of the constituent local authorities had previously done, running them and administering them will need buildings, offices, telephones and all the rest of it and that will have to be paid for by the local authorities. Who decides how much each local authority contributes towards the EPB? The hope is that it will be done by agreement: the EPB will say that something is reasonable, there will be negotiations with the constituent local authorities about what is reasonable and a compromise acceptable to all will be reached. The normal way in which organisations of this type fund themselves is by a process of negotiation and agreement with the constituent authorities. However, if the EPB has the ability to levy&#151;whether it is technically a levy on the precept on the council tax or simply an imposition on each constituent authority on whatever basis&#151;it takes levying council tax one step away from democratic accountability, because a council will have to pay the money whether it likes it or not. At the moment, each precepting

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000020"></a>This amendment is designed to probe this important matter so that we can hear what the Government have to say. I shall be interested in the Minister&#146;s answer.</p>

<p><a name="09030338000021"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09030338000065"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> I hope noble Lords will not have withdrawal symptoms after today, since I sincerely hope we will finish this afternoon. I am grateful for the amendments in this group because they allow me to clarify issues that have been raised and to reassure noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000022"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, are about the functions of the EPB and the role of the Secretary of State. Amendments 189, 190A, 190B, 189A, 190 and 191A, which include those tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, seek clarification on the role of the Secretary of State&#151;indeed, the first amendment removes the Secretary of State&#146;s power to make a statutory order&#151;and the intention that the functions relate to economic development and regeneration, which is what EPBs are all about. The suggestion made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, is similar to that made by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, in that they would make the Secretary of State&#146;s power in relation to functions exercisable only,</p>
<ul><a name="09030338000053"></a>&#147;at the request of the local authority in question and with the agreement of the EPB&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000023"></a>I shall not reiterate anything I have said in previous debates on the purposes and functions of the EPB, not least because the Chief Whip is sitting beside me. We debated them thoroughly. We want to create an opportunity for local authorities to acquire significant benefits. I think we all agree that we want more opportunities to tackle economic issues at the sub-regional level, which best reflects real economic markets. I think the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, agrees with that.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000024"></a>We have already encouraged local authorities to work together by introducing MAAs, and EPBs would bring further advantages by creating a coherent legal body&#151;a single conversation&#151;that would provide a clear framework for joint decision-making. It is interesting that the Conservative Party seems to have reached a similar conclusion. In its recent Green Paper on localism, it proposes that local authorities should be able to set up business-led enterprise partnerships, sub-regional bodies,</p>
<ul><a name="09030338000054"></a>&#147;that truly reflect natural economic divisions&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09030338000047"></a>which would be signed off by the BERR Secretary of State. I leave that for the Committee to consider.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000025"></a>Much of the process of passing functions to EPBs is alluded to in the amendments, so let me reiterate briefly what that process is, and in particular reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi. Any functions which will be transferred to the EPB from constituent local authorities&#151;the &#147;when&#148; and the &#147;how&#148;, as she put it&#151;will indeed be decided by the authorities concerned and set out in the scheme which they draw up. The legal definition of a function is any legal power or  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC262"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC262</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>duty, and we are looking at some very important powers. Any transfer of functions should be clearly set out by the statutory order establishing the EPB.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000026"></a>Amendment 189 would remove the functions from the order creating the EPB and would allow member authorities to &#147;agree&#148; to transfer functions. Nothing divides us on that. I absolutely agree that member authorities should first agree the functions that they would like to share with the EPB to achieve their objectives of greater prosperity. However, in all seriousness, because it is a major undertaking, it should be done by statutory order. It is a proportionate and proper use of the Secretary of State&#146;s powers. This also provides an opportunity for the proposal to be scrutinised. As I said last week, these will be affirmative orders whereby Parliament could make its views felt. Finally, the functions cannot be changed without a thorough process involving consultation with all partners, as the Bill provides for in Clauses 95 to 97. There is a security blanket around that issue.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000027"></a>In our previous sitting, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, was concerned about an EPB gradually accreting additional functions over time. That is another strong argument for functions being exercisable only by the EPB by order of the Secretary of State. Amendment 189A suggests that the functions ought to be conditional,</p>
<ul><a name="09030338000055"></a>&#147;at the request of the authority in question and with the agreement of the EPB&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030338000048"></a>I agree entirely that is exactly what we have aimed to provide in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000028"></a>Perhaps I may clarify the process for transferring functions to an EPB, as that will take care of some of the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about the outcome possibly being fragmentary. There will be one statutory order to create an EPB to set out its working arrangements and functions. This will be designed to put into law the scheme prepared by the local authorities. All local authorities will agree the functions that their EPB will have through the preparation of the scheme. As part of this process they can, if they wish, decide that certain conditions should apply to the exercise of those functions. They may also decide that functions should be made exercisable by the EPB instead of by the authorities, or concurrently with them. They will be able to decide to take part of those functions&#151;perhaps the strategic functions&#151;or leave the remaining functions in that policy area with the local authorities. It is entirely up to the local authorities and they should have as much flexibility as possible.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, raised a similar point in Amendment 190B. It would create a presumption that certain functions could not be passed to an EPB unless individual authorities agreed otherwise. Exactly; there must be a collective agreement whereby the EPB and its objectives, as defined by the local authority, focus on certain activities, programmes and policies. Therefore there will be agreement that the respective and necessary functions be transferred.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000030"></a>The noble Lord asked about powers. It does not make sense for each local authority to make separate decisions without reference to the other authorities involved. It simply would not work. It would serve neither the form nor the functions of the EPB.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC263"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC263</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000031"></a>Amendments 190, 191 and 191A are concerned with ensuring that functions passed to EPBs are the right ones, as is absolutely correct&#151;for example, that an EPB&#146;s functions relate to economic development. Amendments 190 and 191 would make this explicit in Clause 86(1). We have had correspondence with the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee about that, so I hope that I can reassure the Committee on this point. It is precisely our intention that this should happen. I set out in my letter to the DPRRC that Clauses 86(2) and (5), 94(1) and 97(1) should all be read together. When they are, they make it clear that any functions conferred on an EPB will have to relate to economic development and regeneration.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000032"></a>Amendment 191 asks the Secretary of State to consider not only that a function can be appropriately exercised by the EPB but that it can best be exercised by an EPB. The noble Baroness has pressed me on the definition of &#147;appropriateness&#148;, which I will come to. There is also concern that the clause may be designed to protect local authorities from having functions taken from them that are indeed better exercised at local level. However, the amendment would give the Secretary of State rather more power. It is perfectly reasonable for the Secretary of State to talk about the appropriateness of who exercises what functions, but it is absolutely right for the local authorities to decide whether a particular function is best passed to the EPB.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000033"></a>On the question of appropriateness, it will be entirely up to the local authority concerned to decide what its functions should be in the EPB in order to achieve economic prosperity within the objectives that it has set itself. One thinks immediately of investment functions, business development skills training, and possibly joblessness and worklessness issues. A local authority may feel that it cannot realistically plan for the proper expansion of jobs and employment without having more affordable housing, key worker housing or whatever. It will be up to the local authorities that are working through the EPB to decide what is necessary; we are placing no conditions on that. &#147;Appropriate&#148; relates to economic development and regeneration, and it is entirely up to local authorities to decide what is appropriate.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000034"></a>Noble Lords will know that the RDAs do not have clearly defined legal functions, so Amendment 190A would mean any activity carried out by an RDA. We had a lively debate on RDA delegation last week, so I will not repeat those arguments, but our objection is the same. By doing what the amendment suggests, we would cut across existing arrangements and these tiers of government working together organically. It would certainly also undermine parts of the regional arrangements that we are putting in place.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000035"></a>The amendments on taxes, charges and the levy are very important, and I am very grateful to have the opportunity to put my remarks about them on the record. I reassure noble Lords, although they do not need to be told this, that it is a fundamental tenet of our law that no tax can be raised without express provision being made in primary legislation. No such provision is included in the Bill. The local authority functions that can be exercised by an EPB by virtue of  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC264"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an order made under Clause 87 could not include the power to tax. The same principle applies to a combined authority.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000036"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said, under Clause 87 the costs of an EPB will need to be met by its constituent councils, and he described the process that will be followed. It will be a matter of agreement and negotiation in the light of a local authority&#146;s commitment and the sort of EPB that it might want. The basis on which the amount payable will be determined is entirely a matter for its agreement, and it will be set out in the scheme. No provision in the Bill would enable an EPB to raise a levy from its constituent councils. It could not require them to make particular payments to the EPB, which would in turn have to be taken into account by the councils when they set council tax. Again, this would not be possible without express provision in the Bill, and there is no such provision in the Bill because we do not want it. I hope that the noble Lord is reassured about that.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000037"></a>We also had a question from the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, in Amendment 196 about whether combined authorities should be able to raise a levy. I have already said that the Bill does not provide for EPBs to have precepting or levying powers. But, as a combined authority would take on functions that would otherwise be exercised by an integrated transport authority&#151;a later group of amendments deals with that&#151;it is necessary for the former to adopt the levying powers which Passenger Transport Authorities, which date back to the 1960s, and their successor bodies, ITAs, already hold and have held for many years.</p>
<h5><a name="09030338000058"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="90303-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000038"></a>The PTAs were levying bodies for many years in order to allow them to deliver and invest in public transport in their area. The Local Transport Act 2008 provides for ITAs also to be levying bodies, a principle which was agreed by this House last year. I should make it clear, however, that paragraph 75 of Schedule 6 to this Bill limits any levy for a combined authority to expenses that are attributable to transport functions.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90303-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000039"></a>Moving further into Schedule 6, paragraph 83 would apply the Local Government (Overseas Assistance) Act 1993 to EPBs and combined authorities, which is the subject of an amendment by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. I hope that I can provide an assurance that this provision is not a means by which EPBs or combined authorities would be able to open overseas offices or spend council taxpayers&#146; money on overseas projects. It is simply a means by which they can provide advice and non-financial assistance to overseas bodies that carry out similar functions, which may in turn be reciprocated.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000040"></a>The noble Baroness also opposes the whole of Schedule 6 standing part of the Bill. The consequential amendments contained in this schedule are essential to allow EPBs and combined authorities to operate effectively. Schedule 6 applies various aspects of local government law to EPBs and combined authorities. As these bodies are made up of local government representatives and will be able to exercise certain  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC265"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC265</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>local authority powers, as decided by the councils involved, it is clearly appropriate that they should be subject to many of the same rules and procedures that govern the local authorities themselves. In applying this law to EPBs and combined authorities, we are again following the precedent established by the Local Transport Act 2008 in relation to ITAs.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030338000041"></a>The consequential amendments in Schedule 6 will ensure that EPBs and combined authorities are accountable in the ways that we want, which we shall cover in a later amendment&#151;for example, by applying rules on open meetings to them and rules on political representation. We have applied only those aspects of local government law that are relevant and appropriate to the functions which EPBs and combined authorities will have and have not applied anything that will unduly restrict their freedom to structure themselves as the constituent local authorities wish. I hope that that reassures the noble Baroness. Indeed, I hope that the Committee is reassured by those explanations and that noble Lords will not feel it necessary to press their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="09030338000042"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09030338000066"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> People used to say, &#147;Never ask questions unless you know the answers&#148;, but I do, I am afraid. I did not get all the answers that I was expecting from the Minister on these amendments. Having heard what she said&#151;and I shall read it carefully in <I>Hansard</I><I>&#151;</I>I am increasingly alarmed and a little frightened about what the implications of these bodies might be. I have three quick points. When she was talking about housing there seemed to be an assumption that if a major housing regeneration were part of a regeneration of an area, which it often is, that function ought to be handed over to the EPB. I do not understand why we cannot have a body at sub-regional level&#151;a group of councillors working together on regeneration&#151;but with the district councils or unitary councils at a more local level still carrying out the housing functions as part of that regeneration. Clearly, that could happen, but the assumption of what the Minister said is that it would not and that if there were a big regeneration it would all go to the EPB.</p>

<p><a name="09030338000043"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030338000067"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I can reassure the noble Lord about that. It definitely could happen because only part of the function relating to housing could be taken away. If those local authorities forming an EPB thought it relevant and important, there is no reason at all why the housing authorities should not retain most of what they do. I cannot speculate because I do not have a specific instance in mind but I can reassure the noble Lord that it would not mean all or nothing in terms of housing.</p>

<p><a name="09030339000003"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09030339000046"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I am grateful for that; I could have forecast that answer, but I am interested in the fact that things are being put in these terms. So far as planning is concerned, I do not think I had an assurance that development control functions would not be passed to the EPB. That is the further question I ask&#151;can that just be clarified?</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000004"></a>The Minister said, on one hand, that councils will not be forced to do anything&#151;that if they transfer their powers it will be their decision&#151;but, on the other  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC266"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC266</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hand, that we cannot have a system with different councils in the same EPB transferring different functions, so everything has to be uniform. The two do not tie together. Either everything is uniform or each council has the ability to decide for itself which functions to transfer. When an EPB is set up, everyone may well agree on the system but, as time goes by, councils may wish to change the system and withdraw functions from it. There may be those dreadful old fashioned things called local elections, and a different group of councillors might have a majority on the council, have a different view and want to change things, yet it seems that they will not be able to do that.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000005"></a>That leads to my final point, which is on money. It is clear that it will be difficult for a council to leave an EPB&#151;it is locked in&#151;particularly a district council in a two-tier area. It will require the agreement of a majority of the other people. However, if the Minister is saying that the EPB has no power to levy money from councils, what is to prevent a council that has a change of control and gets a party in that wants nothing more to do with the EPB because of the political and public debates that have taken place&#151;because the EPB has suddenly become unpopular in that area, for some reason&#151;saying, &#147;We&#146;re not paying any more money. Sorry&#151;we may be a member of the EPB and unable to pull out of it, but there&#146;s no more brass&#148;? One clearly hopes that people negotiate, come to agreements and reach compromises on such matters, but the real world is not always like that. Sometimes there are major political schisms, even at local level, that result in a breakdown of negotiation as a means of achieving compromise and people simply say, &#147;No more&#148;. What happens then?</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000007"></a>I wrote down what I thought was the correct interpretation and summary of what the Minister said&#151;that the arrangements rely on good will and good sense. However, taking my first amendment as an example, I see nothing to prevent local authority A binding or blocking local authority B because the Secretary of State thinks that that would be the appropriate way to do things. I understand the intentions behind what she explained, but I find it hard to identify the provisions pinning all that down in the legislation. I have no doubt that we will come back to this at the next stage.</p>

First, the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on the transfer of powers is valid. If there is a true commitment to localism, different priorities clearly exist at different times depending on the make-up of the council. It is essential that that flexibility be maintained for local authorities in terms of which powers it hands over to economic prosperity boards at any one time.</p>

<p><a name="09030339000009"></a>Secondly, I am heartened by the comments made by the Minister on the functions of the economic prosperity boards, specifically in relation to their use

I was also heartened by how she addressed my concerns about non-financial and financial support that economic prosperity boards could give as part of Schedule 6. However, it is important that I look at the Minister&#146;s response in detail, especially the reference to the Green Paper, to ensure that there is consistency.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000014"></a>The Bill says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030339000041"></a>&#147;the Secretary of State must have regard to the need&#151;</ul>(a) to reflect the identifies and interests of local communities, and (b) to secure effective and convenient local government&#148;,
<p><a name="09030339000037"></a>both of which are desirable but not necessarily democratic. Either could be carried out undemocratically. My amendment would add the requirement that the Secretary of State should have regard to the need,</p>
<ul><a name="09030339000042"></a>&#147;to promote local democracy and the involvement of local people in local democratic arrangements and decision-making&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09030339000038"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="09030339000043"></a>&#147;to promote economic, social and environmental sustainability&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000015"></a>There are two points here. The first point is about democracy and involvement. I tabled the amendment because of the Government&#146;s emphasis in the early parts of the Bill on exactly that kind of process. It is a tongue-in-cheek amendment, really&#151;a cheeky amendment&#151;because the whole concept of an economic prosperity board and involving local people in local democratic arrangements and decision-making are not compatible. The economic prosperity boards will not be the kinds of bodies that lend themselves to the involvement of local people in local democracy. It is taking decision-making a step further away from local democracy, in so far as local democracy involves elections and people making decisions, making it more indirect and remote.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000016"></a>Moreover, people will find it very difficult indeed to get involved in the structures themselves and to become members of them, unless they are members of a small, local, privileged elite who are lucky enough to be co-opted as the new-style aldermen on these bodies, if they have them. Membership of them will be impossible for most people, because they will have to become leader of their local council before they can be a member. Being leader of the council is not open to a lot of people, whereas being an ordinary councillor is. That is the real difference. I put that forward as an  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC269"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>example of how the two parts of the Bill conflict. I will listen with interest to what the Minister says, but I do not believe that there is anything she can possibly say that will satisfy me and make me believe that my amendment is in any way compatible with the organisation that is being set up.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000017"></a>The second point is important and goes back to the fear, which we discussed on regional structures, that the Government at a regional and sub-regional level are putting more emphasis on the economic to the exclusion of social and environmental sustainability. There is a real fear that environmental sustainability and social sustainability are being pushed back, and that all that will really matter in the future is economic advancement and sustainability. Economic advancement and sustainability are extremely important in the present economic circumstances of the country, but there is a real danger that that will be used to push back the real advances that have been made in recent years in the other fields. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09030339000018"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09030339000053"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> It is a bit daunting for any Minister to be told that nothing they could say could possibly change a noble Lord&#146;s mind or make any impression on it whatever, but I shall try.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000021"></a>The noble Lord raises a very important point, and I am happy to try to reassure him and to ensure that the Committee knows that both parts of the Bill are not merely compatible but are interdependent.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000022"></a>The amendments that the noble Lord has listed would require the Secretary of State to have regard  to the need to promote local democracy and the involvement of local people before creating or amending an EPB or combined authority. If we cast our minds back to those three glorious days at the beginning of the Committee stage when we went into the local democracy clause in extraordinary detail, the noble Lord will know that we are taking this issue very seriously indeed, as he has always done. I am sure that he knows that EPBs and combined authorities are listed under Clause 2(3)(j) as connected authorities for the purpose of the duty to promote democracy. The challenge that he has posed is why they need to be there when, as he suggests, they are not particularly democratic bodies.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000023"></a>I dispute that, however, because those local authorities that come together to form an EPB will be serving the local community. They will have elected members on them and will be part of the local democratic organisation. They must show what they are about and how they work. They must show why certain people are on them and how their work will benefit the local community. That is the sort of thing that we are asking local authorities to drive at through the duty to promote democracy. How they arrive at their decisions is the sort of thing that I said that I would take away and think about in terms of the noble Lord&#146;s suggestion and in terms of decision-making.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC270"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC270</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000024"></a>The EPB will make decisions, so it is important that it is as transparent and open as possible and that people know how they might put themselves forward as possible members. Although there will be a majority of elected members, there will also be space for other people representing local interests. I see no reason why local activists&#151;whether from the employment sector or whatever&#151;should not be considered for that sort of role and, importantly, influence what goes on. They could legitimately be included here and there will be lots of opportunities for people to be involved.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000025"></a>More than that, although the noble Lord did not allude to this, consequential amendments in paragraph 18 of Schedule 6 will have the effect of applying Part 5A of the Local Government Act 1972 to EPBs and combined authorities. That means that meetings will need to be open, and papers and minutes will be available for inspection by members of the public, so they will be completely transparent.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000026"></a>In addition, by virtue of paragraph 91 of Schedule 6, EPBs and combined authorities will be best value authorities and are therefore subject to the duty to involve. Those measures and the fact that at least a majority of members of an EPB will be elected councillors will give the Secretary of State sufficient confidence that they will indeed promote local democracy and the involvement of local people, without having to consider that separately before they are created.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000027"></a>On the need for the Secretary of State to have regard to the need to promote economic, social and environmental sustainability, there is no doubt that EPBs will have a strong focus on economic issues. The Secretary of State will already be required under Clause 94 to consider the evidence and the likelihood that an EPB will improve the exercise of statutory functions relating to economic development and regeneration and economic conditions.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000028"></a>Very early on in our debates, I said that to pose a challenge between economic growth and economic and social sustainability is a false dichotomy. Throughout our legislation, we write about sustainable economic development because we are in the business of sustainability. It does not make human sense not to be. We have covered social sustainability in Clause 94 by the need for the Secretary of State to have regard to the interests and identities of local communities, and the need to secure effective and convenient local government before making a statutory order. That makes it clear that it has to be a major consideration.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000029"></a>In terms of environmental sustainability, EPBs will be expected to follow national and regional policy. The regional strategy, for example, has sustainable development at its core. PPS1, our major piece of planning architecture, is on sustainable development and will include policies designed to contribute to tackling climate change. We can take confidence from that. The noble Lord may also wish to know that the combined authorities will be under a duty to take into account policies and guidance on climate change and environmental protection when carrying out their transfer functions under Section 8 of the Local Transport Act 2008.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000030"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will agree that EPBs will not in any way run counter to our ambitions to promote local democracy, more transparency and more

I hope that he will change his mind from where he was when he spoke to previous amendments.</p>

We disagree about what the words in the Bill mean in terms of the kinds of bodies that will be created and how they will work. I do not believe that what the Minister said about them will happen in practice. I do not in any way accuse her of bad faith. There is no harm in disagreeing. We argue about matters and discuss them in these Committees at great length in the hope that by the end we all see the error of each other&#146;s ways or the error of our own ways and we will come to an agreement or a compromise. That is a useful process, but sometimes we disagree.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000032"></a>The Minister said that it was a false dichotomy to consider, on one hand, economic growth, sustainability or development and, on the other, environmental and social sustainability. These general concepts come down to making lots and lots of practical decisions. I do not know whether it is a dichotomy, false or otherwise, but decisions have to be made and often there is a choice. Is the choice to make a decision on jobs or economic growth, knowing the effect that it will have on the environment? Is it in the interests of an area to have a more super-duper transport system, bigger or faster roads, or even railways, even though there will be some environmental damage? You try to look at the issue as a whole and try to put a proposal together as a package, but you still have choices to make.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09030339000033"></a>The purpose of the bodies to be set up under the Bill has an effect on the decisions that are made. It does not sweep away everything in one direction or the other, but it moves the centre of gravity and moves the position further along the spectrum in one way or another. There is no point pretending that this is not the case. Everything in this Bill and recent Bills, such as the then Planning Bill, has been to push economic issues more strongly than environmental and social issues. That is what has happened, and I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Graham, agrees with me.</p>

<p><a name="09030339000034"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0002.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09030339000057"></a>Lord Graham of Edmonton:</b> I agree with what the noble Lord has said, and with the underlying principle.</p>

<p><a name="09030339000036"></a>I am unhappy about the intention of securing,</p>

<p><a name="09030339000039"></a>in this Bill, when referring to the new boards. Those are precisely the words in the Local Government Act 1972 in relation to reorganising local government. They are the words used in relation to setting up parish councils and parish reviews. These words are usually used, in my experience, in relation to democratically elected local authorities. Here they are used in relation to non-democratic or indirectly democratic, non-elected

<p><a name="09030350000002"></a>As I understand the Bill, Clause 99 allows the functions and powers of PTEs&#151;passenger transport executives&#151;and ITAs&#151;Integrated Transport Authorities&#151;to be transferred to combined authorities. PTEs are local government bodies responsible for co-ordinating public transport in large urban areas. Currently, as far as I am aware, they are in Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire. They are administered in turn by ITAs, formerly known as PTAs&#151;Passenger Transport Authorities&#151;which are made up of councillors representing the areas served by the PTEs. I hope that I have managed to steer noble Lords through this alphabet soup of organisations; it is quite complicated.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000003"></a>On the Local Transport Act 2008, the Government accepted the Opposition&#146;s amendments that stipulated that each ITA must include at least one elected representative from each authority represented on the ITA. Members not appointed from among locally elected councillors are able to vote on only those matters that the ITA permits them to vote on. We had considerable discussion about those issues during the passage of that Act. The Government accepted that important nod in the direction of democratic accountability in the Local Transport Act, and they seem now to be trying to dilute it even further by transferring the functions of the ITAs to the new combined authorities.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000004"></a>Why is this clause necessary? Do the Government believe that PTEs are not currently carrying out their functions satisfactorily? What is so superior about combined authorities that the Government feel that they could perform transport roles better than the PTEs and ITAs? Will the Minister detail by way of explanation and example what a combined authority could achieve that an ITA could not? I ask that question with some genuine curiosity because I have not been able to think of any reasons. I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to enlighten me. What specific powers do the Government envisage will be transferred from PTEs and ITAs to combined authorities? By what criteria will the Secretary of State determine which of those powers will be transferred from PTEs and ITAs to combined authorities?</p>

<p><a name="09030350000005"></a>During the passage of the then Local Transport Bill, the Government went to great lengths to reform the functions and structures of PTEs and ITAs. How will this Bill impact on that recent legislation and vice versa? Is it not too soon to decide that the existing schemes are not working? In fact, they have not really been established yet. Why do they need to be changed? The composition of ITAs was subject to much debate during the passage of the Local Transport Bill. Will the composition of the new combined authorities reflect that discussion? Will they be formed in the way that the ITAs now exist?</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000006"></a>I have asked a series of questions that I hope the Minister can answer because I looked at these provisions and am confused about their purpose and unconvinced about their necessity. I ask the Government to explain to the Committee how Clause 99 fits the aims of the Bill to strengthen local democracy and help local communities deal with the problems of today. I do not see how these parts fulfil some of those aims.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000008"></a>I shall rehearse a little of the Local Transport Act 2008. Allowing the establishment of ITAs was a significant step that allowed local authorities to pool responsibilities and powers at a sub-regional level, where that was in their wider interest. As the noble Lord said, there are six ITAs. They came into being on 9 February, when they replaced the Passenger Transport Authorities in  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC274"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Merseyside, South Yorkshire and Tyne and Wear. Several other parts of the country are reviewing their existing transport governance arrangements at the moment, including considering whether establishing a new ITA might be the right way forward.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000009"></a>It seems that the noble Lord thinks that we are going to subsume all ITAs into EPBs. I reassure him that we will have combined authorities only in so far as the EPB and the ITA agree that it makes sense for the economic development purposes to be served. The noble Lord asked what benefits that would bring. In some areas&#151;travel-to-work areas or EPBs that may cover several districts or even more than one county&#151;there is no doubt that the investment that may be needed to stimulate local economies, skills, FE colleges and so on would have transport implications. There may well be a compelling case for bringing the ITA and the EPB together to make sure that all that could be integrated so, if there is a challenge to a bit of the transport system, it can be addressed as part of serving the wider economic imperative for economic prosperity.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000010"></a>Essentially, it will be something for local choice and will have to be shown to be genuinely beneficial because nobody wants reorganisation for the sake of it. I assure the noble Lord that EPBs are a big step forward but, if there are additional benefits to be gained by allowing authorities not only to set up overlapping sub-regional arrangements but to bring in a single body that can take forward transport and economic development together, that is an option that they might want to consider. I assure the noble Lord that it does not alter the workings of the ITA. If the local authority comes to the conclusion that there is an argument for changing the composition, it will be able to make that judgment, but there is nothing that will require it to do so. I will write to the noble Lord and make sure that I have answered all his questions.</p>

<p><a name="09030350000011"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030350000047"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> Another point came up during the passage of the transport Bill. I approve of Integrated Transport Authorities, and the Government agreed that they should be composed mainly of elected members, but we would be totally against having road charging imposed upon a county that did not want it. If counties want it, that is fine. They can have a referendum. It would be wrong to have a majority of an integrated body voting for road charging within a local authority that did not want it. That is what concerns us: losing the local democracy of that authority. It is up to that authority to choose the various things it wants. We do not want anything created which could impose it upon an authority that was against it.</p>

<p><a name="09030350000012"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09030350000048"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Again, let me offer some assurances. It is up to local authorities. There is no reason why they should change their constitution at all; they will not be required to. The powers that cover road charging are essentially inherited. There is no way that the combined authorities will introduce congestion charging and road pricing in an underhand way.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000013"></a>The ITAs were granted powers over local charging schemes by the Local Transport Act, as the noble Lord knows. The Bill provides no extra powers on

If they choose to go down the road that he suggested, it is entirely up to them. I am happy to put that on the record. I know that there was some concern after Second Reading that this might somehow open the door to congestion charging. That is absolutely not the case. I hope I can reassure the noble Lord about that.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000014"></a>We are looking to enable any local authorities that want to opt for an EPB to consider at the same time whether, in order to deliver that powerful economic objective, it would serve their purposes to bring the ITA on board and have an integrated approach to economic development at a sub-regional level. It is simply there as a facility that can be considered if the local authority so chooses.</p>

<p><a name="09030350000015"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09030350000049"></a>Lord Smith of Leigh:</b><b></b>I wonder whether my noble friend agrees with me on two points. We are here debating the difference between two joint authorities and where the functions lie. This is not about local councils or local democracy, but about whether local councils work together, combining their powers to work in a joint arrangement, or not. Whether it is an ITA, an EPB or some combined body is entirely up to the local authorities. As a former leader of Greater Manchester, someone who still bears the scars of the congestion charge debate there, I say that it is important that we think about transport. That is the strength of ITAs against PTEs. PTEs have fewer powers than the ITAs did because they do not have road traffic but highways traffic, which is actually taking powers from local councils. If we are getting a body that wants to look at the economic prosperity of an area, the link between transport, access to work, access to employment and all these issues is really important.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000016"></a>As much as I loved our PTE in Greater Manchester, it concentrated on public transport. I want to ensure that we have a functioning local public transport service. There is nothing wrong with that. I do not want to worry about bus stops. One of the functions of the PTE&#151;or the ITA, now&#151;is to worry about the location of bus stops. That is an important matter, particularly if it wants to put one outside your House, but it is something I am happy for someone else to do. However, but if we are talking about transport strategy, its integration with the economy and the wider role of a city region, people have to see bigger pictures. That is why there may be a combined authority that takes a limited number of functions from the ITA and leaves bus stops and all the rest of it to it.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000021"></a>We have moved to Part 7, which deals with multi-area agreements. All the amendments in this large group relate to concerns about the provisions for them in the Bill. I will try to resist the temptation to make a speech more properly made at Second Reading on the nature of multi-area agreements and so forth. Speaking personally, and with a little experience, on the whole I favour them. If done properly and correctly, they offer a great opportunity. That said, we need to stress and recognise that they must be voluntary and we therefore have some concerns in this part of the Bill as we creep towards some statutory provisions which start to question the voluntary nature of such agreements.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC278"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC278</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000022"></a>We also need to recognise that partnerships, by their very nature if they are to be successful, are organic and need to grow over time. Some areas, my own included, have a long record of partnerships. They have matured and there is a feeling of trust that is necessary to make them work. In other areas, that is not so. That is a brief background to my view about multi-area agreements in general.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000023"></a>I turn now to the specific amendments. There are a lot of them and I will try to get them all right. Amendments 197B, 197C and 198G each relate to targets. Targets have become an obsession: there is frequent reference to targets in these clauses. The amendments also question the reference to improvement targets. Of course improvement targets are always desirable and everyone strives for improvement. I happen to be a member of the executive of a local authority that is not only graded by the Audit Commission as excellent, but is also improving strongly, so I am probably the last person to question the need&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09030350000024"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09030350000055"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> What is better than excellent, then?</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000026"></a>However, in the current climate and, more particularly, in the climate in which local authorities are heading in the next year or two, it will always be desirable to seek improvement, but I question whether that is realistic and whether including that in the Bill recognises the reality of matters as they are.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000027"></a>Amendment 198G in this little group refers to Clause 120, which is detailed about targets and the Secretary of State's involvement. If they are to be voluntary and locally based, why do we need such a degree of involvement from the Secretary of State? Clause 120 deals with provisions for submission to the Secretary of State, but it does not actually say that the Secretary of State's approval is required or under what terms the Secretary of State may decide not to give her or his approval. I assume that if an agreement is required to be submitted to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State will say something about it, but perhaps they just receive it for their greater education and benefit. I am sure that the Minister can clarify that.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000028"></a>Amendment 197D relates to Clause 117. We have discussed economic prosperity boards for some considerable time and expressed our misgivings, to put it no more strongly, that they are in effect quasi-local authorities. Sooner or later that is what they will turn into. Then we get to Clause 117, which has the heading &#147;Local authorities&#148; and states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030350000041"></a>&#147;the following is a local authority for the purposes of this Part&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09030350000039"></a>I accept that qualification&#151;and an economic prosperity board is specified in paragraph (f) as a local authority. That reinforces the misgivings that we expressed on an earlier part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000029"></a>Amendment 198A requires consultation of all the local authorities in an MAA area. At the moment, the Bill refers to consultation with representatives of local  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC279"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC279</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>government&#151;I assume that in England that is intended to be the LGA; is that correct?&#151;and others considered appropriate. Again, perhaps the Minister will explain more fully what might be considered appropriate. We would feel reassured if it said in the Bill that all local authorities in an MAA area would explicitly be consulted.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000030"></a>Amendments 198B, 198E, 198F and 198H are fairly self-explanatory. We suggest that the Secretary of State should be invited, not directed. That is clear. Amendment 198C allows local authorities to request a direction, or an invitation, from an initial MAA to extend it to a revision of an MAA. That is desirable. To be honest, I struggled a little with Amendment 198D, but again it is based on concerns expressed throughout our discussions about the position of non-unitary district councils, which continue to seem to be rather the poor relation in all this.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000031"></a>Amendments 198J and 198K leave out statutory requirements for what should and must be a voluntary agreement. If it is a voluntary agreement, maybe there should not be enforced co-operation. That is a long list of amendments, each one of which deserved a fuller explanation, but in view of the time constraints that we are all under, I beg to move Amendment 197B. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="09030350000032"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09030350000057"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I have three amendments in this group, two of which are probing. They are all along similar lines to those of the noble Lord, Lord Tope. The Minister might be surprised that there were only three amendments, and I hope that she will be relieved when I explain that we have finally come to a part of the Bill that does not upset us as much as some other parts. We have already made our position clear on economic prosperity boards&#151;that we are not particularly in favour of them, and we would rather have them looking more like MAAs. By that, I mean that if local authorities wish to combine for particular purposes, and it is not enforced&#151;this is along the lines suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Tope&#151;they should be free to do so. In fact, I had to leave Committee for a while earlier because I had a long-arranged meeting with Kent to talk about transport issues. That is the sort of thing that MAAs should be about.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000033"></a>There is no need for any kind of prescription. Most local authorities will want to work through MAAs and work with authorities that have similar problems. That is why, like the noble Lord, Lord Tope, we are concerned about some of the issues in the Bill. I suggest that MAAs, as envisaged here, seem to be little more than a mechanism for implementing improvement targets. In common with the noble Lord, Lord Tope, I ask the Minister to comment on that.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000034"></a>Amendment 201 is designed to emphasise our belief that MAAs should be voluntary, along the lines suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Tope. If they are truly voluntary, they would be more openly embraced by local authorities, which would spend more time considering the values of working on common problems with their colleagues.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000035"></a>I have refrained from tabling amendments to Part 7 which would replicate earlier concerns expressed by us throughout the Bill as to the overbearing role of the Secretary of State. That is not because we are now

I hope that the noble Baroness and the Government are reflecting on that before we get to further stages of this legislation. She could reassure me further by accepting the amendment and by ensuring that the Bill will make clear that MAAs are there for the purpose of helping local authorities better to achieve their targets, rather than tying them into agreements that they simply do not wish to have.</p>

<p><a name="09030350000036"></a>On the matter of targets, I have tabled two probing amendments&#151;Amendments 199 and 200&#151;which depend on one another. By tabling them I do not wish Members of the Committee to think that I am calling for local authorities to ignore improvement targets deliberately, but the Bill seems particularly inflexible. Must all improvement targets be paid equal regard? Does not the nature of a target allow for discretion? Will the Minister furnish the Committee with a likely example of improvement targets so that we can better understand what is being set up in the agreements?</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09030350000037"></a>As I said, this is a probing amendment, asked in the spirit of curiosity so that we can have more details of the Government&#146;s version of an MAA to consider.</p>

<p><a name="09030351000001"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0003.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09030351000014"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Sprinkled throughout this group is a series of clause stand parts, which I tabled with the idea that it would enable us to go through clause by clause to winkle out what they all mean. The noble Baroness will be pleased to learn that I shall not do that and do not want to add a great deal to what my noble friend Lord Tope and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09030351000002"></a>The purpose of tabling the clause stand parts was to ask the big question: why is Part 7 necessary? That is the fundamental question. My noble friend said we are favour of multi-area agreements in general. I have an exciting document, <I>Pennine Lancashire </I><I>Multi Area Agreement</I>. Perhaps I should declare an interest as a member of an authority whose leader signed the document in a recent ceremony at No. 10 Downing Street. Clearly, it was thought by the Government to be of some importance. There are lots of interesting things in it referring to government action 1, 2 and so on. It will be interesting to see what all those actions are. I shall not tell the Committee everything that is in the document, but there is some interesting stuff such as reinstating railway lines and services and things like that.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09030351000003"></a>Throughout the country, people are taking to multi-area agreements and are working hard to put them together. No doubt, we will have more as time goes on. If they are happening now and people are being summoned to Downing Street to sign them as if they are such a good thing, why do the Government already want to change the system before it has even got going? We have a multi-area agreement in what used to be called east Lancashire and is now called Pennine Lancashire. It will take some time for it to develop and for us to assess whether it is a sensible idea or whether having the MAA and the institutions that will follow, including a new development company, will be worth while, but the Government want to legislate already.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030351000004"></a>This was sold as voluntary. Local authorities did not dream it up; they were told that a new idea had come from above. The Government had talked to people in the local government world, so how about this idea? People thought it seemed like a good idea so they said, &#147;Let&#146;s do it&#148;. It was sold as voluntary, but there is now some suspicion that its voluntary nature will not be maintained. In their briefing papers, the Government say that it can be maintained and that new voluntary MAAs can be set up if that is what people want. Two kinds of MAAs&#151;voluntary and statutory&#151;will be set up under Part 7. I understand that there will be multi-area agreements and multi-area agreements with duties. The multi-area agreements with duties will be statutory. In my simple way, I believe that if you agree a document with partners and sign it, you are under a duty to do something about it. It does not require a statutory framework in which the Secretary of State penalises you for not doing something. There is a conceptual problem .</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030351000005"></a>Two lots of multi-area agreements&#151;some statutory and some voluntary&#151;is a recipe for confusion. They should at least be called different things. We all know what will happen. The people who want to set up voluntary agreements will be told, &#147;No, there is a new, chrome-plated better one now under Part 7 which can be statutory and that is what we want you to do&#148;. If people say that they would rather be voluntary, they will be told, &#147;You can be voluntary, but you won&#146;t get all the resources and money that you would get if you were statutory&#148;. We all know that in the real world that is how the Government get their way on all these things. If this is passed as it stands, I do not believe that in five or 10 years&#146; time there will be any voluntary multi-area agreements. They will all have been turned into chrome-plated multi-area agreements with duties. All the undesirable elements, such as the powers of the Secretary of State to which the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, referred, will effectively be imposed on people.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030351000006"></a>It is the same old thing. They will say, &#147;You can be poor if you want. You can be the paupers of local authorities. We don&#146;t mind, it&#146;s your decision, but if you want the resources to do something useful you must do it the way we want which is the statutory way&#148;. I do not think that any of this is necessary. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, that the proposal is not actively damaging in the way in which economic prosperity boards are damaging, in my view, but it is totally unnecessary. It is happening already. I have the proof here. The Government ought to be summoning people in five years&#146; time from Pennine Lancashire and all the other 20-odd places that have these documents to ask how MAAs are going. If they are not working, the Government can then legislate. They should not be legislating before MAAs have even started.</p>

We have reached Clause 116 and there is a sort of warmth creeping around the Committee. We are not now accused of doing damage, so there is a conditional welcome. Terrific. MMAs are voluntary. They are shared agreements between groups of local authorities  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC282"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC282</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and partners to deliver improvement targets&#151;I shall come to that point in a minute&#151;particularly in relation to economic development. They help to increase the co-ordination of policies that have an impact on growth at a level that reflects the boundaries of the local economy. The noble Lord asked the bold but necessary question: why do we need Part 7 at all? Why are we thinking about changing the system that has only just been set up?</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030351000008"></a>The Committee knows that MAAs have certainly proved increasingly popular among local authorities as a tool for improving economic prosperity. In July last year, we signed the first wave of MAAs with local authorities in seven sub-regional partnerships. Three further MAAs were signed last month. There are seven other local partnerships actively developing an MAA and one or two others considering the potential for one. I took the trouble to look at the sort of flexibilities and freedoms that the MAAs are beginning to negotiate, particularly in the light of what my noble friend said last week about the slow progress. I was struck by the commitment that local authorities are putting into multi-area agreements and the complexities that are clearly inherent in any system that seeks to achieve a better deal on flexibility for a local area. Whether we are talking about skills, employment, investment or any policy that can make a difference on the ground, it is a serious process. I understand a little more than I did last week about why it is a complex process and why it is slightly slower than we had hoped, but it is heartening to see all the work that is going into it.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030351000009"></a>I want to try to convince the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on this point. In bringing forward this legislation, we are responding to the wishes of MAAs. We are not creating statutory MAAs; they will remain voluntary. The majority of existing MAA partnerships has told us that agreements would have greater weight if they were put on a statutory footing similar to that of local area agreements. They are voluntary agreements with certain statutory powers, in particular, to make partnerships. This message came out clearly in responses to our consultation paper on the SNR last year. For example, the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities suggested that, once signed, MAAs should have the same status as LAAs and other partnerships, such as Tyne and Wear, said that a duty to co-operate should apply to MAAs. Consultees argued that doing this would strengthen local collaboration and bind partners more firmly into an agreed set of actions. Local authorities want that extra facility to ensure that partners place greater store on achieving those targets and on the contribution they are making to that end.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030351000010"></a>Essentially, the partnerships are looking for one thing: they should have a duty to co-operate in developing targets to be set out in the agreement and to have regard to them in exercising their functions. MAAs want to be more effective. That is how they see the greater effectiveness coming. They see that as a way of securing a higher level of commitment from local partners to the targets set out in the agreement, and Part 7 delivers that. MAAs are intended to complement rather than replace the existing model for MAAs. There is no requirement on any MMA to take that  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC283"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC283</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>road. It is entirely up to local people to decide the right thing to do. It gives them a further bit of engine power to bring their partners on board as a statutory requirement. Part 7 therefore brings forward legislation that allows local authorities to establish an MAA with statutory duties, to be referred to as MAAs with duties, to provide local authorities and partners to be placed under a duty to co-operate in developing the MAA and to have regard to the targets within the MAA that relate to their functions.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030351000011"></a>I shall come to specific points, but in relation to the targets themselves, we must remember that this is in the context of having a bonfire of targets, which are being reduced from more than 1,200 to 198. With reference to improvement targets, I seem to remember a Methodist hymn that we used to sing about getting better every day in every way. It would be foolish to abandon the principle of the objective of constant improvement. Indeed, as socialists we believe in the perfectibility of human beings, so we could hardly move away from an improvement target. We can always get better in everything we do.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030351000012"></a>Amendments 199 and 200 seek clarification on targets, and I can assure the noble Lord that Clause 125 does not specify that each local and partner authority must have regard to every target in the agreement&#151;that would be over the top&#151;but that they must have regard to every improvement target that relates to that body in the agreement. We have simply followed the wording of the 2007 Act. With that explanation, I hope that the Committee will understand why I cannot accept Amendments 197B, 197C and 198G, which remove the reference to targets. I hope that it is equally clear that we must resist Amendments 198J and 198K, which would remove the duty to co-operate: the very duty that local authorities are seeking.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030351000013"></a>Let me also reassure the Committee that the decision to proceed with an MAA with duties would come from the local authorities within the area concerned. The Government cannot direct local authorities to go down that route without a proposal from them; it is their decision. In addition, these provisions do not allow the Secretary of State to impose an ongoing duty to co-operate in respect of an MAA. Any agreement would need to specify the period for which it would apply. They also provide flexibility by allowing partners to submit proposals to the Secretary of State for revising any agreement, including changes to improvement targets set out in the agreement. We are not providing any restrictions on the area that could be covered by an MAA. This means that no area would automatically be precluded from entering an agreement, although we would expect any chosen area to reflect a functional economic area.</p>
<h5><a name="09030352000026"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000001"></a>Given that the intention behind this legislation is to bring MAAs on to the same statutory footing&#151;I use that in the limited sense in which I have been describing these extra powers&#151;it is only logical that the legislation broadly follows the provisions for LAAs as set out in Part 5 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. There is one crucial difference, however, because, unlike the LAAs, the Secretary of  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC284"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>State will not have the power to direct that a draft MAA be prepared unless a proposal has been received from a group of local authorities that wish to work together in this way. Therefore, the MAA with duties remains voluntary at inception.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000002"></a>Why does the Secretary of State need a power to direct at all? It is simply a formal mechanism. It provides the trigger for the duty for local authorities and partners to co-operate: the duty that local authorities have asked us for. The alternative would in fact be more burdensome. If we were to impose an undefined, open-ended duty to co-operate, it would weigh far heavier on authorities and their partners. With that explanation, I hope that the questions raised in Amendments 198B, 198C, 198E, 198H and 198F are satisfied.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000003"></a>Amendment 198A relates to consultation. The amendment would require the Secretary of State to consult all local authorities for the areas covered by the MAA in question before making an order changing the list of partner authorities. The amendment is not necessary because consultation with all local authorities via their representatives is already assured, in Clause 122, and the Secretary of State can consult individual authorities or groups of authorities as appropriate. Given the linkages with the list of LAA partners, it is likely that any changes to the lists of partner authorities for both MAAs and LAAs would be made in unison, and it is appropriate that the consultation requirements are the same.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000004"></a>I need to deal specifically with Amendment 197D, which would remove economic prosperity boards and combined authorities established under Part 6 from the list of local authorities set out in Clause 117. We have included EPBs and combined authorities on this list because both bodies will, in our opinion, be potentially important complementary mechanisms for delivering sub-regional collaboration among the constituent local authorities. MAAs and EPBs are different in form and function. MAAs articulate shared commitments between local and central government to delivering shared ambitions in the form of local and sub-regional targets. While the local authorities concerned may create governance arrangements&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Smith, talked about his joint committees, for example&#151;to support the delivery of targets, MAAs are not legal entities in themselves; they are not corporate or legal bodies and they cannot therefore employ staff or hold budgets. Local authorities already negotiate through MAAs flexible arrangements, protocols and agreements with Whitehall departments for the delivery of certain objectives&#151;on the delivery of skills training or worklessness programmes, for example&#151;but MAAs are not a mechanism for establishing robust sub-regional delivery arrangements, and there is a limit to what they will be able to achieve.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000005"></a>It may well be that the evolving MAAs will continue to be the preferred choice for many areas, but, as I said, some groups of authorities may look positively for a more powerful arrangement for sub-regional working through an economic prosperity board. It is perfectly possible for an EPB to coexist with an MAA: the former providing a strong governance arrangement, while the latter articulates the targets for the area. In some instances, the EPB and the MAA could agree  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC285"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC285</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the EPB as the delivery body would take over the delivery of some or all MAA targets. But whatever the relationship might be, the EPB could be a significant tool for the local authorities for delivering their ambitions as a whole. That is why it is included in Clause 117.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000006"></a>Amendment 198D would require that local authorities requesting the Secretary of State to give a direction for the preparation and submission of a draft MAA should include all local authorities for the proposed area, including non-unitary district councils. That is not in Clause 119. I have confirmed my willingness to consider again the role of district councils in agreeing an EPB scheme that covers their area where the whole county is covered.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000007"></a>District council involvement in MAAs is very different from the question of EPBs for the important reason that MAAs will be time-limited voluntary agreements to deliver targets, while EPBs will be corporate bodies with specific functions. EPBs have wider and more long-term implications for the economic development functions of a district council.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000008"></a>Clause 119 is drafted in this way to prevent the situation in which one district council in a large, complex two-tier area prevents the other local authorities in the area proceeding to an MAA. While there may be situations in which a non-unitary district council does not wish to be party to an agreement and to any targets set out in it, we do not believe that that should prevent other local authorities within the sub-region working together to deliver agreed targets. In such a scenario, we believe that the MAA covering the proposed area should proceed but that the district council concerned should not be bound by any targets to which it has not agreed. That is absolutely right and proper. The provisions achieve that. They require each district to be consulted in the formulation of the agreement but to be bound only by the targets to which it signs up. That is fair and logical in terms of what the MAA will be trying to do.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000009"></a>That said, it is clear that the views of other local authorities in the area will be relevant factors in the Secretary of State&#146;s decision whether to issue a direction. If one or more district councils in an area voiced strong opposition to an agreement, it would clearly be material to the consideration of any such request for a Secretary of State direction, particularly if such an area were key to the delivery of the ambitions for the functional economic area.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000010"></a>Were this amendment to succeed, if a district council decided to exclude itself from the request to the Secretary of State, it could in effect block the rest of the authorities in the area from taking advantage and going forward as they would want to into an MAA with duties. A possible alternative might be to redefine the area of the MAA to exclude the area of the district council, but in many cases that would not be workable and would have a negative impact on the ability of the agreement to deliver, especially if there were a hole in the middle of the economic area. I hope that my assurances have addressed the noble Lord&#146;s concerns and that he understands why the amendment is not necessary.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000011"></a>I am getting towards the end. I think that Amendment 201 may be the final amendment. It would allow any local authority to withdraw from an  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC286"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC286</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>MAA at any time as part of any revision proposal. I understand that noble Lords are concerned that local authorities may find themselves tied into commitments that they no longer feel able to achieve. However, this amendment is not appropriate. MAAs with duties are responding to a desire for a more robust and sustainable partnership to achieve shared objectives. If local authorities that had signed up were able to walk away from an MAA, that could undermine its stability and purpose. I return to the point that MAAs are time-limited agreements, typically for three to five years, so local authorities would not be signing up for indefinite, intolerable commitments. MAA targets are voluntary at the outset for all local authorities.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000012"></a>The Bill allows an MAA to be revised with the Secretary of State&#146;s approval. Such a revision proposal could include changes to improvement targets specified in an agreement and the removal of targets, but that would be a proper adjustment, whereas giving local authorities the freedom simply to walk away from obligations that they have entered into is different. That is why I think the Bill is right in this respect. I hope I have addressed all the amendments. I shall have to read <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow to make sure. If I have not, I will do so in writing.</p>

<p><a name="09030352000013"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030352000028"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I have two or three points for the Minister. I am very pleased that she said they are voluntary and will not be imposed. We note that and will underline it lots of times in <I>Hansard</I>. Will MMAs be able to set their own targets? As the Minister knows, because she has worked with Essex a lot, we have to agree our LAA targets with government. We are happy to do that because we have debates and arguments, but in the end there is a compromise.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000014"></a>How will the MAA targets be agreed? I hope that they will be agreed by the partners. Are we going to have to agree those targets with government? Who will agree those targets? Will it be the constituent bodies in MAAs? That is a very important point. If they are going to be voluntary, they should be agreed not by the Secretary of State or by the government offices, as it happens.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000015"></a>Secondly, I am disappointed because I imagine MAAs and officials from one part or another being able to deliver projects. That is the cheapest way to do it. What concerns me about the EPBs is that they will set up a great bureaucracy like the RDAs. We could deliver the RDA money in local authorities much better than RDAs deliver the projects that they do. One does not want to see a great bureaucracy around the EPBs, because that would be a mistake. In the MAAs, I can see one authority helping to deliver a project and another authority delivering a project, a little like the authority in Kent to whom I talked this afternoon. That would be the cheapest way of doing it, rather than setting up new bureaucracies. That is where I see a better future for the MAAs than the EPBs. The EPBs could have 50 employees and not do very much at all. When we are trying to cut down bureaucracy and deliver projects, it must be the right way to do it. I was disappointed to hear that the MAAs would not deliver things. Of course we have to deliver things and improve on things. That can be done by seconding or using various authorities to

That is the point that I hope the Minister will clarify, because I see MAAs as being able to deliver things.</p>

<p><a name="09030352000016"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09030352000029"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> In a minute, I will follow up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. I was fascinated by the explanation given by the noble Baroness of what socialism was all about and how it was all to do with the perfectibility of human beings. From my perspective, she got that rather more from her Methodism than from her socialism, but I was wondering, in all this discussion of socialism, whether she was speaking collectively on behalf of the Government. That would be interesting to know, but I do not expect her to answer that.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made an important point. The MAA may or may not, in the Minister&#146;s phrase, be a &#147;robust delivery vehicle&#148;. There is no reason why it cannot be associated with a robust delivery vehicle. The point that some of us would make is that if a delivery vehicle is required that is not there at the moment, either because it does not cover a large enough area or because there is nothing that can carry out the scale of investment and development that is required among any of the existing local authorities, it can be created. Local authorities can create companies that can carry out development, which can be robust and purely voluntary, and do not have to go cap in hand to the Secretary of State: perhaps cap in hand is the wrong phrase. They do not have to keep giving pieces of paper to the Secretary of State to sign and say, &#147;Yes, we agree with this and we do not agree with that&#148;. That is certainly what the people who have set up the multi-area agreement in Pennine Lancashire have in mind. In a different context, I might argue whether it was desirable to set up such a delivery vehicle. That is what they intend to do and that is what will happen.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000018"></a>At a purely district level in Pendle, we have set up a joint venture company between the council and a major local developer, which is a pretty robust delivery vehicle. You can already see some of the impressive results of that delivery vehicle in Nelson. It is designed at a district level. It is possible to set up these things at the moment and to achieve development, and it will be possible for multi-area agreement authorities to do so collectively, jointly and voluntarily if that is what they want to do. It seems to me that an EPB is a more bureaucratic, legalistic, entrenched and difficult way of doing it, as the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield suggested.</p>

I genuinely thank her and her colleague the noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford, for their tolerance and forbearance in the face of an overt attempt to point out the dangers of the Bill and the idiocies of parts of it. We do not apologise in any way for doing that; it is what the Committee is for. It has performed a useful function, and done what it should have done. We have discovered that we disagree on some things, and on others have discovered that our

I hope that we will find a meeting of minds on some of these issues on Report. Where we disagree, we will continue to disagree, but at least we will not spend so much time over it as we have established the lines of engagement.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000020"></a>I genuinely thank both the Ministers. They have found some of us to be a total irritation in this Committee, but that is what we are here for: to ensure that this legislation is not nonsense and is not dangerous.</p>

<p><a name="09030352000021"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09030352000030"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I shall reply to that point. My excursion into socialism and/or Methodism is prompted by the fact that I feel demob happy because my noble friend Lord Brett is taking the next three groups of amendments to the last part of the Bill. I am glad that he is doing that. I know that my noble friend Lord Patel has not done this, but I am sure that I have shown signs of irritation, which I regret. That is not what Ministers should do when faced with the scrutiny process. I am grateful to Members of the Committee for taking the time to go into the Bill and do their job. I am perfectly content with that, and I look forward to Report.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000022"></a>On the questions of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, as I follow the making of MAAs, albeit at a distance, I can tell him that the process is very much the same as for LAAs. The targets are voluntarily agreed by the partners and the local authorities. They then enter that process of negotiation, which he will understand, having been involved in an Essex LAA. There is a process of mediation and negotiation with government offices, and they are necessarily signed off by the Secretary of State. However, the process is more focused because, in the MAAs, there may be fewer targets than in LAAs generally. Again, if the noble Lord would benefit from my explaining the process in more detail, I would be happy to do so, and to share some of our examples of the sorts of protocols and agreements on flexibilities and so on that are sought.</p>

I shall try to resist the temptation to stray into a debate on the nature of socialism. I merely recognise that it is possibly the first time that that word has been used in this place for a number of years. In my Methodist upbringing, all the Methodists I knew were Liberals, and that was in the days when it was all right to call yourself a socialist.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09030352000024"></a>That was a very large group of amendments. We have covered a lot of ground&#151;indeed, a whole Part of the Bill&#151;and have all expressed at least general support to multi-area agreements. I think that the Minister herself said that she would need to read <I>Hansard </I>to know and understand what she had or had not said. That certainly applies to the rest of us. I thank her very much for her full reply to those amendments. I shall certainly read <I>Hansard</I> carefully. Even more importantly, my absent friend Lady Hamwee will read it especially carefully. We will consider what we may wish to do further at a later stage.</p>

<p><a name="09030352000025"></a>In the mean time, I join in the general thanks to the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Patel, for their patience and tolerance throughout our consideration of the Bill. If there have been occasional moments of irritation on the part of the Minister, we on this side of the Committee simply put that down to the recognition that we were right and that that part of the Bill was clearly wrong. It is understandable that anyone would feel irritated at being put in that position. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Some of us would have liked to have reached this point a little earlier, but this is the eighth day in Committee, so there is a certain symmetry to reaching Part 8. Part 8 is a discrete part of the Bill; it does not have a great deal of connection with all the parts of the Bill that we have dealt with so far. I make no complaint about that because if Her Majesty&#146;s Government think, as they surely do, that some improvements can be made to the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, this is a convenient vehicle and that is fine with me. Indeed, I take the view, as my noble friend the Minister will appreciate, that Part 8 can be improved further by my amendments to what I will now call the construction Act 1996. My noble friend the Minister will be aware that behind these amendments lies a great deal of skill and energy of the Specialist Engineering Contractors&#146; Group, which is really an umbrella body for a number of significant trade associations in the construction industry, which comprises some 60,000 firms in total.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000002"></a>The 1996 Act has been very helpful for the construction industry. It introduced a right of adjudication as a speedy and inexpensive method of resolving disputes, ostensibly on a temporary basis, but in many cases provided a sticking and more lasting settlement. Unfortunately, over the 10 years since then, bespoke procedures have commonly been inserted in construction contracts. Apart from the minimum of eight adjudication requirements set out in the statute, contract procedures can prevail.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000003"></a>Freedom of contract is a fine concept, which is especially valid when parties to the contract are of similar bargaining strengths and each is advised by a lawyer who is well able to seek their way through every aspect of the contract. However, in the construction industry, most smaller and medium-sized enterprises, including subcontractors, do not have that facility.  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC291"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC291</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Fairness between all parties&#151;major contractors, subcontractors, SMEs in their thousands&#151;suggests that the statutory scheme of adjudication, which the 1996 Act introduced, should be a mandatory, self-contained scheme that cannot be overridden by contractual provisions that diverge from the scheme.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000004"></a>The Government have recognised that bespoke adjudication procedures, devised no doubt by major contractors on a take-it-or-leave-it basis for other contracting parties, can result in abuse. For example, it has been decided that the Bill in Clause 135 should ban any clause requiring the party referring a dispute to adjudication to pay the other side&#146;s legal costs, even when the decision is in his favour. We are hardly likely to have the convenient vehicle of primary legislation frequently enough&#151;every year or two&#151;to cope with some of the other abuses that may arise.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000005"></a>Surely it would be better to have a standard procedure as provided by the principal amendment in this group, Amendment 204A. Greater fairness and clarity would be achieved. I understand that that small but vital member of the Commonwealth, New Zealand, has introduced construction contracts whereby all are subject to adjudication procedure. Perhaps we should follow that, as we have done in other matters, such as the parliamentary ombudsman scheme which we are now so proud of. We may not even remember that it originated from somewhere else in the Commonwealth.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000006"></a>My other amendments in this group are consequential on that basic proposition of having one mandatory adjudication scheme. One of the amendments bans contractual provisions that require a party to provide security for any costs incurred by the other party. That is similar to the provision in Clause 135 that the Government themselves are dealing with, and disallows provision for costs made after giving notice of intention to go to adjudication. That is because allocation of costs is inappropriate to an adjudication system where there are no winners or losers. In any case, a clause enabling people to give notice after they intend to go to adjudication providing for costs could easily be abused.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000007"></a>One final aspect of this collection of amendments is in proposed new Section 108(6), which enables easy enforcement of debts irrespective of counterclaims, as is the case where a cheque is dishonoured. The cheque must be paid, irrespective of some counterclaim that it is feasible someone may have. I have argued the main point of the amendments. I beg to move.</p>

The amendment has been suggested by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors to remedy what it sees as some unintended consequences in Clause 135. The purpose of that clause is to eliminate what have been known as the Bridgeway v Tolent clauses in construction contracts. The clauses made the referring party responsible for all costs of the adjudication, including the legal costs of the other side, regardless of the merits of the case. This was thought to be a disincentive to using adjudication to resolve disputes.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC292"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000009"></a>Clause 135 introduces a new Section 108A into the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996. It is maintained that the Bill will make void the allocation of fees and expenses between parties as contained in current standard contract forms. Unless the parties reach an agreement after the notice of intention to refer the dispute, the adjudicator will no longer be able to allocate fees and expenses between the parties.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000010"></a>The amendment would remedy that situation. Without the amendment, the mischief of the Bridgeway v Tolent clauses will prevail, and there will be an absence of agreement on costs in proposed new Section 108(2). Without the default provision in the amendment, the referring party will have to pay the adjudicator&#146;s fees and expenses, even if it has won. These costs are a significant consideration, particularly to small and medium-sized enterprises, and they will have to be met from the principal sum claimed, thus discounting a sum of money to which the referring party had entitlement.</p>

<p><a name="09030355000011"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09030355000037"></a>Lord Brett:</b> The noble Lord, in moving his amendment, referred to the 1996 Act, from which these proposals arise as a review. He also pointed out the Specialist Engineering Contractors&#146; Group, described it and said that it was the motivator behind the amendments. It has to be said, both in 1996 and since, that there has continued to be widespread consultation within the construction industry. While it is true that the amendments have the support of one of the organisations in that industry, it is equally true that when the review commenced there were a number of organisations that thought that an amendment was not required, and they were rather larger in number.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000012"></a>Equally, others have made their view known subsequently, having seen how far the Government have got in their review, that they do not wish the issue to be taken further. They have indicated reluctance to see the Government take matters further as set out in the amendments. I offer that not as a representative view of government policy, but simply to point out that we move on the basis of consultation and responses, and there has been quite widespread consultation. The responses are not universal, as noble Lords might expect, but there is substantial support for some parts of the Government&#146;s proposals rather than others.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000013"></a>The noble Lord is concerned that the Government&#146;s proposals to revise the adjudication provisions of 1996 do not go far enough. He would like to see the introduction of a single statutory scheme that applies to all the commercial arrangements covered by the 1996 Act. That Act intentionally covers a wide range of contracts between a number of organisations in the construction supply chain. It applies to the main contractor&#146;s contract with the subcontractor&#151;that is the one we tend to hear about a lot, and we have heard something about it today. It equally applies to a construction client&#146;s contract with the main contractor or with his architect, just as it can apply to a sub-contractor&#146;s contract with a further sub-contractor to that body.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000014"></a>Whatever we introduce must work in a fairly broad range of commercial relationships. Therefore, it will have to command the respect of a wide part of the  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC293"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>industry. Following extensive consultation, we have introduced provisions elsewhere to deal with the key issues that have come to light in the decade or so since the operation of the 1996 Act&#151;the application of the Act to oral and partly oral contracts being precisely such a point. Given that, I continue to believe that the flexible approach is the right approach; it strikes a sensible balance and is the approach most able to cope with a broad range of commercial relationships.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000015"></a>SMEs exist in large numbers throughout the construction supply industry as the noble Lord indicated. ONS data show that some 99.9 per cent of firms in the construction contracting sector are SMEs. The Bill directly addresses the interest of the broad range of SMEs in the construction supply chain.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000016"></a>We will be moving on to payment issues, but in terms of adjudication we are taking specific measures to address the key issues which have been raised with us by the industry during our review. The first is the ability of a party with greater clout to use the costs of the adjudication process as a barrier by, for example, requiring that the weaker party pays all the costs of the adjudication, irrespective of where they arise. We have prevented the use of such clauses.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000017"></a>The second concerns the problems caused by the current requirement that all the non-trivial terms of the contract have to be in writing for the 1996 Act to be in place. We are removing that restriction. Given those changes, Introducing a single statutory adjudication scheme would be something of a legislative sledgehammer to crack a nut. Having said that, there is support&#151;and it is perhaps wider than we have heard it voiced today, but not universal&#151;for the introduction of a single scheme for adjudication. That would not be unreasonable. Therefore, we have made an offer to the industry that we will conduct a thorough review of the existing adjudication scheme set out in secondary legislation when we make amendments to this secondary legislation as a consequence of the changes we are making to the 1996 Act.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000018"></a>The Construction Umbrella Bodies Adjudication Task Group, comprising representatives from all the key sectors of the industry, is meeting this month to decide whether or how to take forward this approach. That shows the Government&#146;s desire to meet the broad wishes of the industry to be flexible and not to set our face against the proposal, but on this occasion to seek to ensure that that proposal carries rather greater support than it has in the discussions so far. Therefore, we must resist the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09030355000019"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09030355000038"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> I declare an interest as president of the Specialist Engineering Contractors&#146; Group. My noble friend laid great stress on the concept of consensus across the industry. He also pointed out that 99.9 per cent of the businesses involved in the construction industry are SMEs. I get the impression that a number of organisations comprise a relatively small part of the industry compared with the number of SMEs&#151;the people who have not been properly looked after in this respect. What does he mean by consensus? Is it the agreement of a group of trade associations or the majority of businesses in an industry? At the moment, I get the impression that a number of small trade associations are quite well represented in  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC294"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>terms of their influence in the industry, but the businesses affected, the SMEs, constitute a far bigger majority but have only one umbrella organisation looking after them. Therefore, the consensus is not well defined.</p>

In the United Nations, where I spent a number of years, consensus was described as the point at which no one changes their opinion but recognises that they have agreed as far as possible. That became the consensus. The truth is that there will always be contrary views.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000021"></a>As I have said, 99 per cent of the companies in the industry are SMEs. That is about 250,000 firms. With all due respect to the noble Lord, I understood him to say that the SEC Group represents some 60,000 firms. Sixty thousand into 250,000 suggests that there are one or two other groups outside that area, so we would look at more than those companies. I mentioned that several organisations have commented and given the Government the benefit of their views which, as I said, did not always conform by any means with the views of the SEC Group. They included the National Specialist Contractors Council, the Construction Clients&#146; Group, the Federation of Master Builders, the British Property Federation, the National Federation of Builders, the UK Contractors Group and the Civil Engineering Contractors Association. There is a very broad group, which is why the Government, having held that consultation, and given that the contracts cover many of the participants from those organisations, are of the view that resisting the amendments at this stage is the correct course of action, and I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09030355000022"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09030355000040"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> I am sorry that my noble friend has taken that view particularly strongly in the last few moments. When I made the point that the Bill was very welcome in that it banned clauses that tried to allocate responsibility for legal costs when there was no fault on the part of that party, I mentioned other similar clauses that typically existed and asked how they were to be dealt with except by some future legislation, which I suggested was unlikely to be just a year or two off and was much more likely to be at least a decade away. Unfortunately, the Minister has left it at that.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000023"></a>As far as I understood him, he has not indicated much, if any, support for the notion that a standard scheme for all could be devised with fairness for all in mind and that that would be much better than trying to deal ad hoc with abuses, as and when they arise, some of which cannot be foreseen by him, by me or by anyone else. It is a pity that he has taken that view. Of course I must consider fully at this stage what he has been saying, and withdraw my amendment.</p>

In our view, this extra limb is simply not necessary, as such a provision would be an agreement on the allocation of costs and should already be caught. In any case, such a provision cannot exist in the absence of an agreement on the allocation of costs. I am sorry if my robust response seemed to be too robust, but I made the point, which I repeat, that the matter is to be discussed at the construction umbrella body&#146;s adjudication task force meeting this month. The Government wait to see whether there will be consensus, or whatever other collective noun the noble Lord wants to use, at that meeting to ask the Government to review this matter further. So the matter is not absolutely closed.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000026"></a>The noble Lord reminded me of the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, which I have not addressed. I shall now do so. The noble Baroness is concerned that, in the absence of a cost-sharing agreement, not allowing the adjudicator to recover his costs from both parties will act as a disincentive to adjudication. At the moment, the referring party may be disinclined to refer a dispute to adjudication, as he alone would be responsible for the costs. Likewise, there may be some reluctance on the part of the adjudicator to proceed if he is concerned that he may not get paid because he cannot look to both parties for payment.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000027"></a>The noble Baroness would like to introduce an amendment that provided for the adjudicator to award his costs where the parties have not addressed the issue in a valid agreement: in other words, where they have not entered into an agreement after a dispute has arisen about costs. Interestingly, the draft Bill that the Government published in June 2008 contained a provision broadly similar to that now proposed. However, it was overwhelmingly rejected by the industry because, among other reasons, it was complicated. We found that the original provision had to address other issues beyond the narrow cost-awarding power and, in doing so, it became necessarily complicated. Given the scale of this rejection by stakeholders, the Government decided to keep the policy simple and transparent.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030355000028"></a>I therefore resist the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment. However, we accept that it is current industry custom and practice for the adjudicator to award his fees and expenses and we will write to the noble Baroness to see if we can identify a way forward. I hope that, with that, the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

It is commonly understood in the construction industry that many small firms suffer through poor payment practices. SMEs are mainly, of course, the subcontractors in the supply chain; they are the heating and electrical contractors, the plumbers, glaziers and others. One hardly needs a crystal ball to assert that, at a time of recession like this, SMEs are at greater risk than ever, whether in this industry or otherwise.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030357000002"></a>My amendments to Clauses 137 and 138 would simplify the whole procedure. That in itself would be a great boon to small enterprises which do not have ranks of advisers to support them. It would make the procedure fairer to all parties, and there would be less bureaucracy by enabling the payee&#151;the person who has been doing the work and supplying the goods&#151;and only the payee to issue the initial payment notice. This is, after all, what other industries do. The payer does not give the initial payment request. As I understand it, and I hope that this conforms with the advice given   


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC297"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC297</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the Minister, well known organisations such as the Chartered Institute of Building and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors also take this view that the payee and only the payee should issue the initial payment requirement.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030357000003"></a>If the payer, as the Government propose as an alternative, is the most likely person to give the initial notice, a challenge to that payment request could be made only by going to adjudication. Of course, under the scheme proposed by my amendments, when the payee issues the initial invoice, as it were, on the payment due, the payer may wish to challenge that. He may wish to say, &#147;This is not what was agreed&#148;, &#147;The work has not been done properly&#148; or, &#147;The goods delivered are defective&#148;. The payer, as the Bill allows, may also wish to issue a notice to pay less than the notified sum.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90303-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030357000004"></a>However, we say in these amendments that it is sensible to impose some kind of limit and that the payer&#146;s notice that the payment should be less than the amount notified must be issued not later than 14 days after the payment due date. Without such a limit, which Clause 138 does not require, SMEs would find it difficult to manage their cash flow effectively, because the payer could issue a notice of reduced payment at the last moment before the final date for payment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09030357000005"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09030357000022"></a>Lord Brett:</b> The noble Lord has characterised the payment framework set out in the Bill as being ineffective by not improving the lot of SMEs in the construction supply chain. As with adjudication, he is concerned that the Bill does not go far enough. I have to repeat that there has been wide consultation, and there has not been a consensus among every organisation offering views. On this issue, perhaps the SEC Group finds itself in a smaller minority than on the adjudication issues.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030357000006"></a>As we said earlier, 99 per cent of firms in construction are SMEs. The main contractor is not always a large firm and the subcontractor is not always a small firm. The legislation will be effective in improving cash flow for SMEs in all sectors of the construction industry. The noble Lord&#146;s amendments suggest two main changes to statutory payment. They create a position whereby only a payee can issue the statutory payment notice and introduce a statutory period within which a notice amending that amount can be revised.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030357000007"></a>The position under the 1996 Act is that only the payer may issue the statutory payment notice. This Bill removes that restriction and allows the payer, the payee or a third party&#151;for example, an architect working for a customer&#151;to issue the notice. We leave it for the parties to agree in contract who should issue the notice. The reason for doing this is to be permissive by allowing a broad range of commercial practices to continue unburdened by legislation. We do not prevent the payee-led process suggested by the noble Lord&#151;far from it; we are expressly allowing it. However, in addition we are allowing others to use processes which reflect their own commercial logic should they see fit.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030357000008"></a>The second main change which the noble Lord seeks is the introduction of a statutory period within which a notice amending the amount in the payment  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC298"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>notice may be revised. His amendment suggests that this should be within nine days of the issue of the payment notice. The Bill leaves the timing of this notice as a matter for contract. I will put freedom-of-contract considerations to one side and set out why I believe that the practical effect of such an amendment may be detrimental&#151;indeed, it would be detrimental. Introducing a statutory period within which a sum due can be revised would have the following effects as people sought to protect their own cash flow situation by ensuring they did not overpay. People would simply extend payment periods to take account of the time taken away from them by statutory intervention. They can also be extremely conservative in their valuation of work undertaken.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030357000009"></a>While this intervention may provide the payee with greater certainty of what will arrive in his or her bank account on the final date for payment, it will do so at the expense of extending payment periods and reducing the amount of cash which is actually flowing. The objective of the review of the Construction Act which was announced in the 2004 Budget was to identify what improvements could be made to prevent unreasonable delays in payment. These amendments would have the direct effect of actually increasing delays in payment.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030357000010"></a>The noble Lord raised complexity and the search for a simpler system. Legislation needs to be crafted to incorporate a number of possible scenarios, but the underlying process is a simple one. A payment notice is served, setting out the sum considered to be due; that sum can be revised; and the sum becomes payable. This underlying process will be incorporated into contracts. Contracts will clearly set out who is responsible for issuing the payment notice. I cannot see any complexity in that.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030357000011"></a>Again, the Government are trying to come forward with improvements that are appreciated across the industry. I entirely agree with the noble Lord that the industry is in difficulty in the present economic circumstances, although not uniquely so. I hope, in the light of my response, that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09030357000012"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030357000023"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> I do not find the Minister&#146;s answers entirely satisfactory. He used the word &#147;permissive&#148;. I felt that the provision in the Bill is too permissive in allowing the payer, the payee or somebody else to issue a notice. Of course, I will look at <I>Hansard</I> carefully to see what the Minister has said, but I did not hear an explanation as to why construction should be different from every other industry and profession, where bills are sent out by the person who has done the work or supplied the goods. That simplicity seems to be lacking in the Government&#146;s scheme. However, as I say, I must look at <I>Hansard</I> carefully. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p class="amendment_hs_quote"><a name="09030357000019"></a>In the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 (c. 53) in section 113 (prohibition of conditional payment provisions), omit the following&#151;</p>

They have insolvency in common, but they are actually quite different. I am not complaining about the grouping, but I must deal with them separately.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030357000014"></a>First, on Amendment 217A, SMEs are concerned&#151;especially, I repeat, in difficult economic times like these&#151;that perhaps considerable sums, or sums which mean a lot to them and that they are due, may be left owing to them if the payer goes into insolvency. In this new clause, firms would have a right to request adequate security for payment. Failure to provide such would give the payee the right to suspend performance of his contract. In other words, this would give a pre-emptive strike to, let us say, a subcontractor who, for some reason, is anxious to ensure that he will be paid for the work done and is seeking security to that end.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030357000015"></a>Amendment 206A deals with an entirely different problem of insolvency. Generally, the 1996 Act outlawed any arrangements by which the paying party, usually the main contractor, makes payment conditional on receipt of payment from somebody else&#151;some other player upstream. Unfortunately, the 1996 Act continues to allow a contractor to refuse payment to his supply chain if money was not forthcoming because of a client&#146;s insolvency. Amendment 206A would end that. My view is simple. I ask the Minister whether he agrees or disagrees with the statement that a contractor should not be allowed to refuse payment for work that has been properly done just because there is insolvency up the line and the contractor will not be paid by  the client. Most respondents to the Government&#146;s consultation on this in 2005 favoured what I propose in Amendment 206A. I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="09030359000016"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09030359000001"></a><b><a name="90303-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09030359000017"></a>Lord Brett:</b> The noble Lord seeks in both his amendments to protect firms from the effects of insolvency elsewhere in the supply chain. This is a laudable aim, but in seeking to provide this protection for some we must be sure that we do not disadvantage other businesses, be they in construction or other industries. We accept that the construction sector faces difficulties, but it is not alone in that. Other sectors are in the same position.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC300"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column GC300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030359000002"></a>On the point that he makes about the 1996 Act and the reflected view that he now suggests requires us to make these changes, we have consulted the industry extensively on whether there is a better solution than the compromise we currently have in the 1996 Act that would deliver a fairer result for all. There is no clear evidence that the removal of the current insolvency exception will achieve this, so the Government&#146;s view is that the only sensible option is to maintain the status quo.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030359000003"></a>Amendment 217A raises the question of the impact of insolvency which we believe has to be seen on a broader front rather than a narrow one. We therefore have difficulty with the proposal. Both the amendments impact on insolvency. He suggests that we delete the insolvency exception to the prohibition of the so-called &#147;pay-when-paid&#148; clause. Let us be clear that that insolvency exception was a significant part of the compromise that marked the introduction of the 1996 Act. The construction industry is unique in that pay-when-paid clauses are prohibited by statute. The exception is there for good reason. It is to continue to allow construction firms the same protection from the risks of insolvency as businesses in other industries. We need to maintain a level playing field across business sectors.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030359000004"></a>Further, the noble Lord suggests that after Clause 139 we introduce an amendment which provides a statutory right for a firm in a construction supply chain to receive adequate security in respect of the contract. Where no security is forthcoming, he suggests that the payee may suspend performance until it is. In such a case, the payer will have to pay the payee an additional sum reflecting the extra costs which the payee incurs in stopping work. That is a situation that appears to be uncomfortably close to double jeopardy.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030359000005"></a>It is, of course, open to that firm to request such a guarantee during the normal course of business. By making it a statutory right, we would again be creating an uneven playing field between firms in the construction industry and businesses in other industries who have no such statutory right. The practical effect in the case of insolvency is that non-construction creditors could be severely prejudiced and as unsecured creditors there would be fewer assets left to satisfy their claims. Although we share the desire of the noble Lord and those in the industry to look for a fairer solution than the one that we currently have in the extensive consultation neither a better solution nor a consensus to adopt a solution similar to that set out in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment was forthcoming. On that basis, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</p>

To refresh the memory of the Committee, they dealt with the Guild of Freemen and the rights, especially of women, to succeed to membership of local guilds. They also dealt with the important question of the honorary freedom given to individuals. I was delighted then, and I repeat my thanks to the Minister and her colleagues for being so helpful, understanding and supportive of this matter. I am sure that the amendment will improve the situation of local democracy&#151;which is what it is all about&#151;in the way that we want. Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to move the amendment.</p>

It was an admirable debate and, very properly, the noble Lord expressed his pleasure and thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews. It would have been perfectly in order, since we are in Committee, for me to have intervened and expressed my thanks to her at that stage, but it always seemed to me to be a trifle impolite to intervene after the noble Lord&#151;in this case the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton&#151;had thanked her, having moved the lead amendment.</p>

<a name="90303-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030359000011"></a>I seek now to express my warm thanks to the Minister. She indicated towards the end of the debate on 3 February that she was prepared to accept all the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, all of which I also supported. I thank the Minister for having accepted those amendments. As will have been clear from what the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, said, they have given great pleasure to very many people; not least people in the Cinque Ports, whose right to create honorary freemen had been taken away. That right will now be restored through this legislation when it is passed.</p>

<p><a name="09030359000012"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, indicated several times over the past two years that if a suitable legislative opportunity arose, she would support the proposals, helping, among others, the people in the Cinque Ports. She has been as good as her word, and I thank her for that. I also ask her to pass on warm thanks to her officials, both in her private office and elsewhere in her department. Will she also pass on thanks to her lawyers, who have been of great assistance in preparing for these matters? As a lawyer, I have noticed that we do not very often get many thanks, so it gives me very great pleasure to offer thanks to her lawyers. In court, I found it appropriate on one or two occasions to thank my opponents; but I did not find it possible to thank them all. I thank the lawyers for the advice that they have given the noble Baroness.</p>

Noble Lords will appreciate that it was quite a challenge to look at the legislation and to make sense of it in the way that was needed. I am very pleased that we were able to do so.

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09030335000003"></a><b><a name="90303-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09030335000046"></a>The Attorney-General (Baroness Scotland of Asthal):</b> My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary and I are today publishing the Government&#146;s response to Baroness Neuberger&#146;s report on volunteering across the criminal justice system. We are grateful to Baroness Neuberger for her work on the report and for highlighting the key role of volunteers across the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09030335000004"></a>We recognise and value the huge contribution that thousands of volunteers make right across the CJS. We have already taken important steps to strengthen the role of volunteering and we will drive this work forward as part of our commitment to promote community engagement and active citizenship and to deliver first-class public services. This is why my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Shahid Malik), who leads on community involvement in justice issues, has been appointed as the cross CJS ministerial champion for volunteering.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09030335000005"></a>Our focus is on practical action that enables volunteers to contribute to the delivery of high quality value-for-money services. It is also important that people from all backgrounds are encouraged and empowered to play their part.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09030335000006"></a>The champion will work with criminal justice agencies to identify practical opportunities to enhance their work through the use of volunteers and improve our engagement with the community.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09030335000007"></a>Copies of the Government&#146;s response have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies of the response will be available on the Criminal Justice System website at <a href="http://www.cjsonline.gov.uk">www.cjsonline.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="09030335000052"></a>Public Investment</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="09030335000008"></a><b><a name="90303-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09030335000047"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> My right honourable friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Yvette Cooper) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09030335000009"></a>I am announcing government action today to ensure vital PFI infrastructure projects will go forward as planned despite current financial market conditions, so they can support jobs and the economy.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09030335000010"></a>This action will ensure that crucial and valuable public investment will not be disrupted by problems in the financial markets. In total, &#163;13 billion of public investment in procurement will be safeguarded. This protection will assure the future of a broad range of public infrastructure projects including &#163;3.5 billion of waste treatment and environmental projects, &#163;3.1 billion of transport projects and &#163;2.4 billion of schools projects.  


<notus-date day="3" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS48"></a><b>3 Mar 2009 : Column WS48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It will also avoid the significant delays which would be entailed by switching these projects to alternative procurement approaches. These projects can therefore go ahead swiftly and support jobs and the economy and help prepare the country for the future recovery.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09030335000011"></a>Around 110 PFI projects are currently in the pipeline, and PFI projects make up typically 10 per cent of public capital investment. PFI projects have consistently demonstrated value for money and high levels of user satisfaction in vital areas of public service delivery.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09030335000012"></a>PFI projects continue to be able to secure equity as private construction companies and investors are still willing to put money in and bear the risk of delays or cost overruns, rather than the taxpayer. Some projects, however, are finding difficulties obtaining sufficient debt as a result of the global credit crunch.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09030335000013"></a>From today the Government will lend to those PFI projects that cannot raise sufficient debt finance on acceptable terms, lending alongside commercial lenders and the European Investment Bank. It will also be able, where necessary, to provide the full amount of senior debt required by a project. Funding will be provided from across government, including initially from unallocated funds and departmental underspends on previous projects. Equity investors will continue to bear the primary risk in these projects and, where available, private sector debt will continue to be provided.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09030335000014"></a>The Government believe it is vital to get these infrastructure projects under way as swiftly as possible&#151;to support jobs and the economy this year as well as delivering important public services. Switching to alternative procurement methods or conventional funding and for these projects at this late stage would incur significant additional delays or risk projects failing. For that reason, we have decided that providing additional debt finance is the most effective way to get construction under way swiftly and support the economy.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09030335000015"></a>Retaining the PFI structure will mean that the private sector will continue to bear the risk of cost overruns and delays. A recent Ipsos MORI report on the operational benefits of PFI has shown that contract managers are highly positive about the overall performance of PFI projects, contract service levels are being achieved and user satisfaction is high.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09030335000016"></a>The Treasury will use professional lending skills, and intends to lend to projects only where appropriate funding is not available from the market. It will be a temporary intervention. As with normal commercial lending these loans will bear interest and will be repaid over the life of the project. The Treasury envisages, however, selling the loans it makes prior to their maturity when favourable market conditions return.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09030335000017"></a>I have agreed that all PFI projects in procurement (that have, to date, issued a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU)) will be eligible for this finance from the Government. Future projects intending to go to market soon will also be eligible, provided they meet the usual value-for-money and affordability criteria, and subject to Treasury approval before issuing their OJEU notice.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09030335000019"></a>I am today announcing that &#163;919 million of capital spending on schools and children&#146;s play areas will be brought forward from 2010-11 to 2009-10.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09030335000020"></a>Of the total, &#163;499 million is allocated among 116 local authorities. These authorities bid to have expenditure brought forward in response to an invitation we issued following last November&#146;s Pre-Budget Report.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09030335000021"></a>&#163;390 million of capital funding devolved direct to all schools in England is also being brought forward to invest in smaller projects as they see fit. In addition, &#163;30 million of investment in play facilities is being brought forward.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09030335000022"></a>Bringing forward capital spending is a key plank of the Government&#146;s fiscal stimulus package to boost the economy in the current downturn. It means that thousands of school modernisation projects across England can start 12 months early.</p>

The allocation comprises:</p>
 &#163;235 million for local authority modernisation grant;&#163;76 million for primary capital programme;&#163;50 million for locally controlled voluntarily aided programme; and&#163;138 million for targeted capital fund for 14-19, SEN and disabilities fund.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09030335000025"></a>&#163;390 million being allocated a year early direct to every school in the country&#151;bringing forward 40 per cent of all indicative devolved formula capital allocations for 2010-11 to 2009-10. It means:</p>
a typical unmodernised primary school of 250 pupils will now get &#163;47,600 this year, including &#163;13,600 brought forward from its 2010-11 allocation. A primary school newly built, rebuilt or refurbished in the last 11 years will now get &#163;23,800&#151;up from &#163;17,000; anda typical unmodernised secondary school of 1,000 pupils will now get &#163;158,200, including &#163;45,200 brought forward. A secondary school newly built, rebuilt or refurbished in the last 11 years will now get &#163;79,100&#151;up from &#163;56,000.

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="09030335000030"></a><b><a name="90303-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="09030335000049"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> My right honourable friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09030335000031"></a>I am pleased to tell the House that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs will shortly publish drafts of the Tax Law Rewrite project's sixth and seventh Bills.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09030335000032"></a>These two Bills are a major landmark in the task of rewriting the legislation for the two main direct taxes which are of great importance to individuals and businesses. The project has, since its inception in 1996 been rewriting the income tax and corporation tax codes in a clearer and more understandable form, making them more accessible than at any time in recent memory. The Bills, when enacted, will complete this work.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09030335000033"></a>One is the Corporation Tax Bill which is the second of two Bills by that name which will rewrite substantially the whole of the corporation tax code. The first is presently before Parliament and will become the Corporation Tax Act 2009. It is expected to become the Corporation Tax Act 2010. It includes provisions about the treatment of losses and gifts to charities, reliefs, distributions, particular types of companies and activities, avoidance and definitions.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09030335000034"></a>The second is the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Bill which includes provisions about double taxation relief, transfer pricing, advance pricing agreements and tax arbitrage. The Bill also seeks to help users by relocating and where appropriate rewriting provisions which would otherwise have been left unhelpfully in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act or one of the Finance Acts.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09030335000035"></a>It is planned to introduce the Bills into Parliament by the end of 2009. Four previous Bills of the project were enacted as the Capital Allowances Act 2001, the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 and the Income Tax Act 2007.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09030335000036"></a>The scope of these new Bills and the timing of consultation were agreed with the project's Consultative and Steering Committees which together include the main representative bodies and other users. They benefit from a style and structure that has been developed as a result of consultation over the previous rewrite Bills. Earlier versions of the legislation in these new Bills have been revised in the light of comments and suggestions from tax professionals and others who engaged in the consultation process. This has only been possible thanks to the close collaboration and co-operation between the project team and tax practitioners, the legal profession and business representatives.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="09030335000037"></a><b><a name="90303-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="09030335000050"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Jonathan Shaw) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09030335000038"></a>I am pleased to announce that the Explanatory Memorandum and Command Paper for ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be laid before Parliament later today.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09030335000039"></a>In taking this important step, the Government have confirmed their commitment both to this convention, and to the principle that it enshrines that disabled people have, and should be able to enjoy, the same human rights as other people.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09030335000040"></a>In working towards this point, government departments and the devolved Administrations have been checking their legislation, policies, practices and procedures against the convention&#146;s provisions. The UK does not ratify any international treaty until it is in a position to ensure that it can implement the provisions and therefore comply with its obligations. The Explanatory Memorandum which has been laid explains the basis on which the Government propose the UK should now ratify the convention, and the handful of reservations and interpretative declarations that are required in order that we may do so.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09030335000041"></a>A reservation is proposed in respect of service in the Armed Forces to preserve the position already reflected in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as amended (DDA). Service in the Armed Forces is exempt from the employment provisions of the DDA. This approach is entirely consistent with EU Council Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. Service in any of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown are excluded from the DDA&#146;s employment provisions to preserve their combat effectiveness. The Government decided to exclude members of the Armed Forces in the DDA because Armed Forces personnel need to be combat effective in order to meet a worldwide liability to deploy, and to ensure that military health and fitness remain matters for Ministry of Defence Ministers based on military advice, not for the courts.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="09030335000042"></a>An interpretative declaration is proposed to make clear that the UK general education system includes both mainstream and special schools, thereby clarifying how the UK Government interpret the convention. This will make it clear that special schools are considered part of the UK&#146;s general education system and that parents have the right to express a preference for a special school. A reservation is proposed to allow for circumstances where disabled children&#146;s needs may  be best met through specialist provision, which may  be some way from their home&#151;so they will need to be educated outside their local community. This also maintains parental choice for schools outside the local community.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="09030335000043"></a>A general reservation is proposed in order to retain the right to apply immigration rules and to retain the right to introduce wider health screening for applicants entering or seeking to remain in the UK, particularly in the event of a global health emergency, if this is considered necessary to protect public health. This clarifies the Government&#146;s understanding that the convention does not create new or additional rights for non-UK national disabled people relating to the entry into, stay in and departure from the United Kingdom. This reservation will be subject to review 12 months after the UK has ratified the convention in order to assess whether there is a continued need for it in practice.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09030335000044"></a>A reservation is proposed in respect of Article 12.4, which concerns safeguards for the exercise of substituted decision-making and includes a requirement for "regular review" by a competent, independent and impartial authority or judicial body. There is currently no review system for Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) appointees; ie, people who are appointed to claim and collect benefits on behalf of another person due to that person&#146;s lack of physical or mental capacity. Those appointee arrangements are not at present subject to the safeguard of regular review, as the Government believe this article requires. DWP is therefore actively working towards a proportionate system of review to address this issue.</p>

<a name="90303-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09030335000045"></a>Moving towards ratification is a major achievement. I believe that this step will be welcomed, along with the signing of the optional protocol to the UN Convention last week. Together, these two actions send out a very strong signal&#151;the Government are serious about achieving equality of human rights for disabled people and is making real progress towards its goal of disability equality by 2025.</p>

<a name="90303w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="09030337000006"></a>Following a mid-term review of DfID's regional programme in Southern Africa it was decided in October 2008 that the DfID-Southern Africa (DfID-SA) office should rebalance its commitments. It was agreed that DfID would not proceed with the design of ICS. Instead it will focus its work on other health and AIDS programmes; namely, a &#163;12.5 million new programme to improve access to quality essential medicines in countries; and delivering on an existing &#163;19 million programme providing behaviour change communication programmes.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="09030337000007"></a>The ICS programme was being designed to provide support to three key partners, the regional teams of UNAIDS and WHO and a challenge fund for regional civil society organisations (CSOs).</p>

<a name="90303w0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a><a name="09030337000008"></a>DfID remains very committed to UNAIDS and WHO. We recently agreed new institutional strategies for 2008-11 with both organisations. DfID will provide up to &#163;34.8 million core funding to UNAIDS and &#163;44 million core funding to WHO over this period. We rely on their management systems to ensure they allocate funds to regional and country programmes to deliver on their strategic objectives.</p>

<a name="90303w0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a><a name="09030337000009"></a>DfID has historic funding relationships with two CSOs: the Anglican Church of Southern Africa (ACSA) and the Health Economics and HIV/AIDS Research Division (HEARD) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. DfID has taken steps to ensure the sustainability of these organisations, providing short-term funding and facilitating discussions to secure funding from other donors. DfID has also given advice and is providing technical assistance to ACSA on resource mobilisation. DfID has been able to provide some &#163;1 million support to ARASA (AIDS and RIGHTS Alliance of Southern Africa) through another donor.</p>

<a name="90303w0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a><a name="09030337000011"></a>DfID remains seized of the importance of tackling AIDS in the hyper-endemic Southern Africa region and will remain a significant donor for HIV and AIDS and Health in the Southern Africa region, spending up to &#163;61 million in the current financial year. It is expected that this level of spend will continue during 2010-11 and may increase the following year.</p>

<a name="90303w0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a><a name="09030337000012"></a>There is no change in DfID's policy. DfID remains committed to championing the global health and HIV/AIDS architecture including within the Southern Africa region. DfID has forged an excellent working relationship with others donors, national governments and regional institutions within Southern Africa. We remain active partners in the multi-donor group convened by the UNAIDS regional team, which is collectively monitoring whether there is any impact on the regional level approach to health and AIDS as a result of this and other donor decisions.</p>

<a name="90303w0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a><a name="09030337000015"></a>We keep the level of threat under constant review. This is done through monitoring the international reports of disease incidence worldwide and assessing whether there is a change in threat for the UK. These assessments are published on the Defra website and stakeholder organisations are advised when a new assessment is published. Our current assessment is that the UK is at a low but constant risk of the virus being introduced.</p>

<a name="90303w0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a><a name="09030337000016"></a>There are a number of pathways through which the virus might be introduced. Trade in domestic poultry, other captive birds and poultry products is regulated. Regulation is based on international veterinary standards and certification designed to reduce the likelihood of the virus being transmitted via legal trade routes. The UK's Border Agency is responsible for undertaking anti-smuggling controls on products of animal origin (including avian products such as poultry meat and eggs) from third countries. These controls are risk-based, taking into account information from Defra on the changing global animal health situation.</p>

In wild birds it is used to help detect a change in risk for domestic poultry and other kept birds allowing controls to be triggered that help prevent disease spread (eg housing of birds).</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a><a name="09030337000018"></a>We have well developed contingency plans for dealing with outbreaks. These have been activated eight times since April 2006. In addition, we have undertaken exercises with stakeholder partners to test out different scenarios. No two incidents are the same and after each one there is a lessons learnt exercise the conclusions of which are published on the Defra website.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_40"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government further to the Written Answer by Lord Bach on 12 February (<I>WA 238&#151;40</I>), of the 197 Muslim chaplains currently serving in prisons in England and Wales how many are employed (a) full-time, (b) part-time, and (c) on a sessional basis, broken down by the prisons they are serving in.

These figures are not static and will reflect changes over time for a range of reasons. In a few cases, the same Muslim chaplain works at more than one prison. Some prisons will also have a sessional Muslim chaplain who does not attend regularly but who can be called on to provide cover when needed. The figures presented have been derived from manual records. This is liable to the normal inaccuracies associated with a reporting system of this type.</p>

However, the information relating to the specifics of the administrative section of the Scotland Office, which you enquired about in your original request, would not be published as the numbers are fewer than five and would make the identification of individuals possible.</p>
