<a name="40719-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Peyton of Yeovil </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether they anticipated the effects on pension funds of the changes to the rules for advance corporation tax.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport  (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </b>  My Lords, I hope I am right in thinking that the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, is referring to payable tax credits on dividends. Those were a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_2"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

distortion in the tax system under which non-taxpayers such as pension funds were better off if companies distributed profits as dividends rather than retaining them for investment. They were abolished in 1997 as part of a balanced package of measures, including reductions in corporation tax, designed to encourage companies to reinvest their profits for growth. While the abolition of payable tax credits reduced the income of pension funds by around &#163;3.5   billion per annum, the long-term effect of that package of measures will benefit all investors, including pension funds and those saving for retirement.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord will forgive me if I say that, coming from the Treasury&#039;s most skilled apologist, that Answer was really not very welcome. Will he not at least try to explain how the Chancellor of the Exchequer came to aim such a blow at both the whole of the savings movement and the arrangements made for retirement by many pensioners? A word of regret or sympathy would not come amiss.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I have not had time to look up the word &quot;apologist&quot; in <i>Roget&#039;s Thesaurus,</i> but I suspect that it is related to very many words that are much less approving than the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, would be prepared to use in public. Having said that, I do not think that any apology is required. The change was a redress of a distortion that has existed for some time and has not been a significant element in pension funds&#039; ability to meet their obligations in the years between then and now. There have of course been significant changes in the financing of pension funds, but those have been due much more to interest rate reductions than to the fall in the price of equities and, even more significantly, to increased life expectancy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that companies are currently increasing the amounts they are putting into corporate pension funds at an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_3"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

annual rate of 25 per cent? What estimate have the Government made of the loss of corporation tax that will follow those increased flows?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, when figures are quoted on which an estimate can be made, no doubt an estimate will be made. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, referred to the increasing amounts that companies are   putting into their pension funds, and that is welcome. I would remind him that in the period preceding the   abolition of payable tax credits on dividends, companies&#151;many of them the same companies&#151;took very much longer pension fund holidays, amounting over a period of years to something like &#163;19 billion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, is it not clear that the change in ACT to which my noble friend referred was only the first in a series of actions by the Chancellor that have added to the present crisis in provision? The Government admitted only last week in Grand Committee that the Pensions Bill was introduced in a hurry. As a result, there was not adequate time to debate it in the Commons. We in this House will have to sort out the details of the Bill, which seeks to rectify some of the damage that the Government have caused. Your Lordships will need to make that effort.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I am sorry to correct the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, but the abolition of advance corporation tax took place roughly at the same time, and on the basis that advance corporation tax and dividends tax credit were generally set at the same rate. What we are talking about now is not advance corporation tax; it is only the payable tax credits on dividends that directly affected pension funds. On the issue of the Pensions Bill, I leave the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, to debate that at his usual length and with his usual assiduity with my noble friend Lady Hollis.

<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What studies they have made of the report on Zimbabwe from the African Union&#039;s Commission on Human and People&#039;s Rights.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </b>  My Lords, we received the executive summary of the report at the time of the African Union summit on 6 to 8 July. The full report will be available later this year, after Zimbabwe has responded to the observations about human rights abuses. We welcome the summary as clear criticism of the human rights situation in Zimbabwe by the African Union.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that it is a damning report on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_4"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

abuses in Zimbabwe and on the activities of the racist regime there? Does she further agree that the way in which it has been handled, having been suppressed, it seems, for two years, reflects poorly on the African Union and on its aspirations, vision and strategy, which we all support, for a better and reformed Africa in the future? Is there any channel by which this can now be brought into the United Nations forum? Hitherto, the Government have taken the view that there are too many obstacles to bringing the issue to the United Nations, but this could provide the vehicle for doing so.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I agree that the executive summary is a full criticism of Zimbabwe on human rights. The noble Lord said that the report is damning, but I reiterate that I have not as yet seen the full report. It will not be forthcoming for at least another month, or possibly longer, in order to give Zimbabwe the opportunity to comment on what is said.
</p>

<a name="40719-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The African Union has pointed out to Zimbabwe that three reports are now outstanding on Zimbabwe&#039;s failure to comply over human rights issues, and it has urged Zimbabwe so to do. On the last point, the United Kingdom Government are considering taking an issue to the United Nations General Assembly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </b>   My Lords, is it not a welcome sign that the African Union has commented so stringently on human rights abuses in Zimbabwe? We should be encouraging the African Union for doing so, since it is always under criticism. Does my noble friend agree that it is also important that the African Union has now said to African leaders that they can no longer expect a defence from the African Union where there are abuses of human rights?
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   Yes, my Lords, I strongly agree with that. That is why I said in my initial Answer that we welcome the report by the African Union. It is most welcome that it has spoken out in the way that it has. I remind noble Lords that the Zimbabwean Government, in the person of the Information Minister, last Wednesday accused the opposition Movement for Democratic Change of &quot;smuggling&quot; the report onto the AU agenda at the behest of the British Prime Minister. That is complete and utter rubbish, but it gives your Lordships an indication of how far the Zimbabweans are prepared to go in order to try to protect their backs.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40719-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, while it is unfortunate that the AU summit declined to publish the report on the basis of the false claims made by Zimbabwe that they had never seen it before, as well as the allegations by Mr Moyo that the Minister has quoted, and considering that the report is already two years old, should we not be looking ahead? Will the noble Baroness consider whether the G8 secretariat, which is preparing for the meeting to be hosted by the UK at Gleneagles in June 2005, might request its opposite numbers in the African Union to commission reports <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_5"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 5</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

from the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation in Zimbabwe, from the UNHCR on the 3 million exiles from Zimbabwe in neighbouring countries, and from the FAO and the World Food Programme on the starvation of Zimbabweans as a result of the economic policies of the Mugabe regime?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040719/text/40719-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is right to point out that it is not just a question of straightforward human rights. There are also issues around the appalling economic situation in Zimbabwe, which has resulted in many of its people being put in jeopardy. The noble Lord raised the question of next year&#039;s G8. It is too soon to state with any certainty whether we will be able to focus on   these issues next year, although I see certain attractions in what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has said. One note of caution is that it is already the case that Zimbabwe believes that anything that has UK fingerprints on it can be discredited. We must be careful how we handle that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Renton: </b>   My Lords, in view of the way in which the people of Zimbabwe have now suffered for some years, has not the time come for the United Nations to be inspired to intervene there?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, as I indicated to the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, we are considering whether it might be possible to pursue a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly this year. As the noble Lord will know, UN sanctions, which are binding on all member states, would require the agreement of the Security Council. Security Council agreement to such sanctions at this stage is not an option.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   My Lords, is it not important to reflect on the development of the constitutional position of the African Union? The ambition to have peer group review of sovereign states by other sovereign states in Africa is a recent development. It may be that we are looking through the wrong end of the telescope if we see only what they have not done. I agree with my noble friend in seeing what they are now developing as a role for the future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   Yes, my Lords, that is a fair comment. The African Union has a great difficulty in how it deals with Zimbabwe. There are clearly a number of differences of opinion within that organisation. It is important that at the end of the executive summary of the report the African Union notes that the republic of Zimbabwe now has three overdue reports in order to fulfil its obligations to the African charter. The African Union is laying it on the line in that way with the Government of Zimbabwe, and it is to be congratulated on doing so.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Acton: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that the commission was chaired by an eminent South African academic? In the hope that this is a favourable <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_6"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

augury of South Africa&#039;s attitude, are the Government planning to hold talks about the executive summary, and ultimately about the report, with the South African Government?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, as I understand it, the investigation team was led by the vice-chair of the African Commission on Human Rights, Mr Jainaba Johm of Gambia. However, it included a South African churchman and academic, Barney Pityana, who is the commissioner responsible for Zimbabwe, and, of course, Fiona Adolu of Uganda. Barney Pityana is the past chair of South Africa&#039;s human rights commission.
</p>

<a name="40719-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>My honourable friend Mr Mullin will meet the South African deputy Foreign Minister on Wednesday of this week. I have not seen their agenda, but I believe that it is highly probable that the report will be discussed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the African Union is undoubtedly to be congratulated on having tried for so long to bring the matter out into the open and face the facts about what is happening? Could it not be encouraged through the EU&#151;not by us, I accept&#151;to bring the matter, as the AU bloc, to the UNHCR meeting in Geneva? On previous occasions, it has prevented discussion there: this time, it could initiate a clear call for Zimbabwe to recognise the human rights of its people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, that idea has considerable merit. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, who has taken such a close interest in the affairs of Zimbabwe.
</p>

<a name="40719-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>There may be some difficulty in trying to persuade the African Union to adopt the course of action that the noble Baroness suggests. Zimbabwe tried to persuade the African Union to withdraw the report altogether, on the extraordinary pretext that it was all a put-up job by the United Kingdom. It was supported by at least one other country in that endeavour, but, I am happy to say, they were overruled.
</p>

<a name="40719-02_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>Zimbabwe now has the opportunity to respond to the report, and it may be that the response will overrun the period of the next meeting of the UNHCR in Geneva. The situation is still uncertain with regard to the point at which the report will see the full light of day. No doubt, when it does, there will be many people who are most anxious to discuss it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Blaker: </b>   My Lords, has the noble Baroness&#039;s attention been drawn to reports last week in two reputable South African newspapers of talks between the ANC, which is President Mbeki&#039;s party, and ZANU-PF, which is Mr Mugabe&#039;s party, about the future of Zimbabwe? In particular, they are said to have discussed co-operation by the two parties on preparations for the Zimbabwe elections next spring. If those reports are correct, do they not cast doubt on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_7"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 7</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the suitability of President Mbeki as an impartial interlocutor between ZANU-PF and the opposition in Zimbabwe?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I know that concerns have been raised about President Mbeki, but I remind the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister discussed Zimbabwe with President Mbeki following South Africa&#039;s elections in April. The Minister for Africa has also had regular opportunities to discuss such issues with the South Africans.
</p>

<a name="40719-02_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>President Mbeki and Foreign Minister Zuma have stated that negotiations between ZANU-PF and the MDC are imminent. However, the noble Lord is right: we would be more interested to see some firm evidence of progress in those discussions, rather than just reports that the discussions are imminent.

<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Hogg of Cumbernauld </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether they have plans to renew trade ties with Syria.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, the trade relationship between the European Union and Syria is underpinned by the EU-Syria co-operation agreement of 1977. Negotiations are under way for an EU-Syria association agreement, as part of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership under the Barcelona process, which aims to create a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area by 2010.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Hogg of Cumbernauld: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that helpful and informative reply. I recognise the importance of trade and the development of normal, peaceful relations between nations, but is it not the case that Syria has failed to meet important international obligations? In the past, that has led to sanctions against other countries, such as Iraq and Libya. Are we operating different standards here? Is the standard applied to Syria different from that applied to other countries?
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I do not believe that it is. The European Union has concluded a number of trade agreements with the countries involved in the Euro-Med process and the Barcelona process. I have been part of those meetings this year, and I have seen no difference in the way in which the negotiations are conducted or in the criteria that trigger those negotiations. I would, however, be misleading your Lordships if I were to say that the negotiations were the easiest that I had ever observed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, is it not clear that Syria is still the sponsor of terrorism in the Middle East <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_8"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 8</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and adheres to a policy of having weapons of mass destruction? How is that compatible with increased trade between ourselves and that country?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40719-02_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend uses very strong language. He claims that Syria is a sponsor of terrorism and a possessor of weapons of mass destruction. The fact is that there are causes for concern about Syria&#039;s activities on weapons of mass destruction, which is why there is a clause&#151;not only in the agreement that we hope to conclude with Syria but in all future agreements in the EU association agreements process&#151;that deals with the very important question of weapons of mass destruction.
</p>

<a name="40719-02_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>I think, without going into any detail, that it is important that we are clear&#151;I might say &quot;blunt&quot;&#151;with a number of countries in the region about the way that terrorism&#151;even if not sponsored&#151;is perhaps a subject from which individuals turn their face in the opposite direction when it is discussed.

<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40719-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, we recognise that critical engagement&#151;with as much emphasis on &quot;critical&quot; as on &quot;engagement&quot;&#151;is the only way forward with Syria. I have two questions. First, how much more scope is there for engaging with Syrian civil society by, for example, expanding the network of Chevening and other scholarships and inviting young Syrians to spend time in this country? Secondly, can the Minister expand a little on what she said about including clauses on weapons of mass destruction in all other European agreements with Mediterranean countries? Does that, for example, include future association agreements with Israel?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40719-03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, we already have an association agreement with Israel. There are new European neighbourhood policy action plans&#151;I am sorry to use such Foreign Office jargon in your Lordships&#039; House&#151;which involve clauses about weapons of mass destruction. Those who want to have a closer relationship with the EU will be asked to negotiate on that basis. I cannot tell your Lordships that there will be standard wording for every clause; one size does not fit all in negotiations. However, the issue will certainly be raised in all future agreements of that nature.
</p>

<a name="40719-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>I agree with what the noble Lord said about Chevening scholarships. We regard them as one of the key areas for developing a relationship.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40719-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that we all want better trade relations with Syria, and I know that the noble Baroness has been directly involved in discussions with Syria about its attitude. Does she think that the American decision to apply sanctions has helped the situation, given the very poor state of the Syrian economy? All the tourists have been driven away from Syria&#039;s marvellous sites, and Syrians have a very low standard of living.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_9"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 9</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40719-03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Can the Minister confirm that the conditions that we seek are that Syria should not only denounce weapons of mass destruction but should truly cease to harbour terrorists and conceal any terrorists who may have fled over the border from Iraq? Are the Syrians even prepared to contemplate such things?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40719-03_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I myself have discussed those matters with the Syrians. The right way to tackle such issues is through a process of critical engagement, rather than by adopting the attitude of the United States of America, which has imposed sanctions that prohibit the export of goods and services from the US to Syria, with the exception of food,   medicine, cellphones and Internet equipment&#151;interestingly enough&#151;and aircraft parts. It is also the case that US investment is still allowed. By tackling the issues of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction with the Syrians, we at least stand a chance of enhancing not only our relationship but the security of the region, which of course is our ultimate objective.

<p><a name="qn_3"></a>
<a name="40719-03_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Perry of Southwark </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_3"></a>What steps they are taking following the findings of the Commissioner for Public Appointments concerning the rules on appointments to public posts and the practice in certain government departments.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40719-03_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the Government are aware of the commissioner&#039;s concerns about how Ministers are involved in the public appointments process. The current inquiry by the Committee on Standards in Public Life is considering this issue. It is expected to report by the end of the year and we will study its findings very carefully.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40719-03_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Perry of Southwark: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Can he tell the House what has been done to civil servants to make possible these breaches of the Nolan rules, with Ministers adding names to short lists, drawing up their own short lists and taking names off short lists?
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40719-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am not aware that the situation is as the noble Baroness suggests. There are wide-ranging differences between departments in regard to public appointments. I understand the fact and identify that the commissioner has drawn attention to four departments which have varied their practice from what she sees as being the appropriate procedure. But those departments have been entirely transparent; it has always been a part of their process and interventions are properly recorded.

<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40719-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, we obviously welcome the advice we are given by the commissioner, but it is not always going to be the case that the Government will accept all of that advice. As it is, the commissioner has her own group of 12 independent assessors who offer advice, and we greatly value that.

<a name="40719-03_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   My Lords, in the light of the commissioner&#039;s latest report showing that the percentage of female public body appointees remains the same as last year at 39 per cent, with the number of women chairmen of public bodies almost invisible, can the Minister say whether the 2005 target set by the Cabinet Office for achieving between 45 and 50 per cent of women on public bodies remains realistic? If not, what further measures will be taken?
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="40719-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, we are obviously disappointed that the appointment figures to which the noble Baroness refers are as they are, but we do not think that this is a new trend. We hope that our targets are realistic. I think everyone would accept that it is a highly desirable objective. There is some good news in the commissioner&#039;s report. I am particularly pleased to see that there has been an increase in the number of appointments for those with disabilities, up to 3.2 per cent from 2.7 per cent in the previous year.

<a name="40719-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Strathclyde: </b>   My Lords, I am almost incredulous at the sheer complacency of the Government&#039;s answers to this most serious Question. It is the Commissioner for   Public Appointments who has made an official complaint on the basis that appointments could be interpreted either as political interference or personal preference. Should not the Government be taking firm action now and drafting clauses for a Civil Service Bill to be presented to Parliament to deal with this terrible problem?
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="40719-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is conflating two separate issues. There is a disagreement between the commissioner and some departments about the appointments process. Those departments have always had Ministers involved at an early part of the   appointments process, and that is accepted by the   commissioner, those departments and all other departments. As I am sure the noble Lord will know from his own background and time in government, it is a part of the process that has been commonly accepted.

<a name="40719-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Marsh: </b>   My Lords, if Ministers have traditionally taken a position whereby they make these appointments and make suggestions, what on earth was the point of appointing a commissioner to do the same job?

has been accepted practice in the past. We are very keen to ensure that there is integrity, openness, probity and transparency in these matters. The commissioner accepts that that is absolutely the case. There is a minor disagreement&#151;some might even call it a misunderstanding&#151;over this issue.

<a name="40719-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, further to the question of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, is the Minister satisfied that the membership of ethnic minorities on such bodies is in proportion to their representation in the community?
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40719-03_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I think the noble Lord will accept that this Government have made great progress in ensuring that ethnic minorities have an appropriate level of representation in all public appointments. The figures suggest that we are making great progress. As I understand it, in 2002&#150;03, 8.4 per cent of all appointments were to ethnic minorities, which is fractionally down on the previous year. But that does not disappoint us; it gives us greater encouragement that we are absolutely right to ensure a fair representation. We shall go on pursuing that objective. We do not see this as a long-term trend and, in any event, we intend to ensure that we get the balance absolutely right, fair and proper.

<a name="40719-04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, it is not the commission that makes the appointments; these are public appointments made by the Minister. The noble Baroness is of course right that everyone should be appointed on merit.

<a name="40719-04_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Howells of St Davids: </b>   My Lords, I find slightly disturbing the way in which the discussion is going.

there is bound to be some public concern that matters are not right?

This would probably help them in their relations with Ministers and, indeed, might help Ministers.

<a name="40719-04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, it may be worth reading to your Lordships&#039; House from the commissioner&#039;s report, in which she stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;I was concerned to discover in the course of last year that four Departments were routinely showing shortlists privately to Ministers during the appointments process. Ministers are given a choice of candidates at the end of the process and can, if they wish, be involved throughout the process&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>She said that her particular concern is the unrecorded involvement of a Minister at such a late stage. Three Permanent Secretaries wrote to the Committee on Standards in Public Life as part of their evidence, and they dispute the fact that this is done privately. They state quite categorically that it is an open part of the process and has been a routine part of the process for many years. We are all concerned to ensure that there is transparency, integrity and openness in the process. All government departments believe that they are achieving that.

<a name="40719-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Noble Lords will recall that when we were considering the Bill previously, we had some useful exchanges about how to improve the enforcement framework for patent disputes. Indeed, the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, brought forward an amendment that enabled us to identify an additional improvement to the provisions in the Bill that adjust the threats provisions in the Patents Act 1977. We believe that Commons Amendment No. 2 provides another small improvement to the enforcement framework which may be particularly beneficial for SME patent holders in certain circumstances.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_14"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40719-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The amendment would ensure that the courts have regard to all the relevant circumstances, including the financial position of the parties, when making an award of costs in a patent dispute where a decision has to be made regarding infringement. This amendment would still leave the courts with discretion over whether or not to require the losing party of a patent dispute to pay the costs of the winning party. There may well be circumstances in which financial circumstances should not be reflected in the actual award of costs. However, this amendment would put an SME engaged in a patent dispute against a wealthier party in a better position than the current one. It ensures that the financial position of the parties will always be a relevant factor to be weighed in the balance when the courts consider what award of costs to make.
</p>

<a name="40719-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>We hope that the amendment will have an effect beyond those cases that reach the stage in the courts where costs are considered. With wealthier parties aware that they may not necessarily get an award of all their costs in a dispute against a less financially secure party, even when they win, there may be greater willingness to agree to settle the dispute more cheaply in the first place by, say, mediation or voluntary binding arbitration.

</p>

<a name="40719-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>I hope that noble Lords will therefore agree with the sentiments in the other place that this is an amendment worth making. I stress, however, that it does not mean that we will not also continue to explore other approaches to facilitate quicker and cheaper enforcement of patent rights. For example, I am delighted to be able to confirm today that the Patent Office-led feasibility study into the patent enforcement project has concluded that there may be a way of constructing new, mutual insurance-based arrangements to help SMEs enforce their patent rights. We are looking at how best to work with insurers and others to make this happen. The Patent Office will publish the feasibility study by the end of the month.
</p>

<a name="40719-04_para11"></a>

</p>

<a name="40719-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>This amendment relates to the patentability of medical methods, and to the changes made by Clause   1. Noble Lords may recall that, under the existing law, a patent cannot be granted for a method of treatment or diagnosis. If such a patent is granted, it can later be revoked.
</p>

<a name="40719-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Clause 1 provides a new section, Section 4A, in the 1977 Act. This sets out, in a much simpler way than at present, that such medical methods are not patentable, while also clarifying the law in respect of the patenting of substances which are used in such medical methods. However, in Committee in another place, it was pointed out to us that the new provision in Clause 1 could have cast doubt on the fact that a patent can be revoked if it has wrongly been granted for a method of treatment or diagnosis. So we brought forward a small amendment&#151;Amendment No. 3&#151;which would make it clear in the 1977 Act that a patent may be revoked if it does not comply with any of the provisions of new Section 4A. It is a small improvement to the drafting that I hope will be welcomed by noble Lords on all sides.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;We are committed to sell the Tote to a racing trust to allow it to compete commercially, with all long-term profits invested in the sport&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="40719-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that, since it was set up in 1928, the Tote has had a long and distinguished tradition of serving British horseracing. Last year it provided &#163;11 million to racing. Similarly, the House will need no reminding of the importance of horseracing as an economic activity and a major spectator sport in the United Kingdom and in the world.
</p>

<a name="40719-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The Minister will be pleased to learn that we on these Benches are grateful for the reassurances he gave   in Grand Committee when he set out the Government&#039;s good intentions for the Tote. However, it is clear that Part 1 is merely seeking approval for the Tote to be abolished, as set out in Clause 1, with its assets transferred to a successor company wholly owned by the state. This much is clearly contained in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40719-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>The other issues surrounding the transfer and sale are slightly less certain. The Government stated in Committee that the newly nationalised Tote will then be sold&#151;it is to be hoped on the same day. The difficulty lies in the fact that Ministers are unable or unwilling to guarantee either that the nationalised Tote will be sold or to whom it will be sold, be it to the Racing Trust or a private bookmaker. Nor are the Government able to confirm what the sale price will be. That is essential, given that the racing trust will need to borrow the money to pay for the Tote.
</p>

<a name="40719-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>We are concerned because these issues are of fundamental importance to our deliberations over the sale of the Tote, and yet so little is on the face of the Bill. I am afraid that the Government&#039;s amendment, which we shall debate shortly, makes matters even less certain.
</p>

<a name="40719-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The purpose of our amendment is to ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to approve the Government&#039;s final decision to sell the Tote. This is necessary because the Government have not yet been able to conclude their negotiations with the shadow Racing Trust, although I understand that progress is being made and that a deal may be agreed before we return to the Bill at Third Reading.
</p>

<a name="40719-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>To my mind, the best course of action would be if the Government were able to report to the House today that progress is being made, and at such a pace that we will delay Third Reading, if necessary, until such time as a deal has been agreed. I very much hope that that will not be the case; Third Reading is pencilled in for 7 September&#151;154 days, or 22 working weeks, since the last day of Committee. I very much hope that that will be adequate time to finalise negotiations on the manifesto commitment which the Government are putting before the House today. If the Minister is able to give such an assurance to the House today, then this amendment may not be required, and I would be pleased to withdraw it.
</p>

<a name="40719-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>As I said, our amendment provides the necessary check on the Government&#039;s intentions, because in previous discussions in Grand Committee, the Minister indicated that the Tote would not be abolished until an agreement was in place to transfer it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_17"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 17</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to the successor body&#151;preferably to the Racing Trust under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. The Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;We intend that the sale to the Racing Trust will occur as soon as the Tote is vested, under the appointed day order, in the successor company.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>More to the point, we can ensure that that is the case because we will not transfer the assets of the Tote until a deal is ready&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 31/3/04; col. GC 473.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>In other words, when the Government are ready to abolish the Tote, they should also be in a position to   confirm to the House that an agreement is in place to meet the Government&#039;s manifesto commitment either, preferably, with the Racing Trust, or with another body. Similarly, the Government should be able to tell the House the price that they intend to charge for the transfer to the successor body.

<a name="40719-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The amendment is designed to ensure that this House would approve the final decision when all the facts are known. So much remains undecided and unclear at present that it is important that Parliament has final approval of the Government&#039;s plans. I beg to move.

<a name="40719-05_spnew4"></a><b> Viscount Falkland: </b>   My Lords, we on these Benches have little to add to what the noble Lord, Lord   Moynihan, said. We agree that, if the Government were able to give us some assurances now, it would be unnecessary for us to proceed further with this amendment, which we are inclined to support. The transfer of the Tote to the Racing Trust has been well discussed in Grand Committee and it is not appropriate now to rehearse the same arguments or make Second Reading speeches. It is a complex issue, but we support the philosophy behind the move of the Tote to the private sector, preferably to the Racing Trust, which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, and is headed by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, who I am happy to see is in his place.
</p>

<a name="40719-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>As the House is aware, there may be problems in arriving at the result that we all hope for&#151;a transfer that benefits racing. The Treasury plays an important role in this and has its own agenda to follow. We would not argue with the criteria that the Treasury uses, which include its consideration of this transfer. As the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, said, we understand that the Government are well forward with their negotiations for a sale along the lines that we all hope will result. If that is the case, the Minister will tell us now and we will have no need to discuss these matters further, but will wait until September.

<a name="40719-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lipsey: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the two noble Lords who preceded me for declaring my interest for me as chairman of the shadow Racing Trust and the Racing Trust that is emerging from that. My Amendment No. 2 differs from Amendment No.   1 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan. His amendment says that before anything is done to the Tote, the Government have to come back to the House. I quite understand that amendment but, personally, if a deal is done with my Racing Trust, I <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_18"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

hope that the House would then take it that we would not have done such a deal unless we wanted it to go ahead and that the parliamentary procedure is therefore not necessary. My amendment concentrates on a different position. After the negotiations, there may not be a deal and the Government may proceed to flog the Tote off to whoever they can get the most money from. In that event, my amendment would provide that there must be a vote in both Houses before the sale can proceed.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>We may as well admit that there is suspicion in some quarters that underneath this legislation is a deep-laid Treasury plot to pretend to sell to the trust and, when both Houses have finished with the Bill, to sell to the highest bidder. Quite frankly, I do not believe that there is such a plot, not because I believe that the Treasury is incapable of plotting&#151;I wrote a book about the Treasury so I have some authority on Treasury plots&#151;but it would not benefit the Treasury to go down such a road. The Treasury&#039;s paramount objective in this is to get rid of the Tote. It is not a business that belongs in the public sector&#151;it is an historic anachronism that it is there&#151;and, while we still have it, there is a suspicion that the Treasury stands behind its debt, which could amount to many times any proceedings from the sale.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Secondly, the Treasury will not have failed to note that the proceedings, even from selling to the highest bidder, amount to peanuts&#151;half of the peanuts that the Government want to go to racing, anyway. Thirdly, the Treasury did not get it where it is today by loosely ignoring manifesto pledges. There is a clear government manifesto pledge and it is no light thing for any official to say, &quot;Ditch your manifesto pledge, Chancellor, so that we can make a bob or two&quot;. Therefore, I do not think that there is a plot of that kind.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>My Amendment No. 2, however, guards against the possibility that things could go wrong. I will give some examples, all of which are slightly unlikely, but may help the House. There may be an adverse state aid ruling from Brussels or the Government&#039;s advisers on the sale&#151;PwC&#151;may lose all touch with reality and ask the Tote to pay a price that it could neither fund nor afford. I do not think that that is likely, but it could happen. Or, the tiny minority in racing that does not want to own the Tote and would rather take the money and run may get a temporary hold on racing&#039;s policy making and racing itself decides not to proceed. That is even less likely than the other scenarios, but it could happen.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>If any of those things happened, a decision clearly falls to be made whether we stick with the status quo or sell the Tote on the open market. It would not be appropriate that, when Ministers have declared in this and the other House that their policy is to sell to the Racing Trust, they could turn on a sixpence and say, &quot;Oh no, sorry that&#039;s dead. We Ministers in our wisdom have decided to abandon everything that we previously said and it has nothing to do with Parliament&quot;.

</p>

<a name="40719-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>This Bill involves a manifesto pledge. It has been carried by both Houses of Parliament&#151;with almost unanimous support&#151;for a particular objective; namely, that racing should fulfil its long-held ambition to own the Tote. It would be wholly inappropriate&#151;even constitutionally inappropriate&#151;for that decision to be taken and implemented without reference back to the two Houses of Parliament. If the Government came back with good reason, the two Houses may agree with the Government&#151;they usually agree with government proposals, after all. However, both Houses would at least have the right to a further and final say before the Government proceeded. To be honest, I have found it difficult to understand why the Government have been resistant to that, but resistant they are.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, said in his speech, we have made useful progress in the negotiations in recent weeks. I am delighted to tell the House that the Minister recently wrote to me offering the Racing Trust a period of exclusive negotiations. They are not talking to anyone else. They are talking only to us and we will try to get the deal sorted. We will try as far as we can to get a deal&#151;or as near as dammit&#151;by 7 September. Therefore, this is not a decision that the House needs to finalise this afternoon. On 7 September, it will have the fullest and latest information at its disposal about how the negotiations have gone.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>As I say, I hope that we will have a deal but, if we do not, we can consider the right course then. In the mean time, it is not necessarily the best solution to press these amendments. The best solution would be to have a deal that is signed, done and dusted and then we would not have to worry about wasting further time on hypothetical situations that I hope and believe will never arise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="40719-06_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport  (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </b>  My Lords, we did indeed debate comparable amendments in Grand Committee. I can update the House on developments since then. The amendments are variations on a theme that was aired in Grand Committee and the intention is to make the Government return to Parliament for further approval before a sale of the Tote can be completed.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>I entirely respect the motives behind these amendments. They are clearly intended to reflect the noble Lord&#039;s commitment to the horseracing industry. But I hope that they will agree that we share their commitment to the horseracing industry.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>The Tote and the racing industry as a whole have achieved record figures under this Government. That has, in no small part, been due to the reform of the betting tax regime&#151;a regime that was developed in the Treasury, which is the object of such suspicion for some Members of this House.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>At every stage of the Bill, the Minister for Sport and I have gone out of our way to provide public assurances that there is no hidden agenda&#151;no Treasury plot, as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, puts it. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_20"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 20</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

We want to effect a sale to the Racing Trust as soon as possible. There are no grounds for suspicion that we want to get the Bill safely on to the statute book on the basis of a sale to racing and then switch to a purchaser who will pay more.

</p>

<a name="40719-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>But I have to make it clear to the House that it will not be possible to finalise the terms of the sale to racing while the Bill is before Parliament. We have to respect government accounting rules, which prohibit expenditure on new services&#151;and this is a new service&#151;before Royal Assent if that expenditure would be nugatory if Parliament were ultimately not to approve the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>We can properly undertake planning and preparatory work and we are doing so. We are making useful progress in taking forward discussions with racing. We will go as far and as fast as we can with the negotiations, but we have to recognise that we cannot take them beyond a certain point or conclude them in advance of Royal Assent.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, used the example of state aid. It is certainly the case that before Royal Assent we could obtain an independent evaluation for the purpose of clearance of state aid. However, we cannot conclude negotiations beyond a point of no return before Royal Assent. This is not a Treasury plot. If it had been, we would not be in this position; we would not have this complicated Bill which, as the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, rightly says, does not express the ultimate intention of the Government on the face of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>The Tote does not belong to the Government; it belongs to Parliament. In the end, only Parliament can make the final decision, through passing legislation and achieving Royal Assent for that legislation.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>Everything that we are doing and everything that we are saying is aimed at securing the sale to the Racing Trust. Absolutely no steps have been taken to prepare for any other eventuality.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>As has been said, discussions are taking place between the Government&#039;s financial advisers and those of the Racing Trust. The Minister for Sport and I met the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, and Peter Jones, the chief executive of the Tote, a week ago to restate the Government&#039;s support for the longstanding proposals. As the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, said, we provided them with a letter promising that in the first instance we would commit to a period of exclusive negotiations with the Racing Trust.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I mention that only because they are the most recent examples in a very long line stretching back to 1998 of the Government&#039;s determination to sell the Tote to racing, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, reminds us, was a Labour Party manifesto commitment in 1981.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>I return to the specifics of the amendments. I remain convinced that they are unnecessary. As the Bill stands, dissolution of the Tote will take place on &quot;the appointed day&quot; and that appointment will be made by statutory instrument without any parliamentary procedure. There is nothing unusual in that, and the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform found no reason to comment on it. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_21"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

It has been previously stated in debate that it is not for the Secretary of State to run, on behalf of the Crown, the Tote&#039;s successor. The clear intention is to effect the appointed day order contemporaneously with the sale.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>We seek the approval of Parliament now for a Bill which leaves open the fall-back option of selling the Tote to someone other than a racing consortium. That much is obvious. If we remind ourselves of the Government&#039;s commitment to a sale to racing&#151;and all the work that has been put into achieving that&#151;that must be beyond doubt to any reasonable observer.
</p>

<a name="40719-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>By Third Reading of the Bill on 7 September&#151;or whenever it is; we cannot fix a date until this Report stage is completed&#151;we will have made progress on the sale preparations, subject to the provisos that I have made about the rules of government accounting.
<a name="time_8"></a>

</p>

<a name="40719-06_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I am sure that the rules of government accounting, which prevent the Government committing to expenditure without the approval of Parliament expressed through passing legislation, will be agreed by everyone on all sides of this House. There may still be negotiating problems that I do not know about, but that is the reason why, in principle, we cannot accept amendments that would commit the Government in advance of Royal Assent. That is why, with regret, I have to resist the amendments.

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040719/text/40719-07.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="40719-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Moynihan: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister and other noble Lords for their contributions to the debate on this amendment. A number of important points arise.
</p>

<a name="40719-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>First, I want to clarify that the Tote&#151;I think that noble Lords on the other side were about to jump to their feet on this point when the Minister stated it&#151;is not owned by Parliament; the Tote is owned by no one. It would be owned by Parliament if the Government nationalised it, but until they do so in order to privatise it, it is not owned by Parliament. As a Minster in another place said, the Horserace Totaliser Board,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;is responsible for the assets owned by the Tote but the Tote itself is owned by no one&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 26/5/99; col. 152W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>I move on to the substance of what the noble Lord stated. There is widespread support on all sides of the House for the Minister to continue his work to ensure that the Tote is successfully sold to a racing trust. He stated just now:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;We want to effect a sale to the Racing Trust as soon as possible&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>He went further than that and said that it must be &quot;beyond doubt&quot; in this Chamber that that is the intention.
</p>

<a name="40719-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>I fully appreciate the rules of government accounting and I am sure that noble Lords on all sides do also. But, equally, the rules of government accounting would apply had we placed the Racing Trust on the face of this legislation. Had the will of Parliament been expressed by an amendment to Part 1 that requested that the Tote should be sold to a racing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_22"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

trust, then that sole condition on the face of the Bill would have to be observed and in due course it would be wholly appropriate, after the legislation was enacted, for the rules of government accounting to come into play and to be observed to the letter. No one doubts that.
</p>

<a name="40719-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>The issue is not the rules of government accounting; it is whether or not Parliament should be requested to pass legislation which, as drafted at present, does not require the Government to sell to a racing trust. I do not deny the integrity or the wish of the Minister, nor that of the Minster for Sport, in achieving that goal. The more he states clearly that that is exactly what the Government wish, the more I ask why it is not placed on the face of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40719-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Given that no alternative is under consideration by the Government and given that it is &quot;beyond doubt&quot; that that is the Government&#039;s intention, then it seems wholly reasonable to put that intention on the face of the legislation and ensure that, once it is passed, the Government can conclude their negotiations. That is the position taken by noble Lords on these Benches.
</p>

<a name="40719-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>We have a good amount of time between now and the first day back in September for those negotiations to be completed in principle. I accept that it can only be in principle. But by completing these negotiations in principle and coming back to this House with the outcome of those negotiations, we would be in a position in early September where we had a deal in principle that could be put before the House. I should be very surprised if independent valuations had not already been taken by both sides. I understand that those negotiations are already under way, and so there is no time constraint and it would be perfectly possible for negotiations to be completed within that period.
</p>

<a name="40719-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The point at which a deal could be put before the House is the point&#151;here I agree with the Minister&#151;at which the House would need to consider whether to approve Part 1 as it stood or whether to amend it further. We have a great opportunity at Third Reading to have an admissibility of amendments to enable the Government to fulfil undertakings given at earlier stages of the Bill. Never was it more appropriate than in this Bill. In those circumstances, I will not press my amendment to a vote because the Government have every opportunity to return to the issue, to state that their intention to sell to the Racing Trust has been completed in principle and to give details about the work that has been done on exclusivity. This is the first time that we have heard that the Government will give the Racing Trust exclusivity. I hope that that will involve a standard exclusivity agreement and that it will have a deadline. I also hope that a deadline of early September, subject to parliamentary approval of the legislation, would be reasonable.
</p>

<a name="40719-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Why am I still therefore concerned about the Minister&#039;s position? I beg to differ with the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, who said that the Treasury&#039;s paramount objective was to sell the Tote. In my experience, the paramount objective of many Treasury mandarins is to maximise revenue for the Government. If the Treasury <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_23"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 23</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

had the opportunity to sell the Tote for &#163;300 million, for example, rather than for &#163;100 million while making an arrangement that was in the interests of racing, there would be people in the Treasury, I regret to say, who would urge very strongly that it should be sold for the maximum value achievable. That is the basis of my concern. I hope that all the good comments made by noble Lords and Ministers in another place prove that the will of Parliament, reflecting the manifesto commitment, recognise that in this case it is in the interests of racing for the Tote to be nationalised and then privatised again to a racing trust.
</p>

<a name="40719-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I remain unconvinced in this regard. I cannot understand why, if that is the whole purpose of Part 1, we do not include in it the sale to the Racing Trust and ask Parliament to approve that. Today we have not done so and we will hear in September about whether progress has been made to the point at which Parliament can be convinced that there is no need to refer to the Racing Trust in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40719-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Until that time comes, I will leave the Minister with the following conclusion. Unless all the preparatory work has been done to reach an agreement in principle with the Racing Trust, as it stands the Opposition cannot support Part 1. Either there must be significant progress towards the delivery to a racing trust through the sale process that the Minister outlined or it should be argued that the Tote is better off staying as it is, rather than being nationalised and sold&#151;at whatever price, in whatever circumstances and on whatever terms&#151;by the Government to whomever they wish. I regret to say that that is exactly how Part 1 currently reads.

</p>

<a name="40719-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>I hope that those provisos and remarks will encourage the Minister to get motoring and conclude the deal by the date on which we will return in September. I respond to the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, who was concerned about the amount of parliamentary time that may be involved, by assuring him that if an adequate deal is done with the Racing Trust, proceedings on Part 1 will be covered very quickly indeed by both Houses.

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I am interested in probing the nature of the constraint on the Government spending money. I said that I wanted the arrangement to be as near as dammit a deal and, to be frank, there is much that cannot be done by 7 September, including due diligence, a total funding package and state aid clearance for some matters, although we could be pretty much on top of various other issues. If the Government&#039;s position is that they cannot finalise the deal until we have the Bill, because we are not allowed to do so by the conventions, we will require an amendment of the kind moved by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, or myself to give Parliament a chance to come back if it does not like the consequences. The obvious thing to do on 7 September would be to say, &quot;Sorry, we cannot really get as far as we had hoped, and we will accept one or other of the amendments&quot;, which would not cut across any parliamentary or accounting conventions. If enough progress is made&#151;we will be some way short of the full deal, as I said&#151;we may be able to dispense with that. I hope that the Minister will comment on the exact nature of the constraint, as he sees it. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="40719-07_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I cannot go very much further than I did previously. I am afraid that there is still an element of misunderstanding in this regard about government accounting rules. We cannot conclude or complete negotiations even in principle in advance of Royal Assent. That means that we cannot take actions that are irreversible. Perhaps it would be better if I wrote in more detail about this to noble Lords who have taken part in this debate because, inevitably, I am simplifying. It does not matter whether the date is 7 September, 7 October or 7 November. There is preparatory work that we can do; I gave an example of that. We can have and agree an independent valuation, which we can submit for state aid purposes. However, we cannot conclude or complete negotiations in advance of Royal Assent. To do so would be for the Government to assume Parliament&#039;s wishes before it had expressed them.

<a name="40719-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>We do not own the Tote&#151;the noble Lord, Lord   Moynihan, is right in one sense that no one owns it. However, even if no one owns it, Parliament is its guardian; I hope that the noble Lord can agree with that. We can make good progress and I hope that by early September we will have done so. But there is a point beyond which, for entirely proper reasons, we cannot go. I know that that sounds to some extent like Catch-22; there is an element of that. However, it is for the protection of the public interest and Parliament that we must act in that way.

<a name="40719-08_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Moynihan </b>   moved Amendment No. 3:

&quot;(   )   If, six months after the appointed day, the successor company is wholly owned by the Crown, Part 1 of this Act shall cease to have effect and the Horserace Totaliser Board shall be re-established as on the day before this Act was passed.&quot;

<p><a name="st_74"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment puts in place a check on the length of time for which the newly nationalised Tote can remain wholly owned by the Crown. We have already debated whether there is a need to put a parliamentary check on the body to which the Tote is sold. However, the amendment covers a different issue. It requires the Tote to be sold rather than to remain wholly owned by the Crown. We have already heard from the Minister that the Government are nationalising the Tote only as a means of selling it to, I hope, the Racing Trust. My concern is that there is nothing in the Bill that requires the Government to sell the Tote once it has been nationalised. That concern has not been helped by the wording of the Government&#039;s later amendment, which includes the phrase &quot;if&quot; the Secretary of State disposes of the Tote, rather than &quot;when&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40719-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>In Grand Committee, there was considerable discussion about whether it would be preferable for the Tote to remain as it is in the unlikely event that it was not possible to sell it to the Racing Trust. I hope that this amendment is less contentious and that all sides of the House agree that it would be preferable for the Tote to remain as it is&#151;owned by no one&#151;rather than to become a nationalised industry. This amendment states that if the nationalised Tote has not been sold within six months, then Part 1 of the Bill falls and the Tote reverts back to its previous ownership.

<a name="40719-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>A similar amendment was debated in Committee, when I suggested that there should be a one-year limit on the time that the Tote could remain nationalised without reference back to Parliament. Perhaps it would be helpful to remind the House of the Minister&#039;s response in Committee when he said:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;We do not want to retain Crown ownership of the Tote for more than a day. A few hours was suggested, and that would do very well . . .  We intend that the sale to the Racing Trust will occur as soon as the Tote is vested . . .  in the successor company. More to the point, we can ensure that that is the case because we will not transfer the assets of the Tote until a deal is ready. So there will be no question of the Crown being the owner of the successor company for a year&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 31/3/04; col. GC 473.]</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>The Minister&#039;s response in Committee was helpful and reassuring, although it fell somewhat short of the guarantee that was requested. I have no doubt that one year is far too long. Thus I have settled upon six months as a reasonable length of time, although I must admit that I was tempted to take the Minister at his word and to include a time limit of one day.
</p>

<a name="40719-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>When this was debated in Grand Committee, the Minister pointed out that the wording of my amendment could be tightened. I am grateful for his suggestion, which I have duly taken on board. This amendment puts in place a safety check: something that it hopefully will never be necessary to use, but nevertheless a sensible strengthening of the Bill before us.
</p>

<a name="40719-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>In order to assist understanding the argument in favour of such a safety check and the appropriateness of its inclusion within this Bill, it would perhaps be helpful to draw upon the precedents previously brought to the attention of the House by the Minister in Grand Committee. The Postal Services Act 2000 reorganised the Post Office by establishing it as a public limited company, wholly owned by the Crown. That is precisely what the Bill does with the Tote. However, while we are concerned that the Tote might remain nationalised, in 2000 there was concern that the Post Office might be privatised. To overcome this concern, the Government made sure that the Postal Services Act had checks to prevent such an occurrence. That is exactly the effect of my amendment.
</p>

<a name="40719-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>The Post Office was subject to a manifesto commitment, as is the Tote. The Government have set up similar enabling legislation for both the Tote and the Post Office. I hope and trust that the Government will recognise the benefit of building upon this precedent and of putting in place a similar mechanism for this Bill. I beg to move.

<a name="40719-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>We are all agreed that we want a sale to a racing trust. There is apparently a disagreement about what is the second-best option. We take the view that if, for reasons beyond our control, sale to a racing trust is not possible, we should sell it commercially with 50 per cent of the proceeds of the sale going to racing. The Opposition take the view that the second alternative should be a return to the status quo, with the Tote being as it is now.

<a name="40719-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>I do not know what the view of the racing industry would be. I suspect that those concerned would rather have 50 per cent of the proceeds of a sale to the situation as it is now, but in any event it would be contrary to our manifesto commitment and, for that reason, I cannot accept this amendment.

<a name="40719-08_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Moynihan: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister. I will not revisit the fact that it would be contrary to that manifesto commitment to sell to anybody but the Racing Trust. That said, however, it will not surprise the Minister that I am disappointed that the Government do not recognise the need for this amendment. It seems to do nothing but strengthen the Bill and it is entirely in keeping with the Government&#039;s stated wishes.
</p>

<a name="40719-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>If the whole argument revolves around whether or not the racing industry will be in favour of returning the Tote to its current position, then I think that it would be wise to consult the racing industry in advance of Third Reading. As it stands, without this amendment, there is no requirement for the Government to sell the Tote once it has been nationalised.
</p>

<a name="40719-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>As I mentioned at the start of the proceedings, these Benches welcome the principles behind Part 1 of the Bill but we continue to remain concerned that so much must be taken on trust. The Minister had previously accepted that the time-scale within the amendment was more than generous&#151;compared, as I mentioned to the House, to the period of one day that he himself envisaged in Committee. Similarly, the Minister freely admits that the Government have no intention of owning the Tote for longer than it is necessary to permit the sale. I therefore cannot understand why the Minister is unable to accept this eminently sensible check on the Government&#039;s powers to retain the Tote as a nationalised industry.
</p>

<a name="40719-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>However, this amendment is linked with the previous amendments which we have been discussing. It is something we shall need to revisit in the totality of Part 1, when we return after the Summer Recess. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>I find it impossible to distinguish the argument for this amendment from the arguments on the preceding amendments, and in particular on Amendments Nos. 1 and 2. It raises again the issue of how far we can go down the road of what we all intend, which is the sale to a racing trust before Royal Assent. I appreciate that the amendments which have been put down to my Amendment No. 5 are intended to press the Government further in that direction than it is possible, under government accounting rules, for them to go.
</p>

<a name="40719-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I very much sympathise with noble Lords opposite and with my noble friend Lord Lipsey, who find it frustrating that the Government are not able&#151;for reasons which I think they understand better now but which were not adequately understood at an earlier stage of this Bill&#151;to commit themselves on the face of the Bill to the outcome which we all desire. As a result, it must be extremely frustrating for those who have not been paying attention to the Bill&#039;s proceedings to find that we are now discussing matters which are not on the face of the legislation.
</p>

<a name="40719-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>I do not intend to press this amendment. I put it down in order to show the extent to which we could go in putting on the face of the Bill, if we had to, a second option of a sale with 50 per cent of the proceeds going to racing. In other words, the intention was to cast aside any doubts there might be that, in the event that the sale to a racing trust was not possible, the Treasury would simply take the money and run&#151;which is what the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, said, though much more elegantly and politely.
</p>

<a name="40719-08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I do not think that it is necessary to have an amendment of this kind on the face of the Bill. I put the amendment down solely because of the doubts which have been expressed. I think that the air is now clearer than it was, and that my undertaking to write to noble Lords and to put a copy of my letter in the Libraries of both Houses ought to straighten up the situation before we reach Third Reading.

We are making good progress on Part 1 of the Bill as much will be left to what we hope will be successful negotiations between now and September. However, there is one aspect of this which I should be grateful if the noble Lord would cover in his correspondence that he intends to put in the Library of the House&#151;I hope as soon as possible so that we can consider it over the recess&#151;and that is the link between what the Minister has just said and European state aid rules.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm what discussions have taken place with the European Commission since Committee before Easter about the return to racing, which is at the heart of this <br>&nbsp;<br>

amendment, in the event of a sale to someone other than a racing trust. Having studied the DTI information on state aid, it clearly says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;The Commission will take a minimum of two months from receipt of a complete notification to take a decision. Recently the average time taken is four-five months from the date of notification&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>This is an important area for discussion. If the Commission says that the Government are unable to return the money to racing, or that they can return, say, 10 per cent only, what power does the House have over such a decision? Can the Minister confirm what would happen if the House refused to accept the European Commission&#039;s ruling on the percentage that the Government could legally return to racing? In other words, if the House today were to approve the amendment, or a similar amendment were reintroduced in September, on the basis that 50 per cent of the proceeds would be returned to racing, what would happen if the European Commission ruled against that and ruled that none of the money should be returned to racing, for example? What would happen if the House voted against such an order changing the percentage to zero?
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>It seems to me that we may be being offered a full sense of control by the Minister when, in fact, the power to vary this particular percentage rests almost entirely with Brussels. All I am seeking from the Minister in a spirit of co-operation is an explanation of how negotiations are progressing with Brussels. The earlier negotiations were time limited. They expired and now we are in a vacuum where further discussions are under way and are clearly critically relevant if at some stage of the Bill&#039;s proceedings we were to accept a percentage on the face of the Bill. For that reason I should be grateful if, first, the Minister could let us know how discussions are progressing with the European Commission and, secondly and more importantly, the specific answers to the points that I made with regard to Commission procedure in the event that it overrules any given percentage subsequent to the House considering this amendment if it were returned in this or a similar form in September.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>It might also assist the Minister to know that, in the light of all these discussions, like him I will not vote on the relevant amendments nor will I put them before the House.

<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="40719-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lipsey: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for having tabled this amendment in the first place because it was designed to deal with certain worries racing had both as regards the price at which the Tote would be sold and the share that racing would get were it not to be sold to a racing trust. For that effort we are grateful. We are grateful even if the amendment is withdrawn today as it provides a statement of where the Government&#039;s policy stands, even if we cannot all agree with it.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para4"></a>

<a name="40719-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the correction; of course, we are debating Amendment No. 4 and we cannot advance on that formally. I am grateful to the noble Lords, Lord   Moynihan and Lord Lipsey, for what they have said.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>I can help the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, some but perhaps not all of the way on the state aid issue. We recognise that there are two legitimate shareholders in the Tote; that is, racing and the taxpayer, although the legal position is that the Tote&#039;s assets are owned by the Tote board. It is right that taxpayers should receive market value for racing for their share in the Tote. In effect we are not selling the Tote but the public&#039;s share in the Tote. It will be subject to a full independent valuation at the time of sale and the price paid by racing will reflect this. I have already indicated that there is no reason why that independent valuation should not be prepared for state aid purposes before Royal Assent; in other words, we would work very hard to secure that that is done before Third Reading. If that were to mean moving Third Reading slightly, I think by agreement with the usual channels that might be possible. It might be a better outcome than having Third Reading too early.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>The European Commission was originally notified of the sale plans in 2001 and we have submitted an updated notification. The Commission has responded with further questions and we shall reply shortly. I do not have in front of me the dates of our submission and the dates of the Commission&#039;s response and of our reply but I shall include them in correspondence to noble Lords. The Commission has indicated that it will not be able to give state aid clearance until a valuation is completed nearer the time of sale but we are hopeful that this will not be a problem. Again, I should like to take advice on whether that can be done before Royal Assent. My understanding is that it would be possible. I should like that to be achieved, if possible.

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, from our discussions in Committee there appeared to be a considerable degree of support for the principle behind this amendment; namely, that we should not rule out the possibility of extending the exclusive licence for pool betting. Noble Lords will be aware that there has been an exclusive licence for pool betting in place since the Tote came into existence in 1928. The arguments should be studied carefully&#151;very carefully&#151;before we agree to legislation that will remove this exclusive licence in seven years with no possibility of its renewal.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>It is ironic that throughout our earlier discussions the Government argued that the Bill should allow them flexibility about how best to proceed and yet when we on these Benches suggest an amendment to provide such flexibility for future governments Ministers now seem reluctant to accept our suggestion. If I may, it is worth briefly recapping on our discussions with the Minister in Committee. First, the Minister appeared to suggest that the Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading had insisted on a one-off seven year licence. When pressed the Minister then went on to say that the European Commission&#039;s rules on the single market did not allow the extension of the Tote&#039;s exclusive licence.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>This latter point was quickly picked up by the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, who highlighted the exclusive pool betting licences in France, through the Pari Mutuel, as well as in Germany and Italy. Eventually the Minister changed tack and decided that it was safest to say that the Government had chosen the seven-year licence of their own free will although it appeared that they were aware of the possibility of challenge. The Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;I am not saying that the deal we have has been dictated by anyone, by the European Commission, the Office of Fair Trading or anyone else. The Government believe in competition because we believe in the single market and because we know that rules exist which, if they are breached, create at the very least a risk of challenge&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 5/4/04; col. GC 504.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>I fear that Ministers are seeing the spectre of legal challenges where none exists. There are clear precedents within Europe for exclusive pool-betting licences on horseracing. I am sure that many noble Lords will share my view that the European Commission would think long and hard before ruling against pool betting, particularly given the importance of the Pari Mutuel to the French, for example.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>On the domestic front there is a clear precedent in support of the amendment, which I trust will reassure the Minister. As I mentioned in Grand Committee, the National Lottery, which is covered in Part 3 of the Bill, has an exclusive seven-year licence. My amendment is designed to follow the precedent of the National Lottery, although in this instance there is no requirement for the licence to be renewed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_32"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40719-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>It is worth restating that the amendment merely gives future Secretaries of State the option to renew the licence, or not to renew it, at the end of seven years. Noble Lords may recall my brief foray into economic theory to justify the retention of the exclusive licence. There is indeed a strong economic argument for such retention, although the precedent of the National Lottery is perhaps more compelling, particularly as both the Tote and the National Lottery return money to good causes.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>The gambling market in the UK offers a number of alternative yet easily substitutable forms of betting on a horse race. Punters can use bookmakers, with either fixed price or starting price odds; there is the new option of the betting exchanges; and there is still the Tote. All these options are easily interchangeable, which limits the downside of a monopoly in any one betting market. This tripartite system for betting helps to ensure that all three markets run efficiently and smoothly.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>The same logic applies to the Tote as to the National Lottery. It is clear that the bigger the pool, the more efficient it will be. We have only one National Lottery because this guarantees big prizes, increased efficiency and more money returned to good causes.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I briefly touched on the emergence of betting exchanges, which raises another important point. Development of new technologies within the gaming market is progressing quickly. Who could have imagined the importance of betting exchanges just a few years ago? This rapid advance in technology is yet another reason for the Government to retain sufficient flexibility within the provisions of the Bill, so that they can continue with the exclusive licence if this is found to be in the best interests of both racing and the public.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>The amendment would remove the present subsection (11), which prohibits the renewal of the licence, and replace it with a new subsection (11), giving the Secretary of State the option to direct the Gaming Board to renew, not to renew or to revoke the exclusive licence at the end of seven years. Any decision made by future Secretaries of State would need parliamentary approval. This is a sensible check, and would provide future governments with specific authority in the public interest in the event of any challenge.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>Paragraph (b) gives the Secretary of State the ability to award the licence either to the incumbent or to another company. This is designed to keep the licence holder on its toes by making sure that it does not abuse its market position. Again, the precedent for this arrangement is drawn from the National Lottery.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>Finally, paragraph (c) would allow the exclusive licence to be renewed <i>ad infinitum</i>.
</p>

<a name="40719-09_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>In conclusion, the amendment is sensible and seeks to give future governments sufficient flexibility to make the decision nearer to the time of the renewal or otherwise of the seven-year licence. The amendment makes no commitment to renew that licence. I trust <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40719-10_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Falkland: </b>   My Lords, I had not intended to enter into this debate, but since my name was mentioned in reference to the debate in Committee, I thought that I would reinforce the point that I made then with the additional point that in this country we have gone down a road that is uncommon, if not unique. We have bookmakers who offer odds to the betting public in competition with the Tote, which offers pool as opposed to fixed-odds betting. An inevitable result of this freedom of movement in the market in which bookmakers operate is that the   success of the Tote pool has been patchy to say the least in areas where there is not a lot of interest from the public. Where public interest is present and large betting pools arise, the Tote does very well in competition with bookmakers.
</p>

<a name="40719-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>In other countries they have opted to go down the other road. Indeed, gambling is illegal in France, as we discovered in the pre-legislative scrutiny committee on gambling. I had not known that, and I thought I knew a lot about France. Gambling there is illegal, but their way of dealing with these matters is to introduce exceptions to the ban when it is appropriate&#151;very French, one might say. There are two fundamental exceptions. One is the Pari Mutuel, which was created in 1928. They decided not to allow bookmaking at all in the world of racing and to make it exclusively a betting pool. The other exception of course is casinos in resorts and spas in France. An additional exception has also been introduced recently whereby towns with populations of more than 500,000 may apply for one casino.

</p>

<a name="40719-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>That is by the by. We have a curious situation here which may mean that, psychologically, there is a underrating of the role of the Tote in its relationship with bookmakers. As the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, said in comparing the Tote to the National Lottery, the size of the pool is fundamental to the success of the Tote in raising money. People can choose which horses to support in racing, but the bigger the pool the better.
</p>

<a name="40719-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Recent talk about dividing the pool up into small parts does not offer a practical or realistic solution. It is just unfortunate that the phrase &quot;Tote monopoly&quot; has been current for so many years. For most of us, &quot;monopoly&quot; has a pejorative note to it. In reality, however, in the day-to-day world, the bigger a pool, sweepstake or totaliser is, the better it will be for all those who benefit from it. To divide that up into small pools and to allow other operators to compete is a prescription for the end of pool betting.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="40719-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lipsey: </b>   My Lords, for all the reasons so eloquently set out by the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, the Racing Trust and the Tote sought a longer period of exclusivity than seven years&#151;that is no secret. We also took the view that seven years was enough. It was the lowest number of years at which a deal could be done, and a deal was agreed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_34"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 34</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40719-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>I am about to go into negotiations with the Government on this deal and this price. I would like to do so with a reasonably intact reputation for keeping my word. Having signed up to this deal&#151;although I understand the strong arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, and the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland&#151;I do not seek an extension or even a power for the Government to extend the exclusive licence.
</p>

<a name="40719-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>If that sounds rather high-minded, I am afraid there is also a low-minded reason. We are negotiating the price that will have to be paid. Obviously, a Tote with a seven-year exclusive licence is worth more than a Tote with a nought-year exclusive licence, and less than a Tote with an infinitely long exclusive licence. If we accept the seven-year exclusive licence, that brings the price down.

</p>

<a name="40719-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>That is not an abstract point. At this very moment&#151;I trust&#151;the Tote will be negotiating arrangements with the racecourses designed to cement its position after the seven years have expired. Those arrangements will be costing it current cash out of the accounts, but they are designed to cement its position in the long term in light of the seven-year exclusive licence. They are all reducing the value of the Tote. So there will be money off in return for the Government rejecting the amendment. At this stage in the negotiations, I recommend that Tote supporters in the House go for that.

</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="40719-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I agree with both the high-minded and low-minded arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. I would like to retain a reputation for consistency as well. It has always been the view of the Government that an exclusive licence is a transitional measure to foster a strong pool-betting market, so far as we can obtain it, and allow the Racing Trust-owned successor an opportunity to establish itself in a fully commercial environment. The business should not be in public ownership.
</p>

<a name="40719-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Any provision that would permit the continuation beyond the seven years would run counter to our objective of opening up the pool-betting market to greater competition. As the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, rightly said, seven years without the option to continue was the deal. In the interests of consistency and in view of how we have been making progress, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, not to press the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="40719-10_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Moynihan: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his comments. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, on 99 per cent of issues when it comes to the interests of racing, but I differ with him and the Minister on this matter. I simply do not accept the economic argument that the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, put to the House. Competition in racing is effectively between different opportunities to individual punters when it comes to choice. Removing one of those choices reduces competition; it does not enhance it.

</p>

<a name="40719-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>I understand that Ministers within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport have found it a struggle to convince their colleagues in government to permit even a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_35"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 35</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

seven-year exclusive licence, and I praise the Minister for the achievement. In those circumstances, it is wholly understandable that he is unwilling to accept any amendments that might upset that arrangement. However, future Ministers for Sport and, if I may say so, future chairmen of the Racing Trust might have a different point of view from those that we heard this afternoon. The Minister said in Committee that this deal was the only deal on the table; that is his prerogative. However, it is the duty of this House to decide whether the deal before us is acceptable.
</p>

<a name="40719-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>In the context of the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, about competition, I remind the House that the Government&#039;s own regulatory impact assessment stated that without an exclusive licence there would be:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;Lower Tote contributions to Racing&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>and the:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;Possible loss of pool betting at some race meetings/ racecourses&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>That is the crux of the matter&#151;the safeguarding of the Tote&#039;s contribution to racing and helping to make sure   that all race meetings, particularly the smaller meetings and courses, benefit from pool betting well into the future. For those reasons, I have no doubt that the amendments strengthen the Bill and British horseracing. I therefore wish to test the opinion of the House on the issue.

<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="40719-10_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lipsey </b>   moved Amendment No. 12:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>Page 5, line 39, leave out paragraph (a) and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_8"></a><br>
(a)   may make an order revoking the exclusive licence if a material term or condition of the licence has been materially breached and that breach has not been remedied within 28 days of written notice having been given by the Gaming Board to the successor company notifying it that if it does not remedy the breach the Gaming Board may make an order revoking the exclusive licence, and&quot;


<p><a name="st_90"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we have just been arguing about the status of the seven-year exclusive licence for the Tote and we said, &quot;Seven years; nothing but seven years; the whole seven years&quot;. The amendment provides a kind of protection for that because at the moment the Bill allows the Gaming Board to remove the exclusive licence without very much ceremony, I fear. So the aim of the amendments in the group is to inject ceremony&#151;for example, the 28   day rule&#151;and I hope that the Government, who rightly put so much store on the seven years, will accept them. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="40719-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Moynihan: </b>   My Lords, I am pleased to support the amendments in this group, which bear more than a passing resemblance to those tabled in Grand Committee. I hope and trust that the noble Lord, Lord   Lipsey, in his brevity has been more successful in convincing the Minister with his compelling argument than I was in Grand Committee.
</p>

<a name="40719-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>Perhaps I may elaborate a little, as the issues involved are important. They relate closely to those that affect the amendment that I have tabled, to which I shall speak in a moment. Having re-read our discussions in Grand Committee I am afraid that, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, I am no wiser as to what, if any, circumstances could justify the immediate removal of an exclusive licence. I hope that when the Minister addresses the amendment he can give a clear answer to that simple question.
</p>

<a name="40719-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>It would also be appreciated if the Minister could clarify whether the removal of the exclusive licence would prevent the successor body continuing to offer pool betting on a non-exclusive basis. The amendments in the group similarly concern the ability of the Gaming Board to remove the exclusive licence of the successor body. As currently drafted, the Bill gives the Gaming Board the ability to remove the successor body&#039;s exclusive licence,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;if they think that a term or condition of the licence has been breached&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_38"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 38</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40719-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>In Grand Committee it was clear that there was concern among a number of noble Lords that the Bill gave the Gaming Board too much power and could be against the principles of natural justice. Their concern was heightened when we learned that the only appeal against such a decision would be through judicial review, which can often be clumsy, time consuming and expensive.
</p>

<a name="40719-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Nevertheless, the Minister was, as always, robust in his defence of government policy and went on to say that the Gaming Board already had those powers. By way of an example, he went on to draw an analogy with its powers to close down casinos. It is greatly appreciated that the Minister subsequently reflected upon his comments and wrote to me and other Members who attended the Grand Committee to clarify that point. His letter recognised that he may have somewhat overstated the existing powers of the Gaming Board. The letter also went on to set out the   powers which it is anticipated would be given to the new gambling commission with which the Draft Gambling Bill proposes to replace the Gaming Board.
</p>

<a name="40719-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>These new powers will require that before any licence can be revoked it will be necessary to have a review to which the licence holder rightly has the opportunity to make representations. Similarly the putative Gambling Bill proposes that there should be a gambling appeal tribunal to hear any appeals against the decision to suspend the licence. Those safeguards form the basis of my amendment, which, together with the amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord   Lipsey, improve the Bill by adding checks and balances to the powers that the Gaming Board will have over the successor company and the operation of its exclusive licence.

</p>

<a name="40719-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for outlining in his letter of 26 April the latest government thinking about the regulation of gambling and I trust that my proposal sits within that framework and that the amendments have been drafted in a manner that the Government may find acceptable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="40719-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, the intention of my letter of 26 April was to head off amendments like this at the pass. It was not my intention that we should continue to debate this issue. The Government intend to sell the Tote to a consortium of racing interests. As part of the sale, the Tote will be given a seven-year exclusive licence to provide pool betting. As I said in response to the previous amendment, this is a transitional measure to foster a strong pool betting market and to allow the Racing Trust-owned successor company an opportunity to establish itself in a fully commercial environment. After the seven-year period of exclusivity the licence will expire and under the terms of this Bill any bookmaker holding a permit will be able to provide pool betting services on horseracing.
</p>

<a name="40719-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The Bill does contain a reserve power for the Gaming Board to revoke the exclusive licence in the event that the terms and conditions are breached. But we do not believe that the Gaming Board will ever need to exercise this power. We believe that the successor company&#151;assumed to be the Racing Trust-owned <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_39"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 39</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Tote&#151;will co-operate fully with the Gaming Board in complying with the terms of the licence. The Tote, which has an excellent reputation, would have to commit an extremely serious breach in order for the licence to be revoked. A revocation in any circumstances other than a serious breach would be unreasonable and, on that basis, open to judicial review.

</p>

<a name="40719-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>We do not believe that it is appropriate to set up a review procedure and an appeals process. A licence of this kind would not be revoked lightly. If the holder of an exclusive licence committed an offence so serious that the Gaming Board decided to revoke it, we believe that it would be in the public interest to revoke the licence without delay; in other words, if there were something so seriously wrong that it had to be done immediately and any damage may be compounded by leaving it for 28 days. However, under the Bill, the Gaming Board is already obliged to specify the reasons of any decision to revoke a licence. If the holder of a pool operating licence disagrees with the Gaming Board&#039;s decision, he or she can challenge the decision through judicial review. We do not consider that an additional statutory right of appeal is necessary.
</p>

<a name="40719-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>My officials are already working on a draft code of practice that will inform the licence as a whole. It will be circulated to the current Tote management and to the Gaming Board shortly. A meeting has already been arranged for early August to discuss it. I am sure that a collaborative approach of that kind will deliver sufficient clarity on the issue without any need for provisions appearing in primary legislation. I believe that those discussions and the final code will greatly assist in spelling out the relationships between the parties and their responsibilities and should be an entirely satisfactory way of proceeding. A formal system of review, representation and appeal may simply serve to harden the relative positions of the parties at an early stage, when an informal approach may be good enough to resolve matters.
</p>

<a name="40719-11_para9"></a>

in the past there have been some strange chairmen of the Tote. Nevertheless, I do not find the promise of judicial review as a backstop very comforting. The judicial review hoops are relatively easy to jump through as long as one follows the procedure, but they may have little to do with justice.

&quot;(   )   An exclusive licence shall not be revoked under subsection (1)(c) unless the Gaming Board has previously published a code of practice for the interpretation of subsection (1)(c).&quot;

<p><a name="st_97"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 17 follows on from our entertaining and informative discussion in Grand Committee on Clause 9. My understanding is that the clause to which my amendment refers is designed to replace the requirement that the Tote is a fit and proper organisation. Today we are in a somewhat strange position as the Bill seeks to incorporate a clause of the Draft Gambling Bill which may or may not find parliamentary time this Session.

</p>

<a name="40719-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>I was indebted to the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, for his explanation in Grand Committee of the terms contained within this clause. There can be no doubt that we all benefited from his experience on the Greenway committee, examining the detail of the Draft Gambling Bill. Nevertheless, now that the Minister has had three months to consider the issue, I trust that he is in a better position to provide a full response to what the Government mean by the terms referred to and the scope of the definition in sub-paragraphs (i) to (iii) of Clause 9(1)(c). In Grand Committee the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, best summed up the meaning when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;anyone who has money and goes to a racecourse, casino or amusement arcade is vulnerable by the very fact that he or she is going to lose money . . .  It is a question of common sense&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 5/4/04; col. GC 517.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>While it is undoubtedly correct that it is a matter of common sense, I think that our duty today is to make sure that the Government set out very clearly what they intend the clause to achieve. Clause 9 sets out the conditions of the exclusive licence, which the successor body will be required to promote, and which it could forfeit if it were seen not to be protecting vulnerable adults.

</p>

<a name="40719-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>To return to the detail of the amendment, I trust that it is non-controversial and that Members on all sides of the House will recognise that it is not only right but manifestly sensible that the Gaming Board clearly set out <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_41"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 41</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

what is expected from the successor body and how it is supposed to fulfil its obligations to protect vulnerable adults.
</p>

<a name="40719-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>It would be appreciated if the Minister were able to clarify whether the on-course bookmakers will also be subject to the same obligations to protect vulnerable persons. I ask that because it seems to be a somewhat hollow and superficial exercise for the successor body&#039;s staff to protect drunken punters from throwing away their money on long shots on the Tote if the same punters can walk to the rails and give their money to the bookmakers instead.
</p>

<a name="40719-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>To conclude, I trust that the Minister is able to provide the House with a clear indication of what the Government intend the new subsection to achieve and what is meant by,

<a name="40719-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, says, the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, reminded the Grand Committee that Clause 9(1)(c) duplicates the intended objectives of gambling regulations under the Draft Gambling Bill. The intention in this Bill is that the issue should apply also to the exclusive licence of the Racing Trust or whoever it is.

</p>

<a name="40719-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Clause 9(1) provides that the Secretary of State, in considering whether to require the Gaming Board to issue or to revoke a licence, is to consider whether such issue or revocation would satisfy the objectives of the Draft Gambling Bill. Straightaway I say that those objectives have been welcomed by the Joint Committee on pre-legislative scrutiny and have achieved the general recognition that they are desirable objectives.
</p>

<a name="40719-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>The Secretary of State can exercise this power only while the Crown wholly owns the successor company. I can envisage only very limited circumstances where it has come to her notice that there was good evidence to suggest that the holder of the licence was somehow failing with regard to the objectives in paragraph (c). In other words, something would have to come to light after the successor company had been issued with a licence to cause the Secretary of State to reassess her decision to require the Gaming Board to issue the licence in the first place.

</p>

<a name="40719-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>The circumstances in which the Secretary of State could do that would be fairly obvious and would not require any detailed interpretation of the paragraph. For example, if the Secretary of State discovered that the successor company was letting children into its betting shops to place bets, depending on the extent of the problem, she might be entitled to consider whether it was a suitable body to conduct pool betting. Of course, she would have to ensure that good administrative practice&#151;namely, that she acted lawfully and reasonably&#151;was followed in reaching such a decision.
</p>

<a name="40719-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>I can give the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, the assurance that he wants&#151;that on-track betting is covered in the licensing objectives. In Schedule 4, paragraph 2 of the Draft Gambling Bill all forms of <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_101"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am glad to see the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, in his place. He tabled an amendment in Grand Committee, which I call the &quot;Larkhill amendment&quot;. Its purpose was to remove the number of race days which qualify a racecourse for point-to-point exemption notices for the purpose of conducting pool betting once the exclusive licence comes to an end. He said that there were racecourses which hold point-to-point races on more than four days a year&#151;the number of days stated in the Bill. He mentioned Larkhill as an example. I was sympathetic to what he said and stated that I would give it consideration.
</p>

<a name="40719-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>I should explain that this provision is not limited to Larkhill. Otherwise, I suppose it would become a hybrid Bill; it would mean that any racecourse could apply for a point-to-point exemption notice. That is what would happen if the original amendment of the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, had been agreed to. It would defeat the purpose of the notice, which is to provide a lighter regulatory regime for pool betting on point-to-point racecourses. The right thing to do is to raise the limit from four to seven days. That is what the amendment does. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="40719-12_spnew4"></a><b> Viscount Ullswater: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister very much for tabling this government amendment in response to the amendment that I put down in Grand Committee. It deals with almost all the concerns that I raised at that stage. Since then, I have been informed that point-to-point courses receive certificates of approval from the Levy Board to conduct betting. That appears to make the restriction in the Bill ineffective. I trust that when the gambling commission inherits the issuing of these certificates of approval from the Levy Board, it will look again at this matter and make sure that no point-to-point courses are disadvantaged.
</p>

<a name="40719-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>I think I stressed at the time that the Bill introduces a new regime for point-to-point meetings. Responsibility is now placed on the course managers rather than on the point-to-point secretaries. Of course, in many instances that may be the same individual. Applications must be made before the commencement of the calendar year, which means that decisions must be made long beforehand by the different organisers if they wish to run their own tote. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_43"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 43</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

At present, the Tote grants an &quot;authority&quot; to run pool betting to the organisers of a meeting during the year. Not all courses wish to run pool betting systems.
</p>

<a name="40719-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>Larkhill, as the Minister mentioned, is the only course that runs eight meetings. I did not want the number seven. That is why I said that the amendment addressed almost all the concerns. But I am an old hand and seven-eighths is much better than four-eighths; so I would not want to query the number at this time. Presumably, on most point-to-point courses, eight days is self-limiting in that the ground would not stand more than eight days&#039; racing on the same turf. Where there is more than one meeting, discussions can be held with the Gaming Board of Great Britain to see how many exemption notices would be appropriate for that course.
</p>

<a name="40719-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>I am very grateful to the Minister. With that, I hope that the House will agree to his amendment.

<a name="40719-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lipsey: </b>   My Lords, in Grand Committee, we took the separate but related point of harness racing and the possibility of exemption certificates for harness racing to complement those extended to point-to-points by the amendment originally suggested by the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater. I declare my interest as president of the British Harness Racing Club, and indeed a provisional driver under its rules. I want to square off the circle by reporting that it has emerged that it is possible to make progress in harness racing without a change to primary legislation. Discussions are well advanced with the Levy Board on how to permit that. That fully discharges the commitment made by the Minister in Grand Committee to deal with this problem. I am extremely grateful to him and his department for their assistance.

</p>

<a name="40719-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>It would be helpful to the House if the Minister could explain how the figure of seven was reached. Having re-read the excellent speech of my noble friend, I am concerned that the Government may have simply looked at the number of licences awarded in 2003 and used that as the basis for the higher figure. I am not certain that that is the best way to draft primary legislation.

</p>

<a name="40719-13_para1"></a>

&quot;(   )   In exercising his responsibilities under this section, the Secretary of State shall ensure that the Horserace Forensic Laboratory is established as an independent agency with the same aims and purposes as it had at the time which this Act is passed.&quot; 

<p><a name="st_107"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment covers the critically important area of drugs in sport. This is a very important subject and my analysis, far from digressing from the amendment, is central to it. I am therefore pleased to have this opportunity to facilitate the House&#039;s understanding of the arguments involved and to explain how it is central to the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40719-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>As noble Lords are aware, the Government propose to transfer the Horserace Forensic Laboratory to the British Horseracing Board, which is of course the governing body for the sport. I am concerned that such a proposal is fundamentally flawed and that it would not be in the best long-term interests of racing.
</p>

<a name="40719-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Anti-doping arrangements for any sport, including horseracing, should be independent of the governance of that sport and should at all times avoid conflicts of interest and the possibility of governing bodies being put in the invidious position of being gamekeeper turned poacher. Parliament has a duty to hold the Government to account in that respect, especially if sports bodies do not wish to tackle the problem of drugs seriously and in an open and transparent manner. I should stress that there is no implication whatever that horseracing is anything but totally committed to the fight against drugs in sport.
</p>

<a name="40719-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>Before I address the detail of my amendment, it may be helpful to recap briefly on the excellent work of the Horserace Forensic Laboratory so that the House has a fuller understanding of the purpose behind the amendment. Since 1963, the HFL has successfully provided drug surveillance services to British horseracing to help to maintain the integrity of the sport, both for participants and the betting industry. The laboratory is now one of the leading authorities in the world on drug testing horses and dogs. This is an achievement of which racing can rightly be proud. It is the mark of the excellent work done by the laboratory that it has been successful in its application to the World Anti-Doping Agency for accreditation to test human samples.
</p>

<a name="40719-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>There are only 32 such laboratories in the world, with the UK joining Germany and Spain as the only countries with two accredited laboratories. That was achieved only last week. I congratulate the staff at the laboratory on that impressive achievement.
</p>

<a name="40719-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>Many noble Lords already know that I have a passionate interest in ensuring that sport remains drug-free. No doubt that is in part influenced by the memory of being beaten to an Olympic gold medal by <br>&nbsp;<br>

athletes who were, as documented by subsequent analysis following the collapse of Communism, in all probability part of a systematic doping policy.

</p>

<a name="40719-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>I believe that the Government have a fundamental role to play in helping sports to remain drug-free. In Committee, the Minister accepted that the Government have a responsibility for anti-doping in sport. That responsibility has been ably demonstrated by the strong lead that we took, and the Government took, in the establishment of the world anti-doping code, and the Government&#039;s decision, led by the Minister for Sport, to sign up to the declaration on the code. It is worth reviewing the wording of the WADA code, which in Article 8 outlines the right to a fair and impartial hearing as a fundamental basis for drug testing. That is particularly important, because there is the potential for significant breaches of that right in the Government&#039;s proposals for the transfer of the Levy Board&#039;s assets under Clause 16. As the Minister said in Committee, talking about the transfer of assets:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;Although we have not reached a final decision on that, our approach has been to look to the British Horseracing Board, as the governing body of the sport, to be the most appropriate home for many of the assets held at present by the Levy Board. The BHB is the guardian of the sport&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 5/4/04; col. GC 544.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>I stress again that no criticism of the British Horseracing Board is intended, either explicitly or implicitly, in the amendment. It is about the principle of independence, and it applies equally to any sport. It just so happens that this Bill, and hence this amendment, covers horseracing and the transfer of the Horserace Forensic Laboratory.
</p>

<a name="40719-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The House will be aware of the high stakes that are now involved in drug testing in sport, particularly since the financial rewards of sport have increased so significantly. Just as the incentives for the few greed-ridden athletes to cheat have increased, so has the pressure on the sports organisers to limit the damage done to their sports by positive drug tests. There is always a danger that sports bodies will seek to overlook or minimise the publicity associated with potentially embarrassing drug findings. Perhaps equally important, there will always be the perception that governing bodies want to avoid positive findings, which has not been helped by cases such as the United States Track and Field Federation, which allegedly covered up adverse drug tests by its athletes in the past.
</p>

<a name="40719-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>It is essential that the Government take a strong lead in promoting drug-free sport. It is simply not good practice for the sports governing body to control the drug testing laboratory that carries out tests in its own sport. Such a system lays itself open to possible accusations, however false, that the anti-doping process will never be free from interference by that governing body. It is to prevent such accusations that I have tabled this amendment to Clause 16. There have already been cases where sports governing bodies have had to hold hearings for players accused of doping offences when the governing body itself had supplied the drugs. That is no one-off occurrence. In tennis, there was the well publicised case of Greg Rusedski, who was given an ATP-approved supplement that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_46"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 46</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

may have been contaminated. Similarly, in rugby there was Keiron Cunningham, the Welsh rugby league captain, who was given HGH by a bogus fitness adviser employed by the Rugby Football League. I am sure that the House can imagine how much more complicated it would be if the same governing body was also responsible for the drug-testing laboratory and the collection of samples. It cannot be right for the Government to hand over control of an anti-doping laboratory to the selfsame governing body responsible for prosecuting adverse drug tests on its athletes, as well as handing out and enforcing any punishments.
</p>

<a name="40719-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>To put it bluntly, in Part 2 of the Bill the Government are proposing the principle that the national governing body be responsible for choosing the athlete to be tested, testing the sample, holding the hearing to determine any guilt, deciding any penalty, and then enforcing the penalty. How can such a system ensure a free and fair hearing for anyone accused of a doping offence? It will make it all but impossible for an athlete or an owner of a horse to receive a free and fair hearing, particularly if there was a concern over the actions of the national governing body, as had been the case for Greg Rusedski and Keiron Cunningham. It is that aspect of the system that represents dereliction of the Government&#039;s responsibilities under the World Anti-Doping Agency.
<a name="time_15"></a>
<a name="40719-13_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40719-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>My amendment proposes that the laboratory be set up as an independent agency, free from any undue interference or, what is more likely, the perception of undue interference. It is that perception that is important from sporting interests. The appearance, the very suspicion, of undue interference, is one of the key issues here. This year has seen a couple of unfortunate instances where the integrity of racing and jockeys has been questioned. It is of key importance that punters maintain their faith in racing and their faith in the sport as a whole. It would be a tragedy for the sport if the industry were in any way compromised.
</p>

<a name="40719-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>My amendment will not resolve the many conflicts of interest that already exist within the UK&#039;s anti-doping policy. It would at least prevent another potential flaw being introduced by the Government. The clause, which encodes the Government&#039;s intention to give the drug-testing laboratory to the British Horseracing Board, sets a worrying precedent. What is to stop other sports&#151;in particular professional football, where the athletes are often worth as much as the best thoroughbred horses&#151;following a similar route? We have already seen unconfirmed press reports that the football authorities are thinking of moving drug testing away from UK Sport, the Government&#039;s anti-doping agency. Can we really expect the international sporting community to believe that we are tough on drugs in sport if we allow a leading sport to control its own drug-testing?
</p>

<a name="40719-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>I am aware that racing has put significant resources, particularly financial, into the Horserace Forensic Laboratory. It is right that should be recognised. It seems clear that the terms of the transfer scheme <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_47"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 47</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should take account of that investment, perhaps including free tests for horseracing in the future. It is also worth reflecting on the current uncertainty in the racing industry owing to the OFT investigation. While an agreement has been reached, it is still subject to public consultation, and we still cannot be certain that either the British Horseracing Board or the other racing bodies will remain unchanged. It makes far more sense for the future of such an important drug-testing laboratory to be safeguarded through its establishment as an independent agency. I stress again that there is no criticism of the British Horseracing Board implied in anything that I have said. It is the perception and the principle of the sports governing body owning the anti-doping laboratory and testing procedures for its own sport that troubles me. My amendment would dispel such concerns.
</p>

<a name="40719-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I trust that the Minister will agree that on this occasion I have not strayed from the amendment. In the interests of assisting him, it might be helpful if I highlighted three key points, which I would be grateful if he could consider in his reply. First, does the Minister agree that the Government have a lead role, perhaps even a statutory role, in the fight against drugs in sport? Does he further recognise that when his colleague the Minister for Sport signed up to the declaration of the World Anti-Doping Code, that committed the Government to upholding the principle of the right to a fair hearing under Article 8? Finally, does the Minister recognise that handing the drug-testing laboratory and drug-testing collection process for a sport to its own governing body could fundamentally jeopardise the right of an athlete, or anyone involved in the sport, to a fair hearing before that same governing body?
</p>

<a name="40719-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>I ask the Minister whether his department has sought advice from the World Anti-Doping Agency, whose chairman, in Parliament, responded to a question I put to him upstairs as to whether it would be better to have an independent anti-doping agency with an unambiguous, &quot;Yes&quot;. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="40719-14_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Falkland: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, on so fully and comprehensively explaining his amendment. His arguments were persuasive, as I am sure the Minister will acknowledge in his response.

</p>

<a name="40719-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>We are talking about an exceptional institution. Those of us who have had the privilege of visiting it know that it is a centre of excellence. It has scientists of the highest repute internationally, as indeed has the British Horseracing Board. The perceptions mentioned by the noble Lord are important in racing, for the reasons that he gave. Many of the rows and disagreements&#151;I do not want to put it too strongly&#151;involve the public perception of what, people hope, is a fair and honest sport. By and large, it is fair and honest, but we must maintain the utmost vigilance to sustain the reputation that racing rightly has worldwide.

</p>

<a name="40719-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Apart from that, it was clear to the All-Party Group on Racing and Bloodstock, when we visited, that the work of the laboratory was much wider than just racing. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_48"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 48</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

It deals with all kinds of scientific research with regard to animals&#151;dogs and horses mainly, but others too. It is appropriate, as the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, has argued, for such a body to stand independently of any sport. I agree with the noble Lord that that is no criticism of the British Horseracing Board, which has been suggested as the successor. I am sure that it would not want its ownership to inhibit in any way the ability of the laboratory to maintain its high scientific reputation. I hope that the Minister will say that, ultimately, he and the Government hope that the laboratory will stand independently as a centre of excellence and that this is only a temporary measure.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="40719-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lipsey: </b>   My Lords, I understand, as will the whole House, the logic behind the arguments made by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, and by the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, but I am not sure whether their practical impact is the same. The thing about the British Horseracing Board and racing as a whole is that it is vital to the continuation of racing that there should be a fair system of drug testing and that cheats should be discovered and dealt with. The BHB has such a strong vested interest in that that I find it hard to see how there would be a conflict of interest with the HFL, which is trying to do the same thing.
</p>

<a name="40719-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>I have another point to make about the HFL. I must declare a third quadrupedal interest as chairman of the British Greyhound Racing Board. Greyhound racing is not an area, perhaps, into which the HFL will be moving, as human drug testing is. The HFL is already absolutely central to it, and a huge amount of greyhound drug testing goes on. The number of drug-positives has diminished tremendously, although, as noble Lords will know, we lost a Derby winner last year through a drug test. That work must continue, and it seems to me that the British greyhound racing industry has an important interest in the HFL. I trust that, when the ownership arrangements are sorted, that interest will be duly recognised.
</p>

<a name="40719-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>Sometimes, our poor old dogs are the poor cousins of the horseracing industry, with all its grand and noble advocates, but attendances at the races are two-thirds the size of those at horseraces. I hope that, with regard to the ownership and control of the HFL, the Minister will not downgrade the importance of greyhound racing just because it is a sport of the working classes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="40719-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I can go some way along the path outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, and others. I can confirm, as I did in Committee, that the Horserace Forensic Laboratory is a world-renowned centre for equine drug testing. It conducts nearly 9,000 tests a year for the Jockey Club and provides services for other clients, such as the National Greyhound Racing Club, as my noble friend Lord Lipsey reminded us. It is also true that the Horserace Forensic Laboratory has gained accreditation from the World Anti-Doping Agency for testing human sport samples, which significantly enhances its international status. It has also gained a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_49"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 49</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

major two-year contract to participate in UK Sport&#039;s anti-doping programme. So far, we are all entirely in agreement.
</p>

<a name="40719-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>I yield to the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, in my understanding of drug testing in sport. I acknowledge his expertise, and I admire the passion with which he pursues his concerns. I fully support what he says about drug testing, but it does not lead me to the same conclusion about the amendment and the future of the Horserace Forensic Laboratory.
</p>

<a name="40719-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>The first point is that the HFL was established via the Levy Board with racing&#039;s money. That means that it should be transferred to racing, along with other Levy Board assets. That is what Clause 16 does, and our intention is to transfer it to the British Horseracing Board. As the governing body of the sport, it is the most appropriate home for the HFL. It will be for the BHB to decide what terms of payment are most suitable for services provided to the Jockey Club and other clients of HFL.
</p>

<a name="40719-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>This is the fundamental point: the amendment is based on the assumption that there is a conflict of interest if the same body decides which horses will be tested, how the testing should be done and who should adjudicate on the results. There is not. The testing done by the Horserace Forensic Laboratory is not done for the British Horseracing Board; it is done for the Jockey Club. The British Horseracing Board is the governing body, but the Jockey Club is the regulator. The testing is done for a different organisation. I am sorry to say that, therefore, the whole thrust of the noble Lord&#039;s argument is misconceived.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="40719-14_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Moynihan: </b>   My Lords, it is far from misconceived. The fact that the BHB pays for the Jockey Club seems to render any distinction somewhat arbitrary.
</p>

<a name="40719-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I shall move from dismissing the Minister&#039;s last argument to the fundamental point. It is and will remain the case that the principle here is one of having an independent anti-doping agency. It is wrong that UK Sport should meet, one day, to consider which elite athletes to fund and, the next day, meet under the same chairman to determine who will be tested in an anti-doping programme. Even if that works with all the professionalism evident in UK Sport&#151;Michelle Verroken ran the anti-doping agency with integrity and professionalism that was second to none in the world&#151;it remains possible that there will be a perception that there is a conflict of interest. That perception could be dealt with by separating the two functions. That is the thrust of the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40719-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>It is clear that we have a difference of opinion on the matter, and I would like to test the opinion of the House on whether there is merit in setting up the anti-doping laboratory for horseracing&#151;the HFL&#151;as an independent body. I fully recognise the Minister&#039;s second point that the Horserace Forensic Laboratory has received significant money from racing. That must be recognised in the terms of any transfer scheme. The scheme must take into account that investment.

   &quot;EXEMPTION OF OLYMPIC LOTTERY FROM LOTTERY DUTY

<br>
   After section 24(4)(e) of the Finance Act 1993 (c. 34) there is inserted&#151;


<br>
&quot;(f)   of an Olympic Lottery within the meaning of the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004&quot;.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_113"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we move to Part 3 and the London 2012 Olympic bid. In Committee it was clear that the exemption of the Olympic lottery from duty was one of the key points of difference in the Bill between the Government and these Benches. The purpose of Part 3 is to create a new lottery game specifically to raise money for the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympic Games.
</p>

<a name="40719-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>We believe that all the money raised through the new Olympic lottery game should go to the Olympics and Paralympics rather than the Treasury. This is the first lottery game exclusively hypothecated to one good cause and we hope that it will help to rejuvenate the lottery that John Major set up so successfully in 1995. If the opportunity to stage the Olympic and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_52"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 52</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Paralympic Games in London is so important that it merits a new hypothecated game, then it also merits a decision by the Treasury to hypothecate its usual 12p lottery duty to the games.

</p>

<a name="40719-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The scale of the tax raid on the Olympic lottery is worth highlighting. As the House is aware, the new Olympic lottery games are expected to raise &#163;750 million towards the cost of staging the games. However, the fact that the new Olympic lottery will also raise &#163;340 million for the Treasury may not be so well known. In seeking to understand the Government&#039;s justification for levying a &#163;340 million tax on the nation&#039;s efforts to raise money for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, it might be helpful to revisit what the Minister said in Committee. He stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;The lottery is a mainstream gambling activity in competition with other gambling activities&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6/4/04; col. GC 566.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>The more I think about this statement, the more I am concerned that the Government have not fully understood the unique contribution of the National Lottery to the nation&#039;s good causes. It is both perplexing and inconsistent that, on the one hand, the House is being asked to approve a special measure to raise money for the London 2012 Olympic Games, and yet, on the other hand, the Minister considers this to be no more than another mainstream gambling opportunity.
</p>

<a name="40719-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>Perhaps this is the reason for the difference of opinion between us and the Government on the merits of the amendment. We do not consider the lottery&#151;and especially the Olympic lottery being set up under the Bill&#151;to be simply a mainstream gambling opportunity. Our view is shared by the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, and I fear the Minister may be on his own in this case.
</p>

<a name="40719-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I shall quote for the Minister&#039;s benefit the Select Committee&#039;s report on the reform of the National Lottery. The Select Committee viewed the taxation of lottery returns for good causes as an,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;inappropriate double hit for the Treasury&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>The report continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;Returns for good causes should be treated more like charitable giving than other spending on gambling products. Within the gambling sector we note that the Government recognises the unique status of the Lottery for the purposes of regulation but not for the purposes of taxation. This is inconsistent and wrong&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40719-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>The Select Committee concluded that there was a strong case for treating the lottery as charitable giving rather than mainstream gambling, thereby qualifying it for gift aid rather than the 12p lottery duty. The Minister will be relieved to know that the amendment stops short of the Select Committee&#039;s recommendation. Instead it would enable the new Olympic lottery games to be treated as one of the special exemptions qualifying for zero-rate lottery duty within the 1993 financial legislation which governs the tax on all lotteries. There are clear precedents for lotteries to be exempt from the duty; these include private lotteries, society lotteries and perhaps, my personal favourite, a lottery promoted in accordance with the Art Unions Act 1846.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_53"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 53</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40719-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>As I have said before, if the Olympic lottery were tax free it would send out a very strong message signalling the Government&#039;s commitment to hosting the Olympics to lottery ticket buyers, to supporters of the London Olympics, to the international sporting community as a whole and, most important, to the IOC. The importance of this message should not be underestimated. It is clear from the International Olympic Committee report on the bidding cities that the London bid would benefit from stronger governmental support.
</p>

<a name="40719-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>If the new game is to raise the required &#163;750 million towards the cost of staging the 2012 games, then why place obstacles in its way. If more money from each lottery ticket sold went to the Olympics, then the sales of tickets would be boosted and the Olympic lottery financial goals would be secured. Similarly, if the Olympic lottery is tax free, this will help to impress upon the international sporting community just how serious we are in our desire to bring the Olympics and Paralympics to London in 2012.
</p>

<a name="40719-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>At Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Judd, eloquently put forward the view, supported by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, that the new Olympic lottery game should be tax free as this would reduce the need to raid quite so much from other good causes. The Minister&#039;s rejection of these arguments in Committee begs a closer examination of the Treasury&#039;s financial commitment to the London 2012 bid. On first examination of the figures for the funding of a London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games it is now clear how much money the Exchequer will be contributing. We know that the Treasury remains the ultimate guarantor of the Games, but in the small print even this ultimate responsibility is shifted onto the lottery and the Mayor of London. The fact of the matter is that after winning the bid in Singapore next July, if we still have a Labour Chancellor, the Treasury will not put a single penny towards the cost of the Games.
</p>

<a name="40719-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Indeed, it is possible that because of the financial arrangements and the burden placed on the lottery, the Treasury will actually make a direct profit from the   Games. That is why, when asked about the Chancellor&#039;s support for the London bid, Michael Howard said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;To describe Gordon Brown as a little half-hearted in his support for the bid is possibly a compliment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>As we know, the Treasury is currently reviewing the taxation of the National Lottery. In Committee I quoted the words of the Economic Secretary to the Treasury who said that the Government were in &quot;listening mode&quot; about possible changes to the way in which the lottery is taxed. Why then in Committee did the Government appear to go suddenly and conveniently deaf?
</p>

<a name="40719-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>On that occasion, the Minister tried to pour cold water on these proposals by stating that the Treasury review would be in the context of maintaining Exchequer revenues. This is not as disappointing as it might initially appear to be. It is clear that a significant part of the revenue from the new Olympic lottery game will be additional ticket sales and will therefore <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_54"></a>

represent a bonus to the Exchequer. Thus the hypothecated Olympic lottery games will, as I mentioned before, if anything be helpful to the maintenance of the Exchequer coffers.

</p>

<a name="40719-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>The amendment provides an opportunity for the Minister to demonstrate before the House just how seriously the Government are listening to the arguments for reduced taxation on the National Lottery. The House is, of course, limited in its powers with regard to financial issues and especially Finance Acts, but we owe it to sport, as we do to the other good causes, to send a clear message to the Treasury that where there is a hypothecated game with a specific intent&#151;in this case to raise money for a successful bid and to host, from that successful bid, the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games&#151;and where Parliament is being asked to agree to the first ever hypothecated game for a purpose, it must be right that the Treasury does not pocket 12p of every ticket sold for that purpose. It should ensure that our disabled athletes and our able-bodied athletes receive every part of the pound that is spent in order to back the London Olympics, rather than pocketing 12p and making sure that the tax does not go to the games.
</p>

<a name="40719-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>That is the fundamental principle behind the amendment. From these Benches, the Conservative Party has not only committed to ensuring the 12p goes to the London Games, but that, in practice, represents more than four times as much money as the total sports budget of the DCMS. That is a commitment from these Benches and from the Conservative Party to the success of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, which we believe should be at the heart of any party&#039;s sports policy at the present time.
</p>

<a name="40719-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>I hope that the Treasury will be persuaded to forgo the tax on the new Olympic Lottery. It certainly should. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="40719-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, having recovered from my surprise at seeing an amendment on the Marshalled List which purports to amend a Finance Act&#151;which I have not seen in this House before&#151;I reflect that the Public Bill Office must have accepted the amendment. It must have snuck in somehow from round the corner and must be legitimate, but it does not seem to me that if I went to the Chancellor of the Exchequer with this suggestion he would be terribly happy.
</p>

<a name="40719-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, were to press the amendment and succeed in a Division, the Commons would of course reject it on the grounds of privilege, not only because it purports to amend a Finance Act but it would cause a considerable reduction of Exchequer income.

</p>

<a name="40719-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>There has been no secrecy about this issue all the way through. We have said that although the Chancellor is always looking at the current tax treatment of the lottery&#151;he keeps the lottery duty under review and gives consideration to representations made in the course of the Budget and Finance Bill process&#151;he does not, and we do not, think it appropriate to make this exception to the rules set out when the lottery was established by a Conservative administration. I do not find the argument that this is hypothecated to a single cause at all <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_55"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

convincing. After all, the lottery funds have been set up&#151;again, by a Conservative administration&#151;to be hypothecated to good causes. Although the good causes then have the freedom to distribute their funds, they are nevertheless hypothecated to a very substantial degree.
</p>

<a name="40719-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>The principle of the taxation of the National Lottery was accepted by Parliament when the lottery was introduced. Lottery duty&#151;that is, the 12 per cent&#151;brings in more than &#163;500 million a year for spending on essential public services such as schools and hospitals. When the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, says, with great confidence, that his party supports this amendment, I hope that he will understand that we will be using that statement in any future election. He had better be very clear that he has Mr Letwin&#039;s agreement that additional expenditure will be added to the sums on which it is proposed that the Conservative Party will fight an election.
</p>

<a name="40719-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>The National Lottery is a mainstream gambling activity, in competition with other gambling activities. It is reasonable that it should make a fair contribution to revenue for public expenditure at the same time as raising money for good causes. We debated in Grand Committee how much of the money raised from the Olympic lottery would in fact be diverted from other good causes. The figure that I have is 51 per cent. I hope that when the Conservative Party is fighting an election, it will be expecting some reaction from sport, the arts, heritage and the projects funded by the New Opportunities Fund if such an exception were to be made for only one of the National Lottery good causes.
</p>

<a name="40719-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>We intend that the same principles that apply to the existing National Lottery should apply to any Olympic-themed games. There are not, at this stage, any plans to exempt the National Lottery from tax. It has not, and it has never been, the Government&#039;s intention to fund the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games from central Government tax receipts. Indeed, the public funding package for the games does not rely on central Government revenue, and that did not cause an adverse reaction from the International Olympic Committee. Hypothecating taxes from the Olympic lottery, as this amendment proposes, runs contrary to this principle.
</p>

<a name="40719-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Of course I am sympathetic to any desire to boost the Olympic cause, and I have no doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, will plead that cause. However, this amendment is a departure from the principles on which, right from the outset, we have proposed to fund the Olympic Games, and it is not acceptable to the Government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="40719-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Moynihan: </b>   My Lords, let me respond to the Minister&#039;s comments. First, I am well aware that tax matters are the responsibility of another place. However, I would be doing this House, particularly the noble Lords, Lord Phillips of Sudbury and Lord   Pendry, among others, a disservice if I failed to mention that we have previously managed to persuade the Treasury on the merits of tax cuts for sport, most recently tax breaks for community amateur sports <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_56"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 56</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

clubs. However, I take the Minister&#039;s point about the Finance Act and, in that context, I shall not be pressing the amendment to a Division.
</p>

<a name="40719-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Before I conclude my remarks, I should like to make a few points. The Minister is concerned about the hit on other good causes to which the amendment would, in his view, lead. I have already demonstrated in Committee&#151;some might argue at somewhat too great a length; it was certainly a long speech&#151;the merits for starting the Olympic lottery game at the time of the Athens Olympics rather than in a year&#039;s time. I did so because I was driven by the fact that we would reduce the take on other good causes if we were to raid a contingent fee in order to host the games in London 2012 at any stage between winning the bid next summer and 2012.
</p>

<a name="40719-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Had we been able to launch the hypothecated game at the same time as the Athens games started, there would have been a direct benefit to other good causes. Such an amendment has not been tabled before your Lordships today simply because it has been a long time since we last considered the Bill. In fact, the day before the Easter Recess was the last day of the Committee stage, and we are so close to the Athens games that it is impractical&#151;it is too late&#151;to launch the game at the same time as the Athens Olympics, which will take place in a matter of weeks. So in that regard I reject the Minister&#039;s argument.
</p>

<a name="40719-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>The noble Lord also questioned whether I had support for the amendment. I have the support not only of the Leader of the Conservative Party, the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer and every member of the shadow Cabinet, but, I believe, of every Londoner committed to sport and recreation to ensure that that 12 pence tax take goes towards hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012. It is simply not credible to argue that the generic term &quot;good causes&quot;, which is very widely drawn, is a hypothecated single cause. It is not. If it were, there would be no need for Part 3 of the Bill. We would have no need for a specific hypothecated game because it could easily be managed within the context of good causes.

</p>

<a name="40719-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>In bringing forward this legislation, the Government recognised that they required parliamentary approval to have the first ever hypothecated game&#151;a game that was specific in its intent and totally directed towards hosting the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Government recognise that this is the first ever hypothecated game. They are seeking parliamentary approval to recognise and to launch that hypothecated game. The Government cannot accept that proposal while taking the opportunity to pocket the 12 pence, which, quite frankly, in a hypothecated game, should go towards the games.
</p>

<a name="40719-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Londoners would expect this to go towards the games. Sportsmen and women the length and breadth of this country will expect that all but a very small administrative charge on the pound they spend in choosing to buy an Olympic 2012 ticket after the decision in Singapore next year should go to the   games. We back Londoners in that view; we back the sportsmen and women the length and breadth of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_57"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 57</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

this country, with whom I have spoken on many occasions about the intent of this amendment. We have complete support from the shadow Cabinet and on these Benches. I believe, from many discussions with noble Lords opposite, that there is a lot of support on their Benches as well.
</p>

<a name="40719-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>I take the point that the Minister made at the beginning of his reply. There was unquestionably a major discussion within Cabinet over whether a bid should be backed. We have had prevarication for three and a half months. There were two schools of thought: one said no; but the other recognised there would be tremendous benefit for the sporting world and particularly for the pride of London if we were successful in hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The decision finally came down to a yes, with the proviso that the Treasury would not pay for the games. Ultimately, Londoners, through an increased precept, would pay a significant part of every additional pound that was required to host the games as well as paying for the games. I argue that that is one very strong reason why the IOC did not recognise the level of government support as being high when it undertook its interim adjudication of all the competing cities. We were not at the top; we were very close to the bottom.
</p>

<a name="40719-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>We need to address the financing of the games, and we need to look at how we can encourage the private sector to play a far greater role. After all, these games will be right next door to the City of London. Within two miles of the City of London, we should have a structure to encourage private sector support for the games which is far more prominent than that which we have seen to date. It is for all those reasons that, in tabling the amendment, I believed the Government had an opportunity to demonstrate their support for our able-bodied and our disabled athletes in their bid to back my noble friend Lord Coe and his team in winning the bid in Singapore next year to host the games in London in 2012. However, I am grateful, as always, to the Minister for his reply. For the reasons I have given, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40719-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>Page 13, line 22, leave out from &quot;has&quot; to end of line 29 and insert &quot;made an order under subsection (3).</p>

(3)   If a United Kingdom city has decided to bid to host the Olympic Games, the Secretary of State shall, by order, make a declaration to that effect. 

<br>
(3A)   Where the Secretary of State has made a declaration under subsection (3), he shall then make a progress report every three months to Parliament on the bid and its financing until the International Olympic Committee has elected a host city for the Olympic Games.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_58"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(3B)   The duty in subsection (3A) continues after the election but only in relation to a successful bid by a United Kingdom city to host the Olympic Games; and the duty then ceases once the Olympic Games have taken place or have been fully financed, whichever is the later.

<br>
(3C)   Subsection (4) applies if the Secretary of State by order declares&#151;


<br>
(a)   that the International Olympic Committee has elected a host city other than a bidding United Kingdom city as the host city for the Olympic Games in any bidding round, or


<br>
(b)   that the election by the International Olympic Committee of a United Kingdom city as the host city for the Olympic Games has been revoked.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_118"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a somewhat complicated amendment, but its aims are simple. First, proposed subsection (3) would permit an early start to the Olympic lottery for the 2012 London Olympics bid or any subsequent British bid. That is to say that the lottery could start once it has been announced that a British city is bidding for the games. Secondly, subsection (3A) would ensure that the Secretary of State makes regular reports to Parliament on the progress of the bid with an update on the financing. Finally, subsection (3B) would require that those regular reports continue once the British city has won the bid until the Olympics have taken place and the financing has been signed off.
</p>

<a name="40719-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>Noble Lords may recall that we on these Benches have previously argued that the proposed Olympic lottery games should have been launched to coincide with the Olympic Games in Athens this summer. I referred to that a moment ago. In Grand Committee in April&#151;some three months ago&#151;I highlighted the benefits that an early start would bring. Not only would it help to raise the domestic profile of the London 2012 bid, which is essential to any successful bid, but it would also raise an additional &#163;50 million and save the other good causes money.

</p>

<a name="40719-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>As many noble Lords will already be aware, the International Olympic Committee rules require that the proceeds from the Olympic lottery be used towards Olympic purposes, including funding for the British Olympic Association, the British Paralympic Association and Olympic athletes as well as the cost of staging the Olympics. The Minister and no doubt the House will be pleased to learn that I do not intend to develop that argument further today, mainly because delays in bringing forward the Report stage have removed many of the benefits of starting the lottery game early.
</p>

<a name="40719-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>However, the main purpose of this amendment is to require the Government to make regular reports on the progress of our London bid as well as the latest financial projections. Noble Lords will be aware that the Government are a key stakeholder in the London 2012 Olympic bid, even though they have discharged their financial responsibilities through the National Lottery and London council tax payers. It is therefore right and proper that Parliament receives regular updates on how our bid is progressing.
</p>

<a name="40719-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>A great deal has happened to the London 2012 Olympic bid since our discussions in Grand Committee. I feel sure that all sides of the House will join me in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Coe, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_59"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on his new position as chairman of the London 2012 Olympic bid. I was fortunate enough to compete at the same time as the noble Lord in both the 1980 and 1984 Olympics and I know that we have an excellent chairman for the bid.

</p>

<a name="40719-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>The other major development in our Olympic bid has been the publication of the report by the <i>IOC Candidature Acceptance Working Group to the IOC Executive Board</i> on 18 May 2004. The report was the basis for the short-listing of the bids in which London came third out of the nine applicant cities. It must now act as a road map of what the Government need to do in order to achieve our aim of winning a gold medal in the race to host the 2012 Olympics. With this proposed clause at the heart of the Bill, we would have regular reports and that road map would form the basis for regular reports to government.
</p>

<a name="40719-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>The amendment would ensure that we have the opportunity to study the 11 key criteria by which our bid would be judged, with a ranking given to each one. On government support, legal issues and public opinion, London finished eighth out of nine, but we would have the opportunity, through this amendment, constantly to see the improvement that I believe must and will come if we are to win the bid. On general infrastructure we were third and on sports venues, fourth. Our Olympic village concept was rated sixth. On environmental impact we came joint second. On accommodation, one of the few areas outside government control, we came first. Our transport concept came a distant fourth, with parts of our transport system being described as &quot;often obsolete&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40719-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Again, if the amendment were passed, we would have the opportunity to consider and review the improvements that I am sure we will see&#151;and must see&#151;in the transport system between now and when the decision is made in July next year, and to monitor, consider and discuss those improvements. When necessary we must cajole the Government to make those improvements, but I hope to return to this House regularly to congratulate the Government on making those improvements.
</p>

<a name="40719-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>On finance, we were ranked joint second. On the overall project and legacy, we came third. Perhaps one of the advantages of this amendment being passed is that, although experience of past sports events is critical, London&#039;s ability to host those events would be considered by your Lordships. We would be promoting London and the Government would be supporting London through UK Sport to host more international events successfully, as we have done with Wimbledon and as I hope that we would do on future occasions within Olympic sports. The fact of the matter is that we were judged sixth out of the nine bidding cities on those criteria.

</p>

<a name="40719-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>Agreeing to the amendment would enable the Minister to come back and show the good progress that I am sure he intends to make between now and July next year. As the Minister knows, we have a long way to go if London is to be successful, but we should not be downhearted. We now know what needs to be done and it is up to the bid team, the Government and the GLA to learn from the IOC report, to strengthen those areas that need <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_60"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

strengthening and to deliver a much improved final bid book to the IOC on 15 November. However, the bid team can only do so much on its own. It needs dedicated and committed government support. That is the key to success.
</p>

<a name="40719-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Government support for an Olympic bid is essential for success. That is why the amendment calls for regular updates from the Government on the progress of our bid, so that we can monitor much needed improvement and higher levels of support from the Government. So far, most of the Government&#039;s comments on the bid have come from Parliamentary Questions and media speculation. Although Parliamentary Questions and their Answers are helpful, I am afraid that they can only do so much. There would be merit in regular reports, when both Houses would have the opportunity to hold the Government to account and continue, as we consistently have from these Benches, to make positive contributions to the Government&#039;s thinking.
</p>

<a name="40719-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>For example, it worries me deeply that Ministers can write to me on 14 July saying that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;London did not score badly for Government support&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14/7/04; <i>WA</i> <i>153</i>.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>That followed on from the Secretary of State with responsibility for the Olympic bid saying, no doubt somewhat tongue in cheek, that London scored badly on the IOC criteria for government support,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;because of the uncertainty created by the forthcoming mayoral elections&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 28/6/04; col. 15.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>The House will recall that, at the time the IOC report was completed, none of our London mayoral candidates had been officially adopted.
</p>

<a name="40719-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>It is clear that the Government need to accept the facts, learn from them and then move on by stepping up at least two gears in their support. Noble Lords may have seen the speculation in the media that the Prime Minister will use his summer reshuffle to appoint a Minister with specific responsibility for our Olympic bid. That is to be welcomed. I have been calling for that appointment for over a year. I hope that the Minister is able to feed back the support of these Benches and indeed, the House, for a government response to a classic example of a positive contribution to government thinking.
</p>

<a name="40719-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The other major area that the Government rather than the bid team will need to address if we are to win the race to host the games is, as I have mentioned, the state of London&#039;s transport infrastructure. The scale of the investment needed is such that that clearly falls within the Government&#039;s area of responsibility. The Government are responsible for the delivery of the East London Line extension and improvements to the Jubilee Line. Both those developments were promised within our initial bid to the IOC and the Government&#039;s credibility will not be improved if they cannot find the funding required to deliver those projects in time for the 2012 games. I hope that, as a result of what was in the press this morning, the Minister will report to this House that that money has been found and that we are moving forward on a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_61"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 61</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

timetable to meet the Games. Indeed, I hope that he can confirm that the same applies to Crossrail, which was mentioned on the front page of <i>The Times</i> today.
</p>

<a name="40719-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>Amendments such as this provide an opportunity for the Minister to report to the House on progress towards this important Olympic bid. The opportunity to report to the House at regular intervals on all the issues that I have mentioned will, I hope, be warmly welcomed by the Minister. I hope that he is about to stand in front of us and address those key issues on transport infrastructure.

</p>

<a name="40719-17_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>The House will be aware that noble Lords on these Benches are passionate supporters of the London Olympic bid and we are committed to doing everything in our power to help deliver the games to London. I believe that this amendment will further strengthen the excellent work being done by the London bid team.
</p>

<a name="40719-17_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>I trust that my suggestions will be acceptable to the Minister, who will, with his colleagues&#151;in every aspect of the IOC interim report conclusions&#151;consider them, react to them and push London to the top of the tree so that we win in Singapore in July next year. I also trust that, with this amendment, we shall have the opportunity in your Lordships&#039; House to consider all the points that I have outlined consistently at regular opportunities and in detail. I beg to move.

<a name="40719-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, this is an interesting amendment. As the noble Lord told us, the Government did not come out of the initial bidding process very well.

</p>

<a name="40719-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>The idea that the Government should report every three months is an interesting one. If this amendment is not accepted, can the Minister give us some idea about what plans there are for reporting progress to Parliament on this matter?

</p>

<a name="40719-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>Bearing in mind that the Government are still responsible for driving this bid, we have not seen a great deal of commitment in the work that they have done. The communication to win over the support of the rest of the country does not seem to have had an impact. So far, I have not read anything or seen a great deal about the promotion of our Olympic bid nationwide. The French, who are perhaps our major competitors on this side of the Atlantic, have the whole of their government machine behind them. Their bid is driven loudly and obviously by the French Government.

<a name="40719-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>I do not believe that it is too late. I am not one to give up a race until the race is well and truly lost. I wish to make the point that the British Government have an awful lot of work to do, and we are looking to some serious initiatives and some serious public support and leadership to get our bid well and truly up front.

<a name="40719-18_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, started by saying that his amendment was complicated. I can forgive him for that. Clause 22, in which it is placed, is also complicated. He need not be ashamed of that.
</p>

<a name="40719-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, thinks that I am going to make a stump speech of the kind that he has just made&#151;it was a very fine stump speech; the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, added to it and I admired it&#151;I am going to disappoint him. My responsibility in this legislation is to respond to the amendment before us rather than to the very interesting, but more general, views which have been expressed.

</p>

<a name="40719-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The amendment would enable Olympic lottery games to begin as soon as any UK city had decided to bid for the Olympics. It would therefore allow Olympic lottery games to begin before the International Olympic Committee had elected a host city. We argued against that in relation to the London 2012 Games and the same arguments apply to any future bid.
<a name="time_18"></a>
<a name="40719-18_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40719-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>We believe&#151;and the distributors of lottery funds also agree&#151;that only the unique opportunity of hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games can justify the establishment of a lottery fund specifically for that purpose. If Olympic lottery games were to begin before the IOC had elected a host and a UK bid was unsuccessful, the funds raised in relation to that bid would need to be allocated to Olympic and Paralympic sport. The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, was right and open about that. He knows what can and cannot be spent before a host city is selected. Olympic and Paralympic sport are worthy causes but they do not justify a hypothecated funding stream separate from the existing sports lottery funding stream.
</p>

<a name="40719-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>We have asked the existing distributors and their funding sectors to work with us, in the event of a successful bid, to manage the impact that the Olympic lottery games would have on the income to their good <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_63"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 63</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

causes. They have agreed to that because of the wide-ranging benefits that hosting the games would bring. The majority of lottery distributors have confirmed that they would not want Olympic lottery games to begin before a decision had been made on the host city because of the probable impact on the income to their good causes. I have no doubt that they would hold the same views in relation to any future bids.

</p>

<a name="40719-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>To amend the Bill to extend the opportunity to run Olympic lottery games to any time in the future, provided that a UK city had simply declared an intention to bid for the Olympics, would certainly cause widespread concern among the lottery distributors and the good causes. Effectively, the lottery would be held hostage to fortune.
</p>

<a name="40719-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The amendment is also drafted to enable legislation to apply to any future Olympic bids. We do not believe that that is appropriate in advance of more detailed knowledge of all relevant considerations. I will consider that matter when I respond to the next group of amendments.
</p>

<a name="40719-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The remainder of this amendment places a statutory requirement on the Secretary of State to submit progress and finance reports to Parliament on this current bid and any future UK Olympic bid every three months. If the bid is successful, the Secretary of State will be required to continue submitting three-monthly progress and finance reports to Parliament&#151;presumably on the staging of the Games&#151;until the Olympic Games have taken place or they are fully financed, whichever is later.

</p>

<a name="40719-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>That is a real burden. It is not necessary to place such a requirement on the face of the Bill because robust accounting and governance arrangements are already in place in relation to the bid. London 2012, the bidding company, is already obliged to produce annual accounts that will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. In addition, the stakeholders have in place arrangements&#151;including meetings and updates&#151;to ensure appropriate and rigorous oversight of the progress and financing of the bid company.
</p>

<a name="40719-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>Speaking as someone who does not usually pay a great deal of attention to the sporting pages, there has not exactly been a shortage of public comment on the progress of the Olympic bid. The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, referred to it himself. It has certainly attracted my attention in a way that it might not otherwise have done.
</p>

<a name="40719-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>In the event of a successful London bid for the 2012 Olympics, the bodies directly involved in the delivery of the Games will be required to give full account of any public monies received.
</p>

<a name="40719-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>An additional requirement to lay three-monthly reports before Parliament on progress and financing arrangements of the Olympic bid&#151;and, if successful, on the staging arrangements&#151;would be extremely onerous. It would duplicate reporting structures and accountability arrangements that are in place with the stakeholders and the International Olympic Committee and could lead to unnecessary delay or interference.

</p>

<a name="40719-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>We recognise the legitimate and important role of Parliament in the scrutiny of public expenditure. However, we believe that existing arrangements, including the Public Accounts Committee and the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, which is extremely active, in conjunction with the laying of annual reports as described, will ensure an adequate level of parliamentary involvement. I hope that the amendment will not be pressed because it would, in effect, allow for the immediate introduction of an Olympic lottery bid before a host city was announced, and because of the reporting requirements.

<a name="40719-18_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Moynihan: </b>   My Lords, I believe that I should thank the Minister for referring to my speech and that of my noble friend Lord Glentoran as being very fine stump speeches. If that description reflects the passion for sport that my noble friend and I have, we shall take the Minister&#039;s comments as a compliment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_123"></a>

</p>

<a name="40719-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Briefly, the specific point is that publication of annual accounts is insufficient to monitor progress on the bid, as we should do in Parliament. I hope that we will win the bid; the one critical factor that can ensure that we do so is government leadership. With that, with strong government policies to support the bid and with government commitment, the excellent work that is being done will lead to a winning bid. Looking at the examples of the active support of Chirac when he was mayor in Paris&#151;he now leads his country&#151;or at what is happening in Madrid shows that that is the litmus test of success for a bid.
</p>

<a name="40719-18_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>The Minister should reflect between now and the announcement next year in Singapore on the fact that the reporting structure that the amendment would put in place would, I am sure, take us from pretty low in terms of ranking in terms of government support to the very top. All those working on the London 2012 Olympic bid and every sportsman and sportswoman the length and breadth of the country deserve and expect government leadership, commitment and strong policies towards success. I hope that they will be forthcoming. However, in light of our debate, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</ul>

</p>




<p><a name="st_126"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is similar to one that we debated in Grand Committee. Briefly, its purpose, and that of those grouped with it, is to extend the Bill&#039;s shelf life. If London is unsuccessful in the 2012 bid&#151;we all hope that that will not be the case&#151;we on these Benches believe that there is a strong case for retaining the legislation so that it could be used to support subsequent bids.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_65"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 65</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40719-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>We are all aware that primary legislation is time-consuming and that it is not always easy to find parliamentary time. These relatively simple amendments are designed to ensure that we do not need to revisit our deliberations if the government of the day decide to bid once more for the Olympics and Paralympics. Having re-read our discussions in Grand Committee in <i>Hansard</i>, I am slightly unclear about whether the Minister was unable to accept the amendments because the Bill is a bespoke Bill for the London 2012 games or if it was because there was not the necessary Cabinet authority to extend the Bill&#039;s shelf life.
</p>

<a name="40719-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>I do not wish to embarrass the Minister, who has always been helpful, not least today, but it would be appreciated if he could clear up a few queries arising from the Committee stage. The Minister agreed that if we did not have the amendments, there would be a need for primary legislation to set up an Olympic lottery Bill for any subsequent bid. However, he also said that even if we accepted the amendment, there would still be a need for primary legislation because,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;the Bill is so specific to London and the funding arrangements&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6/4/04; col. GC 586.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40719-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>I have studied the Bill carefully and I can see nothing in Part 3 that could not be altered to include another city besides London. The other cities across the UK that are capable of bidding for the games will almost all have a mayor. Likewise, they will need to have a suitable local government structure that is analogous to the Greater London Authority. Similarly, and very importantly, I can see nothing in Part 3 that refers to any specific funding arrangements for the London 2012 bid. There is no reference to the expected &#163;750 million that we anticipate the Bill will provide; there is no reference to the &#163;750 million from the other lottery good causes; and there is no reference to the &#163;625 million from the council tax levy or to the &#163;250 million from the London Development Agency. I could go on.
</p>

<a name="40719-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>It should be clear that all that the Bill does is to permit the setting up of an Olympic lottery with its specific remit to fund the Olympic Games. Of course, all funding arrangements have been carefully worked out. The memorandum of understanding between the Government and the Mayor of London on funding to the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games is very helpful in that respect but it does not appear in the Bill and is not referred to by it.
</p>

<a name="40719-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>Is the Minister able to highlight which clauses of the Bill are so specific that they cannot be altered? Similarly, could he kindly point out the clauses on funding that are specific to the London 2012 bid, which it appears I may have missed? If nothing else, the Minister&#039;s response in Committee made a refreshing change from the exchanges on Parts 1 and 2, when the Government stressed the need to maintain sufficient flexibility in the Bill to handle events beyond the Government&#039;s control. When these Benches sought to extend that flexibility, the Government suddenly appeared to be keen on making sure that the legislation is very specific.

</p>

<a name="40719-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>In light of the Minister&#039;s comments in Committee, I considered altering my original amendments so that they referred only to future London bids. That would have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_66"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 66</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

been easier to draft. I am also very much aware that there is a strong view in the OIC that it would prefer a London bid. However, after much deliberation, I decided to stick with my original wording because it is vitally important that those cities are not excluded from bidding.
</p>

<a name="40719-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, and the Minister were concerned that the amendment might be portrayed as undermining the London 2012 bid. They will be the first to know that I completely reject that suggestion. Anyone who underestimates the commitment of the London bid team and its chairman, my noble friend Lord Coe, does so at his peril. London remains a serious bid and is now putting in place a world-class bid team with world-class plans. In parenthesis, I mention that it saddens me to think that there have been those who apparently do not realise what a great honour it is to be associated with an Olympic bid. Everyone involved with the bid is there to serve the sportsmen and sportswomen of this country, not to serve vanity. At least my noble friend Lord Coe is now putting together such a group, with the welcome appointment of Mr Sloman.
</p>

<a name="40719-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>To conclude, all our amendments are designed to support and strengthen the London 2012 bid. Those amendments in particular will help to ensure that if the unthinkable happens and we get pipped at the post, we are able to learn from the London bid and to try again. I believe that we owe it to future Ministers of Sport to ensure that this legislation is not lost. That is what the amendments are designed to achieve. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="40719-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord has been consistent in his idea that we should have something on the shelf that we could wheel out for more bids. However, one of the most important points about 2012&#151;this does not undermine the noble Lord&#039;s support for it but is merely a difference in approach&#151;is that we have a one-shot deal in this regard. In a few years, we will not be able to advance with this type of Bill. We would probably need new financing arrangements in that case. Over-reliance on the lottery, as is currently the case, would not have been my ideal. However, we have the current show and we must support it&#151;let us go with what we have now. That is the only reason why I am not 100 per cent behind the noble Lord in this regard.
</p>

<a name="40719-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>I feel that we could do better. If we put our heads together we could come up with a more aggressive stance than that in the Bill. However, this Bill is what we have now. Racking up the process for a couple more goes would probably not be as advantageous. The politics behind our being able to win the bid are pretty well known. These amendments contain an approach that I recommend we do not follow. A bespoke Bill, for this occasion or in relation to any future bid in which we believe we stand a realistic chance, is the least that the Olympic bid deserves.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="40719-19_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, if it was thought at any stage that I accused the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, of attempting to weaken the London bid through these amendments, that was a mistake. I certainly did not intend to make that accusation; that is not what he intends to do. I know that he is fully behind the London bid and I applaud him for it. We are at one on that.

<a name="40719-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>This is a series of very modest amendments. They are designed to see if it is possible to have a Bill which could be brought off the shelf again on a future occasion if, as we hope will not happen, the London bid fails. As such, I am very sympathetic to it. I should like to think that it would work, because I should like to think that we could avoid primary legislation. Alas, I have been persuaded by those more expert in these matters than I am that it would not work and therefore, regretfully, I am not able to support it.
</p>

<a name="40719-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>It is an attractive and flexible proposal, but we think that it would be unwise to have the broader powers and such open-ended legislation as proposed by these amendments. We do not think that it would remove the need for more specific legislation, if at a future date there were another UK city bidding for the Olympics.
</p>

<a name="40719-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>The provisions of the Bill are focused on the London Olympics in 2012. They set up a hypothecated lottery stream to fund those Games. As the noble Lord, Lord Addington, said, there are those who wish it was not financed in that way; there are those who think that the balance between lottery and local funding should be different. These are legitimate points of view. The Bill as it stands, however, reflects current lottery funding arrangements and the bespoke funding package that has been put in place by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, together with the London Development Agency and the Greater London Authority, to help fund the 2012 Olympics, and it would not work anywhere else.

</p>

<a name="40719-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>In order to reach this agreement, we had extensive cost-benefit analysis by the consultants, Arup; we had negotiations between the Government and the Mayor; we needed to have Cabinet agreement to back the bid; and a bespoke policy framework for the 2012 Olympics in London. The results are in this Bill. It was undertaken in respect of the London 2012 bid but not with the possibility of it being extended to other cities and to later dates.
</p>

<a name="40719-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>The assessment of the amount of money to be raised from the Olympic lottery by Camelot was based on the current lottery performance. We cannot be sure that that would be true for another city at another date. I know that the figures are not on the face of the Bill, but this is the primary legislation which was necessary to bring into force the deal which has been reached between the London Development Agency, the Mayor, and the Government. All of these things could well be different and could make it necessary to have a quite different pattern of legislation for another city at a future date.
</p>

<a name="40719-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>I am enormously sympathetic to the idea of saving parliamentary time. Nobody is more sympathetic than me. However, valuable time and effort have gone into the preparation and consideration of this Bill. That consideration and effort need not be lost.

For the first time in I do not know how many hours of deliberation on this Bill, I thought that the Government were going to make a concession and accept my amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>I must admit, however, to being unclear why the BOA, and indeed the Greater London Authority, cannot just receive this compensation from the Olympic lottery distributor. If the Minister is able to clarify this point, it would be appreciated.

</p>

<a name="40719-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>The reason for bringing back this amendment is that there have been a number of developments since it was debated in another place. First, UK Sport announced on 13 July that it is providing some &#163;800,000 to the British Olympic Association to help pay for Team GB&#039;s pre-Games preparation camps in Cyprus and Barcelona. That changes the historic independence of the BOA from any source of government or government-influenced funding.
</p>

<a name="40719-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>Secondly, the British Paralympic Association has announced that it needs to find some &#163;200,000 in order to stave off financial problems and impending bankruptcy after the Paralympics in Athens this September.
</p>

<a name="40719-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>I know that this House contains many friends of disability sport in general and the British Paralympic Association in particular. Noble Lords will be aware that our Paralympic athletes were outstandingly successful at the Sydney 2000 Paralympics, landing an impressive medal haul of 41 gold medals, 43 silvers and 47 bronzes. That was enough to secure Britain second place in the overall medal table: a performance only bettered by the host nation, Australia.

<a name="40719-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>While I welcome the Government&#039;s commitment to ensuring that the British Paralympic Association and the British Olympic Association are treated similarly, I am afraid that there is still some way to go. As a nation our sports policy must ensure that we reward winners and this should start as much with the British Olympic Association as with the British Paralympic Association and their athletes to enable them to go one better in the medal table in Athens in September. I beg to move.

<a name="40719-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, this amendment is absolutely right. The British Paralympic Association has added considerable lustre to the British colours for quite a while. Apart from that, if we are serious about equality for the disabled, we must try to start thinking outside the box of, &quot;Let&#039;s help him across the road&quot;. We need full participation in all aspects of life. If that means that an Olympic athlete with a disability is funded differently from one without a disability, I suggest that he or she should receive support on those grounds alone, irrespective of any medal haul. This measure constitutes a sensible step towards that. I appreciate that the Government have not yet got round to dealing with this. I hope that that is the case. If they do not think that this body is big enough, they are wrong. If they do not think that the issue is important enough, they are wrong. I hope that the Minister will give a favourable response or at least tell us why the amendment is not needed. That would be enough. If he cannot do either of those two things, I certainly would support the amendment.

<a name="40719-20_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I endorse everything that both the noble Lords, Lord Moynihan and Lord Addington, have said about the importance of the Paralympic Games. Clearly, not only are they important for this country but they are also important worldwide. They are symbolic of an attitude that ought to apply throughout our lives. I have no doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, through this amendment intends to give equal treatment to the British Paralympic Association and to the British Olympic Association. If I may trespass on the next group of amendments, our willingness to support Amendments Nos. 37 and 39, which the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, has already indicated, shows that we are entirely in agreement with him about that. I am sorry to say that I have a boring technical reason why Amendment No. 29 does not achieve what it sets out to achieve and would introduce unnecessary discrimination.
</p>

<a name="40719-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>There is a specific reason why the British Olympic Association appears in the legislation as a potential recipient of Olympic funds, and why the British Paralympic Association does not.

Olympic Games. Under this arrangement the British Olympic Association must give the London Organising Committee,

<a name="40719-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>Effectively, the British Olympic Association transfers commercial rights, including the ability to market the Olympic emblems, to the London Organising Committee.
</p>

<a name="40719-20_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>That arrangement greatly reduces the British Olympic Association&#039;s ability to generate sponsorship income, which is its main source of funding. The IOC joint marketing programme must include financial provision to the British Olympic Association in consideration for the rights granted to the London Organising Committee.
</p>

<a name="40719-20_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>The British Olympic Association will have a key role to play during this period, both in helping to stage the Games and in supporting Team GB. It will be vital for the British Olympic Association to receive revenues, in spite of its decreased ability to generate income. The inclusion of the British Olympic Association as a possible recipient of Olympic Lottery Distribution Funds was designed in case it was necessary to compensate the British Olympic Association for the transfer of its rights to the London Organising Committee, as required by the IOC, from the Olympic Lottery Distribution Fund. I told noble Lords that this was a boring explanation but I am afraid that it is logical.
</p>

<a name="40719-20_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>It is possible that the funding for the British Olympic Association will come directly from the London Organising Committee marketing and sponsorship programmes. That would mean that the power to transfer funds from the Olympic Lottery Distribution Fund to the British Olympic Association would not be used. However, the power was included in the Bill to ensure that the BOA could receive essential revenue from the Olympic Lottery Fund if necessary.
</p>

<a name="40719-20_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>The British Paralympic Association is in a different position. There is currently no requirement from the International Olympic Committee or the International Paralympic Committee for the British Paralympic Association to surrender its rights. Additionally, the British Paralympic Association does not rely so heavily on marketing and sponsorship income as the British Olympic Association. The BPA receives Exchequer funding for its running costs, unlike the BOA.
</p>

<a name="40719-20_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The possible requirement to compensate the BOA for loss of income is the only reason why the BOA appears as a possible recipient of Olympic Lottery Distribution Fund payments. There is no need for a similar arrangement for the British Paralympic Association. However, I shall support Amendments Nos. 37 and 39.

However, I am not persuaded by the Minister&#039;s argument about the wider benefits of the British Paralympic Association being excluded. There is real merit in including the British Paralympic Association within the overall list, which goes much wider than the British Olympic Association. As I mentioned, it covers the Greater London Authority and the National Lottery distributor. Even the Secretary of State can receive money directly from the Olympic Lottery Distribution Fund.

(iv)   the British Paralympic Association&quot;


<p><a name="st_138"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am pleased to introduce these amendments, which include the British Paralympic Association in the list of consultees on the Olympic lottery strategy. I hope that they will meet with approval from both the Government and the House. A similar amendment was debated in Committee and it was encouraging to learn from the Minister that the Government were minded to look favourably on the principle contained in the amendment, provided that some changes were made.
</p>

<a name="40719-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>I am also grateful for the support of the Liberal Democrats, including that of the noble Lord, Lord Addington, in Committee. Subsequently, the Minister wrote to me on 12 July and indicated the Government&#039;s support for the amendment, for which I am grateful. I have always believed that many sporting issues cut across party lines in the House, and in many cases those lines are erased altogether.
</p>

<a name="40719-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>All sections of the House have worked together in the past to bring about improvements to legislation to the overall benefit of sport. This amendment is one of those areas where there should be no difference between the political parties. There is a great deal of support for the excellent work of the British Paralympic Association, and there is a general feeling that the Bill could and should do more to recognise that work. That is the underlying rationale for the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_73"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 73</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendment. It is designed to ensure that when the new Olympic lottery distributor prepares or revises its distribution policy, it will have a statutory requirement to consult with the British Paralympic Association.

</p>

<a name="40719-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>As the Bill is presently worded, when the Olympic lottery distributor draws up its distribution policy it is under a statutory requirement under Clause 31(4)(b) to consult with the National Lottery Commission, the Mayor of London and the British Olympic Association. It is eminently sensible that the key stakeholders in the London 2012 bid are consulted. They are well placed to help to set the main parameters for the spending of the &#163;750 million of lottery funding for the bid.
</p>

<a name="40719-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>Yet the original Bill made no reference to the British Paralympic Association. Were anyone tempted to ask why it is so important for the British Paralympic Association to be included in the list of statutory consultees for the Olympic lottery distributor, the answer is simple. It is because the British Paralympic Association can bring uniquely valuable experience and expertise to the distribution policy, and can help to ensure that the Olympic lottery distributor takes proper account of the Paralympic Games.

</p>

<a name="40719-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>One of the more satisfying aspects of my time in another place as Minister for Sport was the opportunity to help oversee the setting up and funding of the first million pounds to go to the British Paralympic Association, in 1989. Since that time, the role and reputation of the British Paralympic Association has grown immensely. It sends teams to every Paralympic Games, and supports the development of elite athletes. In so doing, the BPA has developed a body of expertise in high performance disability sports which is second to none.
</p>

<a name="40719-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>The Paralympic Games have their own special organisational requirements. To give the House an idea of the scale of the task ahead, it is helpful to look back on the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. A record 122 countries participated at those games, the largest games in paralympic history. During the games, the paralympic village was home to 6,943 people, of whom 3,284 were athletes, 2,315 were team officials and 804 were technical officials.
</p>

<a name="40719-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>Clearly, there were a number of specific issues concerning the staging of the Paralympic Games and it is important that the Olympic lottery distributor has access to the best advice available. The British Paralympic Association is in a position to supply that advice, and it is more than happy to do so. It is essential that the Bill is amended to take maximum advantage of the skills in the BPA and to ensure that the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games are a huge success.
</p>

<a name="40719-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>The amendment will help to ensure that the London 2012 games are fully inclusive and that that inclusiveness starts right at the very top, with the lottery distribution policy, and then permeates down to every level of the games. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_144"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I must apologise for having a manuscript amendment&#151;it appears that my original drafting was slightly outside the scope of the Bill. This is a fairly simple point. This is a narrow Bill, which deals with the 2012 Olympic bid for London. The amendment is an attempt to guarantee that if something goes wrong within the scope of the Bill, a report can be produced or any reports can be brought together so that we know what happened and what went wrong for all future events. The primary reason for the amendment is that the lessons learned will not only apply to any future Olympic bid but to any major event we care to take part in, such as the cities of culture competition or other games or championships.

<a name="40719-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>It was suggested in Committee that this information is generally available if one knows where to look.

and should be of benefit to sport in the United Kingdom. It is hard to believe it, but now is the first time that London has bid for the Olympic Games since it last hosted them in 1948. If the unthinkable happens and London is not chosen to host the 2012 Olympic Games, there should be an inquiry into how we could have done better.

<a name="40719-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I am sorry; it must have been one of those things. I am afraid that my answer is very similar to what it was on the comparable amendment. The amendment would make the creation of two reports&#151;one to be commissioned when the IOC decides who will host the games in 2012, and a further on completion of a London games&#151;a statutory requirement. Certainly there must be due process to capture and make the most of all the available information in relation to staging the Games, but I do not believe that the amendment is the best way to achieve that.
</p>

<a name="40719-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>As we said in Committee, there are already a number of arrangements in place to capture key information, and hold accountable those bodies charged with delivering the Games and ensuring an appropriate sporting legacy from them. In terms of parliamentary scrutiny, there are appropriate measures through existing parliamentary powers, and I am confident that those would be exercised. The Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport has already demonstrated a close interest in the London Olympic bid. We have welcomed that and contributed to it. I am sure that the committee will continue to do so, and the Public Accounts Committee will play an appropriate role. My department already works closely with other key stakeholders in the bid, including the sports lottery bodies and the devolved administrations, to consider how best to capture the benefits of the Games, whatever the outcome, so that knowledge can be transferred and used for future bids.
</p>

<a name="40719-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>As for the report on the completion of the Games, the host-city contract that will be entered into with the International Olympic Committee requires that within three months of the conclusion of the Games, the organising committee for the Olympic Games&#151;it has the horrible acronym of OCOG&#151;submits to the IOC a report on all aspects of the organisation of the Games, including an analysis of performance. A report has been produced for each Olympic Games since Athens in 1896. I cannot see how commissioning a further report with the same purpose will enhance the legislation, nor can I see a good reason for such a provision to appear in the Bill.

If there is some way to achieve that, it would help dramatically in the whole process through which we are going.

<a name="40719-22_para4"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>As we know, so many of the Government&#039;s intentions for the Tote are to be taken on trust. Although I recognise that there has been some movement during the passage of the Bill, the Government still refuse to specify the Racing Trust in the Bill. Noble Lords will also be aware that the price charged for the Tote is of vital importance to the Racing Trust. That is because the trust will need to borrow the money to pay the Government, and so is limited by the cost of interest payments on the debt. In other words, the promise to sell to the Racing Trust is worthless unless the price is one that the trust can afford.
</p>

<a name="40719-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>I shall not develop the full detail of the argument during my short speech. I want to underline that the amendment is designed to do the next best thing to delaying Third Reading until a satisfactory sale of the Tote to a racing trust is achieved. It does so by allowing the Government a free hand to negotiate or complete the sale of the Tote, with the proviso that the final agreement is then subject to parliamentary approval. If Parliament does not agree with the Government&#039;s intentions, the whole of Part 1 will fall and the Tote will remain as it is currently constituted.
</p>

<a name="40719-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>The amendment overcomes all the concerns that the Minister put before the House earlier. It overcomes the concerns about finalising the negotiations and waiting until the European Commission has come up with its ruling&#151;if any. It overcomes all the concerns shared by many people, both inside this House and outside, that there is a possibility, if Part 1 is passed unamended, that the Government could simply nationalise the Tote and sell it to whomever they like, whenever, at whatever price and under whatever circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40719-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>The Minister and the Minister for Sport have been eloquent in arguing that selling the Tote to a racing trust is sacrosanct&#151;that it is a manifesto commitment and a policy that the Government will see through. The amendment allows them to go ahead and deliver, with Parliament having the final say. I am sure that that final say would take only minutes, if that, when it was finally requested, but at least it would be a backstop. It would enable myself or someone in my position in future to praise the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, as chairman of the Racing Trust, for their work in achieving the goal that they set out before Parliament.
</p>

<a name="40719-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>The amendment has the benefit of allowing flexibility for the Government and the House. I humbly suggest that it offers more flexibility than the Government&#039;s own amendment. It has also the not inconsiderable advantage that, rather than relying on the Secretary of State&#039;s opinions about whether someone is a person,

</p>

<a name="40719-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>As I mentioned at the start of this speech, the principle behind the amendment has already been well debated. I am conscious that it would be unwise to move to a Division at this stage, because it is absolutely the type of amendment that we would need to consider when we return in September on the first day after the Recess to assess the effectiveness or otherwise of the Government&#039;s commitment to negotiate a successful sale with the Racing Trust.
</p>

<a name="40719-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>Every day between now and mid-September, therefore, is focused towards that goal and the amendment could be returned to if the undertakings that the Minister has given the House today are not achieved. For those reasons the principle behind the amendment is important and becomes even more important as a result of today&#039;s proceedings. I beg to move.

<a name="40719-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lipsey: </b>   My Lords, I greatly welcome the decision of the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, not to press the amendment to a vote this afternoon. I have been reflecting, while your Lordships have been debating the Olympic lottery, which is not a subject upon which I could contribute, that we have seen two important developments today.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>First, the Minister has said what the Government can and cannot do under the conventions in terms of negotiating a deal and he has promised to write to noble Lords with his view. That letter will be of great importance to all of us in assessing what we should do when we return to the Bill. We need to assess that letter before we decide on fundamental steps.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>Secondly, the Minister said that he would have no objection if the date of 7 September goes&#151;I paraphrase him although it is perhaps not entirely accurate. I can see wisdom in shifting that date back&#151;perhaps not too far, but to give us a little time to take stock at the beginning of September when we are all assembled. In those circumstances the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, would be doing the right thing in coming finally to the right decision and withdrawing the amendment.

which were of value in protecting the Tote, I had drafted a two and three-quarter hour speech on the amendment. But I suspect that at this time of night that might not be wholly welcome to the House.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>I should say that, given that the breach of the condition set out in the schedule constitutes a criminal offence, only material failures should constitute such an offence. If a totalisator is not working one morning because someone has put glue in it or it is not operated properly, that would constitute an immaterial factor and it would not be fair for anyone to go to gaol as a result. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, which is minor and technical but will provide some comfort to the wives and husbands of Tote employees who will find that their spouse is not likely to be locked up as a result of this drafting. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="40719-23_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Moynihan: </b>   My Lords, given that I am not surrounded by my Whips at this stage of our proceedings, I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, is not planning to push the amendment to a vote. However, I am delighted to support the amendment which is similar to Amendments Nos. 10 and 12 which we debated earlier and bears more than a passing resemblance to an amendment in my name that we considered in Grand Committee.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>I hope and trust that in being brief the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, has more success convincing the Minister with his compelling arguments than I had in Grand Committee.
</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="40719-23_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, no such luck. I am afraid that the words, &quot;in all material respects&quot; do not add anything at all to the meaning of the schedule. Parliamentary counsel are deeply reluctant to add words that do not have any meaning and I have some sympathy with that. However, I think that what the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, is looking for is an assurance that the wives and children of unfortunate operators of totalisators will not find themselves in prison as a result of a minor infringement which could hardly be called their fault. A minor technical glitch will happen from time to time and the Gaming Board will have to decide whether a pool betting operator has failed to comply with the requirements set out in paragraph 4 of Schedule 1A. I believe that the Gaming Board will not behave unreasonably. It will be required by administrative law not to behave unreasonably and it would not be constrained by the phrase &quot;in all material respects&quot;.

<a name="time_22"></a>
<a name="40719-23_time1"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="40719-23_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>Before I speak to the Bill, I offer an apology to the House for causing the adjournment 10 minutes ago. I have found that it is impossible to be in two places at once. At the time, I was in the Grand Committee.

</p>

<a name="40719-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to bring this Bill to your Lordships&#039; House. It is a very short Bill, with one substantive clause. That clause does two very simple things to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967. First, in subsection (2) the Bill extends the circumstances in which the Parliamentary Commissioner, who is better known as the Ombudsman, will investigate a complaint; and, secondly, in subsection (3), it adds the Government Actuary&#039;s Department to the list of bodies that are within the Parliamentary Commissioner&#039;s remit as set out in Schedule 2 of the 1967 Act.

</p>

<a name="40719-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>Before explaining those two subsections, it might be of assistance to the House if I paint a little of the background that has led me to introduce the Bill for consideration. The Parliamentary Commissioner has an important role in carrying out independent investigations into the administrative actions of government departments and other public bodies. The Parliamentary Commissioner is an important part of the framework of checks and balances in our constitution and is held in very high regard. My Bill extends the scope of the Parliamentary Commissioner&#039;s work.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>The real background to my Bill is the sorry story of Equitable Life Assurance Society, which was closed to new business in December 2000. I am extremely pleased to be able to report to the House that I have absolutely no interests to declare in this regard as neither I nor any of my family invested a penny piece in Equitable. But I feel sure that many noble Lords join me in having at least second-hand experience of the sense of outrage felt by those whose financial security was removed or severely dented by Equitable.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>I shall not delve into the fall of Equitable itself. Earlier this year, we had the very extensive study into Equitable by the learned Lord Penrose, and we have had the opportunity to debate that. The driving force behind my Bill is the role of government departments in the financial misery meted out to Equitable policy holders. The Penrose report highlighted the management and governance failures that beset the conduct of the company&#039;s affairs. But the report also singled out the role <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_81"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 81</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of other agencies involved, notably the Financial Services Agency, the Treasury and the Government Actuary&#039;s Department.

</p>

<a name="40719-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>The Penrose report did not, of course, opine on maladministration as such, but it offered much evidence to contribute to a judgment about the relevant administrative actions&#151;that is, it is very relevant to a consideration by the Parliamentary Commissioner.

</p>

<a name="40719-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>As would be expected, the Parliamentary Commissioner received many complaints from aggrieved policy holders. Having resisted initially, the Parliamentary Commissioner eventually decided in October 2001 to examine one representative complaint. That investigation was to cover only the work of the FSA and only for a period of a little less than two years from 1 January 1999.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>In November 2002, a new Parliamentary Commissioner was appointed and she confirmed that the investigation would not cover a longer period. She repeated that conclusion in June 2003, when her report on the representative complaint was eventually made to Parliament. She also stated that she had no legal power to examine the Government Actuary&#039;s Department as it was not listed in the 1967 Act.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>It was not surprising that those Equitable policy holders who lost so much financially could not comprehend the Parliamentary Commissioner&#039;s decision, and could not understand why she would not look at the whole sorry history of Equitable, as the learned Lord Penrose did. They also did not understand why the Parliamentary Commissioner would not look at the Government Actuary&#039;s Department along with the DTI and the Treasury before 1999. Honourable and right honourable Members of another place could not understand it either, which is why there was much pressure for the Parliamentary Commissioner to think again.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>In April this year, the Parliamentary Commissioner said that she would look again at whether she should re-investigate matters related to Equitable Life. A few hours ago she announced her decision, which is that she will re-open the case and investigate the period before 1999. That is a welcome decision for all those who have suffered because of Equitable. But the bad news is that she confirmed that she had no power to examine the Government Actuary&#039;s Department, although she has asked the Treasury to extend her powers in that regard.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>I now turn to the specifics of the Bill. Under the 1967 Act, the Parliamentary Commissioner may conduct an investigation outside the normal time limit for complaints if he considers that there are special circumstances that make it proper to do so. The Bill that I present to the House goes one step further and says that the Parliamentary Commissioner shall conduct an investigation if the House of Commons so resolves.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>The Parliamentary Commissioner reports to the House of Commons and receives complaints via MPs, so it seems right that the other place should be able to direct that the Parliamentary Commissioner carries out an investigation, even if it is outside the normal <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_82"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 82</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

timeframe. That deals with a general frustration that has been felt that the other place ought to have a little more say in what cases the Parliamentary Commissioner should investigate. It is a modest extension of the powers of the other place.
</p>

<a name="40719-23_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>Subsection (2) brings the Government Actuary&#039;s Department within the scope of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 by adding it to Schedule 2. The Penrose report describes the Government Actuary&#039;s Department as &quot;persistently naive&quot; and &quot;complacent&quot;. In her report today the Parliamentary Commissioner says at paragraph 33:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;I consider there is sufficient initial evidence to suggest that the actions of GAD are key to an assessment of whether maladministration by the prudential regulator constituted an unremediated injustice to complainants&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40719-23_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>As I said earlier, the Parliamentary Commissioner has asked the Treasury for her jurisdiction to be extended to cover the Government Actuary&#039;s Department. My Bill is directly in point. I am delighted that the Minister is here this evening to respond to the Bill. I hope that he will say that the Government support my Bill. If the Minister cannot say that, I hope that he will at least indicate how the Government intend to respond to the Parliamentary Commissioner&#039;s request. I commend the Bill to the House.

<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="40719-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, on bringing forward the Bill today. Whether she is unusually prescient or whether she has precipitated the ombudsman to bring forward her report, I am not sure. The timing is absolutely perfect.
</p>

<a name="40719-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>We, on these Benches, have supported the ombudsman route as the most likely way, post Penrose, of achieving progress on Equitable Life. Therefore, we are extremely pleased that the ombudsman has decided, in principle, that she would like to investigate Equitable. However, the question is whether the Government will allow her to do so by extending the scope of the Act that we are discussing tonight to bring the Government Actuary&#039;s Department within it. A failure by the Government to agree fairly rapidly to do that would suggest that they are obstructing a possible definitive ruling on at least one aspect of the Equitable Life debacle. Therefore, I hope very much that they accede to the ombudsman&#039;s request.
</p>

<a name="40719-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>Given that we have a Bill before us which does that&#151;here is one that the noble Baroness prepared earlier&#151;it would seem that the sensible way forward from the Government&#039;s point of view is just to agree to it and be done with it, save the time and let the ombudsman get cracking. One of the main problems with this whole sorry story is the amount of time that has passed since the problems arose and even the possibility of any redress.

The legislation required is short and sweet. There can be no &quot;in principle&quot; argument against introducing it. So I am afraid that it is over to you, Minister.

<a name="40719-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness on her prescience in bringing this Bill before your Lordships&#039; House and on pursuing this matter with her usual vigour.
</p>

<a name="40719-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>As the noble Baroness said, the parliamentary ombudsman has this afternoon announced that she will conduct a further investigation into the prudential regulation of the Equitable Life Assurance Society&#151;Equitable Life.
</p>

<a name="40719-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>I know that the House is aware of the background. The ombudsman agreed to give further consideration to the position following the publication of the Penrose report and the Government&#039;s response to that report. In the special report laid before Parliament today, the ombudsman makes clear the reasons for her decision. Her decision was reached following an extensive consultation exercise. In her report, she states that she,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;received approximately 2,000 responses, including 211 from Members of Parliament, 1,603 from policyholders or former policyholders, three from policyholder action groups, and responses from Equitable Life, the Treasury, the Financial Services Authority, the Government Actuary&#039;s Department and the Department of Trade and Industry&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>So I think we need be under no illusion that there is considerable concern about the whole issue&#151;a very sorry saga, as the noble Baroness described it.

</p>

<a name="40719-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>As part of the consultation exercise, the ombudsman also invited a number of interested parties to meet her, and the details are set out in the report.
</p>

<a name="40719-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>The ombudsman states in her report that the new investigation will focus on the actions of the government departments responsible under the relevant legislation for the prudential regulation of Equitable Life. She makes clear that her investigation will, subject to the approval of a request she has made of the Government, also include the actions of the Government Actuary&#039;s Department.
</p>

<a name="40719-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>This afternoon the Government received a formal request from the ombudsman to make the necessary arrangements to include the Government Actuary&#039;s Department within her jurisdiction. We have only just received this request and we will give it urgent consideration, not least because of the time that has elapsed since the onset of problems with this particular issue relating to Equitable Life. We will reply to the ombudsman as soon as we possibly can.
</p>

<a name="40719-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>I have been invited to make some observations on the noble Baroness&#039;s Bill. I shall keep these brief. First, if the Government agree to the request to include the Government Actuary&#039;s Department within the ombudsman&#039;s jurisdiction, Section 4(3) of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_84"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column 84</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 provides that public bodies which meet certain criteria can be added to her jurisdiction by Order in Council. Bodies not meeting those criteria could only be added by primary legislation.
</p>

<a name="40719-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>Therefore, if the Government agree to the ombudsman&#039;s request to include the Government Actuary&#039;s Department within her jurisdiction, they could be expected to do this by Order in Council rather than primary legislation. The Government are therefore not convinced of the need for this part of the Bill.

</p>

<a name="40719-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>Secondly, in addition to including the Government Actuary&#039;s Department within the ombudsman&#039;s jurisdiction, the noble Baroness&#039;s Bill also proposes amending Section 6(3) of the 1967 Act. That section of the Act provides that, where there are special circumstances which make it proper to do so, the ombudsman may consider complaints more than 12 months old.
</p>

<a name="40719-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Baroness would add a new paragraph, which would provide that the commissioner,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;(b) shall conduct an investigation pursuant to a complaint not made within that period if the House of Commons so resolves&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>At present, the ombudsman decides what cases to investigate. To give the other place the power to tell the ombudsman that she must investigate would, I believe, have implications for the operation of the office of ombudsman. I also think it unlikely that the ombudsman herself would support a Bill that sought to fetter her decision-making powers.
</p>

<a name="40719-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>I make these observations on the noble Baroness&#039;s Bill, not in the spirit of great hostility because I recognise the spirit in which the Bill has been constructed. I am prepared to give an undertaking, which is a quite easy one to give, that we will reply to the ombudsman on the issue of including the Government Actuary&#039;s Department within her jurisdiction as soon as possible because we recognise the urgency of the issue.

<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>The ombudsman&#039;s report is most helpful. We will make a rapid response. While we are not hostile to the Bill, it is deficient in the ways we have described. So, it is not for us obviously to deal with that matter today. Much as we welcome the opportunity to make our views known with regard to the usefulness of the ombudsman&#039;s report, it is probably best if we leave it there.

<a name="40719-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>The Minister used the sorts of formulations that we often hear from the Government Front Bench&#151;that the matter will be given urgent consideration and that a reply will be made as soon as possible.

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Clause 107 [<i>Investment of funds</i>]:
</p>

<a name="40719-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 107 shall stand part of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40719-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   On the last occasion, the Question was put whether Clause 107 shall stand part of the Bill and I responded by saying that this was obviously an important clause. Our proceedings were then cut short by a Division in the House.

</p>

<a name="40719-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>During the weekend, I contemplated the progress we had made on the Bill. We have spent a considerable time debating the membership of the regulator and the board of the pension protection fund. In the light of our earlier discussions, I though I might make a constructive suggestion; namely, that Members of this Grand Committee shall forthwith be appointed to the board of the pension protection fund. We have every possible expertise. We have my noble friend Lord Hunt on insolvency; my noble friend Lady Noakes on accountancy; the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, on fund management; and the noble Lord, Lord Lea, on trade union representation. I was not going to leave out the noble Baroness&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40719-25_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </b>  I thought that first we should all take the trustees examination that Peter Lilley has taken. That would be an essential requirement and I am beginning to think that at the end of this procedure we might all have a fair crack at it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40719-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   Some of us are puzzled by why noble Lords opposite were so concerned about knowing the composition of the remuneration committee.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40719-25_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   We have even more expertise, such as my noble friend Lord Borrie. We could negotiate the remuneration on a reasonable basis, including a pension arrangement.
</p>

<a name="40719-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>Be that as it may, Clause 107 is indeed important, concerned with the investment of funds of the pension protection fund. References have been made to a number of reports by outside individuals appointed by the Government to look into various aspects of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC2"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

corporate governance. In this context, a report by Mr Myners dealt with the way in which pension funds might operate in investing. On the last occasion, I reflected that whenever such an individual was appointed to this sort of job, his own business tends to deteriorate. I am not sure where that will leave Marks & Spencer at the present time. However, the Myners&#039; report makes a number of valuable remarks which are relevant to Clause 107.
</p>

<a name="40719-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>We need to consider carefully, in the context of the pension protection fund, exactly how the money it acquires by taking over eligible funds is to be invested, and in particular the principles involved when it operates in that way. The clause begins by stating:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;The Board may invest for the purposes of the prudent management of its financial affairs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>No one could object to that in one sense, except that what &quot;prudent management&quot; means is not made clear. We should note that this will comprise a massive conglomerate of pension funds&#151;if, tragically, a number of funds and companies with funds do fail&#151;which the PPF will need to manage. In essence it will operate as a pension fund, but of a rather strange kind because, as we discussed during our deliberations on earlier clauses, all these funds are effectively for deferred pensioners. Therefore the investment funds may be somewhat different from that which would apply to an ordinary final salary pension fund.
</p>

<a name="40719-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>The crucial question arose when the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, was kind enough to arrange a meeting ahead of our discussion of this Bill, concerning asset allocation. We asked in what way the pension protection fund ought to allocate its assets. If one were to interpret,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;the prudent management of its financial affairs&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>very precisely, I suppose it could be said that the sensible thing to do would be to put the whole lot in gilts. I am not sure whether that is what the Government have in mind, but it would certainly tend to relieve pressure on the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his effort to finance his very considerable borrowing requirements.
</p>

<a name="40719-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>However, if that is the case, as is likely, the costs of the levy will be greater than need be. Even though, as I understand, all the pensioners will, in effect, be deferred pensioners, there would be none the less a case for a mix of assets between gilts on the one hand and investment in equities, hedge funds or similar on the other rather than all of them in gilts. That would minimise the long-term cost of the operation to those paying the levy. We need to be clear about exactly what the Government have in mind when they state in the Bill that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;The Board may invest for the purposes of the prudent management of its financial affairs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>The clause goes on to state that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;there should be at least two fund managers&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>which is also certainly my view because that is sensible. However, other Members of the Committee have greater experience of that side of things. I refer also to the various recommendations made in the Myners report that the trustees should be paid. Perhaps I have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC3"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not studied the Bill adequately, but I am not yet clear whether the pension protection fund will have trustees as such or whether it will comprise a board. If it is not to have trustees, I do not understand the argument against it. There would seem to be a case for a board.
</p>

<a name="40719-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>Myners goes on to ask particular funds&#151;I think this would apply to normal funds as well as to the pension protection fund&#151;about their attitude to risk, which is important. In order to minimise the burden on those paying the levy, will the PPF take some degree of risk in terms of the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;prudent management of its financial affairs&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>As regards the appointment of fund managers, are we to understand that there will be straightforward, open competition? I hope that there will be. But will we have rules laid down, which at the moment I cannot find in the Bill, about commission and transaction costs and whether or not they should&#151;which I think not&#151;engage in operations with soft options and so forth? Those are matters that I think, at this stage, it would be appropriate for us to have an idea about exactly how the Government think operations should be conducted under this clause.
</p>

<a name="40719-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Rather more fundamentally, will there be investments in active funds or in passive funds, and so forth? They will all be of very great importance to the success and ultimate cost of the operation. Given that the cost of the operation is a deterrent to people continuing to operate final salary schemes and to bear the cost of the levy, this is a matter about which we ought to be concerned. I shall not burden the Committee more, but this clause raises a number of very important issues. We shall come to some of the others at Clause 108. It would be helpful to have the Government&#039;s views. There is great expertise in the Committee and some Members may have views on how we should operate this fund.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40719-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I, too, wish to press the Minister on some of those questions. The key point that should be stated in the Bill, about which we must be clear, is the broad parameter of the investment policy that the PPF should pursue. What is the benchmark? How will we know whether the board has done a good or a bad job?
</p>

<a name="40719-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>Some of the more detailed points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, such as investment tactics, commission or costs, are not matters for the face of the Bill, but it is obviously perfectly proper to raise them now. No doubt, the Minister will answer us on those.
</p>

<a name="40719-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>The basic investment policy&#151;the strategy&#151;cannot be divorced from the nature of the risks that the fund faces. As a little taster for the debate that we will have later about the circumstances, if any, under which the Government should stand behind the fund as a lender of last resort, if the Government hold to their view that they cannot stand behind the fund under any circumstances, that will inevitably mean that the PPF will have to pursue a much more risk-averse policy. Indeed, it is questionable whether it would be prudent to have equities in any proportion at all which, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC4"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

inevitably, will lead to a greater cost in the long run. I make that point of principle that will, in turn, affect investment strategy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40719-25_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   I hope that the Minister has a number of answers to the points about the way in which the provision of funds will be implemented. I am sure that the Government have given considerable thought to this and that the Minister will respond in a way that none of the rest of us can.
</p>

<a name="40719-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Perhaps I may comment on one or two points, especially those mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. I have not read the Bill as though there will be any trustees. I have read these provisions as though there is the board, as mentioned in the previous clause. Although Clause 107 states that the board &quot;may invest&quot;, it makes it clear that the board will appoint two fund managers, which received congratulatory comment from the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.
</p>

<a name="40719-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Clause 107(1) includes the phrase &quot;prudent management&quot;. I should be surprised if that meant always and forever investing in gilts because I would not have thought that was, at all times, the prudent thing to do in order to invest money and safeguard its value. It all depends on what is going on out there in the world, and the managers will determine that and determine the right balance.
<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="40719-25_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40719-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Indeed, I should also have thought that the managers will keep a balance between investment, which we are discussing specifically under this clause, and the other matter of levy. In so far as managers are successful in investing, the levy will be that much less burdensome&#151;and the opposite is true as well. Perhaps the Minister can put the matter more clearly than I can.
</p>

<a name="40719-25_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Finally, I am sometimes critical of Her Majesty&#039;s Opposition, or for that matter the Liberal Democrat opposition. I mention the two separately because the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, criticised me last week for not making the proper distinction between the two groups that sit opposite me. I have sometimes criticised the Opposition for wanting to put in the Bill more than seems appropriate&#151;usually when they want to state the obvious. But in this instance, I must say to the Minister that subsection (4) is stating the obvious, as it says that in appointing a fund manager, the board must chose someone with the &quot;appropriate knowledge and experience&quot;. That is so obvious that it does not need saying. I do not mind that it is there, but if the Opposition had proposed it, I must admit that I would question whether we needed those additional words.

<a name="40719-26_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I start by wishing the Minister the very best of fortune. The last sitting week in July is always trying, and even the best of Ministers must have some collywobbles. I hope that we can keep her mind off it, at least for this afternoon.

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC5</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40719-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>I find this a very exciting part of the Bill. We are seeing here the birth of a creature that may be the forerunner of solutions to two substantial problems, one of which is the annuity difficulty and one of which relates to stakeholder pensions. This sort of vehicle is in effect a public/private pension fund, which is to be run as a public body but will be just like being in a private pension fund in terms of the structure operation and the management of investment. It may be something which, if it can be made to work, we can extend to people who do not wish to turn their pensions into annuities at an early stage, and which would certainly offer, because of the scale of its operations, the opportunity for a low-cost, high-quality pension for people investing small amounts&#151;in other words, a stakeholder pension fund. Here we have a structure because we need it.
</p>

<a name="40719-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>If we can make it work, and if we think carefully about it, try to avoid the pitfalls and think around all the characteristics and make it something that will function, we may have something that will be extremely valuable. It is worth spending time on this matter; it is the birth of an idea, and one of the key parts of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40719-26_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   I do not see the need to amend or reframe Clause 107, which seems entirely adequate. I regard this as an insurance scheme. It is a very good idea to protect the interests of people in schemes, and I hope that it is successful. I see no need at all to alter either Clause 107 or Clause 108, since the investment principle is spelt out in the next clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40719-26_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   My noble friend Lady Turner made tellingly the substance of the point that I was going to make.
</p>

<a name="40719-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>I would be reluctant to describe the fund as a pension scheme, although it has some of those features, or even as an insurance scheme, as my noble friend did. It is a compensation scheme, but it obviously has features of both pensions and insurance in it.
</p>

<a name="40719-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>As for its structure, my noble friend Lord Borrie was right in his response to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. We are talking about a board, rather than trustees. The sort of responsibility that we would expect when advertising for non-executive directors under the Nolan principle is for a commitment to around 20 days a year for a fee of about &#163;15,000. I have no idea whether that will hold over time, but it is our current expectation.
</p>

<a name="40719-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that we are getting to a particularly interesting part of the Bill: trying to find a way through the moral hazard issues of backstopping what has hitherto been a private contract, and doing so in a public law way without recourse to public funds. Clause 107 allows the board to invest for the prudent management of its financial affairs. It is common for NDPBs to be allowed to invest funds&#151;there is a precedent with the Pensions Compensation Board (PCB). Under Section 85 of the Pensions Act 1995, the PCB is currently permitted to invest any funds which it considers to be surplus to its immediate requirements.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC6"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40719-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>The principle of allowing an NDPB to invest is to ensure value for money; in other words, investment by the board may increase the assets in the pension protection fund and therefore over time reduce the amount required to be raised by the pension protection levies. It will be very hard to achieve averages. A small number of schemes might join in one period or possibly a large number of quite small schemes will join in another, but there might suddenly be a major collapse. Resources will be needed to even out that very uneven profile, particularly if a certain sector of the economy is hit. Of the 10 major American companies that joined the scheme, five were steel, four were airlines and the last was Polaroid&#151;I think that that is the right way around. A particular sector was hit, which produced a very jagged profile of liabilities.
</p>

<a name="40719-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>We have been keen to stress that the PPF will operate at arm&#039;s length from government&#151;investment is one example where that principle is seen in practice. This means that the board along with its advisers will be required to be responsible for its own financial management, including its investment strategy. It would not be sensible to require the board to be accountable for its financial management if we restricted its investment powers unduly. If we prescribed how the board should invest, it would put pressure on future governments to step in if investment returns went down. However, the power to invest is subject to some reasonable restrictions&#151;under subsection (2) of this clause, the board must appoint at least two fund managers. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that appointment will be by straightforward, open competition, to use his phrase. Before doing so, however, the board must be satisfied that the individuals or firms have the appropriate knowledge and experience.
</p>

<a name="40719-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>We will discuss accountability later, but it may be worth highlighting a few key aspects. First, the board must ensure that a written statement of the principles governing decisions about investments is prepared and reviewed regularly&#151;my noble friend Lady Turner was absolutely right in this regard. We expect the principles to cover such aspects as choosing investments; the kind of investments to be held; the balance between the different types of investment&#151;the very point that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, made&#151;risk; projected returns on investment; and social, environmental or ethical considerations in the selection, retention and realisation of investments.
</p>

<a name="40719-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>I would be happy to circulate to Members of the Committee three examples of statements of investment principle, because I myself was interested in how they were done. Clause 108 deals with the issue more fully. One example held to be a model of good practice is the university superannuation scheme. Its statement of investment principles lays down clearly what proportion of its investments and assets it expects to be held in UK equities, overseas equities, fixed interest and property, and what proportion of divergence there is on either side. Members opposite may well be entirely familiar with this. The three examples are the BP pension fund, a local government fund and a university superannuation scheme, which are all very <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC7"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC7</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

similar. If they are models of best practice, I would be surprised if ours diverged greatly from them. If it would help noble Lords, I would be happy to circulate the examples so that they can see what they might look like. This approach is more appropriate than including such a provision in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40719-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Secondly, the PPF will be required to produce annual reports, together with audited accounts. Furthermore, the non-executive committee of the PPF board will monitor performance, strategy and risk management and the organisation will have key targets and performance indicators.
</p>

<a name="40719-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Given all that, we obviously cannot define the word &quot;prudent&quot; in the abstract or lay down precisely what should be gilts, hedge funds, equities, derivatives or whatever, but the combination of the accountability of the PPF board through its annual report, through the Secretary of State and to Parliament, together with the statement of investment principles and the open competition for fund managers, should address any concerns that the Committee may have about the nature and structure of the financial investment policies of the board. With that, I hope that the Committee will accept that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40719-26_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the position, specifically the fact that there will be no trustees, it will be the board. These are important issues. It is difficult to know to what extent one should write matters into the Bill&#151;that may be more difficult for Clause 108 than for Clause 107. I am inclined to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that the way in which the provisions for appointing appropriate managers, and so on, are spelt out in Clause 107 is perhaps a little over the top.
</p>

<a name="40719-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>On other matters, I shall need to consider what the noble Baroness said&#151;in particular, whether there will be an opportunity for a parliamentary debate on the report. However, again, we shall come to that in later clauses, so I shall not pursue the matter further at this stage.
</p>

</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40719-26_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham </b>   moved Amendment No. 187:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>Page 75, line 26, leave out &quot;made by the Board about investments&quot; and insert &quot;about investments made by or on behalf of the Board&quot;</p>

</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>The noble Baroness said: I hope to be brief on this. This government amendment relates to Clause 108&#151;the statement of investment principles&#151;and provides that the board&#039;s statement must govern decisions made not only by the board but by those making decisions on behalf of the board. In other words, it is effectively a drafting amendment that covers the major point. Those making decisions on behalf of the board will primarily be the fund managers.
</p>

<a name="40719-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>It is envisaged that the board must set out in its statement of investment those principles that govern decisions made by the board or by the fund managers <br>&nbsp;<br>

on behalf of the board in relation to the sort of issues that I mentioned earlier&#151;investments, the balance of risk, projected returns and whatever environmental, social or other considerations may be appropriate. Without the amendment, the fund managers could legitimately act in a manner contrary to the statement of investment principles. I am sure that they would not want to if they sought to have their contracts renewed, but they could. Hence, I hope that the Committee will accept that this amendment is useful and necessary. I beg to move.

<a name="40719-27_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   May I clarify one aspect of the amendment that I am sure is straightforward, but I am not sure that I understand it at present? Could statements of investment principles be made by someone else on behalf of the board? Under the amendment, the clause will state that a,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;&#039;statement of investment principles&#039; means a written statement of the investment principles governing determinations about investments made by or on behalf of the Board&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Does that mean investments made by or on behalf of the board or determinations&#151;determination of the written statement of principles? I suggest that the amendment is ambiguous and could be read as implying that someone else could be setting the statement of investment principles, which would be wrong.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40719-27_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am sorry. What it does is ensure that fund managers are caught within the responsibility to adhere to the statement of investment principles. In other words, not only the board but the board&#039;s agents must act in conformity with the statement of investment principles. It is obvious that they should but, technically, there could be a lacuna without the amendment.

<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40719-27_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I completely accept that they should be bound by the statement of investment principles, but I was concerned that the amendment implied that someone other than the board could make that statement of investment principles on the board&#039;s behalf.

<a name="40719-27_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   It becomes clearer if one looks at the whole of the clause, including subsections (1) and (3). If one looks at them, it is perfectly straightforward that the statement is made by the board. Subsection (2), as amended, then slots into place because the investment principles are concerned with principles about investments made by or on behalf of the board.

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 108, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40719-27_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   We have already gone over some of the ground covered by this clause in our discussion on Clause 107. I referred earlier to the Myners report. One should not put too much weight on the various gurus who pontificate on these subjects in relation to the requests of the Government for them to carry out studies&#151;we were discussing Higgs the other day. But it seems to me that some of the provisions in the Myners report are sensible and many, if not all, pension funds will make clear whether they are Myners compliant. To the extent that it is relevant to this fund, is it the Government&#039;s intention that it should be so?
</p>

<a name="40719-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>As far as the statement of investment principles is concerned, generally speaking they are all similar. Many Members of the Committee will be familiar with this problem. None the less, it is important that it is clear what those principles are. Myners suggests that a statement of the investment principles should be sent to all the members of the funds. What will the situation be regarding communication between the pensions protection fund board and the members of that fund, who have been taken over as a result of the failure of an eligible scheme with which the fund is now dealing? Do the Government propose that the statement of investment principles should be sent out to those who are members of fund and who are depending on the success of the fund for the continued payment of their pensions, in the same way that they would be if they were in an ordinary pension fund?
</p>

<a name="40719-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>It is important that members are aware of what the fund&#039;s investment objectives are. Generally speaking, despite what was said earlier, I think that there is a case for putting it on the face of the Bill. This will be a very unusual fund, as my noble friend said a moment or two ago. It will be a rather strange public/private hybrid with many of the features of an insurance fund, as the noble Baroness said, or a pension fund or, as the Minister said, a compensation fund. I do not think that it is a compensation fund. It is much closer to a pension fund. It has taken over pension liabilities, is investing assets and is trying to pay out. It is not compensating people. In effect, it is perpetuating the operation. It may be that the Minister can give us a little more information on what the Government envisage in relation to these investment principles.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40719-27_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   Picking up the Minister&#039;s reply, we certainly do not need to be too prescriptive but, as I listened to her, I heard no prescription at all. Her answer boiled down to repeating value for money and prudence. Frankly, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC10"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC10</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

from the point of view of an investment manager or an investment committee that is so vague as to be operationally meaningless. There is surely some third way between being over-prescriptive on detail and giving no investment policy guidelines at all. So far, that is all that the Bill and the Minister&#039;s answer amount to.
</p>

<a name="40719-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The Minister implied that there should be some sort of minimum liquidity requirement, given that she spoke about the fact that the calls on the fund would be quite lumpy. That is something that should be addressed. How far might one need to have a certain amount of liquidity? It is no good just to say, &quot;We do not want to be too prescriptive&quot; and then give no guidance at all. Operationally, and in terms of strategy, that is what the Minister&#039;s answer added up to.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40719-27_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   My concern with this clause is subsection (3). Historically, the bugbear of anything that has involved a government managing investments has been that, after a while, a government will chose to manage investments in their own interests. A generation or two ago, investments would have been used to prop up ailing industries. These days, perhaps it would be mandated that a certain proportion must be invested in new industries. These get included as investment principles or direction of investments for reasons that are not in any way connected with the reasons that should govern the fund, which are its own internal requirements and the requirements of the people funding it.
</p>

<a name="40719-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I am concerned about the breadth of subsection (3). I know how it will be set up to begin with: it will be set up so that there is a sensible set of requirements. But things creep in. There will be a chunk of money sitting around in the fund. Political pressures will be put on it because it is possible under subsection (3). There will be pressures to use the fund to rescue an industry that is in trouble or to consolidate it. There will be pressures to do things British rather than overseas. There will be pressures to put money into government debt rather than equities. All these are pressures that are not properly put upon this fund. It has nothing to do with a government&#039;s investment objectives or the public&#039;s investment objectives. There has to be a degree of insulation and I do not see it in subsection (3). I would like to know how that will be provided.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40719-27_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I shall not trouble the Committee by repeating what I said earlier. I hope that what we expect such a statement of investment principles to contain and the issues it should address is very clear, given the shopping list that I read out. Therefore, the fund does not have a blank sheet of paper. There is plenty of experience in developing and drafting a statement of investment principles that would be appropriate under these circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40719-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>However, I do not think it is appropriate to put it in the Bill. I shall give an example. I think that 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago, it would have been pretty unlikely that an investment strategy would have taken environmental considerations into account. We might <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC11"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC11</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

now. Ethical considerations would probably have been included 20 years ago but 10 years before that they would not have been. The context and the salience of the issues of which one would expect investors to take account will change. The attitude toward particular industries&#151;smoking or arms&#151;will be for society to determine as significant. That is one broad-brush reason why it is unwise to put it in the Bill. However, I have given an indication of the half-dozen criteria that we would expect to be reflected when the board draws up its statement of investment principles.
</p>

<a name="40719-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked whether it would be sent out to all members. I am not expecting that to happen. As a member of the Universities Superannuation Scheme I do not get a statement of its SIP sent to me automatically. I have access to the web and if I write in for a statement, I can get it. I would also expect it to be included in the annual report. All of that is publicly available, without expecting that it be sent to me. Indeed, as a modest pensioner of a university scheme I do not have sent to me the annual statement of investment principles. The information will be fully available without expecting it to be sent. Furthermore, considerable costs would have to be borne by the levy payers if they were to receive all the information.
</p>

<a name="40719-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Much of the discussion has been around whether this is a pension scheme and whether it should follow Myners&#039; principle. Because it is not a pension scheme, we do not regard it as being necessary to be Myners-compliant. The basic reason is that a pension scheme would be expected to honour the commitment between the employer and the employees&#039; contract for 100 per cent of all benefits. The scheme is coming into the PPF because that contract has failed.
</p>

<a name="40719-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Although we expect to see 100 per cent of benefit for existing pensioners, deferred pensioners&#151;everyone else will be a deferred pensioner&#151;will receive only 90 per cent. That is why it is compensation and not a pension. We cannot honour the original contract because those who are parties to it were unable to honour it. That is why we are calling it compensation. It would not be appropriate to regard it as a pension. If it were, one would expect every existing scheme that entered to continue its existing pension contract or commitment. They cannot do that. It will be a pool scheme, with possibly some rough and ready bits to it.
</p>

<a name="40719-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Perhaps I may give an example. I going through information about survivors&#039; benefit. I believe that some two thirds of all existing DB schemes have survivors&#039; benefits at about 50 per cent of the value of the employee. I also believe that about 20 per cent offer a higher value&#151;possibly two-thirds or 60 per cent. Although I do not understand how they get away with it, some honour less than that.
</p>

<a name="40719-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>In the PPF, we are not taking over those pension commitments; we are saying that all survivors will receive 50 per cent. There is also a rough and ready element because it is a pooled fund and we cannot continue to track each individual commitment. That is a second reason why it does not make sense to call this a pension and it is misleading to do so. It is a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC12"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC12</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

compensation fund. In good faith, it will seek to honour, and should do so, the expectations we are laying on it to meet 90 per cent of the pensions rights approved for deferred pensioners.
</p>

<a name="40719-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>I should have added that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, might like to cross-read Amendment No. 181 in the light of Amendment No. 194, which is the general clause about information sent out. That may give him a sense of how we are operating. Amendment No. 194 includes a requirement to disclose the statement of investment principles. I wonder whether I have said enough to address Members&#039; questions without repeating myself from previous discussions. I hope that with that response, Members will feel able to accept the clause.

<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40719-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   A division of opinion is developing between us as to the exact nature of this particular animal. As the Minister said, it is true that those who will benefit from the scheme will not be receiving their original entitlement. It is a certain percentage, but I would have thought that once that quantum is decided, it will operate exactly like a pension scheme. If that is not so, whether or not the board says, &quot;We are compensating you&quot;, it is a little less certain what they will receive. Once we are clear what they will receive, I do not see how it differs from a pension scheme, albeit one consisting entirely of deferred pensioners.
</p>

<a name="40719-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>As to how much should be on the face of the Bill, I am now slightly worried by the noble Baroness&#039;s response. Clause 108(3) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;Before preparing or revising a statement of investment principles, the Board must comply with any prescribed requirements&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Suddenly, this public/private body becomes a bit more public because we are not putting the provisions on the face of the Bill&#151;albeit, there is the possibility of making amendment by statutory instrument&#151;we will have a series of regulations. Therefore, although the provision will not go on the face of the Bill, the regulations will state the prescribed requirements for these investment principles.
</p>

<a name="40719-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Before we agree to all that, we are entitled to know from the Government the requirements which, in the first instance, will be prescribed. Indeed, subsection (4) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;A statement of investment principles must be in the prescribed form and cover, amongst other things, the prescribed matters&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>That being so, I do not see why at the outset we cannot have the provision on the face of the Bill and amend it by statutory instrument rather than have it done by regulation.

</p>

<a name="40719-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>The noble Baroness says that 10 years ago we would not have been concerned with, for example, environmental issues. Four or five years ago, a Secretary of State sought to almost intimidate pension funds into investing in particular types of asset and asked trustees for a response. A number of trustees were fairly forthright on the matter. They wrote back, saying, &quot;The object of our pension fund is not to achieve various government objectives by investing in this and that. The object of our <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC13"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC13</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

fund is to maximise the size of the fund to the benefit of our members and we shall select our investments accordingly&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40719-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>If the noble Baroness is going to say, &quot;Well, of course the Government can intervene suddenly and prescribe that the fund must be invested to X per cent in a particular type of fund for environmental reasons&quot;, that will clearly put up the cost of the levy and in my view that should not be done. We do not have trustees, we have a board, but trustees would, or ought to, take the view that their objective is to maximise the size of the fund and not to engage in various political issues which the government of the day happen to believe they should.

<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40719-28_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   Would the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, believe it might be necessary to say that the investment should be conducted in accordance with prudential requirements? In other words, one must ensure that the fund is prudentially managed in order that people will benefit from it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40719-28_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I agree 1,000 per cent with the noble Baroness, Lady Turner; I am all for them investing in a prudential way. However, the Minister was saying that compared with 10 years ago we might now suddenly find that we must take into account environmental matters; for example, funds must not invest in tobacco companies. I am against tobacco smoking and so on. None the less, one will suddenly find that the board is prescribed from investing in tobacco companies. At that point, there is a slippery slope and we need to be clearer what subsections (3) and (4) will produce. It may be going too far to have the provision on the face of the Bill, but we want a clear statement of what initially these prescribed matters will be before we agree to a totally blank cheque in that sense.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40719-28_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   If there is prescribing to do, I believe that this House should do a certain amount of it first. I listened carefully to the Minister and her various shopping lists and possibilities, but in investment policy it is important to know one&#039;s overriding objective. I suggest an objective that is common in pension fund and long-term investment generally; that the overriding investment policy objective should be to maximise the long-term total return, taking capital in together with the funds entrusted to the PPF. If people want to add on something subject to levels of risk or liquidity, I would accept that, but one must have an overriding objective.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40719-28_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I echo that suggestion. It solves many problems and makes clear in whose interests the fund is being managed. It is clearly being managed in the interests of the pensioners and the levy payers. To my mind, those are the people whose interests should be taken into account. Furthermore, we should have a clear statement. The noble Lord&#039;s suggestion is along the right lines and certainly better than anything I have been able to dream up in the past five minutes.

<a name="40719-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>We must pin this down; there must be a restriction on what the Government can do under subsection (3) so that it is only in the interests of the pensioners and levy payers. It should not be able to introduce some other set of interests that are extraneous to the fund.

<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40719-28_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am a little puzzled. I can see that one could maximise profits by having no requirement to observe equal pay legislation and so on, but we do not operate in that fashion. All that I was doing with my example of environmental considerations was to show how people&#039;s expectations about the considerations that should be brought to bear when making investment decisions have changed over time&#151;neither more nor less&#151;as indeed they have.
</p>

<a name="40719-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I shall have a go at unpicking some of the words to see whether that will allay some of the fears expressed by Members of the Committee. We have already discussed one&#151;that the board must secure that a statement of investment principles is prepared and maintained, is reviewed at such intervals and on such occasions as may be prescribed and is, if necessary, revised. The board will be required to establish whether anything has changed since the last statement was produced, whether it is the nature of the liabilities, the investment market, and so on.
</p>

<a name="40719-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Subsection (2) refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;a written statement of the investment principles&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>which must be available in written form, whether people write in to request it or whether it is on the web.
</p>

<a name="40719-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Subsection (3) was the source of some concern. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;Before preparing or revising a statement of investment principles, the Board must comply with any prescribed requirements&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>The regulations will set out what the statement is to cover, but not specify any strategy. For example, it would specify that it must cover environmental strategy, but not what that might look like. Regulations will require the board to meet certain requirements before preparing a statement of investment principles.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40719-28_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I wonder whether the Minister could read the paragraph again, as I was surprised by one of the words in it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40719-28_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Well, I read subsection (3) and then made two points: that regulations under Clause 108 will require the board to meet certain requirements before preparing a statement of investment principles. For example, it is intended that the regulations will require the board to obtain written advice from a person with appropriate knowledge and experience of investment management, and require the board to assess the nature of the its liabilities and the risk environment in which it is operating, thus considering the appropriate diversification for the fund. That will come in under the reference that it must comply with any prescribed requirements.
</p>

<a name="40719-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Finally, in response to the noble Lord&#039;s question about overriding objectives, I was trying to say that the regulations will state what the statement must cover <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC15"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC15</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but will not specify any strategy. In other words, any investment principles statement must include, for example, a consideration of environmental strategy, but not what that may turn out to be or how the managers respond to it.
</p>

<a name="40719-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>It is a shopping list of issues to consider or principles to take on board&#151;not how those are translated into particular investment decisions, which is as I understand it a job for fund managers working within the framework of the board.

<a name="40719-29_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   This is something that I have been concerned with when wearing another hat. It may be, for example, that if one was acquiring a property asset for some function or other to happen&#151;not particularly associated with the PPF but in another consideration&#151;the cheapest site may be outside the city centre on a greenfield site. But there are hidden environmental costs&#151;additional transport costs&#151;which are dumped on to other bodies. This may be something to bear in mind when producing a green strategy such as the handling of the DWP estate. I am not saying that this is how the pension fund investment principle would operate, but it is the sort of area in which environmental considerations might come into play.

<a name="40719-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   Are not our colleagues opposite inviting the Minister to predict on the hoof what the regulations might be, despite the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, put it very differently five minutes ago when he said, &quot;If there is any prescribing to be done, we want to be part of it&quot;? Parliament will be part of the prescribing in that it would have to approve. This is not the moment to raise any further debate. Noble Lords opposite have given us three different versions in the space of around three minutes of what substantively the requirements should be. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said that it was obviously a very good model of long-term maximisation of value; another noble Lord said that it was self-evident that the object should be slightly similar. The short answer is that this is not the time to predict what the substance of the prescribing should be, but simply to note that prescribing will be necessary. We cannot go any further than that.

<a name="40719-29_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I am sorry if I was not entirely clear.

responded to my point&#151;one which, to some extent, other noble Lords are also making&#151;that there should be a statement in the Bill of the overriding objective.
</p>

<a name="40719-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The noble Baroness may not wish to respond to my specific proposal today. The problem is that there is no effective objective in the Bill. The Minister has drawn to our attention the reports of some very good pension funds such as those of the FSSU and BP. I would be very surprised if they did not contain an overriding objective of the type I seek. Will she look into those reports and let us know why such an overriding objective as a principle should not be in the Bill? I do not need an answer now; it is a matter to consider.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="40719-29_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I am astonished at the way in which the debate has developed. There is no inconsistency in what is said. Both opposition parties have said that there are various alternatives. The Government propose simply to operate by regulation. We are not asking the noble Baroness to respond on the hoof, but we certainly need before Report a clearer indication of exactly what the regulations will cover.
</p>

<a name="40719-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>I am somewhat horrified by the noble Baroness&#039;s remarks regarding environmental considerations, because they are wholly inconsistent with the view expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, with which I sympathise, on what the basic objective of the fund should be. The basic objective should be common to that of many pension funds: effectively to maximise the size of the fund for the benefit of members or alternatively to minimise the contributions of levy payers. In any event, the objective is not to go off on some frolic involving environmental considerations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="40719-29_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Perhaps I can help the noble Lord. His view is not shared by the three bodies whose statements of principle I have read&#151;I only have three so they may not be consistent with others. The BP statement of principle says, for example:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;Consistent with its obligation to act in the best financial interest of the fund the trustee supports a bias towards investments in companies with positive social, environmental and ethical policies&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>The noble Lord talks about being horrified and queries the shopping list that I produced. All I am saying is that, so far as I can see, the list reflects closely the sort of considerations for taking social, environmental and ethical statements of policy into account. Equally, other companies talk about minimising environmental damage in various ways.
</p>

<a name="40719-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>The noble Lord goes on to ask about the main objective. That is already carried in the phrase:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;The Board may invest for the purposes of the prudent management of its financial affairs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>I do not see why that is not the overriding objective. We know that the purpose of the fund is to be able to meet the liabilities that will arise from ensuring that members are compensated for the loss of their pension schemes. It is asked to attend to the prudent management of its financial affairs and to put itself into a position in which it can best meet those liabilities. But, in addition, through its investment principle it will bear these issues in mind. It must take <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC17"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC17</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

cognisance of certain issues, although it may decide to ignore them by saying that they are not relevant to its investment principle.

</p>

<a name="40719-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>This is almost a checklist of considerations to which the statement of investment principles must be exposed in order to measure against it. I see no problem with that. Certainly the three examples I have looked at follow very closely in their formats what we are suggesting will happen here. So I am slightly surprised that noble Lords are finding this difficult, because it appears to be consistent with best practice already established in the field: the prudent management of funds for the purposes outlined. These are some of the issues on the shopping list which must be taken into account when the board draws up its statement of investment principles.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40719-29_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   I rise briefly to intervene. Two different things are being considered here, the second of which was first initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and followed by other noble Lords. The first was whether something more specific should be set out in the Bill as regards Parliament&#039;s statement of the objectives of the board.
</p>

<a name="40719-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>At an earlier meeting the Minister pointed out that the board is to be at arm&#039;s length from the Government and Parliament. When established it is meant to set out its investment principles in accordance with Clause 107(1):


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;The Board may invest for the purposes of the prudent management of its financial affairs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I should say in response to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, because he read out something which outlined a rather more ideal and detailed objective, that that could be interpreted as favouring the short term over the long term. That would not do because the board must operate for a very long time and will have to deal with matters arising not only in the immediate future but also in the long term. It is right that on the face of the Bill it is left to the board to determine at arm&#039;s length the investment principles.

</p>

<a name="40719-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>However, I do have some sympathy with Members opposite, and certainly with the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, who initiated this point. Subsection (3) of Clause 108 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;Before preparing or revising a statement of investment principles, the Board must comply with any prescribed requirements&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>As I understand from my noble friend at the Dispatch Box, those are not prescribed requirements on the statement of investment principles, rather the prescribed requirements for what the board must do to build up its preliminary work and knowledge in order to set out its statement of investment principles. It must take professional advice and so forth.

<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40719-29_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I turn back to a point made by the noble Baroness on the last occasion. She said that this Bill is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC18"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of necessity being pushed through quickly and that there are areas in it that ultimately we shall just have to take on trust.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="40719-29_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I want to make a point in response to that remark by the noble Lord. I did not say that the Bill was being pushed through quickly, but that some of its clauses are coming through quickly. Were I to delay the whole Bill for the sake of those late clauses, more pensions would be put at risk. I should like to make that distinction.
</p>

<a name="40719-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>I can tell noble Lords that, to my certain knowledge, 85 to 90 per cent of this Bill has been worked on for three years or even longer. This is not a swift piece of legislation being pushed through at the last minute. However, some clauses, of which pensions liberation is the most extreme example, along with the financial assistance scheme, have come through very late. That is the reason why they were not scrutinised in the Commons. We had to choose between either deferring the Bill&#151;Members of the Committee know about the problems associated with such a move&#151;or going ahead. I want to make that distinction absolutely clear.
</p>

<a name="40719-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The Bill follows a Green Paper and its subsequent elaborate consultation. It then went into a quasi-White Paper issued as a Statement which in turn generated consultation that was included in the Bill. The amount of work that went into the origins of this Bill far exceeds that undertaken for any other Bill I have worked on. I should not like that canard to be repeated in quite the way indicated by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.
</p>

<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="40719-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I consider myself suitably put down. However, my point, however inexpertly made, is nonetheless relevant. We all recognise that certain things will have to be taken on trust. Ideally we would like to have seen this Bill produced in draft form and considered by a committee able to deal with something so technical and far-reaching. However, we do not have that and so, in some cases, we shall have take decisions based on our trust that the Government have done all the work.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>However, the quid pro quo is that the Government must recognise that some points cause us real problems, although in fact they are not difficult to solve. While I accept that that is not what is written, noble Lords on this side share the universal feeling that there is a considerable difficulty here. However, as I have said, I do not think that it will be difficult to solve. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, has suggested that we set out in the Bill a basic statement of investment principles which outlines in whose interests these investments are being managed. If we were to go down that road, many of the subsidiary problems would fall into place. It would then be impossible to use Clause 108(3) in the wrong way because it would be subject to the basic and overriding principle that presumably would be set out somewhere in Clause 7.

</p>

<a name="40719-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>I have spent some of my life as a tenant of the Church Commissioners&#151;and an extremely unpleasant experience that has been. The commissioners interpret the mandate in the interests of their beneficiaries <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC19"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

extremely severely and their tenants do not come into the equation at all. The noble Baroness wants to introduce some kind of softening of the absolute mandate. I suggest that the right way to do that is by a reference to general best practice rather than allowing a means by which particular special interests can fight Clause 108 in ways that might damage the fund and its beneficiaries as well as those who will have to pay for the fund.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>There is a way through here, one that I do not think threatens in any way either the integrity of the Bill as a whole or this part of it&#151;of which, as I have said, I am a great fan. I hope very much that the Government will be able to take this in a positive light, saying that they will do their best to meet our concerns rather than defending the purity of their own belief in what is already set out. That would be more in keeping with the spirit in which the Bill is being taken through this place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="40719-30_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I shall certainly reflect on what has been said because it is obviously a matter of major concern. Normally, if Members of both the main Opposition party and the Liberal Democrats press me on something, I can see where they are coming from and I am able to understand the nature of their concerns. Then it may or may not be the case that I can meet those concerns.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>On this occasion, however, my difficulty is that I still remain baffled. Noble Lords have made their points very clearly, but I do not think that we shall advance much further today. The least I can do is to reflect and consider our debate to see whether I have missed something rather important, although I must repeat that I am baffled. Obviously that is a shortcoming on my part, but I really do not understand what the extra words proposed would do aside from producing a territory of debate about what the fund is for, which is carried by subsequent clauses that we shall come to discuss.

</p>

<a name="40719-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>If noble Lords wish to write to me, I shall be perfectly happy to circulate these examples of investment principles. Some have an overriding objective while others do not follow that form. But the phrase &quot;prudent management&quot; covers virtually everything that has been said today and so I do not understand why further words in the Bill are necessary. However, I have to say that this is not ringing any bells with me.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40719-30_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I intervene only briefly to ensure that the noble Baroness&#039;s contemplation on this issue is correctly directed. The crucial point is this: in whose interests are these investments being made? The expression &quot;prudent management&quot; is too wishy-washy. Most pension funds have an overriding objective&#151;I stress that&#151;of the kind quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Some years ago, a Secretary of State or possibly even the Chancellor wrote to various pension funds saying, &quot;We would like you to invest in a particular way, taking environmental issues into account&quot;, to cite the expression used by the noble Baroness. The responses were of two kinds: either the trustees <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC20"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC20</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

responded by saying that it was nothing to do with them&#151;in other words, take a running jump&#151;or they produced something along the lines quoted by the noble Baroness from Shell, which stated that consistent with their main objective, they would try to be helpful to the environment, and so forth. But the phrase &quot;consistent with prudent management&quot; is not good enough; it has to be more explicit than that. It is that which we shall have to try and achieve on Report.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>We really cannot have the board of the pension protection fund investing in this or that environmental project or small business at the expense of either the beneficiaries or those who are to pay the levy. It has to be tied down more securely than that.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The noble Baroness has always been helpful with regulations. If it is possible for her to let us have a draft of these regulations, which are probably the clearest case in the Bill, I would be grateful. However, the wording as it stands is certainly not sufficient and we shall need to straighten it out.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>The noble Baroness said: Following that extended debate we move now to a rather mundane probing amendment drafted to find out from what kinds of institutions the Government envisage the pension protection fund borrowing. The permission to borrow is drafted in terms of a &quot;deposit-taker&quot;&#151;loosely, banks. The definition of such a deposit-taker set out in subsection (3)(a) is fairly straightforward, but can the Minister give some examples or a list of the deposit-takers which would be covered by subsection (3)(b)? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="40719-30_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The purpose of Clause 109 is to set out the power to borrow commercially in order to manage short-term liquidity so that the fund does not have to sell off assets and so forth. Noble Lords know that this is not meant to be a long-term method of funding.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The board may borrow money from a deposit-taker or, in layman&#039;s terms, a bank or building society which is authorised to lend money in the UK by one of two routes. The first route is set out in subsection (3)(a) of the clause and is where the deposit-taker has been directly authorised by the Financial Services Authority under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>As the noble Baroness said, the second route is set out in the paragraph that the amendment would remove. That states that the board may borrow from,

</p>

<a name="40719-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>and so on. That is where the deposit-taker has exercised its appropriate passport rights to be able to act as a deposit-taker in the UK. Those passport rights mean that, once authorised in its home state by its home state regulator, a bank is automatically authorised to carry on banking business in other member states. As they are authorised in the UK, all companies in the UK may also borrow from those banks and building societies. That is why it would be inappropriate to remove the paragraph. Does that answer the noble Baroness&#039;s question?
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="40719-30_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I am grateful for the noble Baroness&#039;s response and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>

<a name="40719-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 109 shall stand part of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40719-30_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   As the heading suggests, the clause concerns borrowing. I have only just noticed that Amendment No. 190 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, comes later and I do not want to pre-empt what he may say about it. I think that it essentially concerns whether the Government will be the lender of last resort in this matter. We can come to that matter in due course and I would not want to anticipate it.

</p>

<a name="40719-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>None the less, the cause concerns borrowing by the board. As has already been pointed out, it may borrow from a deposit-taker. The dilemma here is that we really do not know what will be the situation when the board begins operations. It has been commonplace in our discussions that, because the provisions under the pension protection fund are likely to be more favourable than those under what I call the &#163;400 million compensation fund under Part 6, companies or employers may seek to defer becoming insolvent if they can, so that pensioners receive the provisions of the pension protection fund, rather than those under Part 3.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>Therefore, if I understand it correctly, there is likely to be something of a rush of companies becoming eligible almost immediately after the Bill becomes operational. The noble Baroness shakes her head; I should be interested to hear what she has to say. In all events, especially in the early period but perhaps in later periods as well, the funds available to the pension protection fund may well be less than the amount that it needs to pay out to eligible companies or funds. The question is then: how will it finance that? The answer in Clause 109 appears to be that it will have to borrow.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>At the same time, it will have come into a lot of assets from companies that have become eligible. To some extent, at any rate, they will be funded and have assets. So, under the provisions of the two previous clauses, we may find that the pension protection fund is investing in gilt-edged securities and lending to the Government at the same time as it is borrowing from licensed deposit-takers. I think that I am right to say that the return on gilt-edged securities is likely to be lower than the amount paid to licensed deposit-takers. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC22"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

So overall, the pension protection fund will incur a net cost. The clause then specifies limits on the amount that it can borrow.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Again, we are told that that arms-length operation will suddenly find the murky hand of the Treasury intervening. The Treasury will say how much the PPF can borrow, although, presumably, it will always have to borrow enough to pay out the liabilities that it has taken over.
<a name="time_3"></a>
<a name="40719-30_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40719-30_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>What is the situation? Are we to be assured that the Treasury will never impose a limit on borrowing that prevents the PPF from carrying out its obligations to the pensioners which it has taken over from an eligible company? Similarly, as a further qualification, there will be limits set, apparently, by the Secretary of State&#151;although I should have thought that it would be the Treasury&#151;on the borrowing limit.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>Another point arises concerning this clause. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;The Board may . . .  give security&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-30_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>I am not clear what security the board has to give. Will it be able to use the assets that it has acquired from eligible companies to finance borrowing and to secure borrowing from a licensed deposit-taker? Again, it seems that that will raise costs above that which the board could borrow if it were able to borrow from the Treasury.
</p>

<a name="40719-30_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>As I say, I do not want to anticipate the other point, but it would be helpful to know under what rules limits are to be imposed on the PPF either for the fact that it borrows at all or increases its borrowing limits and the basis on which it will be able to offer security. Are we sure we are doing that in a way that minimises the costs of the operation?

<a name="40719-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   The noble Lord is right. In a sense, my Amendment No. 190 to Clause 110 could stand with either clause. In anticipation of that, in Clause 110, the heading, &quot;Grants&quot;, should be changed to &quot;Grants and Loans&quot;. As regards Clause 109, clearly, if there is a formal procedure by which the Government could act as lender of last resort in an emergency, that would undoubtedly reduce the borrowing costs and enable the PPF to borrow on finer terms commercially. I would invite the Minister to consider that point as well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="40719-31_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   In setting out the purposes of the clause, I hope that I shall be able to answer the points that were raised. Clause 109 sets out the board&#039;s power to borrow commercially in order to manage its short-term liquidity. The power is designed to save the board money, ensuring that it does not have to sell off assets that it is holding at times when it would not receive a good price.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>However, the borrowing is not designed to be a long-term method of funding the pension protection fund or the fraud compensation fund. Instead, we have given the board the power to smooth the peaks and <br>&nbsp;<br>

troughs of the economic cycle. Perhaps I may summarise our approach on that. In good times, the levy system is designed to smooth costs over time, while during bad times, the immediate costs of compensation should rise only slowly over time.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>After a bad time has hit&#151;this is the most relevant part for our discussion of the clause&#151;the board has a number of strategies open to it to deal with cash-flow problems, as the noble Lord said. The strategies include being able to increase the levy, to borrow, and, in a worse-case scenario if it is still necessary, to reduce indexation and revaluation rates. Finally, the board could ask the Secretary of State to reduce the 100 per cent or 90 per cent levels&#151;depending on whether a person is a deferred pensioner or an active pensioner&#151;of compensation.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>As one part of that approach, the power to borrow is a sensible and appropriate measure. But, as with any other power, the PPF must account for any borrowing in the annual reports and accounts. One further restriction is that the board may not exceed the maximum borrowing limit set out in secondary legislation.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>Within that broad framework, the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked whether we considered that there might be a rush of schemes. I accept that some schemes may delay insolvency in order to maximise its chances of entering or becoming eligible for the PPF. That is always possible. But it does not mean that the PPF should have a cash-flow problem. During the assessment period, trustees will be responsible for maintaining and making payments.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>It is worth emphasising that the assessment period will be one year. In some circumstances I can conceive, it may well be longer than that. We are not talking about something that will happen the day after tomorrow. When a scheme comes into the PPF, it will take over all the assets. It is therefore unlikely that the PPF would have a cash-flow problem, although it will need to consider its funding position in terms of the amount raised by the levy.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>This debate takes us back to our brief discussion on deferred pensions. Assets will immediately come into the PPF, but the only immediate payments that it will have to make will be to existing pensioners at 100 per cent. Perhaps a very high proportion of its liabilities will not fall in for five or 10 years or, in some cases, 30 or 40 years. That is why we are not expecting a cash-flow problem except, as we discussed earlier, in a situation where either a sector or a major company suddenly fall into PPF territory. Even then, given the assessment period, one is talking about a period of a year or so on average&#151;maybe longer than that&#151;in which the board can determine the extent to which it may need to meet liabilities that are substantial because a scheme is coming in with a very high proportion of pensioners and payments. We should bear that in mind.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>In a way, we are coming back to some of the FRS 17 issues where there is an assumption that all liabilities have to be instantly met. They do not. That <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC24"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC24</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is why I would not normally expect there to be a cash-flow problem, but it is wise to have the borrowing power to meet it if it should occur.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>What would be the maximum borrowing limit? That will be determined by secondary legislation. I do not really want to speculate or put a figure on it. Given that the PPF is estimated to have an annual income from levies of approximately &#163;300 million, I would expect the borrowing limit to be a fairly substantial figure&#151;rather more than, say, the &#163;15 million that the Pension Compensation Board currently has. Whether that figure is nearer &#163;15 million, &#163;50 million or &#163;100 million is something that we would want to consider when we draw up the regulations. Obviously, the maximum ceiling would have to be sufficient to meet the very occasional contingency that might befall if a seriously major company came into the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>Finally, the noble Lord asked me about security. As he suspected, security is assets held, which could, for example, be property because that would be assets going into the scheme. Security, indeed, is an asset. I hope that I have met most of the queries raised by Members of the Committee. In that case, I hope that Clause 109 shall stand part of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="40719-31_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   We shall come later to the difficult issues of indexation and revaluation to which the noble Baroness referred. In those circumstances, it would seem that the board is probably not covering the people who have been in the eligible schemes as well as it might otherwise do.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I should like to clarify two points. I am not clear why the Secretary of State should set a limit. More particularly, I am not clear that we are minimising the costs of borrowing. The PPF may well be lending money to the Government in the form of gilts at one interest rate while also borrowing on the commercial market. Generally speaking, that is not cost-effective. In other words, should the PPF not be borrowing from the Government rather than the commercial market?
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40719-31_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   On the first point, it is reasonable and standard practice for the Secretary of State to set a borrowing limit where it is appropriate. That is normal for NDPBs. For example, the Pension Compensation Board has a borrowing limit&#151;I think that I am right in saying&#151;of &#163;15 million, which is set by the Secretary of State. I think that that is fairly standard for NDPBs. As I say, it is important that we recall that this is for only short-term liquidity problems where there can suddenly be very lumpy expenditure.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>Behind that, I suspect, is a debate into which I was not going to enter because it may be more appropriately dealt with or responded to in respect of the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott: namely, should bodies be able to borrow from the Government or should the Government stand as a lender of last resort? The Government&#039;s view on that is very clear. The answer is &quot;no&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>The Government are not lending because they do not want to be seen to be the guarantor of last resort. That goes back to all of the moral hazard issues that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC25"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC25</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we discussed earlier. If the Government are seen as a lender of last resort, possibly unable ever, unlike a commercial organisation, to recover that money because of the situation in which they find themselves, there is the moral hazard of schemes possibly failing to exercise due diligence. Instead of being &quot;policed&quot; by other private sector companies about what the levy should raise, they might instead rely on government hand-outs as lenders of last resort in order to bankroll them.


</p>

<a name="40719-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>The Government are very clear on that. It is a major part of the Government&#039;s decision that we will not underwrite this either through making a direct contribution or, as has sometimes been suggested, putting on a levy through the public sector, which should not come into it at all, or acting as a lender of monies. I should make that clear. I know that that is not necessarily what noble Lords want to hear, but the Government&#039;s view on that is unambiguous.

<p><a name="st_62"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak to Amendment No. 189 standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Hoyle. I am sorry that I follow on just after my noble friend the Minister has categorically said that the Government will not stand behind this proposal because I am about to argue, in a very modest way, that the Government should do precisely that.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>We seek to amend Clause 110, which is about grants. Quite specifically, it states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State may pay the Board out of money provided by Parliament . . .  other than expenditure which by virtue of section . . .  is payable out of&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>Our amendment seeks to reverse that. We seek to make explicit provision for the possibility of a small amount of government financial support, but not any specific amount.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>The amendment, by reversing the intention of the clause, provides a safety valve that would allow, in the   event of unexpectedly high claims on the fund, the possibility of a third way other than by reducing benefits or increasing the levy. It would also signal possible government underwriting of the scheme&#151;I repeat, possible government underwriting of the scheme&#151;which would add to confidence.
</p>

<a name="40719-31_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>As my noble friend the Minister knows, there has been widespread pressure for a measure of this kind from those who believe that claims may be such that a reasonable level of compensation cannot be afforded while maintaining a reasonable levy payment. We do not want the cost of covering past failures to become a deterrent to providing final salary schemes in the future. From the Marshalled List, I can see that the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, obviously have similar concerns and <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40719-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   It is a pleasure to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Turner. She is right: we are broadly seeking to achieve the same thing in our amendment. In due course, I am sure that we can talk about how we can combine forces. This is a fundamental issue of principle in the Bill, so I propose to say a few words about how we feel and why. Perhaps I may just say that I never thought that I would live to see the day when the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, would be supporting the third way. We agree with her on this one.

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>It seems to us a matter of simple prudence&#151;that ought to commend itself to the Chancellor&#151;to plan before setting out what happens if the ship is forced to send an SOS call. Obviously, one is conscious of moral hazard, but that is a very important part of the reason why on these Benches&#151;and, I believe, on the official Opposition Benches&#151;we are insisting that a proper risk-based assessment of the scheme and the contributions to it comes in as soon as possible. That will be a considerable incentive to avoid moral hazard.
</p>

<a name="40719-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>I ask the Minister to take this point up because I have twice asked her to do so across the Floor of the House and she has ignored it both times. I accept that this is a matter for the Treasury but I ask her to get a proper response for us from the Treasury as to why the PPF is so different from the PoolRe reinsurance scheme, whereby the Government stand behind possible enormous claims on terrorism insurance. I believe that that is a sensible precedent and has worked well in the past.
</p>

<a name="40719-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>If we look at the PBGC in America, which the Government have clearly studied carefully, it is true that there is no official government guarantee but the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor are on the board. That makes clear how unthinkable it is that the American Government would walk away from it. We would be happy to accept Gordon Brown and Andrew Smith on the board, rather than a formal government guarantee, if the Government prefer to do it that way.
</p>

<a name="40719-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>I believe that it is far better to deal with this in advance in case of the remote likelihood that it comes up. None of us can possibly know what the likelihood is.

</p>

<a name="40719-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>I have warned the Minister of my next point. We have a veritable media blitz of interviews from the newly appointed chairman of the pension protection fund, Mr Lawrence Churchill. He has been intruding very strongly in political matters, which he should not do, particularly before this House and the other place have taken a decision on this important matter. I see, for instance, that last week&#039;s <i>Professional Pensions</i> reported that:<i> </i>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;Calls for the government to underwrite the Pension Protection Fund have been described as &#039;outrageous&#039; by its inaugural chairman.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;But the National Association of Pension Funds chairman Terry Faulkner questioned whether it was appropriate for Churchill to &#039;wade into the political debate&#039; while still getting to grips with workplace pension issues&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>In today&#039;s <i>FT</i> fund management section the chairman of the BT pension fund very properly queried that point of view.
</p>

<a name="40719-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>It is not just politicians. Many people in the pensions industry are arguing that the Government should stand as the lender of last resort. I believe, and I hope that the Minister will accept, that it is quite inappropriate for the newly appointed chairman of the PPF to weigh in on one side or other of that debate. He was all over the <i>Times</i> on Saturday, saying the same thing. In <i>Financial Adviser</i> he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;My intention is to make sure the PPF does what it says on the tin&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40719-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>We on these Benches believe that it must do what it says on the tin. What it says on the tin is that it will pay certain benefits. As the NAPF have said, this is not right. We do not believe that the PPF should cut the benefits that are laid down. The Minister is quite right that in principle it cannot go bust as it is set up at the moment because it could cut the benefits, in principle, to nothing. I do not believe that that is what the country expects. The PPF has been set up by the Government, the board is appointed by the Government and it is inconceivable that the Government could walk away from it. We believe that it is better to put that clearly upfront now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="40719-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I understand the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, about recent statements about the pension protection fund. In view of his opening remarks about going off on a voyage and so on, I cannot but recall the statements made about Christopher Columbus: he did not know where he was going when he started, he was not where he thought he was when he arrived and he did it all on borrowed money.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="40719-32_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I like that very much. I sought to make clear the Government&#039;s position on this. As the Committee will expect, I cannot accept the amendment of my noble friend and that of the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott. The argument seems to be two-fold. The first part is that, as we have done it for the Financial Assistance Scheme, we must accept that we may be called upon to take a similar role with the PPF. I do not accept that. The Financial Assistance Scheme exists because the PPF is not in play. It would be unfair and unreasonable to make a retrospective levy on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC28"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC28</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

companies when they were not getting protection at the time. That is why there was no alternative but to go for a government-funded scheme of assistance&#151;it is not even compensation because it is not up to the levels of the PPF&#151;to reduce some of the deficit. That is why there is taxpayers&#039; money there.
</p>

<a name="40719-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>I do not think that it is right to expect the Government to be even a last resort, let alone a direct contributor to the pension protection fund. If it is believed that the Government could be called upon, I believe that the Government will be called upon. That is the nature of moral hazard. The PPF is an arms&#039; length body. We have established various ways of funding it: it will have substantial assets coming in from companies but will have liabilities that fall in over time; secondly, it has the capacity to raise a levy; thirdly, it has the capacity to borrow up to a certain, sensible level; and, finally, it has the capacity to review and reconsider and to ask for authority to reduce the sums of money that it needs to meet.
</p>

<a name="40719-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>It is not just that if the Government can be called upon, they will be called upon, but that when we say &quot;the Government&quot; we are saying taxpayers. Taxpayers&#151;at least half of whom have no occupational pension scheme or who are in public sector schemes where this does not arise&#151;should not be asked to pay for the safeguarding of the minority of people who have occupational pensions schemes. That is not right. It is like saying that people who do not draw down on buildings insurance, for example, because they are not owner-occupiers and therefore do not have a buildings policy, should nevertheless contribute to the buildings insurance system of the country, even though only a proportion of the population are owner-occupiers. That is not reasonable. It is not the basis of this scheme and this is not where the Government are proposing to go.
</p>

<a name="40719-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>I accept that Parliament determines the shape of the Bill but I want to make it very clear that this is not the Government&#039;s intention. Whether as a lender of last resort or a giver of grants, as my noble friend suggested, or however else it is put in other ingenious amendments to which I can look forward relating to the levies on public sector schemes which have been mentioned at various points, these proposals are that people other than the beneficiaries of this scheme should help to finance it. That is not the Government&#039;s view.
</p>

<a name="40719-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>It is in the interest of the industry and of employees in occupational pension schemes to increase good faith, security and confidence in the pension system. But to expect others who do not benefit from the fund, and will possibly never benefit from it, to pay for it, is not reasonable, decent or fair. Of course, as more people come into pension schemes and see the value of them, then the situation may change and they will be contributing to the levy. The distinction between that and the Financial Assistance Schemes is that no such levy existed and therefore no retrospective payments could be made. There was nobody else to help out and the alternative was to allow people to come on to state-related benefits. However, that was not the primary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC29"></a>

objective, which was decency and trying to maintain confidence in the pension system. That seems to be very different.
</p>

<a name="40719-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>We can continue the debate, but that is the philosophical argument. I do not think that it is right to ask those who do not benefit to pay. We have constructed a system that we believe matches those who gain and those who pay in a decent way in the pooled framework of a compensation scheme. For some people, it is rough and ready justice. I do not doubt that they will not have the exact provision that they would have enjoyed. But it seems to be a more honourable way forward than encouraging people to believe that the Government will be the lender of last resort and that the taxpayer will bale the fund out. If they believe that, it will surely happen because that is the nature of moral hazard. At that point, because they are taxpayers, those on modest incomes, often women in part-time occupations, will be asked to cross-subsidise a scheme of which they are not beneficiaries. I do not think that that is right. That is not where the Government propose to go.

<p><a name="st_75"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am in the hands of Members of the Committee on this matter. We have explained in the past that it would be necessary to introduce a number of government amendments, some of which would be minor amendments to achieve consistency across the legislation. I know that it is tiresome, but we have to do it. This is one such group of amendments, covering a number of miscellaneous minor amendments relating to Part 2 and the pension protection fund.
</p>

<a name="40719-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The effect of the amendments is to aid understanding and clarity and to ensure the proper working of existing provisions in the Bill. They clarify some references and change a number of further references which are inconsistent with other provisions and where the meaning is intended to be exactly the same. I shall give just one example. Amendment No. 191 removes the superfluous word &quot;the&quot; from the administration levy clause, which clarifies that the administration levy may recover the cost of any expenditure by the Secretary of State in setting up the board, rather than a specific expenditure.

<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="40719-34_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am happy to try and help on this. Clause 112 concerns fees. As the noble Lord said, it allows the board of the PPF to charge fees and recover costs in prescribed circumstances where it would be appropriate for the board to do so. The secondary legislation will set out the specific circumstances in which the board will be allowed to charge fees.
</p>

<a name="40719-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>An example of what the Government have in mind is where the board has carried out or commissioned an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of a scheme in order to assess whether it should enter the PPF. A third party may wish to use that valuation for another purpose. Alternatively, the third party may wish to ask the PPF to gather an additional category of information at the same time. In this example, the third party might be an individual or a firm interested in buying part or all of the insolvent company, which could involve taking on the pension scheme.
</p>

<a name="40719-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>It would be appropriate in such circumstances for the board to charge a fee because the PPF would have incurred costs in preparing the valuation, while the provision of that service could represent a significant saving for the third party involved. Of course, the valuation or any other information could be used or disclosed only in compliance with all the necessary disclosure of information requirements, including data protection.

</p>

<a name="40719-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The ability to charge fees will be extremely limited because the circumstances where fees are allowed must be set out in secondary legislation. In any case, the regulations will not allow the PPF to take on tasks not related to its functions or, indeed, to set itself up in competition with the private sector in any way.
</p>

<a name="40719-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>The opportunity to recover specified costs in this way may in certain circumstances provide practical solutions for the board and those organisations and individuals involved with the board while also keeping the administration costs of the organisation to a minimum. We think that it is appropriate for the board to charge fees and for the circumstances in which it may do so to be set out in secondary legislation as we may wish to include new categories of costs, or remove them, to reflect the changing environment in which the PPF will operate. I expect this to be a power that is exercised very seldom, in limited circumstances, but it is useful to have it should the PPF appropriately acquire information that might be of considerable value. As a result, it could recover some of the costs to the levy payer.

<a name="40719-34_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I cannot possibly comment on the second question. Not having had detailed notice of that point, I have not been able to check on it. However, in the normal course of events, the annual reports of all bodies that are laid before Parliament are not debated in the way suggested by the noble Lord. Normally copies are sent with a compliments slip. If any noble Lords are interested, an Unstarred Question can be tabled, which may result in a debate on something like the social fund annual report. That is the normal way in which things are done, in my experience.

After an &quot;insolvency event&quot;&#151;a splendid euphemism&#151;occurs in relation to the employer, the insolvency practitioner is required to notify the board, the regulator, the trustees and so on.

</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="40719-34_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham </b>   moved Amendment No. 192A:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>Page 80, line 13, leave out subsection (2) and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

&quot;(2)   An insolvency practitioner in relation to the employer must&#151;

<br>
(a)   if he is able to confirm that a scheme rescue is not possible, issue a notice to that effect (a &quot;scheme failure notice&quot;), or


<br>
(b)   if he is able to confirm that a scheme rescue has occurred, issue a notice to that effect (a &quot;withdrawal notice&quot;).&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_95"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 114 and subsequent clauses set out that when an insolvency event occurs in relation to the sponsoring employer of an occupational pension scheme which is eligible for PPF compensation, it is the duty of the insolvency practitioner to notify the PPF board, the regulator and the pension scheme trustees or managers of the insolvency events. It is the insolvency event which triggers the beginning of the assessment period. After all, a scheme will fall under the PPF only if both the employer is insolvent and it is deemed that there are insufficient assets to wind up the scheme and keep it out of the PPF. A two-part assessment must take place.
</p>

<a name="40719-34_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>The insolvency event triggers the beginning of the assessment period. During that period the scheme is assessed for eligibility for PPF compensation&#151;in other words, to see whether it can stay outside the scheme but, effectively, wound up and its liabilities bought up by annuities. Therefore, the insolvency practitioner&#039;s role in informing the board, the regulator, the trustees and managers of the insolvency <br>&nbsp;<br>

event in determining the status of the scheme is clearly essential to the entry rules of the PPF. It is vital that the role of the insolvency practitioner is set out in legislation.
</p>

<a name="40719-34_para20"></a>

<a name="40719-35_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   How?
</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="40719-35_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I shall go on if I may. That is part of our problem&#151;we wanted to get the notices reviewed, but we then found that we must produce another way in which to do it, so the noble Lord is right to ask that question.
</p>

<a name="40719-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>As the Bill stands, insolvency practitioner notices take effect as soon as they are issued. For example, a notice issued under Clause 116 stating that a scheme rescue has occurred sets in train an automatic series of events that will lead to the board&#039;s withdrawal from a scheme and the termination of an assessment period. In other words, the liabilities can be met outside of going into the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40719-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>It is highly unlikely that the notices issued by an insolvency practitioner will be incorrect. The matters on which insolvency practitioners make decisions&#151;for instance, whether a scheme rescue has occurred and therefore the scheme does not come into the PPF&#151;are straightforward and clear criteria which will have to be met before a notice can be issued. However, we can not discount the possibility of human error&#151;for instance, an insolvency practitioner&#039;s office attaching the wrong name and address to a notice. Furthermore, because these notices set in motion such an important series of events, we felt as a matter of principle that it was important that individuals had a right of appeal.
</p>

<a name="40719-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>However, because we did not want an appeal to be the only means of correcting a mistake, these amendments require the board to verify a notice issued by an insolvency practitioner. The board will do this by issuing a determination notice, and it is the notice that we have made appealable&#151;in other words, if the insolvency practitioners did not wish, and it did not seem appropriate, that their decision be appealable, it is even more appropriate within this structure that the determination notice that the board will issue instead should be the appealable route. That there needs to be an appealable route is clear, given the ECHR considerations.
</p>

<a name="40719-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>In the unlikely event that the board determines that an insolvency practitioner&#039;s notice is not correct, it is required to issue a new notice under amended Clause   117. That is exactly what it would have to do if the insolvency practitioner failed to issue a notice. The amendments also ensure that the notices do not take effect&#151;that is to say, they do not trigger any action&#151;until they become binding. Binding is when all appeal rights have expired and all outstanding appeals disposed are of.
</p>

<a name="40719-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>However, there is one key drawback of delaying action&#151;that is to say, bringing the scheme into the PPF&#151;until the notice becomes binding. In the period <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC37"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC37</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

between a notice being issued and the notice becoming binding&#151;you have to allow that period for an appeals procedure to go through&#151;the assessment period continues and any insolvency event that occurs in this interim period would be ignored. In view of this, we have amended Clause 140 so that if a further insolvency event occurs before a scheme rescue notice becomes binding, for example, the original assessment period is to be treated as terminating immediately before the occurrence of the insolvency event, thus allowing the further event to trigger a new assessment period. In other words, it may have been that the insolvency event has triggered a procedure where it looks as though there could be a rescue, that rescue falters and we therefore need a new insolvency event to trigger a new assessment period.
</p>

<a name="40719-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The intent behind all these amendments is sound: requiring the board to verify that notices issued by an insolvency practitioner are correct and allowing the board&#039;s verification notice to be appealed. These are important modifications to Chapter 3. Unfortunately, the implementation of this intent has required some complex changes to the existing structure of the provisions of Part 2 of the Bill&#151;that is the reason for this long list of amendments. I think that the changes have been dealt with succinctly but I would be very happy to spell it out further, if noble Lords would find it helpful.
</p>

<a name="40719-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>That is the purport of what we are doing, but I would be perfectly happy to describe the amendments further so that we had it on the record. I am in noble Lords&#039; hands. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="40719-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>There is concern that the procedure that we are now setting up is immensely complicated. Will the Minister share with us the advice that she and her colleagues have had about the application of the Human Rights Act, because it seems the motivation behind setting up this highly complicated procedure? Also, perhaps she might share with us who she is most concerned to protect, so far as concerns the right of appeal. Will she give us some examples of the sort of individuals or organisations that might wish to lodge an appeal and the circumstances in which that might happen so that we can then see these amendments more in context and understand the justification for them?

I agree with the noble Lord that the procedure looks cumbersome, but I hope that it will apply to a tiny number of cases. Rather than try to outline examples of such cases now, I shall write to the noble Lord. One simple example is where a nought has been left off a number in notification.

<a name="40719-35_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   The noble Baroness is always helpful in writing on points. The dilemma is that people outside who understand such matters will need to know also. I hope that the department can ensure that any interested individual can understand them.
</p>

<a name="40719-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>On the Human Rights Act, if I understood the noble Baroness correctly, she said that the members of a scheme that is about to become eligible can appeal. Was she referring to an appeal against the company&#039;s decision to become insolvent? I am not clear how the members would do that, but this is an opaque area. The noble Baroness also said that she hoped that there would not be many cases. Does she hope that there will not be many eligible schemes at the end of the day or that there will not be many schemes going through this procedure? As I understood it, all potentially eligible cases will go through the process. Perhaps the noble Baroness can say whether that is the case.

</p>

<a name="40719-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>I wish to raise a point that I ought to have made earlier on Amendment No. 192. As we understand it, the purpose of Part 2 of the Bill is to require insolvency practitioners to report to the regulator if insolvency events occur to the employer. The definition of &quot;insolvency events&quot; is contained in Clause 115 and is used elsewhere. As currently drafted, Clause 115 does not include the appointment of a provisional liquidator. It would be possible, therefore, for most of the requirements of the Bill relating to an employer in liquidation not to apply for the period of a provisional liquidation. That seems contrary to what the Government intend. Provisional liquidations tend to occur only as a short emergency measure pending full liquidation; none the less there are cases where such periods can become protracted.
</p>

<a name="40719-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>Additionally, if the Government accept that the regulator should not have the power to issue notices for any act or deliberate failure to act during the period where the legal effect of an insolvency event remains in force&#151;generally, while the insolvency practitioner is responsible&#151;this should apply during the period of provisional liquidation also.
</p>

<a name="40719-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I may be totally wrong because the point has been covered in the government amendments. But, having only recently received the explanatory notes on those amendments, I am not sure whether that is the case. More particularly, will this procedure be applied in all potentially eligible cases or did the noble Baroness merely mean that she hoped that the provisions would not often apply?

lower rate of pension benefit than he or she would have done if the company had remained insolvent or if the scheme had been wound up&#151;apart from cases of scheme rescue. By definition the PPF will be inferior to the wind-up. The legal advice given to me is that, given that it affects members, there must be an appeal procedure for members against that decision on the basis that they will enjoy lower pension rights as a result. Rather than adopting a different procedure, we are providing for an appeal against the board&#039;s determination notice rather than against the decision of the insolvent company. That is not what is being appealed in such cases; it is the appropriateness of the decision to come into the PPF during the process of assessment.
</p>

<a name="40719-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>I accept that the procedure is complex. However, I am told that the existing appeal mechanisms&#151;for example, for actuarial valuations&#151;are consistent with this procedure and that it is not out of line. We are trying to address scheme members&#039; need for an appeal mechanism under the ECHR. That creates a need to produce determinations or notices by the board which can be appealed against. In turn, that produces the procedure of interim periods and what can happen during them. We end up with a domino cascade: we solve a problem that produces another one. As a result, we have had to table this complex set of amendments, although they do hang together.
</p>

<a name="40719-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>The noble Lord asked about interim liquidity. Amendment No. 192 sought to treat the appointment of a provisional liquidator as the first insolvency event. The court can appoint a provisional liquidator on or after the presentation of a petition for winding up&#151;usually because it is satisfied that the company&#039;s assets may be in jeopardy and that a provisional liquidator should be appointed to seek to secure its assets pending the hearing of a petition. Those appointments have not been included as an insolvency event because they are interim measures pending the hearing of a winding-up petition. At that hearing, the court may make a winding-up order, which we have already included as an insolvency event, but it may also decide not to make a winding-up order. In that case, we do not want to proceed down the route of an insolvency event where that is not required. That situation seems rather more straightforward than the previous set of issues that we have discussed.

The Bill currently provides a definition of scheme rules at Clause 142(7) and repeats this definition in Schedule 7, paragraph 32(2). The definition is intended to ensure that where references are made to scheme rules that means, logically enough, the scheme&#039;s rules&#151;this is the discussion we had earlier about the difference between the rules of a scheme and scheme rules. It also includes any overriding statutory provisions which the scheme rules do not contain but ought to contain in order to comply with statutory requirements, for example, the requirement for equal treatment for people on maternity, paternity and adoption leave, and so on.

</p>

<a name="40719-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>We are clarifying the language throughout so that the rules of the scheme refer to the particular scheme and the scheme rules are those rules as modified by other statutory provisions, such as equal rights to paternity <br>&nbsp;<br>

and maternity pay. I could go on. Again, I am very happy, if Members of the Committee wish, to circulate a detailed description of what each amendment does, but basically that is what they do through the Bill. I am in the Committee&#039;s hands again.

<a name="40719-37_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   As I understand it, what is proposed is to deal with the eligible scheme&#039;s members according to the scheme&#039;s rules; that is, the rules of the scheme that is being taken over.

I am puzzled about why the Government need to define the scheme&#039;s rules at all. Perhaps I have misunderstood the difference between the scheme rules, which I take to be the rules of the&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="40719-37_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   It is precisely because one phrase, &quot;scheme rules&quot;, could be used to embrace both the existing legacy of individual scheme rules and the rules that will apply when going into the PPF. The individual scheme rules are overridden by statutory requirements. For example, PPF compensation is based on entitlement under scheme rules. If scheme rules do not include the statutory requirements for, say, limited price indexation, then PPF compensation would not reflect the minimum LPI entitlement set out in legislation. That would clearly be contrary to our policy intent.
</p>

<a name="40719-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>What we are saying here is that the rules of the scheme are the legacy of the individual schemes, which may all   have different rules. The &quot;scheme rules&quot; are the compound of those, modified by statutory provisions which apply across the board. The noble Lord will recall our discussion much earlier on about the &quot;rules of law&quot;. I said that this would not refer to <i>habeas corpus</i>. This concerns matters such as equal pay directives, the right to transfer to schemes, to maternity provisions and so forth. Some of the smaller schemes might not have embraced all these issues, but now they need to do so. We are making the distinction all the time between the rules of the scheme&#151;the individual scheme&#151;and the scheme rules, which are those modified by statutory changes.
</p>

<a name="40719-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>Turning to the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, I think that it was because we were advised that confusion could result if we did not make the distinction. As a result, people will know that there is a difference between the rules of the individual scheme&#151;in some cases almost a legacy structure&#151;and the scheme rules, which are those rules as modified by overriding requirements.
</p>




<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="40719-37_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I am still not sure that I understand it. Clearly we need to change the terminology because I do not think that it could be much worse. Perhaps those are famous last words.
</p>

<a name="40719-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>We have the rules of the existing scheme which is being taken over. Perhaps, as the noble Baroness has done, we should call those the &quot;legacy scheme rules&quot;. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC45"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC45</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

But what are the other scheme rules? Are they the rules of the scheme as amended by the fact that, for example, it will be 90 per cent rather than 100 per cent and so forth? I understand the legacy scheme rules&#151;they are the rules of the scheme being taken over, but I am not clear about the other scheme rules.
</p>




<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="40719-37_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Let me try again. When a scheme comes into the PPF it will be expected to observe the requirements of the legislation. For various reasons, some legacy schemes do not do so. When such a scheme comes into the PPF, we will seek as far as possible and with a broad brush to protect the structure of benefits which the scheme members and the employer have contracted together and bought. I cite, for example, spousal payments, which would continue under the PPF. If the rules of the original scheme allow for payments to be made to surviving opposite sex partners then, given the European directive, they would also apply to same sex partners and that right will continue to be exercised and protected in the PPF. Within the PPF, some members will have no rights for partners while others will because of the legacy rules.
</p>

<a name="40719-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>The legacy rules may say, for example, that payments can be made to a spouse, but would not say that they can be made to a civil partner. However, when that scheme comes into the PPF, because subsequent legislation has been passed since the date of the rules of the scheme, those payments would apply to civil partners as well. That is my understanding of what is intended here: to try to keep clear the distinction between the legacy rules of the scheme and the fact that when such a scheme comes into the PPF, while some benefits will remain distinct to the scheme, they will nonetheless conform to legislation which now applies to all schemes. That is the purpose and why we are making the distinction between the rules of an individual scheme and the scheme rules, which are those rules of the scheme as modified by subsequent legislation.

Amendment No. 193 would delete subsection (5), on a probing basis. The question posed by the amendment is why we have this paper chase. A subsection (5) notice will come into play only if the regulator becomes aware of the employer being unlikely to continue as a going concern. The pension protection fund then has to tell the trustees, managers and employers. That raises the question of how we are expecting the PPF to work. Will it sit in a sort of ivory tower, isolated from employers and trustees, so that its decisions come as something of a surprise; or will there be some real engagement&#151;in which case, what is the <br>&nbsp;<br>

necessity for the paper chase? Could a notice be issued where an employer had no prior knowledge? That seems to me to be quite unusual.
</p>

<a name="40719-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>Amendment No. 204, which is to Clause 137, relating to binding valuations, adds the regulator to the list of those who should be informed under subsection (3). As I understand it&#151;I may be wrong&#151;the regulator does not cease to be interested in a scheme simply because it falls within the ambit of the pension protection fund. Surely something as significant as the binding valuation ought to be notified to the regulator.
</p>

<a name="40719-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Amendment No. 207 would require the pension protection fund to tell the employer if the fund has assumed responsibility, following reconsideration under Clause 143. We tabled that amendment as a way to tease out when the employer should be informed and when the employer will be ignored. It is currently ignored in Clause 143, but employers are mentioned in Clause 121 and, for example, in Clause 140, covering when the scheme ceases to fall within the pension protection fund. I am sure that there are further references. So the amendment is trying to tease out whether there is a coherent pattern of information given to the employer. That is probably enough for today, and I shall leave Amendment No. 214 for another day. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="40719-38_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   I do not propose to speak to it today, but I shall consider what the noble Baroness says about the other amendments and decide whether to return to it or to leave it to another day.

<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="40719-38_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Then I shall try to respond to her points about Amendments Nos. 193, 204 and 207. Amendment No. 193 relates to Clause 121, which provides for the trustees or managers of the scheme whose sponsoring employer is unlikely to continue as a going concern but is not subject to insolvency events, as defined in Clause 115, so that no   event can trigger an assessment period in the usual way, to apply to the board of the PPF for it to assume responsibility for the scheme. Examples include some public sector schemes without a Crown guarantee or schemes with a foreign sponsoring employer.
</p>

<a name="40719-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The clause also provides that where the regulator is aware that the sponsoring employer of such a scheme is unlikely to continue as a going concern, it is given notice to the board to that effect. Once such a notice has been received by the board, subsection (5) imposes an obligation on the board to notify the trustees or managers of the scheme and the sponsoring employer of the notice. Given that the assessment period begins when the board receives such a notice from the regulator, it is vital that the trustees and managers of the scheme and the sponsoring employer are notified immediately.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC48"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC48</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40719-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>If the trustees and managers are unaware that the assessment period has begun&#151;although I agree with the noble Baroness that it might be an unusual occurrence&#151;we could hardly expect them to comply with all the controls that have been designed to protect the scheme and members&#039; interests during the assessment period. So that is possibly a belt-and-braces approach, but nevertheless, it seems important if we are to have a reliable paper audit. That includes their obligation to reduce members&#039; benefits payable to the PPF level of compensation.
</p>

<a name="40719-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>The amendment would therefore remove the vital requirement on the board to keep trustees and managers of the scheme and the sponsoring employer informed of the important events that can initiate the assessment period.
</p>

<a name="40719-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Amendment No. 204 relates to Clause 137, which sets out certain provisions relating to the valuation of a scheme&#039;s assets and protected liabilities. In particular, Clause 137 states when the valuation obtained under Clause 135 becomes binding. Amendment No. 204 would require the board to issue a copy of the binding valuation obtained in conjunction with Clauses 135 and 136 to the regulator.
</p>

<a name="40719-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>The purpose of the valuation obtained under Clause 135 is to enable the board to determine whether a scheme requires PPF assistance. Once the valuation has been undertaken and the board is satisfied with it, it must approve it. At that point, a copy of the approved valuation is issued to the trustees or manager of the scheme, the insolvency practitioner and the regulator, as set out in Clause 136. Following that, it becomes binding.
</p>

<a name="40719-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>The amendment would require the board to issue a copy of the binding valuation to the regulator. I accept the amendment in principle, but it is not required because government Amendment No. 203E has been tabled, which has exactly the same effect. The noble Baroness is exactly right; but we are running in parallel.
</p>

<a name="40719-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>Amendment No. 207 would impose a duty on the board to send a copy of the determination notice provided for in Clause 143(2) to the employer. I could go on, but, at that stage, there is no sponsoring employer to send it to. If the noble Baroness would like me to expand on that point, I am happy to do so.

</p>




<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="40719-39_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   We enter a series of clauses in which, as I understand it, the application for an eligible scheme to be taken over can be done in different ways. Under Clause 121, if the trustees or the manager become aware that the employer is unlikely to continue as a going concern and the prescribed requirements, of which we are unaware, are met, they should apply to the board to take over.
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="40719-39_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Perhaps I can help the noble Lord. This may be another case where the Explanatory Notes could have been more helpful; I do not know&#151;I have not looked at the note to this clause. We do not expect that duty to be relevant to most schemes, as it is imposed only on the trustees of those schemes that are not subject to insolvency events as defined in Clause 115. I mentioned that in passing just now, but examples would include public sector schemes without a Crown guarantee&#151;such as the Arts Council scheme, as opposed to that for local authorities&#151;and schemes with a foreign sponsoring employer. That is why we need the procedure.
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="40719-39_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   So an application can be made or a scheme can become eligible if there is an insolvency event. As I understand it, under Clause 121, the scheme can become an eligible scheme if the trustees or the managers apply for it to be effectively taken over.
</p>




<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="40719-39_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   It is where employers will not be subject to insolvency events, such as in the case of the Arts Council.
</p>




<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="40719-39_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I am unfamiliar with the Arts Council scheme. But when the noble Baroness talks about an overseas employer, I am especially concerned. As we know from earlier exchanges, we are worried about circumstances such as when a Japanese bank reneged on its commitments to its employees in the UK.
</p>

<a name="40719-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Let me try again. As I understand it, there are various routes under different clauses whereby a scheme may become eligible. One is an insolvency circumstance. Clearly, there are several other ways to become eligible. Perhaps it would be helpful if the noble Baroness would tell us what are the alternative routes, other than insolvency.

<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="40719-39_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   As the noble Lord will know, a scheme will come into the PPF if it meets two conditions. One is that the employer is insolvent; the second is that the pension scheme does not have sufficient assets to wind it up in such a way that it can meet its obligations. Both of those conditions must be fulfilled. We dealt with some of the concerns associated with this about moral hazard when we discussed Clauses 39 to 45, and what counts as a scheme rescue and what counts as manipulation in order to dump liabilities.

</p>

<a name="40719-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>This provision concerns the fact that there are some schemes where there is no employer who can fall within the triggering insolvency event to start the assessment period. Therefore, the clause is not to do with the eligibility of a scheme to enter the PPF but with what will trigger the start of the assessment period. The clause states that there is a duty on the trustees of such schemes to apply to the PPF for the board to assume responsibility for the scheme.
</p>




<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="40719-39_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   Clause 121 is drawn in broad terms. It does not appear to be confined to those companies for which an insolvency event could not be triggered. It seems to be drafted to cover the whole universe of pension schemes because it contains no limiting words. So it appears that one can enter the process either through an insolvency event or through someone thinking that the company is no longer a going concern. Some of my later amendments are predicated on that being the case.
</p>




<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="40719-39_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   In that case, I can only apologise to the noble Baroness, because that is not what is intended. The prescribed requirements under the Bill will be where employers are not subject to insolvency events. If they are, as set out in Clause 115, the only way that an assessment period can start is through an insolvency practitioner&#039;s notice as described in Clause 114.
</p>

<a name="40719-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>This clause provides for where there is no employer subject to an insolvency event but where the scheme none the less should arrive in the PPF. It is a question of what triggers that assessment period to decide whether it should indeed arrive in the PPF. The trustees or managers may trigger that, but it is not a new route for the vast majority of schemes, which are subject to an insolvency event. It just provides for a shopping list of some slightly odd companies or bodies for which there is no employer in a conventional sense to be subject to an insolvency event and where, therefore, the trustees and managers, where that scheme may need to come within the PPF, can apply to enter the assessment period to see whether it should.

</p>

<a name="40719-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>There would seem to be various routes by which a scheme can become an &quot;eligible&quot; scheme. One is through the insolvency route and we discussed that in considerable detail. It would appear from Clause 121 that it can also come by a different route; namely, the trustees or managers of a scheme which is to become eligible become aware that the employer is not going to continue and that prescribed requirements are met in relation to the employer.
</p>

<a name="40719-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>I understand from the Minister that those prescribed requirements, of which we on this side of the Committee are totally unaware, are that it cannot have followed the other route. It cannot have become an eligible scheme because it became insolvent. If so, one would have thought that that ought to be clear at the beginning of Clause 121. It ought to say that where there is a concern that the employer is not going to continue as a going concern and that the scheme has not become eligible because it has become insolvent.

<a name="40719-39_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   That is my understanding. We expect that, in the vast majority of cases, the assessment period which could result in schemes coming into the PPF is triggered by an insolvency event on the employer. The assessment period is then used to determine not only that that is legit&#151;in other words, that it is not a manipulation&#151;but that assets and liabilities can be bound up and so forth.

</p>

<a name="40719-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>The two categories which we have in mind where a scheme could end up in the PPF but has not come via the insolvency route into assessment, but by another route, is where the trustees and managers have a duty to make the application. They include two broad categories of scheme. The first comprises the public sector schemes without a Crown guarantee. I have given the Arts Council, but the category includes the Audit Commission, the British Tourist Authority, British Waterways, the Crown Estate, the Design Council, English Partnerships, Investors in People, the Meat and Livestock Commission, the National Board for Midwifery, Remploy, Scottish Enterprise, the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve Association, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy and the Wine Standards Board. That is not an exhaustive list, but Members of the Committee can see the type of schemes to which we are referring.
</p>

<a name="40719-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>The second category is those schemes with a foreign employer. When we adjourned, I was being asked for an example of that. The advice I have been given is that an example of an overseas company would be one that is not subject to an insolvency event as defined in Clause 115 but which has employees in the UK and a UK-registered pension scheme. If the trustee or regulator became aware that the company is shutting down leaving the pension scheme under-funded, they can apply or notify the board. Without this clause, such schemes would not be able to initiate the assessment period because there is no insolvency event and members would not receive PPF protection. Indeed, it is almost like a branch of an overseas company.

number of commitments which we warmly welcome. However, I have become slightly out of kilter in my understanding of what is to happen now. When the Grand Committee adjourns later today, we will not meet again until Tuesday 7 September. I do not know whether it will be for the convenience of all Members of the Committee, but it would be helpful for me if the Minister could set out a timetable to which she will work as regards the various commitments, the rewriting of clauses and the consultations she has promised she will enter into.

<a name="40719-40_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I do not want any misunderstanding to arise. I am not making any commitment whatever to the redrafting of this clause, rather I am trying to take seriously on board areas which are either of concern or perhaps confusion to Members opposite because of the drafting. I shall see whether there is anything to be done, or whether anything should be done. That is all. Obviously, those Members opposite who have been in government in the past and have stood at the Dispatch Box will know that Ministers look over the procedures of Committee sittings to see where there were hesitations, problems and difficulties, to examine what triggered those and to consider whether the drafting of a Bill is correct, whether the supporting information provided was inadequate and so forth.
</p>

<a name="40719-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>All I am saying is that I will look to see whether there is anything to be done. I make no commitment either way and it is my expectation that there will be no movement on the drafting. I say that because this has been elaborately negotiated through parliamentary counsel. But it concerns me if experienced Members of the Opposition find the drafting obscure. If there is anything I can do to help in that, I shall seek to do so.

<a name="40719-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>I turn to the point about our work over the summer. I have already given an undertaking that before we move on to the Report stage&#151;and by September, I hope&#151;we may be in a position to say where we are going on the moral hazard clauses. But that will depend on whether and to what extent there is a meeting of minds with the organisations with which we are consulting to see whether we can overcome the problems. Associated with that, as the noble Lord will recall, we are trying to achieve greater clarity on how the clearance procedure will work. That is pivotal to drawing the distinction between good faith and manipulation, if you like. Again, further work needs to be done on that.
</p>

<a name="40719-40_para4"></a>

<p><a name="st_169"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment. It is intended to discover what happens to scheme members while there is an assessment period. The amendment does this by removing the word &quot;No&quot; as the first word of subsection (5), so that it reads:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;benefits may accrue under the scheme&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40719-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>An assessment period can apply to an employer under Clause 121 when someone thinks that the employer will not continue as a going concern. When we discussed that, we established that three would be relatively few potential employers in that category, but some could be prescribed. If there is an example of a question mark over &quot;going concern&quot;, it is likely that all the employees are still working normally, being paid their wages and expecting to accrue benefits for length of service, pay increases or changes in personal circumstances. Can the Minister therefore explain why employees suffer because someone believes that the employer might not be a going concern?
</p>

<a name="40719-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>A going-concern evaluation can be complex and not at all self-evident. If that is the case, should there not be an obligation to tell employees that their pension accruals are on hold because someone is looking at the going-concern nature of their employer?

</p>

<a name="40719-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>Can the Minister also explain the relationship between subsection (6) and subsection (5)? Subsection (6) seems to say that subsection (5) does not prevent an increase in benefits. I am unclear as to the net effect of the two. While she is explaining that, perhaps she can also explain why the draftsman has chosen to enclose the words &quot;in a   benefit&quot; in commas. I find it difficult to read subsection   (6). We referred earlier to the parliamentary draftsman&#039;s commaphobia and there was a recommendation that he be given a copy of Lynne Truss&#039;s excellent book. In subsection (6), some stray commas could benefit from being removed if the provision is to be read with sense. I beg to move.

<a name="40719-41_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Amendment No. 194 seeks to allow benefits to accrue to or in respect of scheme members during the assessment period. I can understand that this is a probing amendment.

PPF   assume responsibility for the scheme. We have decided to reduce the amount of compensation payable to scheme members during the assessment period to ensure that the funding position of the scheme remains stable and that schemes in the assessment period are treated consistently and fairly. Otherwise, some schemes that took a long time to go through the assessment period would be building up benefits at a higher rate than others that had gone through the assessment period quicker.
</p>

<a name="40719-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>There are also some important reasons why we consider it necessary to limit the accrual of benefits during this time to inflation levels. The first is to keep the funding position of the scheme as stable as possible during the assessment period. Secondly, given that the assets and liabilities of the scheme are assessed at the assessment date and that it is on this basis that the PPF may eventually assume responsibility for a scheme, there seems little point in allowing benefits to accrue to members during this period as any benefits that did accrue would be disregarded. However, in the event of a scheme rescue employees can subsequently backdate their pension accruals to the start of the assessment period. There will be an override on issues such as indexation. Apart from that, this amendment is to make sure that scheme members do not perversely benefit from a long assessment period compared to a shorter assessment period. That is the push.

scheme. Amendment No. 230A introduces a new sub-paragraph (b) to paragraph 27 of Schedule 7, &quot;annual increase in periodic compensation&quot;. It refers to pensionable service which is notional service allowed in respect of the member under the admissible rules, which qualifies the member for benefits.

<p><a name="st_180"></a>The noble Baroness said: In introducing this amendment, I shall speak to the related amendments. They enable the PPF to comply with court orders for ancillary relief made following divorce or annulment of marriage. Members of the Committee will remember that I was responding to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, to say what the major groups of amendments were. This was one of them simply because the original pension sharing/pension earmarking had not contemplated the situation of a PPF and, if we did not make these amendments, spouses who might otherwise have received a pension would have been able to receive only that element available pre-PPF compensation. These amendments ensure that that is properly taken into account as a matrimonial asset.
</p>

<a name="40719-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>In determining the financial settlement on divorce or annulment, the court may make an attachment order, a commutation order or a pension sharing order. The attachment and commutation orders are for separation&#151;

</p>




<p><a name="st_182"></a>
<a name="40719-41_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   All right. Where there is an attachment order, it will be the responsibility of the trustees of the pension scheme to make payments of a specified amount out of the pension when it becomes payable direct to the former spouse on behalf of the member. The member may also be required to commute, or convert to a lump sum, part of the pension payable from the pension arrangements. The trustees are also responsible for discharging liability for pension sharing orders.
</p>

<a name="40719-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>These amendments ensure that any attachment orders made during the assessment period can be implemented by the board. They also ensure that if a pension sharing order is implemented during the assessment period, the pension debit can be created and the pension credit&#151;we mean the element which belongs to the spouse, who is divorced in pension terms&#151;and the pension credit deposited in a suitable pension arrangement on behalf of the former spouse or held in the pension scheme.
</p>

<a name="40719-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The trustees will be able to discharge their liability for these orders under the provisions of existing legislation as the orders will be made against the pension scheme. However, there may be occasions when circumstances will prevent the trustees discharging their liability for a pension credit before the end of the assessment period.
</p>

<a name="40719-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>We have ensured that even though the scheme has entered the PPF, the board will be able to implement a pension sharing order made before the end of the assessment period. It will become the responsibility of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC59"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column GC59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the PPF board to ensure that the pension sharing order is discharged against PPF compensation. The PPF will honour the pension sharing order by reducing the member&#039;s compensation by the percentage ordered by the court. An amount of compensation, equivalent to the member&#039;s reduction, will be retained within the PPF and will be payable to the former spouse. The big difference is that both blocks are held within the PPF, whereas if the scheme is not going to the PPF the spouse receiving a share of the pension will take it out into another scheme. Only rarely would the trustees allow it to stay in.
</p>

<a name="40719-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>The former spouse will not be able to choose to have the credit deposited in another pension scheme as the PPF does not provide for external transfers after a scheme has entered the PPF. However, the former spouse will be entitled to the same protection as a scheme member and will become entitled to payment of compensation from the scheme&#039;s normal benefit age. Compensation will be payable for life.

</p>

<a name="40719-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Regulations within the new clause will ensure that the trustees&#039; liability for discharging pension sharing orders will be transferred to the PPF board. The regulations will modify some of the provisions of the existing legislation to allow the PPF board to implement any orders which have been made before the end of the assessment period but not implemented by the trustees.
</p>

<a name="40719-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>We then modify other legislation. Many of the subsequent clauses relate to other legislation such as the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 and the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 to ensure that the provision applies. I hope that I have described the purpose of these amendments: to make the moneys in the PPF available for pension-sharing. I beg to move.

<a name="40719-42_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   It is not very satisfactory to introduce such a complex amendment at this stage in the Bill. It was difficult to follow what the noble Baroness was saying. We had not previously turned our minds to such issues as divorce and were therefore unable to catch up at this stage.

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>The only query that occurred to me was whether the provision had implications for the Child Support Agency.

ago. Therefore the best thing would be to let the matter go and to table an amendment to clarify the situation, if necessary, at a later stage.
</p>




<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="40719-42_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   These are government amendments but I had thought that Members of the Committee received a copy of the description that I was reading out so that their comprehension would not depend on the acoustics of the room, which I agree are unfortunate. I accept that the amendments are technical. I had hoped that with the arrangement that I suggested before the Committee started&#151;that where we were dealing with a large batch of government amendments I would try to be helpful by giving a copy of my speaking note to Members opposite&#151;the noble Lord would have been able to follow what I was saying, even if he could not hear every word by virtue of the acoustics or my speed.
</p>

<a name="40719-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>The noble Lord says that the situation is unsatisfactory. In an ideal world, your Lordships would be redundant because Bills coming from the Commons would be so polished and ready that we would not need to make amendments. The point is that pension-sharing on divorce is extremely technical. Having been intimately involved with others in your Lordships&#039; House in getting the Bill through in the first place, I genuinely thought that the drafting would be so complex that we would not be able to get it into this Bill at any stage, with perhaps only a gesture at Third Reading. The officials and the draftsmen have gone to enormous lengths to include these clauses because I felt, as did others&#151;I am sure that noble Lords will agree&#151;that when a pension, even with a lower value coming through the compensation of the PPF, could be the most significant piece of matrimonial property along with the house, it would be unreasonable and indecent to exclude it from a consideration of the separation of matrimonial assets on divorce simply because it was caught by the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40719-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>If we had not done it in that way, anyone who got divorced where the pension fund was secure would have it included; but anyone getting divorced where the pension fund was not secure, was entering an assessment period and, eventually, into the PPF fund would be denied access to a substantial swathe of matrimonial property, even though the value of that pension had been discounted because payments made under the PPF would be 10 per cent less than if the scheme had persisted. What would Members of the Committee have done in that dilemma? They would have done what I have done, which is table the amendments today, although they are extremely complex and, as I said, officials have worked around the clock to prepare them, to ensure that, under pension sharing both spouses will continue to receive an appropriate share of the pensioner&#039;s matrimonial property as ordained by the court. They may not do so. They may instead offset the house against the pension, but if they do, it would be quite wrong and, in my view, indecent to exclude what will be a substantial asset, even after the top-slicing when entering the PPF, because the scheme had entered the PPF.

</p>

<a name="40719-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>I hope that I can answer the particular point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. If an order has been made by the court before the end of the assessment period, the order will be honoured by the   PPF when the board assumes responsibility for the scheme. An order cannot take effect until divorce proceedings are complete and a decree absolute has been granted. I hope that I have been able to give the noble Baroness the assurance that she wants.
</p>




<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="40719-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   We realise that the noble Baroness feels strongly about this on a personal basis. The fact is that when she stands up and tells us herself what it is all about, it is so much easier to understand than when she reads out an incomprehensible government brief. So we are grateful to her for that further explanation. Perhaps we should dispense with the government briefs and just let the noble Baroness tell us what the Bill is about.
</p>

<a name="40719-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Having said that, no doubt we shall adjourn imminently and continue our discussion during the Recess. I shall add only one point about that.

find the Moses Room unbelievably depressing, especially for a discussion of this sort of complexity. The powers that be will need to consider in September whether this House is a legislature or a building site. They cannot have it both ways. When we used to have emergency recalls in September because World War Three was about to break out, one could understand why we came back and why building work was still going on. But if it is to be a regular event in September, we cannot have building reconstruction going on at the same time.

<a name="40719-42_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Criminal Justice: Strategic Plan 2004&#150;08</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="40719-42_spmin0"></a><b>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </b>  Earlier today, the Government published Command Paper 6288, entitled <i>Cutting Crime&#151;Delivering Justice: Strategic Plan for Criminal Justice 2004&#150;08</i>. Copies of the paper have been placed in the Library of the House.
</p>

<a name="40719-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>The strategic plan for criminal justice sets out the Government&#039;s vision for the criminal justice system (CJS) and how we aim to achieve it, combining forces across the Home Office, the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the law officers&#039; departments.
</p>

<a name="40719-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The plan focuses on how we will provide a better service to victims and witnesses of crime, increase the number of offences brought to justice, tackle offenders who fail to comply with court dates, fines and sentences and improve the way criminal justice agencies work together. This is closely linked to our overall approach to preventing crime and reducing reoffending, which is set out in a parallel document, the Home Office strategic plan.
</p>

<a name="40719-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>The Government are committed to ongoing reform of the criminal justice system. The CJS strategic plan explains how much has already been achieved: huge steps have been made to establish joint working across the CJS&#151;largely through the success of the 42 local criminal justice boards across England and Wales and the strong leadership of the National Criminal Justice Board. We know these changes are working because we are seeing improvements on the ground. Overall, crime is down by 25 per cent since 1997. Seven per cent more offences are being brought to justice in the past two years. The number of Crown Court trials that fail to go ahead on the day scheduled has fallen by 25 per cent. The number of assets recovered in the past three years has doubled. Public confidence in criminal justice was falling sharply: we have turned this around.
</p>

<a name="40719-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>We have achieved a great deal, but there are still some real issues to tackle. The CJS strategic plan outlines our key objectives for reform, structured around a vision of the delivery of criminal justice in 2008. To achieve this vision, we need to improve the way agencies work together to support and protect victims and witnesses; we need to increase further the number of offenders brought to justice; we need to tackle offenders who fail to comply with court dates, fines and sentences; and we need to continue progress towards fully joined-up working, including providing the CJS with the information technology it needs to work effectively.
</p>

<a name="40719-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>The goal of these reforms is to deliver a service that responds better to the needs of the communities it is there to serve.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS2"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column WS2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40719-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>Improved service for victims and witnesses is at the heart of this. By the end of next year, in all cases where someone is charged with an offence, the victims and witnesses will be offered support by a witness care unit, to make it more likely that they attend court and give evidence. Over the period, Crown Court buildings will have separate waiting facilities for prosecution and defence victims and witnesses. The Victims Fund, which will pay for better support services for victims, will also be boosted by a surcharge on all criminals who are convicted.
</p>

<a name="40719-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>The public also need to know that the offenders will be brought to book and respect for the law will be maintained. The CJS strategic plan sets out how the prosecution will take responsibility for charging, co-operating earlier with the police to identify the correct charge for the offence. It also describes innovative measures to crack down on those who fail to turn up at court or comply with fines and community penalties. Those who breach bail can now expect action to be taken straight away, and to be punished for this whatever the decision on the original case. We are working hard to make sure that every offender who defaults on their fine is pursued and made to pay it. With our measures on asset recovery it will be the criminal who pays, not the community. Our approach includes: increased powers for frontline enforcement staff including search and entry, and new measures and sanctions from the Courts Act 2003 to help to recoup fines, including attachment of earnings and deduction of state benefits, and car clamping. By rolling out direct access to the police national computer (PNC) for all magistrates&#039; courts by autumn 2004, we will enable police officers to identify whether an offender is on the run from court or defaulting on a fine or community sentence.

</p>

<a name="40719-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>We will also pilot the community justice centre concept in north Liverpool, bringing new approaches to tackle the low level crime and anti-social behaviour which can make communal life miserable; and to reach offenders and their problems before they progress to serious crime. Court sentences will combine punishment with support to help offenders to kick their crime habit. The community will be involved in helping to steer people away from crime.

</p>

<a name="40719-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>To achieve all these goals we need to work in close partnership across the justice system. The development of the National Criminal Justice Board and local criminal justice boards has made great strides in delivering a more seamless service and better outcomes. To build on this, we are announcing today that, in future, joint working across the CJS will be further strengthened by the establishment of the Office for Criminal Justice Reform on a cross-departmental basis. This implements the recommendations of a recent review of CJS capacity published in a parallel document, <i>Criminal Justice Reform: Working Together</i>. This means that the teams driving progress on shared CJS targets will in future report on an equal   basis to the Home Office, Department for Constitutional Affairs and the law officers&#039; departments. Establishing the Office for Criminal Justice Reform as a shared resource serving all three departments builds on the firm foundations of what we <br>&nbsp;<br>

have achieved, and is a powerful symbol of our resolve to work together effectively to deliver better services for the public.

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="40719-43_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Bach): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Geoffrey Hoon) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.

</p>

<a name="40719-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>I am pleased to announce that we have decided to extend the future aircraft carrier (CVF) programme assessment phase. This extension will enable us to carry out further risk reduction work and increase the maturity of the design prior to making our main investment decision on demonstration and manufacture (D&M). In line with Smart acquisition principles by spending the right amount of time and money in the assessment phase, we will gain a better understanding of the technical and   supply-side risks before we make any major commitments. We had planned to complete this risk reduction work within the original demonstration phase. The underlying programme has not been adjusted, but rather the point at which we make the main investment decision has shifted.
</p>

<a name="40719-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>We anticipate moving into the D&M phase during 2005, following the main gate decision. At this point we intend to finalise performance, time and cost parameters of the carriers. These will continue to be refined during the remainder of the assessment phase. Our target in-service dates (ISD) for the CVF remain 2012 and 2015. When built, the two vessels will be the <br>&nbsp;<br>

largest and most powerful warships ever constructed in the United Kingdom.

<a name="40719-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>We have also agreed the alliancing principles with industry for the CVF programme which confirms the commitment of all parties to the programme and to an alliance based on commercial best practice. The alliancing principles will provide the most effective way of managing risk and reward and will bring together all parties with a vested financial interest, thus ensuring that we deliver CVF collaboratively. We will now discuss and agree the detailed alliancing arrangements with industry, including the roles and responsibilities of alliance members.

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="40719-43_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40719-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>As part of the Government&#039;s continuing commitment to investigate Gulf veterans&#039; illnesses openly and honestly, data on the mortality of veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict are regularly published. The most recent figures for the period 1 April 1991 to 30 June 2004, were published on 14 July 2004. The tables from that publication are set out below. Table 1 gives the causes of death to UK Gulf veterans over that period; table 2 shows the deaths due to malignant cancers among Gulf veterans. As with previous information, the data for Gulf veterans are compared with those of a control group known as the era cohort which is made up of Armed Forces personnel of a similar age, gender, service, regular/reservist status and rank who were not deployed to the Gulf.
</p>

<a name="40719-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>Key points to note are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>there were 663 deaths among Gulf veterans up to 30 June 2004 compared to 675 in the era comparison group; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>approximately 1,032 deaths would have been expected in a similar sized group taken from the general population of the UK with the same age and gender profile.

<a name="40719-44_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40719-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>I have today laid before the House a copy of the Planning Inspectorate&#039;s annual report and accounts for 2003&#150;04.
</p>

<a name="40719-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>The report gives an overview of the performance of the inspectorate and highlights the ways in which it is contributing to the Government&#039;s planning reform agenda. It demonstrates the importance of a credible, accessible planning tribunal service which is open, transparent and impartial.

<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="40719-44_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40719-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>My right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister is today publishing the alterations to chapter 12 of the regional planning guidance for the south-east on the Ashford growth area. This follows the public examination into the draft alterations in December 2003, the panel report in February 2004 and the consultation on the Secretary of State&#039;s proposed changes that closed on 17 June 2004.

</p>

<a name="40719-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The alterations represent a revision to the regional planning guidance for the south-east (RPG9), as published in March 2001. On commencement of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act the alterations will be part of a statutory regional special strategy (RSS).
</p>

<a name="40719-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>The alterations aim to achieve sustainable growth in Ashford, which was identified as a growth area in RPG9. They set out the scale and form of development at Ashford to 2016, and form a special framework for the preparation of local planning documents and other relevant policy documents.
</p>

<a name="40719-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>The consultation period for the proposed changes to the draft alterations ended on the 17 June with 40 responses from individuals or organisations. These mainly related to issues which had already been raised at the public examination and therefore only minor changes to the proposed alterations have been made.

This will be a cross-governmental body, with ministerial representation, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS8"></a>

<b>19 Jul 2004 : Column WS8</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and jointly chaired by me and my right honourable friend the Minister for the Arts (Estelle Morris), who is making a similar Statement to the House of Commons. I am pleased to say that there will also be strong representation from the private sector, both from the creative industries themselves and from other key industry stakeholders such as Internet service providers and hardware manufacturers. Consumers will also be represented.

</p>

<a name="40719-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>The forum will be a chance for a dialogue on intellectual property issues, such as business models, education and awareness raising, strategies for maximising the opportunities for the creative industries in a digital environment, while also addressing the challenges such as file-sharing and piracy.
</p>

<a name="40719-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>The launch and first meeting of the forum is taking place on 19 July at the London College of Communication, Elephant and Castle. Industry has warmly welcomed the initiative.
</p>

<a name="40719-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>It is anticipated that the forum will work through meetings that will set tasks and objectives to be taken forward. There is intended to be a focus on outputs and deliverables, and I am confident that this will represent a significant development in an area crucial to the UK&#039;s future competitiveness.
</p>

<a name="40719-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>Terms of reference and membership of the forum will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses shortly.

<p><a name="wms_st_8"></a>
<a name="40719-44_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Nigel Griffiths) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40719-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>The department will be placing the figures for the United Kingdom&#039;s stocks of civil plutonium and uranium as at 31 December 2003 in the Library of the House. In accordance with our commitment under the <i>Guidelines for the Management of Plutonium</i>, we will also be sending the figures to the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who will circulate them to member states in due course. The figures will be available on the department&#039;s and the IAEA&#039;s websites.
</p>

<a name="40719-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>The figures show that stocks of unirradiated plutonium in the UK totalled 96.3 tonnes at the end of 2003. Changes from the corresponding figures for 2002 are a consequence of continuing reprocessing operations (e.g. as reflected in the increased quantity of unirradiated separated plutonium in product stores at reprocessing plants). Other smaller changes are the result of material being allocated to UK fuel. The decrease in unirradiated separated plutonium held elsewhere is due to both Thorp and Magnox reprocessing plants being close to empty during December 2003 whereas they were operating over that period in the proceeding year. The decrease in the civil depleted, natural and low enriched uranium figures reflects the change in requirements for these materials at the fuel fabrication plants and reactors.</p>

<br>

The Community Foundation for Northern Ireland (formerly NIVT) also received &#163;1,123,324 through the EU Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (Peace I) which supported victims of violence. The foundation allocated these funds in support of a number of projects for both ex-offenders and victims. Persons from these groups could benefit from the same project and it is not possible to disaggregate the assistance between the two groups.<br>

The academy trust is a charitable trust set up by the sponsor which is responsible for the building and running of the academy. Should the academy close, ownership of the land and buildings would revert to the previous owner.

<p><a name="wa_st_12"></a>
<a name="40719w03_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 requires a local authority to obtain the consent of the Secretary of State for Education and Skills before either disposing, or changing the use, of any school playing field. Section 77 applies where the playing fields are used by a maintained school, or have been used for the purposes of such a school at any time during the preceding 10 years. Consent is not required, however, where the land in question, after the change of use, becomes used in connection with the provision, by a local authority, of educational facilities for a maintained school, or any recreational facilities. A local authority, therefore, may build permanent classrooms, install mobile classrooms or build an indoor leisure centre on playing fields without the need for consent.

<p><a name="wa_st_13"></a>
<a name="40719w03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 set out the minimum area of team game playing fields that local authorities should provide for schools. The minimum area of team game playing fields depends on the number and age range of pupils attending the school.
</p>

<a name="40719w03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a>In certain cases, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills can agree to relax the minimum standards but only under circumstances set out in Section 543 of the Education Act 1996. Briefly, these circumstances are:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_0"></a>(i)   where it would be unreasonable to require conformity because of the nature of the existing site;


</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_1"></a>(ii)   where there is a shortage of suitable sites;


</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_2"></a>(iii)   in order to control public expenditure where the school is to move to a new site, and


</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_3"></a>(iv)   where other sports facilities are available to the school; for example, leisure and sports centres, all-weather pitches and sports halls, etc.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="40719w03_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a>Schools that did not meet the minimum standard when the regulations were introduced were deemed to have an agreed relaxation to those standards. They must, however, apply for a further relaxation if they make any change to the size or layout of their team game playing fields. This means that even where there is a net increase in the size and range of sports pitches, schools still need to apply to have the standards relaxed if the new layout does not meet the minimum standards.
</p>

Its success will be judged as part of the wider programme of work set out in the Government&#039;s strategy for tackling alcohol related harm. We will also be collecting a range of data to measure success, such as the numbers of fixed penalty notices issued and the numbers of licensees selling to underage persons.

In addition to the lottery funding UK Sport invests into the WCPP.

<a name="40719w04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   We are not able to provide a breakdown for the 149 individual English library authorities, as this could only be prepared at disproportionate cost. The information, however, could be calculated from the CIPFA Public Library Statistics, which are available in the House Library. Total expenditure on public libraries in England (excluding capital payments & agency services and capital accounting) rose, in cash terms, from &#163;730.7 million in 2000&#150;01 to &#163;845.1 million in 2002&#150;03 (Source: <i>CIPFA Public Library Statistics (Actuals)</i>). This is an increase of 16 per cent compared to the retail prices index increase of 3.4 per cent for this period. Each local authority&#039;s performance at achieving value for money is reflected within its comprehensive performance assessment.

      Birmingham &#163;1,535

<a name="40719w04_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey:  </b>  The People&#039;s Network has linked all but a few of England&#039;s public libraries to the Internet. Recently published figures show that visits to public libraries in England in 2002&#150;03 (before the People&#039;s Network had been completed) increased to over 274 million, over 3 million more than in the previous year. The People&#039;s Network is one of a number of activities that are attracting more and new users, for example, increased reader development activity, but the timing suggests that the People&#039;s Network is making a major contribution.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_35"></a>What fisheries action plans have been established between the United Kingdom and neighbouring European Union countries to contain the number of cormorants; with what results; and how the United Kingdom action to control the growth in numbers compares with other European Union countries.

<p><a name="wa_st_35"></a>
<a name="40719w06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Whitty:  </b>  Fishery action plans (FAPs) have recently been initiated by the Environment Agency in England and Wales to provide a mechanism for fisheries development at the catchment scale (or wider), with the objective of maximising sustainable development of fisheries and associated ecological, social, economic and recreational benefits. FAPs seek to identify the main issues affecting fisheries, including bird predation, prioritise these and plan appropriate action. Such fishery action plans do not apply in the European Union.
</p>

<a name="40719w06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_29"></a>Cormorants are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which fulfils the UK&#039;s obligations under the EC Wild Birds Directive 79/409/EEC to conserve all wild birds. Results from earlier Defra-funded research on the impact of cormorants on inland fisheries support the view that this is a problem for specific fisheries rather than a general problem. Where such site-specific problems exist, licences can be granted to allow limited numbers of birds to be killed or taken as an aid to scaring. However, it must be shown that there is no other satisfactory alternative to the issuing of a licence. Nevertheless, the Government are currently looking into further measures to help resolve their conflict with fisheries.
</p>

<a name="40719w06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_30"></a>Similar provisions apply in many other European Union countries, although there is some variability in the number of birds that are killed. It is not possible to compare the effects of shooting between member states. The numbers of birds killed or taken under licence in each EU country are reported to the Commission annually.

<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_36"></a>Further to the statement by the Lord Whitty on 23 June (HL Deb, col. 1238) that &quot;In certain circumstances, wind farms actually enhance the landscape&quot;, whether they will set out the circumstances in which such enhancement occurs.  [HL3624]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_36"></a>
<a name="40719w06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   Increased development of renewable energy resources is vital to facilitating the delivery of the Government&#039;s commitments on both climate change and renewable energy.
</p>

<a name="40719w06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_31"></a>We recognise that the location of wind farms can sometimes be a sensitive issue. Our landscapes have always been influenced by ever-changing human activity. Buildings and other structures&#151;including, for example, traditional windmills and monuments&#151;have often been seen as enhancing the landscape and providing a point of interest. In some settings wind farms will be seen by many as aesthetically pleasing; in other less so.
</p>

<a name="40719w06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_32"></a>That is why the Government have ensured that there is clear guidance for planning authorities to follow. <i>Planning Policy Guidance Note 22: Renewable Energy</i> makes clear that local planning authorities should always assess and judge the merits of a planning application on a site-specific basis, including consideration of impacts on the landscape.

<p><a name="wa_st_37"></a>
<a name="40719w06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   Estimates for the environmental benefits of existing and additional measures including road transport measures proposed in the review of the national air quality strategy were published in January 1999 in <i>An economic analysis of the National Air Quality Strategy Objectives: An Interim Report</i>.

</p>

<a name="40719w06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_35"></a>The non-health impacts of vehicle emissions will vary from place to place and pollutant to pollutant. For instance, road transport makes a significant contribution to urban concentrations of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), varying between 70 and 90 per cent of annual mean concentrations at roadside locations and 50 to 71 per cent of NOx concentrations at urban background locations. These emissions will contribute to adverse effects on buildings, materials, terrestrial ecosystems, such as crops and forest, aquatic ecosystems and visibility, but the impacts have not been explicitly calculated. It should also be noted that it is very difficult to place an economic value on some of these impacts.
</p>

<a name="40719w06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_36"></a>Defra has commissioned a study to evaluate the Air Quality Strategy 2000 by assessing the effectiveness of selected air quality policies in the transport and electricity supply sectors, in terms of improvements to air quality and consequent health and other environmental benefits.
