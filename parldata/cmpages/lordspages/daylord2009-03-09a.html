In addition, we have been working with Sport England and others to develop guidance on the operation of the planning system to help sports clubs wanting to improve their facilities to navigate through the planning system. We are looking at what more can be done; for example, we are also hoping to review planning policy guidance note 17 <I>Planning for </I><I>O</I><I>pen </I><I>S</I><I>pace, </I><I>S</I><I>port and </I><I>R</I><I>ecreation</I> this summer.</p>

Sports clubs up and down the country will certainly welcome it. They have been seeking for many years to upgrade their facilities by simple initiatives such as putting in floodlights or better playing surfaces. They will certainly be heartened by the Minister&#146;s reply. Who is going to be involved in the appraisals and negotiations about enabling planning procedures to be improved and what is the timetable? This is a crisis; clubs are closing. When are the Government hoping to get these planning guidelines into place?</p>

She is right to press the Government on planning approvals. We are all aware that sports clubs with only voluntary assistance often have great difficulty in coping with the formalities of planning permission. We are hoping to get the guidance ready for the summer. It takes a few months. We have got full consultation in order to get all the parties involved, and we are optimistic that we will be able to present to sports clubs in the summer a clear strategy for dealing with planning permission.</p>

What more can our Government do to strengthen the links between sports clubs, which should properly receive these young people, and universities and schools where they have so enjoyed sport? Young people sometimes lack direction as to where they can continue sports into their 20s and 30s and beyond.</p>

The drop-out rate when children leave school is responsible for the deterioration in sporting activity among younger adults, which leads to attendant health problems and obesity issues that are linked to these matters. We have been concerned to link sports clubs more closely with schools. This is also critical to sport clubs, because they get the next generation of participants from young people. We have been concerned in a whole range of sports to get a link between sport and school so that these relationships can be established. A very clear illustration of this, which has universal approval, is Chance to shine in cricket. It takes into schools qualified sports coaches from the clubs.</p>

What are we doing to ensure that they have lower running costs&#151;for instance, by helping with utility bills&#151;and are we going to ensure that they receive assistance for such things as coaching costs in the future?</p>

Indeed, the Rugby Football Union has been very concerned about the link with schools. The noble Lord is quite right to emphasise that a great deal needs to be done. There is no doubt that the crucial link is the drop-out rate. The government strategy of encouraging sport in school and links with the sports clubs and of support for the sports clubs is directed at countering that.</p>

In fact, we all salute the enormous voluntary contributions that are made to almost every sports club in the land. However, there is a fairly limited amount of professional support for sports clubs and, as the noble Baroness will know, negotiating one&#146;s way through existing planning laws and planning permission with a local authority can often be quite a challenge. We are seeking to simplify that and to give guidance and support to sports clubs so that they know how to make planning applications that are more likely to get approval. I cite one obvious example. It is not necessarily easy for sports clubs to erect floodlights. They may need floodlights so that sports can be available in the later darker hours in the evening, but floodlights have an impact on the locality and local authorities obviously have some concern about that.</p>

My noble friend is absolutely right that the drop-out rate for girls occasions particular concern. Part of the general strategy is to emphasise that we want sport to be part of the school curriculum, that we want expertise from local clubs to be available to young people who are developing their sporting abilities, and that we want those young people to look to the clubs in their neighbourhood as the necessary locale to which they go after they leave school so that we can reduce the present unacceptable drop-out rate, particularly among girls.</p>

At that conference on future developments, it was clear that the European Union and others, including the UK, were very concerned to produce support for reconstruction in Gaza, but we also recognise the wider context in which this reconstruction has to be viewed.

I am sure that the right reverend Prelate will take delight, as will the whole House, in the more progressive, constructive position which is now being taken up by the international community, and the increase in demands on the Palestinians and the new Israeli Government to recognise their responsibilities for a lasting peace in the Middle East.

<a name="0903094000042"></a><b><a name="90309-0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0903094000305"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My Lords, tackling pensioner poverty remains a key priority, and we are committed to supporting pensioners during these difficult times. We will continue to build on the substantial progress we have made in lifting 900,000 pensioners out of relative poverty since 1998-99 on an after-housing-cost basis. In 2008-09, we provided extra help to pensioners through one-off boosts to the Christmas bonus and winter fuel payments and we are spending over &#163;13 billion more on pensioners than if 1997 policies had continued.</p>

I declare an obvious interest as I am a pensioner. Interest rates have plummeted but does the Minister think that it is right and fair that savers, most of whom are elderly and rely on investment income, are subsidising those who took on outsize mortgages?</p>

The Government keep all savings incentives under review and we should be clear about the extent of the issue, which is that 42 per cent of pensioners receive less than &#163;1 a week or no income from investments. Around 70 per cent of pensioner benefit units receive less than &#163;10 a week from investments. It is estimated that an 80 per cent reduction in investment income, which is roughly what has happened, would reduce pensioners&#146; net income before housing costs by 3 per cent on average but less than 1 per cent on the basis of a median analysis. It is an issue but it is not of the scale that some suggest.</p>

That would help a lot of poorer pensioners among us who are suffering, as the noble Baroness suggested, because their savings are not giving them any return on their income.</p>

That, of course, is currently in excess of earnings. The ongoing uprating of pension was laid down in the Pensions Act 2007, which was to uprate in 2012 subject to affordability, and in any event by the end of the next Parliament. That remains the Government&#146;s position.</p>

There are gateway proposals to help people on lower incomes to get into a savings culture, and child trust

Substantial tax reliefs are already available for pension savings, which is the right balance, particularly at the current time when we need to do all that we can to make sure that people see the benefit of savings generally and, in particular, the benefit of savings through pension arrangements.</p>

By that, I mean all pensioners rather than a few. It is all right to talk about fuel poverty, but this is about no one particular thing; it is about what they have saved up for their whole lives.</p>

There are, obviously, much more substantial issues for the banking sector, in getting money flowing into the economy and making sure that depositors feel and know that their deposits are safe.</p>

The Minister gave me a rather throwaway answer, saying, &#147;Well, my Lords, we will have to cost it&#148;. What work have the Government put in hand to achieve that costing?</p>

From April 2010, 60 per cent of pensioners over the age of 65 will pay no income tax. The Conservative policy would, therefore, presumably be skewed toward helping the better-off. I understand that the proposed funding for the arrangements is something like &#163;5 billion, cut from public expenditure; in particular, that &#163;2,000 increase in the personal allowance would cost around &#163;1.3 billion.</p>

That will seriously affect interest rates. Also, have the Government estimated the extent to which that action will further reduce the few remaining final-salary schemes as a result of its effect on their balance sheets?</p>

Quantitative easing is about trying to get money flowing back into the economy. As for the specific impact on pensions, it is likely to have an impact on gilt prices&#151;in the short term, at least&#151;and, therefore, on gilt yields

<a name="0903094000056"></a><b><a name="90309-0002.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="0903094000323"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, before I move on to the substance of the legislation before the House today, I wish to mention the tragic events of the weekend. The attack on Massereene Army base in Antrim, which resulted in the cold and deliberate murder of two people and serious injuries to four more, including two civilians, was a shocking reminder of Northern Ireland&#146;s dark past. Following the completion of this Second Reading debate, we will have an opportunity to debate the contents of a Statement that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State will make shortly in another place. For the time being, I am sure that the House will join me in expressing its condolences to the victims and their families, as well as to all those affected by this callous attack.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="0903094000057"></a>For many years, the political history of Northern Ireland was one of division. Attacks of the type that we have seen at the weekend, while no less callous and cold-blooded, were unfortunately all too common during the dark days of Northern Ireland. In recent years, however, thanks to the Belfast agreement in 1998 and the St Andrews agreement of 2006, the political environment of Northern Ireland has been transformed, with the development of firm foundations for a shared future in devolved government. Whenever such significant developments take place over a short period of time, there will always be those who wish to reverse that progress, and this is certainly true in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="0903094000058"></a>A small minority of people is determined to halt the political progress and drag Northern Ireland back to the climate of fear and uncertainty that dominated the political landscape for years, but it will not succeed. That small minority has no community support, as the revulsion towards the weekend&#146;s murders from both sides of the community and all points on the political spectrum demonstrates. The people of Northern Ireland are set on a political path and set against the type of criminality that has dominated our news programmes over the weekend. That is why it is important that we are not deterred from that political path, which has been carefully constructed over the past 12 years. The mindless actions of a tiny minority must not be allowed to place that progress and that new future at risk. We must press ahead with the political process and the process set out by the First and Deputy First Ministers in their statement of 18 November. The legislation before the House today represents the next stage in that process.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0903094000059"></a>During the past 12 years, this House has seen many pieces of Northern Ireland legislation, most of it significant and some of it historic, but all of it helping   


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_956"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 956</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to build the political process that has seen Northern Ireland move away from that past and towards a new, shared future in which locally elected politicians take decisions for the people of Northern Ireland. This legislation is certainly significant but it is also historic, because for the first time the parties in Northern Ireland have come together to decide on the way forward without intervention by the UK or Irish Governments.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="0903094000060"></a>The agreement announced by the First and Deputy First Ministers on 18 November last year set out a process whose completion would see the transfer of policing and justice responsibilities to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Subsequently, the work of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee, which is made up of the four largest parties in the Assembly, considered the modalities for devolution and made a series of recommendations in relation to the shape of a new department with responsibility for policing and justice functions. This report was accepted by the Assembly after a cross-community vote on 20 January and, subsequently, the First and Deputy First Ministers indicated that they wished the Government to introduce legislation giving effect to those elements of the agreement that required primary legislation. That is the effect of this Bill.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0903094000061"></a>The Bill ensures that the necessary framework is in place to enable the continuation of the process set out by the First and Deputy First Ministers in November. It is made in Northern Ireland by the democratically elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland. It will be for these elected representatives to decide when the time is right for devolution to take place. That is right and proper. It is for us to ensure that they can do so by fulfilling a commitment made to ensure that the Assembly has the necessary tools to move forward in a timeframe determined by the Assembly.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0903094000062"></a>The Bill does not impose devolution. The process by which policing and justice will be devolved has already been set out by Parliament in Section 4 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998&#151;the triple lock. It will initially require a motion requesting devolution to be tabled by the First and Deputy First Ministers acting jointly; that motion will then need to be approved by the Assembly on a cross-community vote. A series of orders giving effect to devolution would then be introduced in Parliament, which will have an opportunity to debate these orders and approve them if it so wishes.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0903094000063"></a>I turn to the detail of the Bill before the House. Clause 1 gives effect to Schedule 1, which provides for a new departmental model. This model was set out in the statement by the First and Deputy First Ministers in November last year and in the report of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee, which was approved by the Assembly in January. As such, we would anticipate it being the model used to set up the first department of justice. However, the legislation does not require it to be. It simply adds this model to the menu of options provided by the Northern Ireland Act 1998. It therefore increases to eight the number of options that the Assembly can choose from when it legislates to set up a new Northern Ireland department with responsibility for policing and justice functions. The model itself consists of a single minister, nominated by any Member

Under this model, the justice Minister would not count towards the parties&#146; allocation of seats on the Executive under the d&#146;Hondt formula.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0903094000064"></a>Both the agreement announced by the First and Deputy First Ministers and the Assembly and Executive Review Committee explicitly stated that this model should be subject to a sunset clause that would bring the arrangements to an end by May 2012. The Bill provides for the department to be automatically dissolved on 1 May 2012 unless the Assembly has agreed to continue the arrangements or agreed alternative arrangements.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0903094000065"></a>I know that in another place concerns were raised about the mechanism provided in the Bill for the removal of the justice Minister. It may be helpful if I deal with some of those concerns now, although there will of course be a further opportunity to debate the detail of the provisions in Committee. In the models already provided for in the 1998 Act, there is a symmetry between the methods of appointment and removal. For example, under the d&#146;Hondt system, the party&#146;s nominating officer appoints and has the power to remove. The Bill provides for the justice Minister to be appointed by a cross-community vote and, similarly, to be removed by a cross-community vote, reflecting the same principle of symmetry.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0903094000066"></a>However, the most important point for noble Lords to consider in relation to this issue is that the methods of appointment and removal were explicitly recommended by the Assembly committee report that was approved by the Assembly. At a time when we are continuing to try to build confidence among the people of Northern Ireland, which will enable us to move towards the devolution of policing and justice, it is vital that we are able to provide as stable a system as possible for the justice Minister. I recognise that there are those, including some in this Chamber, who consider this method of removal as evidence of a lack of stability for the justice Minister, but to them I say that surely the best method of providing a stable framework for the future administration of justice is to provide the framework that the people who will be operating within it feel is sustainable. That is the framework set out by the First and Deputy First Ministers, recommended by the Assembly and Executive Review Committee and endorsed by the Assembly in the cross-community vote that approved that report. It is a framework that I believe the First and Deputy First Ministers are committed to making work. We saw a clear illustration of this when the Bill was debated in another place last week. The right honourable Member for Belfast East, speaking as the First Minister, was categorical in his assertion:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="0903094000217"></a>&#147;Neither the First nor the Deputy First Minister will wish to do anything other than give full support to a Justice Minister, especially a Justice Minister who will have been appointed by a more democratic method than any other Minister in the Executive and who will therefore be harder to dismiss&#148;.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0903094000067"></a>He went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="0903094000218"></a>&#147;If there were any difficulty in the process, of course the prospective Justice Minister could talk to the First and Deputy First Ministers about what lay ahead to ensure a clear understanding of the nature of any potential removal from the job&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 4/3/09; cols. 940-41.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0903094000068"></a>To my mind, this makes it clear that the fears of some noble Lords relating to both the ease with which a justice Minister could be dismissed and the desire to do so are unfounded. The Government believe that the framework, set out by the democratically elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland, should be provided to those representatives as an option for use in setting up the new justice department.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0903094000069"></a>Given the careful consideration that was given to this model both by the First and Deputy First Ministers and by the Assembly and Executive Review Committee, and given the belief among the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland that this is a model that they can make work, I hope that noble Lords will see the reasons for the Government providing for this model in the Bill and see fit to support these provisions in the later passage of this legislation.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0903094000070"></a>Clause 2 and Schedules 2 to 6 deal with the arrangements for judicial appointments and removals following the devolution of policing and justice. We will have a further opportunity to debate these provisions in greater detail in Committee on Wednesday but, broadly speaking, the Bill provides for functions relating to judicial appointments and removals to be exercised by the Judicial Appointments Commission and, in some cases, by the Lord Chief Justice and the Northern Ireland Judicial Appointments Ombudsman as opposed to the First and Deputy First Ministers, as had previously been envisaged. In particular cases, important roles also remain for the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor.</p>

<a name="90309-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0903094000071"></a>The agreement between the First and Deputy First Ministers last November stated that these arrangements would be temporary and that permanent arrangements would need to be put in place by May 2012. Schedule 6 provides for this by placing a requirement on an Assembly committee to review the arrangements put in place by the Bill and to make recommendations before 1 May 2012. It also places a freeze on any new appointments to the Judicial Appointments Commission from 1 May 2012, unless and until the Assembly has agreed the future arrangements for judicial appointments and removals. While this freeze will not prevent judicial appointments from being made, it will result in a significant incentive for the Assembly to agree a way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0903094000072"></a>Clause 3 makes two technical amendments to the post-devolution framework in Northern Ireland. The first such amendment is to provide for the current function of the Attorney-General of Northern Ireland in relation to providing guidance on the disclosure of juror information to be split between the Advocate-General for Northern Ireland and the devolved Attorney-General for Northern Ireland after devolution. The Advocate-General will retain responsibility for issuing guidance in respect of national security and terrorism-related cases, while the devolved Attorney-General will be responsible for all other cases. The division of responsibility reflects the split of the current Attorney-General&#146;s functions that was agreed by Parliament in the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0903094000074"></a>During the Committee debate in another place, issues were raised in relation to the lines of accountability of both the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney-General. These are not affected by the Bill, which does not alter the relationships between the Public Prosecution Service, the Attorney-General and the Assembly as already provided for by the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. However, I recognise that there are concerns regarding this issue and it may help if I set out the reasons why the Government believe that the existing arrangements, as provided for by Parliament in the 2002 Act, are right and proper given the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0903094000075"></a>Your Lordships will recall the significance of the criminal justice review of March 2000 which led to the 2002 legislation. This review was the most important and far-reaching survey of criminal justice in Northern Ireland in over 30 years and flowed from a specific commitment in the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. The review and subsequent legislation enshrined the principle of prosecutorial independence in Northern Ireland. The review states that,</p>
<ul><a name="0903094000227"></a>&#147;in the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, we believe that this independence should be further strengthened, by ensuring that the relationship between the Attorney General and the head of the prosecution service, while containing elements of oversight, is consultative and not supervisory. In other words, there should be no power for the Attorney General to direct the prosecutor, whether in individual cases or on policy matters&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90309-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0903094000076"></a>I can understand that some noble Lords may question whether a review that took place nine years ago remains relevant today given the progress that Northern Ireland has seen in that period. The approach taken by the review reflected the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland. However far the politics have come in Northern Ireland, it is clear that the circumstances there are still significantly different from those in England and Wales. The need for confidence from all sections of the community in all the justice system remains of crucial importance, particularly at the point when the Assembly takes on responsibility for that system for the first time since 1972. The Government firmly believe that this fact warrants a different approach being taken in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0903094000077"></a>The 2002 Act, which gave legislative effect to the criminal justice review, was drafted to provide for the appropriate lines of accountability in the post-devolution world. The fact that the process of getting to that post-devolution world has taken longer than most of us anticipated at the time reinforces the need to ensure that these arrangements, designed to create community confidence in the prosecutorial system, are allowed to continue to bolster those levels of confidence to the point where responsibilities are devolved. The fact that the First and Deputy First Ministers have not proposed that those arrangements should be changed is an indication, in the Government&#146;s view, that the time has not yet come to change them. If, at some point in the future after we have devolved policing and justice, the Assembly concludes that Northern Ireland  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_960"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 960</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has come sufficiently far from the circumstances that obtained at the time of the criminal justice review, the Assembly will have the opportunity to change the arrangements in the 2002 Act. I do not think that it would be helpful for this House to seek to impose change at this stage in advance of the elected representatives of Northern Ireland coming to the conclusion themselves that the time was right.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0903094000078"></a>It is still important that the DPP can be held accountable by the Assembly. That is right and proper and is provided for in the 2002 Act. While the Assembly will not be able to inquire into individual cases&#151;that would be trespassing too far on the principle of prosecutorial independence&#151;its justice committee would be able to summon the DPP to give evidence on all matters relating to the financial and administrative running of the service. In addition, there is provision in the 2002 Act for the Assembly to provide an opportunity in its Standing Orders for the Attorney-General to speak and answer questions in the Assembly itself, as well as in Assembly committees, although he will not be able to vote. Given the consultative relationship between the Attorney-General and the DPP, this means that the Attorney can also answer questions relating to prosecution matters, including prosecution policy and systems, although he will not be able to answer questions relating to individual cases.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0903094000079"></a>Another important recommendation of the criminal justice review was that the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland should not be a political figure. The 2002 Act provides for the appointment to be made by the First and Deputy First Ministers. They have already indicated the person whom they would like to appoint, to widespread approval. There has been some suggestion&#151;we will have an opportunity in Committee to debate amendments to this effect tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;that the Attorney should be appointed by the Lord Chief Justice rather than by the First and Deputy First Ministers and that the Attorney should have a more active prosecutorial role. The Government believe that this would be a departure from the principle of separation of powers, which is a fundamental tenet of the UK&#146;s constitution. The distinction between the prosecutorial system, which brings cases on behalf of the Crown, and the judiciary, which tries those cases impartially and independently, would be frustrated if we moved to a position where the head of the judiciary appointed the head of the prosecution service. In addition, given the Attorney-General&#146;s role as a source of legal advice to the Executive, it is important that the post is filled by someone who has the confidence of both the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The arrangements set out in the 2002 Act, reflecting, as they do, the recommendations of the independent criminal justice review, are, in the Government&#146;s view, the right framework in which to place Northern Ireland&#146;s devolved institutions on the right footing when they take on responsibility for policing and justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0903094000080"></a>Clause 4 extends the scope of the order-making power in Section 86 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to enable the possibility of executive functions being devolved, even if the legislative competence for the matter remains reserved. Ultimately, this will allow Parliament greater flexibility to ensure that responsibility

Parliament will have control over the use to which the power is put. All orders made using this power are subject to the affirmative procedure and we will have an opportunity to debate them fully when the time comes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0903094000081"></a>The murderous attack over the weekend has brought into sharper focus the continuing threat that Northern Ireland faces from a small minority of people who are determined to disrupt the progress made in recent years. The shock and revulsion that have been abundantly clear in all parts of Northern Ireland demonstrate how far we have come in recent years. The greatest memorial to the weekend&#146;s victims is to continue with the political process and to show that this minority will not be allowed to drag the people of Northern Ireland, who are united in their commitment to political progress, back to a time when violence dominated the politics of the Province. The progress made by the Northern Ireland Executive must be allowed to continue and this Bill represents the Government&#146;s support for that progress, giving effect, as it does, to the agreement of the First and Deputy First Ministers and the Assembly and Executive Review Committee.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0903094000082"></a>Before I close my remarks, I shall address a concern that I know is shared by a number of noble Lords about the time allocated to consider this legislation in this House. That concern is recognised by the Government. However, it is not for the sake of the Government that we have sought to push this Bill through Parliament on a reduced timeframe; it has not been done for the simple sake of expediency. The Belfast agreement of 1998 set out the Government&#146;s support for the principle of the devolution of policing and justice. That support was augmented by the St Andrews agreement, which set out the Government&#146;s belief that the implementation of that agreement should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the Assembly to request the transfer of policing and justice powers by May 2008. The Government gave a commitment that they would do all that they could to facilitate progress and to ensure that the necessary enabling legislation would be in place to ensure that, when the Assembly felt ready to request the transfer of responsibilities, that transfer could take place expeditiously. That commitment stands, which is why it is important that we do all that we can to ensure that we expedite the path of this Bill.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0903094000083"></a>Of course, your Lordships will know that, in making this comment, I do not discount the vital importance of ensuring that Parliament has the opportunity to scrutinise carefully the legislation before it. I recognise that that opportunity has been curtailed in this case, although I hope that the briefings given by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and his officials have been of assistance to noble Lords and have helped that process of consideration, even given the reduced timeframe in which the process has taken place. However, the Government believe that it is correct that the people of Northern Ireland, through their Assembly, should be able to move forward with the devolution of policing and justice at a pace determined by them. While a final decision on when devolution should take place has not yet been reached,  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_962"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 962</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should the process of building community confidence continue apace, there is no reason why that decision should not be taken soon.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0903094000084"></a>I know that all of us in this Chamber today have the interests of Northern Ireland at heart. We have spent much time over the years debating how best to provide for Northern Ireland and, more recently, celebrating the fact that devolution has been restored and that its elected representatives can, once more, take responsibility for the issues that matter to the people of Northern Ireland. This Bill gives effect to the wishes of the representatives of those people. It is for that reason that, notwithstanding the understandable frustration that many of your Lordships feel about the limited time available to consider the Bill, I am confident that no one here would want this House to become the stumbling block to progress in Northern Ireland. We have a duty to scrutinise the Bill carefully, but we also have a duty to do what is right in the interests of Northern Ireland. In that spirit, I commend this Bill to the House. I beg to move.</p>

From our side, and certainly from my point of view, this has been the worst handled Northern Ireland Bill that in the 10 years that I have been doing this job I have ever been associated with. We are rushing a complex and hugely important Bill, which is vital to the constitution, and which invokes parts of something like six Northern Ireland Acts that need to be read and understood even to start to understand this Bill. The Bill had something like six hours, including the programme Motion debate, in the other place. If you read <I>Hansard</I>, there is only one conclusion that you can come to. I dare not use the language that I would use outside the House, but it was not a very good conclusion.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_963"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 963</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that they stay up front. If it passes through this House, the Bill will go back to the Northern Ireland Assembly. One of the things that concerns me&#151;made even more worrying after Saturday night&#151;is the state of the structure and organisation of criminal justice and policing in Northern Ireland. I believe that the criminal justice system, the judiciary and so on are in good shape. I have been assured of that by the Attorney-General, who is the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland. I know that she has had an interest in Northern Ireland for many years. However, I am seriously concerned about the police and the security forces as a whole.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0903094000089"></a>The Northern Ireland Assembly, if it pursues one of these options and asks for devolution, will be inheriting a police force with a chief constable who is retiring&#151;or being moved&#151;a deputy chief constable who is heading for retirement and an overdraft or debt in the police budget of more than &#163;50 million. Furthermore, the Government have required the police service to save &#163;350 million over the next three years and that overtime is reduced by 51 per cent. Considering the security situation in Northern Ireland as of today and last week and indeed for some time&#151;it was quite some time before the chief constable shouted for help&#151;that is not a good state in which to hand over something as important to a community as its policing. I want to know whether the Government plan to ensure that when it comes to devolving the police and criminal justice system, they are devolving a top-rate, on-top-of-the-job well-funded organisation.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0903094000090"></a>We recognise that the Bill does not itself deliver the devolution of criminal justice and policing. The Bill merely creates an eighth model of how justice powers could be devolved if and when the Assembly feels able to agree. That is a matter, rightly, for the MLAs in Northern Ireland to decide. However, powers should be transferred from this Parliament only when three criteria have been met. First, all parties represented in the Executive should be committed to pursuing their objectives by exclusively peaceful and democratic means. Having heard and read some of the comments of Sinn Fein politicians near the top of the police board as well as Adams and company, I do not believe that they support the PSNI other than cynically because it suits them to use it to pursue their own political agenda, which is not the political agenda of all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0903094000091"></a>Secondly, all parties should fully support in word and deed the criminal justice system, including the police and courts. Thirdly, such a transfer of power should command support across the community, as expressed through Northern Ireland&#146;s political representatives.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0903094000092"></a>We have always made it clear that any devolution of policing and justice powers must preserve the operational independence of the chief constable and his officers. If power had been devolved and the chief constable had asked for support from the SRR, I wonder whether the Assembly would have been able to give it to him or would he still have the power even to ask for it?</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0903094000093"></a>In terms of how the Bill is presented, we are not happy that the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland is independent of a parent department  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_964"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 964</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>within the Northern Ireland departmental system. I understand the arguments that I have been given by the Attorney-General and I understand why we are where we are but the fact that the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland will be appointed by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister means that he cannot be independent of politics. Northern Ireland being what it is, things soon swings into, &#147;Your turn, my turn&#148;.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0903094000094"></a>We were also unhappy about the supervision and support of the DPP. There has been no criticism whatever from me or my party of how the DPP has operated in any way; it has been superb. However, we feel that it needs supervision. The DPP needs support and, at times, some management; in the rest of this kingdom, the DPPs have both support and management.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0903094000095"></a>We have tabled a number of amendments, which will be considered later. However, we in my party have discussed this Bill at length&#151;for a considerably longer time than it spent in another place&#151;and we have done so with Ministers and the noble Baronesses on the Front Bench. We believe that in the situation that Northern Ireland finds itself in and where we are, we should let the Bill go through. We also support whatever is required to keep criminal justice and policing on the road.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0903094000097"></a>These atrocities serve to support the arguments I shall adopt regarding the need to strengthen the position of the proposed Minister of Justice. The Bill before us today is the latest in a series of attempts by the Government and the Executive in Northern Ireland to get the mechanics right when devolving policing and justice matters to the Assembly. It provides yet another model for a department of policing and justice to add to those introduced by the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 and the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0903094000098"></a>As has been said, the Bill does not give details of what powers will be devolved to the Assembly, nor does it tell us when this is likely to happen. In that regard, therefore, the Government cannot claim that this is &#147;emergency&#148; legislation that should be rushed through this House and the other place in a matter of days. The Lord President&#146;s explanation is less than satisfactory. When the Bill was debated in the House of Commons, there was a great deal of anger that it had been rushed through so quickly. It may be urgent, but surely not so urgent that adequate time cannot be provided between the discussions on the Bill in both Houses. This is a complex piece of legislation, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, emphasised when he referred to previous Northern Ireland Acts that subsequently were amended many times. We, too, are grateful to officials for providing a copy of the consolidated legislation, and for their assistance with our queries on  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_965"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 965</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Bill. Nevertheless, more time for consideration of the Bill would have been welcome, as would notice of the meeting that took place today at 1 pm with the Attorney-General and the Lord President. I became aware of that on the train coming down, and could not attend.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0903094000099"></a>The Liberal Democrats are a devolutionist party. For many years, we have supported and promoted the principle of devolving policing and justice powers to the Assembly. We want a local Minister to take responsibility for local aspects of the criminal justice system. That would be a major step in the normalisation process in Northern Ireland and could be regarded as the final piece in the jigsaw puzzle of the peace process. Several measures have already been put in place to provide greater transparency and accountability in operational matters; now they need to be entrenched in an Executive Minister who has been elected by local people.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0903094000100"></a>However, we must not underestimate the challenges that face Northern Ireland in the areas of policing and justice. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, mentioned some of them, including, crucially, the financial matters that must be clarified, particularly in relation to the number of police officers, given the current threat by dissident Republicans&#151;a threat described by the chief constable as being at the highest level for a decade. The atrocities at the Massereene barracks at the weekend fully validate Sir Hugh Orde's grave assessment of the current security situation. We must also address the increasing financial pressures on the prison estate, with a growing prison population and tougher sentences, and the matter of legal aid. Nevertheless, we believe that these issues should be decided at a local level by a local Minister. In so far as the Bill helps the Assembly to achieve that aim, we support it.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0903094000101"></a>Our difficulty, of which the noble Baroness is well aware and to which she has alluded, lies with Schedule 1 to the Bill, and in particular with the provision dealing with the removal of a Minister from office. The schedule proposes that a Minister of Justice can be removed simply by a cross-community vote in the Assembly. The Secretary of State may argue that this is the procedure for the removal of any other Assembly Minister. However, that would be to ignore the political implications of this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0903094000102"></a>We have warned Ministers previously not to look upon policing in Northern Ireland as being in any way comparable to other ministries there. Northern Ireland policing has a different dimension. There are special arrangements, including human rights compliance and structures for oversight and accountability. The fact that we are debating yet another model for a Ministry of Justice in Northern Ireland, in addition to the various other models that are on the statute book, emphasises that this is not just &#147;any other Ministry&#148;.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0903094000103"></a>The model in effect implies that, for something as important as policing in Northern Ireland, there must be special arrangements. We must create an entirely new department, outside the 10 departments that already exist in the Assembly, to accommodate such weighty functions. The model suggests that, although we have looked at how such a Ministry should be structured, we have not yet got it right. This is too important to be  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_966"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 966</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>anything less than as optimal as can be contrived. To state simply that the Minister who is in charge of one of the most contentious and critical departments can be dismissed in the same way as other members of the Executive ignores the special circumstances that surround this portfolio.</p>

<a name="90309-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0903094000104"></a>Policing and justice functions are different in Northern Ireland. Indeed, they are so different that the parties that currently compose the Executive believe that they should look outside themselves to find a person who can fulfil the role of Minister of Justice. It is not the function of the Bill or of this House to appoint the first Minister of Justice. That responsibility lies with politicians in the Assembly. However, it has been rumoured&#151;indeed this was discussed in the other place&#151;that the First and Deputy First Minister are looking to the Alliance Party to fill such a role. To place an Alliance Minister in a position where he or she can be so easily removed from this office is completely unacceptable. There is no equivalence between a Minister who has to retain only the confidence of his party nominating officer and a Minister elected by the Assembly as a whole, as the Justice Minister will be. The words of the First Minister, Peter Robinson, speaking in the other place last week, were welcome, but unless his intentions are enshrined in legislation they cannot provide, unfortunately, the necessary comfort that is required. We do not doubt his sincerity when he stated, as the Lord President has already quoted:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="0903094000219"></a>&#147;Neither the First nor the Deputy First Minister will wish to do anything other than give full support to a Justice Minister&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 4/3/09; col. 940.]</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0903094000105"></a>We also did not doubt the sincerity of the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, when he pledged to the people of Northern Ireland in May 1998 that paramilitary prisoners would be kept in prison unless and until violence was given up for good.<sup></sup>Indeed, I was present when he made that pledge at the Coleraine campus of the University of Ulster, being the vice-chancellor of the university at that time. However, despite the sincerity of the then Prime Minister, as the statement was not enshrined in the Northern Ireland Act 1998, we all saw that it was impossible to insist that the promise was kept. As it turned out, it was not, and prisoners were released without the pre-condition of arms being decommissioned.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0903094000106"></a>Similarly, as the recent Constitution Committee report on the surveillance society highlighted, Mr Charles Clarke, when Minister of State in the Home Office, categorically stated that anti-terrorism laws would not be used for other purposes. In fact, as the committee noted, such laws have been used by local authorities as well as by central government for other purposes. Ministerial assurances have to be discounted in the light of the experience of these examples; they have been debased so that now little confidence can be placed on them.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0903094000107"></a>It is also worth remembering that, in a cross-community vote, the vote of a member of the Alliance Party is worth less than that of a member of the DUP, Sinn Fein, the SDLP or the UUP. The vote of an Alliance Party member does not count in the stage which requires 50 per cent of unionists voting and 50 per cent of nationalists voting, as they are neither unionist nor nationalist. Is it right that they could be removed

No other party would accept such an onerous task under such disadvantageous circumstances. We cannot expect Alliance to do so either. Accordingly, when we come to discuss the Bill in Committee, we shall move amendments to rectify this provision.</p>

I am, of course, referring to the murder of two soldiers in Massereene barracks in County Antrim. I find it extremely difficult to use the proper words on such an occasion. I am very conscious that whatever words I might use, they will fall far short of what should be said. I am sure that every Member of the House is utterly revolted and repulsed about what happened on Saturday evening in Northern Ireland. To the two young soldiers&#146; families, I extend my sincere and heartfelt sympathy. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. To those who were seriously injured, we trust that they will make a speedy recovery. They did not deserve this by any standards. It is most sickening and downright appalling.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0903094000109"></a>Some may recall that when I spoke in the House just over a week ago, I said that Northern Ireland had come a long way. However, I sounded a note of caution and said that it had much further to go before we could have confidence that normality had returned. Sadly, this murderous attack confirmed our very worst fears. However, none of us could have anticipated the horrific callousness and ruthlessness of what happened on Saturday evening.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0903094000110"></a>Just last week, the PSNI chief constable, Sir Hugh Orde, was severely criticised after making it known that he was forced to return the Special Reconnaissance Regiment to the Province due to the possibility of an attack. Sadly, his worst fears were confirmed. It is a tragedy that there were politicians within Northern Ireland who denounced the chief constable for his actions. I trust that today, on reflection, they will see the folly of their words as two young soldiers lie dead and others seriously injured, including civilians.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0903094000111"></a>Turning to the issue before the House today, in general, my noble friend Lord Browne and I will be supporting the principles of the Bill. Its introduction represents significant advancement and will, I hope, grow the confidence of communities in Northern Ireland in seeing policing and justice matters devolved, eventually, to the Northern Ireland Assembly. I should say that that is in keeping with the St. Andrews agreement. My party is acutely aware of the sensitivities around the devolution of policing and justice to the Northern Ireland Assembly. I wish to state emphatically that the unionist community, in particular, would not accept Sinn Fein being in charge of policing and justice. Of course, the nub of the requirement is that whoever holds the position has support across the community as a whole. As events in Northern Ireland progress, we are hopeful that that will eventually arrive. It should be said that events such as what happened on Saturday  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_968"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 968</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>evening do not enhance the prospects for early devolution of policing and justice and the restoration of the confidence of the community.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0903094000112"></a>It is ironic, however, that unionists in the past fought to have policing and justice powers. This goes right back to the setting up of Stormont and the days of Carson and Craigavon. They were particularly strong and insisted that the Stormont Parliament had them. It is also a reality that another unionist prime minister refused to continue with devolution when those powers were taken away, stating that a Parliament without them was not worth having. My party has always made that clear; indeed, we fought elections and sought and got a mandate on such issues. We made three commitments. One was that we support the principle of devolution of policing and justice functions. We always said it could happen only when there is sufficient confidence within the community. Furthermore, we do not believe there would be support for the devolution of such powers to a Sinn Fein Minister in the foreseeable future. It may be important that policing and justice are devolved to Northern Ireland, but what is more important is that, when that day eventually comes, we get them right, rather than getting them soon. The requirements for the devolution of policing and justice are threefold: that it is done in the right way, at the right time and under the right circumstances.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0903094000113"></a>In conclusion, I would like to draw the attention of the House to what the Bill is not about. This is important. The Bill will not devolve policing and justice. There is a triple lock before that can happen, which has already been referred to. I draw the attention of the House to this because it is vital, in particular to those of us from the unionist community. Parliament has already set out arrangements for that&#151;I refer to my notes because I want these important points on the record&#151;in Section 4 of the 1998 Act. They depend on the triple lock, whereby a Motion requesting devolution needs to be tabled in the Assembly by the First and Deputy First Ministers acting jointly. After that, the Motion would need to be approved by a cross-community vote in the Assembly. The Secretary of State would then bring transfer-matter orders before Parliament in Westminster for approval and debate. The Bill&#151;this is significant and very important&#151;will not impose devolution on the majority if it later chooses not to exercise that power. I believe that the House is looking for an assurance today from the Minister that there will be no attempt whatever to impose the devolution of policing and justice on the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0903094000116"></a>In the circumstances, it is ironic and tragic that we come here today to be asked to build on the selfishness and deceit that began at St Andrews and has been compounded by what are now referred to as the two major parties in Northern Ireland. Those parties are working out of little more than electoral self-interest and in cahoots with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, whose briefing, which was conveyed to Members of this House last week, was so flawed, misleading and bereft of substance as to be offensive.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0903094000117"></a>We are led to believe by the Secretary of State that the Bill, which has been rushed in its entirety through another place in a single sitting and is to be dealt with in your Lordships&#146; House in a mere two sittings, is not really about any precipitate movement towards the devolution of policing and justice in Northern Ireland; it is simply a means of providing another option in that process for our devolved Assembly.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0903094000118"></a>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said in his briefing that the Bill was to reflect agreement between the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on 18 November 2008, and as taken through the Assembly with cross-community endorsement on 20 January this year after consideration of a report by the Assembly and Executive Review Committee. He went on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="0903094000220"></a>&#147;In that sense, the Bill not only enjoys confidence, but has &#145;Made in Northern Ireland&#146; stamped firmly on it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 4/3/09; col. 856.]</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0903094000119"></a>Let me share the real facts with noble Lords. I do not know, nor I suspect does anyone else, exactly what deal was conjured up between Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness during and subsequent to the irresponsible and disgraceful 150-day moratorium of the Assembly Executive, but I do know that when the letter conveying the Robinson/McGuinness deal to the Assembly and Executive Review Committee was placed before the Executive &#147;to be noted&#148;, at least two Executive members voted against it. For absolute clarity, it is worth adding that there has not been any formal discussion on the devolution of policing and justice, or the methodology to be employed, at the Executive. It is exclusively a deal between Sinn Fein and the DUP in which the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is complicit, but of which others know virtually nothing.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0903094000120"></a>I am further aware that there was not a unanimous report from the Assembly and Executive Review Committee. At least three review committee members voted against the report. It is a fact that only 51 out of 108 Assembly Members voted in favour&#151;47 per cent of Ulster Unionists and the SDLP voted against and others abstained. Therefore, was the report &#147;made in Northern Ireland&#148;? My answer is hardly so.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_970"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 970</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90309-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0903094000121"></a>I am, for better or for worse, a committed devolutionist who believes that progress must be built on a firm foundation. That is an objective I share with my party and, I believe, with the SDLP. It is also worth noting that the SDLP voted against the substantive motion last Wednesday in another place, whereas the DUP appears to have voted according to its secret arrangement with Sinn Fein. But my opposition to the precipitate action of the Government in this matter has less to do with politics than with practicalities. It is time to look at the situation with which a still tetchy and suspicious community would have to deal and I ask noble Lords not to be misled by talk of a process that can trundle up to 1 May 2012. It is, I am convinced, part of a deal between the Secretary of State&#146;s office and Sinn Fein that matters can be decided in the five weeks between the European election on 5<sup></sup>June and this House going into recess for the summer. Is it not a tactic of this Government to use the recess as a cover for unpleasantness? That is why we are being rushed here today. We can be assured that there is no other justification and I only hope that my words of opposition will frustrate such an irresponsible intention.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0903094000122"></a>What even suggests that the timing for devolution of policing and justice is feasible? We have a chief constable who has just this week concealed from his police board the fact that he sought to mobilise a special intelligence resource because the threat from dissident republicans is so great. I have no problem with such measures and I expect the same level of security as in any other part of the United Kingdom. But I do not expect a conspiracy between the chief constable and the Secretary of State that gives the very people who threaten us publicity, sympathy, status and a raison d&#146;etre. From our brief interaction with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland last Monday, it is clear that he knows nothing of the psychology of anti-terrorist warfare.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0903094000123"></a>If even the police board cannot be trusted with this level of information, why is it there? Of greater relevance, why, if that is their attitude, would the chief constable and the Secretary of State consider devolving total responsibility to the Assembly? It is time for this House to have straight answers to those questions, and I have sympathy with the Lord President in so far as the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has dropped her in the unenviable situation of having to justify his inadequacy.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0903094000124"></a>We are being asked to make provision for policing, obviously with the acquiescence of our chief constable, who recently told an All-Party Parliamentary Group on Northern Ireland that I attended how he had such an efficient force that he did not need to know what was happening on a day-to-day basis. For nearly three years he has publicised the threat from dissident republicans like a recruiting sergeant but, by admission, cannot and does not keep a record of their capture and convictions. Can you imagine? This was the chief constable who told us that he had so little police resources that the PSNI might have to cease recruiting; who admitted that he was short of more than 400 detectives; who told us publicly that the PSNI was no longer investigating the &#163;26 million theft from the Northern Bank, the brutal McCartney murder or the Omagh bomb; and who, with the Office of the Director

We are being asked to prepare to devolve that sort of poisoned chalice.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0903094000125"></a>It is worth noting that, since the DUP/Sinn Fein secret deal in November, almost every question that I have asked about policing has been deemed an &#147;operational matter&#148;, not worthy of a proper answer. On 29 January, in a follow-up Question, I asked how the source of Semtex explosives used by the dissident IRA could be deemed &#147;an operational intelligence matter&#148; and who decided to classify it so, when the information I sought was already known by the police, the Provisional IRA and by dissident IRA activists. I was told that it was the view of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that this was an operational matter. Who so advised him? Is it not a contradiction for the chief constable to publicly analyse day after day, week after week, dissident IRA capability without making any apparent inroads against them, while, arbitrarily, the Secretary of State decides that parliamentarians should be kept in the dark?</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0903094000126"></a>I know a little about anti-terrorist operations, yet neither the Secretary of State nor the chief constable would ever think it worth asking me to meet them, but I bet that they meet Sinn Fein the moment it crooks its little finger. Therefore, how could I or anyone accede to the terms of this Bill brought before us today under such duplicitous and ill contrived circumstances?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0903094000129"></a>Today, I reckon that, for all of us, our discussion of this Bill is overshadowed by the murder of two more soldiers in County Antrim and the wounding of others already referred to, including civilians, by the so-called Real IRA. I say so-called because, to my mind, they are not real Irish people or real republicans, and certainly they are not a real army. There could scarcely exist a more stark contrast between, on the one hand, the motives and methods of the perpetrators of this crime and, on the other, the motives and methods of those leaders whose political agreement has led to the formulation of this Bill. On the one side is the violent and murderous rejection of a future for Northern Ireland based on consent and the rule of law; on the other, the rejection of a future in which the past would  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_972"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 972</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be endlessly and hopelessly reproduced. There is infinitesimal support, if any at all, for the first, yet there is overwhelming support for the second. As this Bill comes forward, the response to the disgusting crimes of two days ago should be one of steadiness and calm judgment, as well, of course, as one of firm resolve.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0903094000130"></a>That said, my first reaction to this Bill, which I support in general for the reasons that have been given, was one of sympathy with the parliamentary draftsman. It bears all the marks of ministerial instructions of the &#147;hurry, hurry, go faster&#148; type. When these necessitate the copious and piecemeal amendment of complete Acts that have themselves been similarly amended, perhaps more than once, then, for the draftsman, Pelion is indeed piled upon Ossa.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0903094000131"></a>For the same reason, my second reaction&#151;it was second only by a short head&#151;was one of sympathy with all who have to construe and implement the result. The Bill is user-hostile. Its clauses are beguilingly few in number, a mere five, but the devil is in the schedules, which take up 28 pages. Examples of their thicket-like quality abound&#151;I take this instance from page 7, lines 33 to 37:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="0903094000221"></a>&#147;After paragraph 12 insert ... &#145;13 ... Paragraphs 3(10), 3D(14), 7(10), 11(10) and (11) and 11E(10) of this Schedule shall have effect subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of Schedule 12A (as those paragraphs are modified at any time by virtue of paragraph 12 of this Schedule)&#146;.&#148;.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0903094000132"></a>I feel that this daunting quality is not the fault of the draftsman; it is the inevitable consequence of the haste with which the Government have required this work to be done; haste which was matched by the time within which they required Parliament to pass this Bill. The timetable simply is not long enough to allow this House at least to do its proper job of scrutiny and revision, valuably though the Bill team has endeavoured with Ministers to help some of us understand the Bill&#146;s provisions and their effect. The Government might well take to heart the reaction of the Select Committee on the Constitution in this House, which reported only a few days ago and whose findings I shall leave to its chairman, my noble friend Lord Goodlad, to relate.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0903094000133"></a>Ministers say that the justification for this haste is the need to keep up the momentum of the devolution process, that momentum will be lost unless, by the summer Recess, the Assembly will have been able to decide what use if any to make of the additional devolution model which the Bill is designed to offer it and what course to take in the light of that decision. They point out that it was only on 18 November last year that the First and Deputy First Ministers reached the highly significant agreement which could be fulfilled only be detailed legislation.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0903094000134"></a>I do not think that that justification stands up. Momentum is not an end in itself. When dealing with a topic as sensitive and controversial as the devolution of policing and criminal justice in Northern Ireland, which has a highly litigious as well as a still-divided society, it would be wiser for the Government to get their legislative tackle reliably in order even at the cost of a couple of extra months. Like patriotism, momentum is not enough, and I add my protest to those that have been made both here and in the other place.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_973"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 973</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90309-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0903094000135"></a>We are nevertheless where we are, however reluctantly. Having served in my time as both the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland and then Secretary of State, I am driven to focus on the Bill&#146;s provisions for the relationship between the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland and the DPP for Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0903094000136"></a>For my part, I have always been a convinced upholder of the merits of the structure that operates in this country. The Attorney-General has a statutory duty to superintend the DPP, whom she appoints, and over whom she has a power of direction&#151;a power that I believe not to have been exercised in modern times but which remains available. That arrangement has been on the statute book since the 1880s and continues to work very well. The prime reason for my support for it has lain in the fact that Parliament will on occasion want to examine a particular prosecuting decision or event, and that rightly it will consider itself entitled to a degree of fair accountability. Similarly, it may be right&#151;I have personal experience of this&#151;for the Attorney-General to go before the House of Commons, or the House of Lords, and explain why a particular action has taken place, why it has occurred and to set the record straight.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0903094000137"></a>Parliament will not be satisfied with the attendance of a mere messenger; it will require to hear from the person with whom ultimate responsibility lies. That person should accordingly be a Member of one House or the other and have the right of audience. Merely being questioned as a witness, which will be possible under the Bill&#146;s arrangements, is not the same, nor is it enough. Given the general acceptance of the fundamentally important convention that the Attorney-General acts quasi-judicially, this has always seemed to be the best practicable arrangement. I believe that it served equally well in Northern Ireland under direct rule.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0903094000138"></a>Devolution in Northern Ireland inevitably can be expected to bring to the fore suspicions and assertions of political bias in prosecutorial decisions. Such is the invasive character of the prosecuting arm of the state that it is highly important to protect the DPP as far as practicable from these suspicions and from the attacks that will foreseeably be based on them. These suspicions can expect to be further fed if the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland is appointed politically by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister jointly, as is provided for by the 2002 Act.</p>

<a name="90309-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0903094000139"></a>The criminal justice review, to which that Act gave effect, took the view that the atmosphere in Northern Ireland was so highly charged that the DPP should be made wholly independent of ministerial supervision. At that difficult time for Northern Ireland I agreed with that, albeit reluctantly given my strong support for what works so well in England and Wales, and which I continue to believe is the ideal. Accountability remains of huge importance, as does public confidence in the system. Since 2002 we have seen the passage of seven years, which has been a generally positive period in which significant political progress towards devolution and peace has been made. In these differing circumstances today, I am inclined to believe that if the Attorney-General were to be appointed by the Judicial Appointments Commission, or rather recommended by the commission and appointed thereafter as a matter of convention by  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_974"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 974</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Lord Chief Justice, and supervision were restored, suspicions of bias would be significantly abated. Accordingly, if my noble friends were to move such an amendment, I could see the point of that and would think it entirely justifiable. It comes down to a question of judgment concerning the atmosphere in Northern Ireland today. Either way, I shall be content to support the Bill which does not deliver devolution of criminal justice and policing but usefully offers further paving along the way.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="0903094000245"></a>4.24 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="0903094000140"></a><b><a name="90309-0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0903094000329"></a>Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve:</b> My Lords, at the end of last week we perhaps expected to have this debate in an atmosphere where we felt that things were moving forward in Northern Ireland. Like other noble Lords, I have been saddened, disappointed and outraged by the events last Saturday at Massereene barracks. Despite the warnings by the chief constable, no one could have anticipated them. In that circumstance, this Bill could have expected a favourable wind. After all, on the surface it comes with cross-community support and cross-party support here. I broadly support it, and others have given very good reasons for supporting it.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0903094000141"></a>However, the wind is also blowing from a different quarter, and the reason is the outrage expressed by several noble Lords&#151;and with great eloquence in another place&#151; about the way in which this measure has been brought forward. This is a constitutional Bill; it is not a piece of small, secondary legislation, but constitutional legislation for a situation that is still complex and intricate. It is not merely that the other place was offered spectacularly little time to debate it, but that none of us&#151;despite the great assistance received from officials&#151;was given the time needed to see how the various pieces of legislation referred to will interact. I am sure that others have spent the weekend with cold or hot towels, according to preference, getting their minds around how these provisions interact. I want to return to the question: why the haste? In some ways, that lies close to the surface at this point.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0903094000142"></a>In the other place, two distinct reasons were given for the haste. It is always a bit worrying when two reasons that pull in quite different ways are given for the same policy. One reason is that there was no parliamentary time, but that does not stand up to the evidence. We know that it has been many weeks, indeed months, since the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister reached agreement; it has been nearly two months since the Assembly came to an agreement, and there has, presumably, been liaison and contact between the Secretary of State and what was going on in Northern Ireland. Nevertheless, we find the plea made that, in this rather lighter parliamentary Session, there was no time to do otherwise. That point was made not just on one occasion, but again and again.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0903094000143"></a>Beside that, a quite different reason was given for this unseemly haste by the Secretary of State and expanded on by the previous Secretary of State, the right honourable Peter Hain: that this is a matter of keeping the momentum. That metaphor comes, I think, from bicycle riding; most of us, if we lose our speed aboard a bicycle, tend to fall off. That metaphor of momentum may have had its place in negotiations among parties reluctant to reach agreement; however,  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_975"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 975</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on this occasion, it has none. We are not in a situation of negotiation among highly divided parties which have to be cajoled and goaded toward agreement. This is a parliamentary process and a constitutional Bill. I do not see why momentum provides a reason for haste. On the contrary, the assumption that momentum is at stake here has served us ill. It has meant that a great deal of the discussion in the other place, and here today, has been devoted to the way in which the Bill has been brought forward and the lack of time for its consideration&#151;and then we come to the complexities.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0903094000144"></a>There is a suspicion, voiced by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, on which I have no opinion of my own. Yet the House deserves to hear that suspicion laid to rest or confirmed. In that spirit, I shall say very little more. If the Minister could tell us the central reason for this process being used for a constitutional measure, it would put many of us in a position to make a clearer judgment about the substance of the Bill. I do not think that many of us would find it difficult to support a Bill whose central provision is to take the Minister of Justice out of the d&#146;Hondt process. There are ancillary questions to be raised and scrutiny to be done, but could the Minister tell the House what led to this unseemly haste? I should be greatly relieved if she could honestly tell the House that it was a muddle.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="0903094000246"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="0903094000145"></a><b><a name="90309-0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0903094000330"></a>Lord Browne of Belmont:</b> My Lords, I thank the Lord President for bringing the Northern Ireland Bill before the House this afternoon. Perhaps not on the face of it substantial, it is nevertheless very significant for the structural management of policing and justice in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0903094000146"></a>Before I proceed, I, too, offer my sincere condolences to the families of the serving soldiers who were murdered in the service of our country at Massereene barracks in Antrim on Saturday. I extend my sympathy to the families of the soldiers and civilians who were injured and I very much hope that they will make a full and speedy recovery. Saturday's tragic events will make all of us strive all the more energetically to ensure that the peace process continues and develops. This Bill is an important element of that process and nothing should be allowed to deter the people of Northern Ireland from striving towards a shared future of peace and harmony.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0903094000147"></a>Without wishing to be churlish, I draw attention to my party's concern and frustration at the legislative timetable of this Bill in the other place. Unlike with other Bills pertaining to Northern Ireland, there is no deadline, crisis or stalemate which justifies the accelerated passage that this Bill is receiving. Indeed, there is a genuine concern that without an appropriate period of scrutiny, this Bill and, perhaps more importantly, the schedules attached, may pass with certain flaws that could otherwise have been detected and amended in the usual manner. That said, noble Lords should be aware that my party is, in principle, supportive of the devolution of policing and justice powers to Northern Ireland. Indeed, during the passage of several Northern Ireland Bills within this place, I expressed the hope  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_976"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 976</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that sufficient public confidence would eventually exist in Northern Ireland to allow the early devolution of significant powers to the locally accountable legislative Assembly.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0903094000148"></a>The devolution of policing and justice is not an aspirational desire. These matters are an essential cog of government, without which the long-term devolution project in Northern Ireland could be called into question. Indeed, it was only a short time after the Northern Ireland Parliament lost this legislative competence that devolved government in Northern Ireland came to an end with the prorogation of the Stormont Parliament in 1972. For this reason, I support the passage of this Bill as a tentative first step, which permits the Assembly to request the devolution of policing and justice powers when it is satisfied that there is sufficient confidence within the community and that the political maturity exists to deal which such functions.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0903094000149"></a>To date, considerable progress has been made towards achieving these goals. Before devolution could be restored in Northern Ireland, my party insisted that support for the courts, the police and the rule of law should be an essential prerequisite for the appointment of any individual to an executive office. While some thought that such a request might be a barrier to progress, my party held firmly to the position that this was a normal requirement in any democratic society&#151;and, fortunately, this view prevailed.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0903094000150"></a>I am confident that continued cross-community cooperation will gradually increase public confidence which should, eventually, permit the devolution of policing and justice. The principle of devolving these powers is an objective on which both unionists and nationalists can unite, and the passing of the Bill will allow the next stage in the process of developing public confidence to begin. For that reason, I support the Bill.</p>
<a name="time_17"></a>
<a name="90309-0005.htm_time2"></a><h5><a name="0903094000247"></a>4.35 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="0903094000151"></a><b><a name="90309-0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0903094000331"></a>Viscount Brookeborough:</b> My Lords, first, I express my deepest sympathy to the families of the murdered soldiers and to the soldiers and civilians injured in the horrific, cowardly incident in Antrim on Saturday night. I must admit that, like many others, I thought and hoped that this sort of thing was behind us. I would point out that in the Province, at home, we have been well aware of the increased threat over the last few months from dissidents of the Real and Continuity IRA. However, I should tell your Lordships that, at ground level, many of the personalities serve either movement. They separate at leadership level, but it is well known that they wish to be closer. Therefore, we should not differentiate so much between them; they are simply all terrorists.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0903094000152"></a>Secondly, the increased known threat did not include this incident in Antrim, which came out of the blue. So the threat continues to be as severe as it was on Friday, even if the perpetrators go to ground, or, even better, if they are brought to justice. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, for her introduction of this Bill to complete the devolution of Northern Ireland and the peace process, but, again, I would ask why it is so rushed. It seems to be lacking in professionalism to have pushed it through like this. I realise that the Bill  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_977"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 977</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>produces only a model for the basis of the devolution of policing and justice. However, this may be our only chance to comment on it in your Lordships&#146; House. I also accept that it is largely a done deal between the DUP and Sinn Fein, both having accepted it.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0903094000153"></a>However, I would like to make a few observations on the issue as a whole. The Government must ensure that these powers of policing and justice are devolved into a stable and democratic political environment. It is important to note that matters of national security are not devolved and I would like to address this for a moment. I would also like the Minister, in her reply, to clarify national security issues, reiterate where they stand in a devolved situation and make it absolutely clear. A lot of the rows over the last few days, prior to this incident, were based on a misunderstanding in some quarters and Sinn Fein playing a different game. Over the last while, Sinn Fein has been active in showing its support for policing, law and order and the courts. This is very welcome.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0903094000154"></a>However, when the chief constable, due to the threats to national security, called in support from the Reconnaissance Regiment, we saw an outraged hysterical attack on him and the Government, and this has done absolutely nothing for community relations in Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein is acutely aware of that and yet it did it and continues to argue it. Therefore, we have a right to ask if Sinn Fein support for law and order is unconditional or conditional and tactical. I hope that it is not the latter, but I fear that it is not being honest in this respect. They may well argue that the current threat is not to national security. I beg to differ and, quite clearly, the Government differ as well; hence, the support being given to the chief constable.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0903094000155"></a>We have known for a long time that the dissidents have links outside the UK and Ireland. Indeed, there has been al-Qaeda activity in Northern Ireland but no incidents. The Antrim incident gives them more credibility in international terrorist circles and it is of national security importance. Although it was a really ghastly, terrible, murderous incident, in terms of terrorism, the dissidents have been after something to give them credibility, both internationally and at home. It is not only international; there are a large number of ex-provisional-type people who are sitting on the fence, waiting to see if the dissidents could do anything credible. Well, now we see that, for a start, they have weapons that were meant to have been decommissioned; not only the weapons, but the Semtex that was used recently. This is really quite bad news for us all.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0903094000156"></a>Sinn Fein&#146;s attitude does not show unconditional support for policing and law and order. I think that I did not hear Gerry Adams or the Deputy First Minister referring to the Antrim shooting as &#147;murder&#148;, and they spoke for a fairly long time on radio and television. I think that the latter actually referred to it as &#147;restarting a war&#148;. This was not condemnation with the strength that we would have all liked to have seen.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="0903094000157"></a>In addition, the dissidents are far from being unknown new recruits, as I think Gerry Adams would have liked us to believe when he spoke on the television, in their 20s and teens. Some of them may be; however, the murderers on Saturday night were cool, experienced veterans, as are most of the known groups and the  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_978"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 978</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>leadership thereof. It is no good anyone hiding behind the idea that these are raw recruits going out on a simple test. That was not so. Until a few years ago, they were colleagues of the senior staff and leaders of Sinn Fein while on active service in the provisionals. The only way that Gerry Adams can distance himself from them, pretending that he does not know who they are, is by saying that they are teenaged recruits. I am sorry, but that is a farce.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0903094000158"></a>Many of us in Northern Ireland wonder why Sinn Fein has not put more pressure on its erstwhile colleagues to stop their terrorist activities&#151;or even expose them to the police, the very force that it now says that it wants to support. Sinn Fein&#146;s attitudes and actions in the past week have done more to undermine community cohesion than anything for quite some time, while the situation had been getting better.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="0903094000159"></a>I have two quick points about the devolving of justice. We must ensure that the legislation is as workable and manageable as possible, but I see that there are deficiencies in our law as it stands and we are asking other people to operate it. First, many people are disappointed that we do not yet have the admissibility of radio and telephonic intercept evidence in courts. I know that the Minister will not necessarily reply to that; we have been through it a large number of times, but I want to make the point.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0903094000160"></a>Secondly, another issue has had a bearing on these recent events, so noble Lords will excuse me for mentioning it. Section 3 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 deals with primary disclosures by the prosecutor:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="0903094000222"></a>&#147;The prosecutor must ... disclose to the accused any prosecution material which has not previously been disclosed to the accused and which in the prosecutor&#146;s opinion might undermine the case for the prosecution against the accused&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903094000210"></a>However, on the defence side, compulsory disclosure by the accused only has to give a defence statement, setting it out &#147;in general terms&#148;.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0903094000161"></a>For an example of how that is perhaps affecting us at this minute, in the Omagh bomb case, low-copy DNA evidence was discredited due to the evidence of two expert witnesses. One of them had an undisclosed criminal record from Scotland. The second had a court ruling made against his role as an expert witness in the US in 1995, which said that he was unqualified and incompetent to perform any DNA testing in any criminal case. As a result of their misleading the court, three other cases against accused dissident terrorists were dropped at that time. They were all significant, and may be involved in today&#146;s terrorist activity&#151;I would have said almost certainly. Do the Government recognise this inadequacy in the disclosure by the accused in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and does the Minister agree that its lack of effectiveness may have contributed to the incident on Saturday night?</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0903094000162"></a>Finally, I support the intentions of this Bill but I seriously question the integrity of Sinn Fein&#146;s so-stated support for policing and law and order. I am not sure how its sincerity and maturity, if there is any, can ever be validated.</p>

The thoughts of us all are with them. Having seen the effect of such acts of violence over the years on opinion not only in Ireland and Great Britain but also in countries to which large numbers of Irish people have migrated, I share the view that these acts are not only evil and contemptible in themselves but wholly counterproductive from everybody&#146;s point of view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0903094000164"></a>I turn to the Bill before us; the work of Parliament must go on. Your Lordships&#146; Constitution Committee published a report on 5 March, to which reference has been made, drawing attention to the constitutional implications of the Bill. The Bill has two aims which are of constitutional significance. First, it seeks to provide an interim framework for a Northern Ireland department and a Minister responsible for police and justice ahead of devolution of those functions. Secondly, the Bill contains interim provisions for judicial appointments and removals, and requires the Northern Ireland Assembly to carry out reviews of both sets of arrangements by 1 May 2012. All this has been foreseen for some considerable time.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0903094000165"></a>The present Session of Parliament, unprecedentedly for many years, is not short of legislative time. Your Lordships&#146; committee expressed the view in a number of previous reports that, as a matter of general principle, Bills which deal with issues of constitutional significance should be published in draft and subject to pre-legislative scrutiny. The Northern Ireland Bill seeks to legislate on matters of constitutional significance. It amends the Northern Ireland Act 1998&#151;a piece of legislation described by the Appellate Committee of your Lordships&#146; House as &#147;in effect a constitution&#148; for that part of the United Kingdom. In addition to the devolution framework, the Bill deals with judicial appointments and removals, and the role of Ministers in that process.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0903094000166"></a>When the Lord Chancellor gave evidence to the Constitution Committee on 28 January this year, he was asked whether there should be a constitutional convention that any Bill which carries constitutional change of any significance should automatically be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny. Jack Straw told the committee that,</p>
<ul><a name="0903094000228"></a>&#147;that will be the rule unless there is some emergency, which I do not anticipate, which would mean that you would have to rush the whole thing through&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903094000211"></a>In the present case there has been no opportunity for pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Bill by the United Kingdom Parliament. Moreover, the Bill has had a very expedited passage in the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0903094000167"></a>Many Bills relating to the Northern Ireland peace process and devolution settlement have similarly been introduced to Parliament on an emergency basis, with Parliament being called on to give legislative effect to negotiations. Your Lordships&#146; committee is currently engaged on an inquiry into &#147;emergency legislation&#148;, broadly defined to include all Bills that receive a fast-track passage through Parliament. As part of this  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_980"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 980</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>inquiry, your Lordships&#146; committee is considering the reasons for and the constitutional implications of the practice in recent years of routinely giving Bills relating to Northern Ireland&#146;s constitutional matters expedited consideration by Parliament. We shall report to the House in due course.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0903094000168"></a>The committee understands the political requirements for progress on the process of devolution of policing and justice functions to Northern Ireland, but it is not clear that there is an emergency situation that in and of itself justifies the departure from the principle that Bills of constitutional significance should be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny in the United Kingdom Parliament. Nor is it obvious that circumstances exist that justify this Bill being put on a fast-track legislative process in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Bill is in effect amending the constitution of the United Kingdom, and such changes should be made only after careful deliberation.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0903094000169"></a>The Bill also makes proposals for the Prime Minister&#146;s future role in judicial appointments in Northern Ireland, which are analysed in the committee&#146;s report and which I shall not delay your Lordships by reciting. In March 2008, the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill proposed removing the Prime Minister from the process of appointments to the United Kingdom Supreme Court. In the new constitutional settlement that has emerged from the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, if a Minister in the United Kingdom Government is to be made responsible for judicially-related matters, that Minister should surely be the Lord Chancellor. The constitutional role of the Lord Chancellor in relation to the rule of law is expressly recognised by Section 1 of the 2005 Act. Under Section 3, he has a statutory duty to defend the independence of the judiciary, distinguishing him from other Ministers whose duty is to uphold that independence. Under Section 17, his distinctive oath of office requires him to respect the rule of law and defend judicial independence.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0903094000170"></a>While the committee accepts that there is a need for Ministers to be involved in both the appointment of and any steps to remove a member of the senior judiciary in Northern Ireland, we question whether the Prime Minister, rather than the Lord Chancellor, should have a role in these processes. I would expect this matter to be re-examined at further stages of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0903094000171"></a>I am grateful for the Secretary of State&#146;s letter in response to the committee&#146;s report, which I received today. It will be studied carefully by the committee before we return to further consideration of the Bill on Wednesday. Personally, I was not impressed by references to future unamendable Orders in Council and a so-called purdah period for the European elections, precluding more lengthy consideration of the Bill in the United Kingdom Parliament. The committee will also study carefully what the Lord President says before we return to further proceedings on Wednesday.</p>

Like other noble Lords, I express my sympathy to the families who have been affected so cruelly.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="0903094000173"></a>I also thank the Lord President, the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, for the way in which she has offered a great deal of consultation and help to noble Lords in coming to decisions about this legislation. The legislation has been rushed, and I have been very grateful indeed for the way in which she has attempted to mitigate the effect of that haste. Like other noble Lords, I think that we have all benefited from those discussions.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="0903094000174"></a>This is a Bill like no other. It comes with the support of the Government, but in a sense that is almost not the important thing. It comes with the support of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is the basis on which normal business in the Assembly was resumed this autumn and the stand-off that had been inhibiting the work of that Assembly came to an end. It is therefore very difficult indeed for this House to treat it in any other way but with great respect. One might almost say that that which Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness put together let no man put asunder.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="0903094000175"></a>The Bill also has its roots in the negotiations going back to 2003 that affect the Northern Ireland peace process. From that time onwards, for good or for ill, the concept of the devolution of policing and justice was intimately related to commitments given by the Provisional IRA on the decommissioning of its weapons. Whether it was wise for that issue to be introduced in that way is entirely another point. We are now stuck with this five or six years later.</p>

<a name="90309-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="0903094000176"></a>We must bear these realities in mind, therefore, when we discuss this legislation. None the less, some observations are appropriate and made even more pressing by the events of the weekend and, indeed, the political arguments in Northern Ireland that pre-dated the murders at Massereene. As the Government rightly say, this Bill is designed not to bring in devolution but to provide parliamentary sanction for a new model that the Deputy First Minister and the First Minister have agreed they might be able to employ to bring about the devolution of policing and justice. It is therefore related to that project and with respect to the project of the devolution of policing and justice as a principle that I wish to make a few observations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="0903094000177"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morrow, is correct to say that for unionists this has been a long-held and cherished ambition. The problem is that it may be one of many unwise features of unionist political thought in the 20th century. It may be one of the less fortunate, less attractive or less intelligent aspects of thinking about politics that characterises Ulster Unionism. It is certainly the case that throughout the 1970s and 1980s and well into the 1990s, British Governments of both parties conventionally regarded the concept of devolution of policing and justice with special fear, concern and nervousness&#151;quite rightly in my opinion.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="0903094000178"></a>I wish to burden the House with an anecdote. In 1998 it was my wont to wander in and out of television studios in advocacy of the Good Friday agreement. After one such debate in which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, has pointed out, the fact that the agreement of 1998 makes provision in principle for the devolution  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_982"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 982</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of policing and justice had come up, I had said during the debate that this was a matter for a long time in the future. I received a call as I left the television studios congratulating me on saying this. The call was from the office of the then Secretary of State, Dr Marjorie Mowlam, and the person at the other end of the line said to me, &#147;Not for 20 years&#148;.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="0903094000179"></a>It is not 20 years since 1998&#151;we have moved remarkably quickly on this issue. Let me remind the House that in 1998 the assumption of my caller and of the Good Friday agreement was that the decommissioning of illegal weaponry would be completed by 2000. In actual fact, what was supposed to take two years took at least seven. We must realise that, even though it is quite right for the Government to say that they had a busy time with the St Andrews agreement and that devolution would occur by 2008 and it has not done so, we are still, in broad terms, moving remarkably quickly across some very difficult and fraught terrain.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="0903094000180"></a>The row over the weekend does not encourage the view that Northern Ireland is mature enough yet for the devolution of policing and justice. I know it is argued that the immaturity of current debate will disappear once the responsibility is devolved. However, very deep divisions have emerged. They emerged over the chief constable&#146;s decision to employ special forces even before the murders. The debate that has occurred since the murders does not encourage us to think that there is yet the kind of political culture in place which could operate effectively any devolution of policing and justice.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="0903094000181"></a>The House has been much concerned about the issue of haste. Many noble Lords have commented that the haste has been indecent and have asked why. There is a very simple answer. The perception in the Government was that the president of Sinn Fein needed something that could be presented as a political victory or a political gain with the European elections just around the corner. I am not sure that we are close to the devolution of policing and justice but at least this is something the Government could offer&#151;the fact that it had been pressed through these Houses so quickly. The very indignation expressed in both Houses is almost a part of the package.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="0903094000182"></a>Let me expand on that point. We are coming to the end of a style of dealing with the peace process. The assumption of government has been that at all times we must allow Sinn Fein to believe that there is further progress along the line which can be delivered and something more that can be presented. At no point do we present a closed door; the assumption is that this is dangerous. It is, by the way, not an unreasonable assumption of government. It is part of the reason why we have had so much success up to this point.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="0903094000183"></a>The trouble is that we are now running out of rope; we are running out of things that can be offered in the process. We may have reached the point where we have to speak truth unto power&#151;in this case, the power being the president of Sinn Fein. Two things must occur here: we must be fair and we must recognise and take seriously the nature of Irish republican political philosophy. We cannot afford to disregard this as casually as we sometimes do and make it into something that in our own minds we would prefer that it was.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_983"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 983</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90309-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="0903094000184"></a>Over the weekend, there was a very concerning turn in the debate. It occurred in relation to Sinn Fein mercifully saying that it supported the police apprehending the murderers at the weekend. None the less, Sinn Fein leaders were heard to say, about securocrats and the role of our intelligence services, that they were, as it were, as bad as the dissidents, that the two fed off each other, that they needed each other, that the two groups were locked into a conflict&#151;that they were morally on the same level&#151;but that some process was at stake: a process by which parts of the British establishment did not accept the Good Friday agreement. During my time in this House&#151;if this House may be considered to be part of the British establishment&#151;I have never heard one person express anything other than support for the Good Friday agreement. Some have expressed their concerns about the moral costs of that process but I have not heard in this particular sanctum one word uttered in a serious attempt to revise it or reverse it. That is what I mean by speaking truth unto power. We should send that message to Sinn Fein. We should not be prepared to allow our intelligence services to be dismissed as securocrats. I know that it is fashionable to be immensely neurotic about the security state at present but we should say clearly that there is a major problem in Northern Ireland&#151;the murders on Saturday night are proof of that&#151;and that we support the work of our intelligence services in trying to prevent similar outbreaks.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="0903094000185"></a>That is why I support the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, who asked the Minister to define national security as it applies to Northern Ireland. This is a central question in relation to the devolution of policing and justice: it is one of the most difficult matters. We hear, rightly or wrongly, that 15 per cent of our security and intelligence services&#146; activities at the moment are directed towards the dissident republican threat. That is a remarkably high percentage, given the scale of the other threats that the United Kingdom currently faces. It is therefore vital that when the new arrangements come in, it should be clear what the place of national security concerns and of our intelligence services are with respect to the other institutions, including the devolved institutions of policing and justice in Northern Ireland. I therefore fully support the request of the noble Viscount for clarification on that.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="0903094000186"></a>Finally, in the other place, some concerns about the Bill were dismissed on the ground that the Northern Ireland Assembly had already discussed them. We must respect the political realities of this process&#151;we have, in effect, to support the Bill&#151;but we do not have to accept the Northern Ireland Assembly as some type of intellectual gold standard before which we bow. If the Northern Ireland Assembly dismissed the matter, that does not mean that we should not discuss it. That is why I am particularly grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, who raised issues about the future role of the DPP and the Attorney-General under this new dispensation. It is perfectly true that the Northern Ireland Assembly was not much troubled by that question but it is the sort of thing that we should discuss in Committee.</p>

The people of Northern Ireland had hoped that murders such as these were a thing of the past. It is shocking that the perpetrators feel that they can derail the peace process by killing and maiming innocent people. We call on anyone who has any knowledge of who is responsible for this outrage&#151;they are members of a proscribed organisation&#151;to give information immediately to the police, so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice. I echo all noble Lords who have spoken of their anger and who have offered their deep sympathy to the families and friends of the two soldiers who were murdered and to the soldiers and civilians who were wounded, some seriously. We, too, thank the noble Baroness the Lord President and the officials in the Bill team who have attempted to explain this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="0903094000188"></a>Opening the Second Reading debate in the other place, the Secretary of State said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="0903094000223"></a>&#147;The Bill will provide an essential stepping stone to the completion of devolution, and it is a tribute to those in Northern Ireland whose political leadership and commitment has turned the peace process into an enduring political process. That political progress has been and continues to be significant, and it is essential that the momentum is maintained&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 4/3/09; col. 886.]</p>

<p><a name="0903094000212"></a>I agree with those sentiments entirely. However, the speed with which we have been forced to consider this important and highly complex legislation, which the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, condemned, has been admirably referred to by many noble Lords, especially by my noble friend Lord Smith of Clifton, and also, graphically, by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, who reminded us of the Constitution Committee&#146;s report that considered this Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, felt that the Bill could in no way be considered to be emergency legislation. The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Neill, pointed out that we could have had ample time since November to consider these measures, and that momentum provided no reason for haste.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="0903094000189"></a>On 18 November 2008, the Secretary of State welcomed the agreement between the First Minister and Deputy First Minister that set out an agreed process for devolving policing and justice in the Northern Ireland Assembly. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="0903094000224"></a>&#147;The Bill does not provide for when devolution will happen, nor does it provide for what is to devolve&#151;both of these still require further consideration by the parties and ultimately by Parliament&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903094000213"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morrow, who unfortunately is not in his seat, reminded us of this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="0903094000190"></a>How many more times must we come together to consider further legislation along this path? This is the eight piece of legislation covering the move towards devolution of policing and justice in Northern Ireland. Will the Minister guarantee that when there is further legislation to consider, it will not be presented to this House in a rushed and inappropriate way?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="0903094000191"></a>When I spoke in the debates on the humble Address following the gracious Speech presented by Her Majesty to Parliament in December, I anticipated a Bill of this kind. I spoke of the challenges that would face a Minister of Justice in Northern Ireland, and those challenges have not changed. They were spoken of again today, as my noble friend has reminded us. I also spoke of the positive effect that such a transfer of power would have. While a number of measures have been put in place already to provide for greater transparency and accountability in operational matters in Northern Ireland, and better performance in criminal justice and policing, the formal devolution to the Assembly will create the cross-community ownership of resourcing and policy matters. There will be enhanced opportunities for joined-up government.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="0903094000192"></a>On resourcing, in his Second Reading speech in another place, again on 4 March, the Northern Ireland First Minister and Member of Parliament for Belfast East said:</p>
<ul><a name="0903094000229"></a>&#147;confidence is about more than who will operate these structures; it is also about the funding of policing and justice&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903094000214"></a>He added:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="0903094000225"></a>&#147;There is no sense in Northern Ireland&#146;s Assembly having responsibility for policing and justice if it does not have the resources to do the job. It is therefore vital that the Government divvy up in this regard&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 4/3/09; col. 912.]</p>

<p><a name="0903094000215"></a>After the appalling circumstances of Saturday night, now is probably the right time for the Government to answer that question.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="0903094000193"></a>For as many years as I have been involved in policing and asked questions in this House about the adequacy of resourcing the Police Service of Northern Ireland, I have been assured that the chief constable has all the resources he needs. Clearly, that now needs to be looked at again in the light of this recent atrocity. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, referred to the imminent retirement of the chief constable and the debt or lack of &#163;50 million in the policing budget. He felt that that was unacceptable and extremely worrying. The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis of Drumglass, also commented strongly on the lack of resources, to which the chief constable has referred.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="0903094000194"></a>We do not get soldiers murdered in England and Wales and they should not be murdered in Northern Ireland, so will the Minister assure the chief constable that he will receive whatever extra resources he needs to ensure that these people are caught? Will he also clarify the national security issues referred to by the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, and the noble Lord, Lord Bew, who also referred to the dangers in security in Northern Ireland? The Northern Ireland First Minister seeks assurance on funding generally and so do I.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="0903094000195"></a>Criminal justice matters do not reside within a neat silo. There are some obvious opportunities for any future Minister in working with other departments. Today, my noble friend has restated the commitment on these Benches to the principle of the devolution of justice and policing matters to the Assembly. I therefore share my noble friend's regret that Schedule 1 to the Bill causes us such great difficulties, for the reasons he has set out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="0903094000196"></a>Given the context of policing in Northern Ireland, it is desperately important that we get this legislation right. I urge the noble Baroness to consider seriously the amendments which we will bring forward in Committee as a genuine attempt to provide proper safeguards for such a vital department.</p>

<a name="0903094000197"></a><b><a name="90309-0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0903094000335"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> My Lords, I echo the remarks made by all noble Lords about the murders on Saturday night, which were as merciless as they were cowardly.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="0903094000198"></a>Listening to all noble Lords, I have been very powerfully struck by the degree of unanimity around the House on devolution. Every single contributor has, directly or by implication, spoken of the desire to reinforce the durability of devolution and the debate has taken place in that spirit. The noble Lord, Lord Bew, helped us all when he said that we should not be timid about suggesting amendments to the Bill because, if we believe that the Bill will be improved by them, we have a duty to bring them forward.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="0903094000199"></a>The Bill is an amendment to the UK constitution and we sit in&#151;I was about to say the most important Parliament in the United Kingdom&#151;the Parliament which is sovereign in the United Kingdom. It is extremely important to keep at the front of our minds our duties towards the constitution; and to ensure that any amendments are responsible and improve the way in which our nation is governed. That is why I valued enormously the contribution by my noble friend Lord Goodlad.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="0903094000200"></a>In their speeches, many noble Lords also regretted the fact that this is emergency legislation. Of course, most Northern Ireland legislation that has come before your Lordships' House in recent years has been emergency legislation; and the reason for that is not hard to discern. The reason is that such legislation, typically, follows negotiated deals between the principal political parties; and there is a fear in the Government that, if it is not swiftly enshrined in statute, the deal will disappear almost before our eyes. So I understand the dilemma the Government face; but the interests of enduring devolution in Northern Ireland are not best served by this conduct. We have to take the risk that certain elements of deals will fall by the wayside for the greater benefit of getting the best devolution settlement we can for the UK constitution. That is not just a matter for those in Northern Ireland; it is a matter for us all.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="0903094000201"></a>I have two examples of what I have just said. The first is the situation of High Court judges in Northern Ireland. One of the unsatisfactory results of the devolution negotiations is that, once it takes place, there will be two sorts of High Court judges in the United Kingdom: those for England, Wales and Scotland and those appointed in Northern Ireland before devolution, all of whom can be dismissed only by a vote by both Houses of Parliament; and High Court judges in Northern Ireland appointed after devolution, who will not enjoy that protection.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="0903094000202"></a>However, I am pleased to see that, in the Bill, the Government have improved the situation in one important way for that class of High Court judges with respect to Sections 5 and 7 of the 2002 Act. Under those sections,  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_987"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 987</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the First and Deputy First Ministers of Northern Ireland have a crucial role to play in whether appointment or dismissal takes place. I am thankful that, in this Bill, the Government have replaced those parties by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. I regard that as exceedingly beneficial, and I congratulate the Government on making that change.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="0903094000203"></a>As the noble Baroness the Lord President and the noble and learned Baroness the Attorney-General are aware, I am much less happy about the relationship between the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland and the DPP in Northern Ireland, as envisaged following devolution. Under Section 42 of the 2002 Act:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="0903094000226"></a>&#147;The functions of the Director shall be exercised by him independently of any other person&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903094000216"></a>The problem about that section is that the DPP will not have the protection of a superintending Attorney-General, as the DPP has in England and Scotland. The result is that if the DPP is accused of political bias in instituting, or refusing to institute, a prosecution, as he inevitably will be from time to time, he will not be able to have his position defended in the Assembly in Northern Ireland by the Northern Ireland Attorney-General; and the DPP himself will have no right to go to the Assembly and defend himself.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="0903094000204"></a>The reason for this&#151;one can see how he came to be placed in this position&#151;is that, under the devolution arrangements, the Attorney-General in Northern Ireland is a purely political figure; he is selected solely by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. That selection is not even endorsed by the Assembly. So he does not have the quasi-judicial role, above and beyond politics, which the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, has, in the United Kingdom jurisdiction. That is why we have tabled our amendment on the Attorney-General.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="0903094000205"></a>The amendment seeks to give the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland a quasi-judicial role by appointing him in exactly the same way in which a High Court judge is appointed post-devolution. From that procedure, which would endow him with quasi-judicial powers, flows the second part of our amendment, which would give him superintendence powers over the Northern Ireland DPP, thereby providing that party with the necessary constitutional protection.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="0903094000206"></a>The Lord President very kindly applied herself to the amendment and made three points which I particularly want to question. First, she said that the arrangements in the 2002 Act were really a function of the circumstances of the time: that is to say, the <I>J</I><I>udicial </I><I>R</I><I>eview</I>, completed in 2000 and published in 2002. Will she be kind enough to explain what she thought the circumstances of the time were, and why, having done that, she thinks that they necessitated the arrangement that appeared in the 2002 Act? My noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew addressed that point, with his characteristic acuity, and observed, at the end of this phase of his remarks, that 2002 was now, and certainly in Northern Ireland political terms, a long way away. As he put it, characteristically modestly, it could well be said that the circumstances had changed to allow us, now, to give the kind of protection which the DPP needs in the circumstances of devolution in which he will operate.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_988"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 988</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90309-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="0903094000207"></a>The Lord President&#146;s second observation was that the Attorney-General should not be a political figure. However, with great respect, the Attorney-General will be a political figure in Northern Ireland because of the way in which he is chosen. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that it is the Attorney-General, as a political figure, who chooses the DPP, thereby compounding&#151;I use the following word metaphorically&#151;the felony.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="0903094000208"></a>Thirdly, the Lord President observed that the solution that we were adopting and advancing breached the separation of powers, because the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland would have a veto over the appointment of the Attorney-General by the Appointments Commission. With great respect, that observation was misconceived. What greater breach of the separation of powers could there be than a political Attorney-General appointing a DPP who had quasi-judicial prosecutorial powers in the jurisdiction?</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="0903094000209"></a>Having proposed and defended our amendment, I should say that, although I will speak to it again on Wednesday I do not propose to put it to a vote; partly because I hope that the Government will be so convinced by the power of the argument that they will amend the Bill, and partly because, perhaps more importantly in the present circumstances, we know that the first and second Ministers have already agreed on an Attorney-General for Northern Ireland through the political process. A few days ago, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, was kind enough to talk to me about this matter and I can see that voting could produce a difficult situation during a time which has been made even more sensitive by the tragedies of Saturday night. For that reason, too, I do not propose to put my amendment to the vote but&#151;some of your Lordships may be disappointed to hear&#151;I will say a few more words in Committee.</p>

It is always interesting to hear the insightful and constructive contributions of noble Lords in relation to Northern Ireland. Many of these issues are of extreme importance and we, the Government, as well as Members in this House, can learn greatly from that expertise and vast experience.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09030926000002"></a>In my opening comments I referred to the reduced timeframe in which this Government have had to consider the legislation. It is clear that all noble Lords are concerned and feel extremely strongly about this issue. But, as I stated at the beginning of this debate, the reduced timetable is not for the convenience of the Government but simply to ensure that the necessary legislative framework is in place to allow the Assembly to progress with the devolution of policing and justice at a pace determined by themselves. This is complex legislation and more time for scrutiny would be welcome.</p>

<a name="90309-0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09030926000003"></a>However, we have to ensure that the momentum is upheld. I note the views expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Neill, that momentum does not necessarily mean haste. I also agree with her that it is regrettable that, for all the obvious reasons, we have spent too much time this afternoon discussing the time allowed   


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_989"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 989</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rather than scrutinising much more important elements of the Bill. However, I must stress that the timetable has not been dictated by any deal, either before or behind closed doors. There is no deal. The speed with which we are dealing with this legislation does not have anything to do with the European elections. Nor, I must stress, is it a carrot to Sinn Fein.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09030926000004"></a>The Northern Ireland Bill is intended to give legislative effect to a political agreement between the Northern Ireland First and Deputy First Ministers and the recommendations of a committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly, which the Assembly have debated and endorsed. It faithfully reflects these agreements and recommendations, which, in response to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, may have something to do with the drafting of the Bill. The recommendations are aimed at paving the way for the future devolution of policing and justice. The Government have to be ready to move forward the parts of the process that are within our gift as quickly as possible. It is crucial that it is not the UK Government or Westminster who are seen to be preventing progress on this issue, but that the political process continues at the pace set by Northern Ireland&#146;s elected representatives. To leave open the possibility of completing the remaining legislative steps in the devolution process during the period between now and the Summer Recess&#151;that is not to say that that timescale will necessarily be used&#151;it is necessary for the Northern Ireland Bill to receive Royal Assent by mid-March. It would not have been possible to publish the Bill in draft or to make it subject to pre-legislative scrutiny and to meet this timetable, although I hear and respect the views of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad. However, it is fair to say that many elements of the Bill&#151;for example, those dealing with the new departmental model&#151;have been debated in detail by the Assembly.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09030926000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, suggested that the PSNI is not satisfactorily funded and, therefore, is not up to the job. The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, asked for my assurance that the necessary funding would be made available. The Government have full confidence in Sir Hugh Orde, and in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, to rise to whatever challenge is before them. On devolution, we are committed to transferring the funding required to enable all aspects of policing and justice to operate effectively. It is not in the Government&#146;s interests to do anything differently.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09030926000006"></a>My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has asked Jeremy Heywood to chair a group looking in detail at the funding situation for policing and justice in Northern Ireland. The group brings together interests from Whitehall and the devolved Administration in Northern Ireland to ensure that concerns about policing and justice budgets are properly addressed in the lead-up to devolution. I am confident that, at the point of devolution, we will be handing over a police service that is top rate, on top of the job, and properly funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09030926000007"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked whether, if devolved, the chief constable could ask for support from the SRR. National security remains an accepted matter, and, post-devolution, the chief constable will   


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_990"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 990</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>continue to be able to ask for specialist support from the military, as he sees fit, in the same way as other police services across the UK.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09030926000008"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, and the noble Lord, Lord Bew, also raised the question of national security. I cannot define the term &#147;national security&#148;. It has never been defined in UK statute. However, I am informed that national security is generally understood to relate to the safety and security of the state and its people. I refer noble Lords to paragraph 17 of Schedule 2 to the Northern Ireland Act, which relates to security in Northern Ireland. I ask noble Lords to note that national security is not devolved in Scotland, where policing and justice are already devolved, and it will not be devolved in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09030926000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, expressed concern, as did the noble Viscount, about whether Sinn Fein supports the police. Sinn Fein&#146;s indication that it would give support to the police was a key factor in securing a return to a devolved Government in May 2007. The Government believe that this support is genuine. Indeed, over the past few days, we have seen Sinn Fein politicians speak out about the weekend&#146;s atrocities and urge the public to provide any information that they might have to the PSNI to assist their inquiries. I am sure that the House will endorse that same point made by the noble Baroness&#151;that if anyone has any information relating to the atrocities, they must contact the PSNI. These people have to be brought to book.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09030926000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked if we met some criteria, which he stipulated. We have seen politics in Northern Ireland develop a position where all parties support peaceful democratic means and the criminal justice system. In relation to community support for devolution, that is one criteria set down by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in their November statement. It will be for the Northern Ireland Assembly to decide when the necessary confidence exists.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09030926000013"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, has great concerns about the Justice Minister and that he or she should not be dismissed by a simple cross-community vote. The noble Lord is right to suggest that the justice portfolio is special, which is why we have provided for a series of alternative models for the structure of a justice department. However, I do not agree that he is right to dismiss the cross-community vote as simple, as if it is a basic norm. It is not. It is a special arrangement put in place by the Belfast agreement which said that, as a safeguard, key decisions in the Assembly would be taken on a cross-community basis. It is not a routine measure, but a safeguard.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09030926000014"></a>The noble Lord suggested that it would be unfair for members of the Alliance Party to be voted out by a system that did not count their votes as equal to those  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_991"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 991</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of designated unionists or nationalists. That is to misunderstand the origins of the cross-community vote. It was to ensure that, unlike in the past, it would no longer be possible for one side of the community to impose measures on the other side, against their wishes. It was a safeguard designed to meet the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland which derived from its history. It is not a routine tool but designated for special circumstances, such as the appointment and removal of a Justice Minister.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09030926000015"></a>This Bill is not the place to unpick the safeguards of the Belfast agreement. If the current definitions of cross-community support were acceptable in 1998, at a time when trust was in its most embryonic state, the Government believe that it remains right to have that test today.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09030926000016"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morrow, was right last week to sound a note of caution about devolution, in view of the atrocities at the weekend. However, we cannot and must not allow the evil actions of a few to derail the peace process, which is so strongly supported and desired by the vast majority of the population and its elected representatives. I am grateful to the noble Lord for clearly explaining what the Bill does not do. It is right that the Government will not and must not impose the devolution of policing and justice. This can happen only when a Motion for the transfer of powers has been moved by the First and Deputy First Ministers and approved by the Assembly on a cross-community basis. It will then be brought to this House in the form of orders.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09030926000018"></a>Various noble Lords have asked me to ensure that adequate time is given to the debating of those orders. Adequate time will be given to the debating of those orders, and I will do my utmost to ensure that the orders are available well before the debate that takes place in this House so that noble Lords have an opportunity to consider them.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09030926000019"></a>I hear and respect the views articulated by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, but do not agree with many of them. The noble Lord referred to the lack of discussions in Northern Ireland relating to the devolution of policing and justice under the votes in the Executive and the Assembly. The votes were taken, and the majority view was that the report from the Executive, which followed up the agreement between the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, was acceptable and should be followed. That is democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09030926000020"></a>This Government, as I said earlier, are not complicit in any deal and are not working to any timetable. As I mentioned, the elected representatives of Northern Ireland, are driving the timetable here, not this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09030926000021"></a>In relation to the chief constable, as I said earlier, the Government have complete confidence in Hugh Orde.

There is a world of difference between suggesting, as does the noble Lord, that the police have abandoned the investigations and explaining, as did the chief constable, that the police have followed all their existing leads as far as they can and that taking their investigations further requires new evidence. The police remain as committed as ever to bringing the perpetrators to justice and I know that noble Lords would support me in asking, as I did earlier, that anyone with information, relating not just to the atrocities this weekend but to the previous serious attacks, should bring it forward to the police precisely so that they can continue with their investigations and the perpetrators can be brought to justice. The noble Lord suggested earlier that he has not had the opportunity to discuss some of these issues with the Secretary of State, but, as he knows, I am happy and willing to facilitate such a meeting.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09030926000024"></a>I am grateful for the views expressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, and his general support. I shall read his views carefully, especially those in relation to the Attorney-General, because he is an esteemed former Attorney-General. I completely agree that the response to this weekend&#146;s atrocities must be calm and well judged, and that we must be resolute.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09030926000025"></a>I entirely endorse the desire of the noble Lord, Lord Browne, to ensure that there will be confidence in future to allow the early devolution of policing and justice to the locally accountable legislative assembly. This must not be a mere aspiration; we have to make it a reality.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09030926000026"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, raised a series of issues, a couple of which I have dealt with. I should stress that the orders that I mentioned earlier will of course be affirmative. The noble Viscount suggested that the weapons used should have been decommissioned. The source of those weapons is an intelligence matter, and it is the long-standing practice of successive Governments not to comment on such matters. However, more generally, the IMC has made it clear that small quantities of weapons were held back by local groups in defiance of the instructions of their leadership. The noble Viscount raised the use of intercept evidence and its disclosure to the defence. He may be aware that the law in Northern Ireland is the same as that in England and Wales in both these areas. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has established a programme to look at the intercept-as-evidence issue following receipt of the Chilcot report last summer. That work will reach its conclusion in the coming months. On disclosure, there is an important principle of ensuring a fair trial. However, if there were clear evidence of a problem, I am sure that this is an area which would be considered further. The noble Viscount asked also about the disparity between prosecution and defence disclosure under the 1996 Act.  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_993"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 993</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The arrangements for prosecution and defence disclosure, which are the same in Northern Ireland as in England and Wales, were amended recently by the Criminal Justice Act 2003. I note the noble Viscount&#146;s comments on ensuring a level playing field in relation to disclosure in the context of an overall right to a fair trial. The disclosure provisions of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 are kept under review, and I shall of course convey the noble Viscount&#146;s concerns. On the disclosure arrangements for the Omagh trial, the conduct of individual trials is a matter for the independent presiding judge, which includes applications of the disclosure arrangements. As I mentioned, the legislative basis for disclosure was reviewed as recently as 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09030926000027"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, rightly brought to our attention the report of his excellent committee. I shall respond more fully to the report in Committee if I may. I also very much look forward to giving evidence to his committee as it looks into emergency legislation. The report asks about the role of the Prime Minister in relation to senior judicial appointments. The Northern Ireland Bill will essentially remove the post-devolution roles of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in these processes, which were set in the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. The legislation under which appointments and removals are currently governed, the Judicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978 and the 2002 Act, already provide significant roles for the Prime Minister. The Northern Ireland Bill does not substantively change the role of the Prime Minister as set out in the 1978 and 2002 Acts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09030926000028"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bew, raised many interesting issues. He is right that it is natural that all parties here and Northern Ireland approach devolution issues nervously. It is therefore quite extraordinary, as he said, that we have moved so far forward and so fast. I must read his contribution with care. I think that I have dealt with many of the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09030926000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is absolutely right that we have to ensure the best possible deal for devolution and to get it right: it is our duty to get it right. These are constitutional issues and we must have confidence that we are acting correctly. I am grateful for the noble Lord&#146;s support for the changes in relation to the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

The First Minister and Deputy First Minister will of course be from different parties, so we can be confident that the person in question will be independent, of excellent reputation and not political.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09030926000031"></a>The Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 on the relationship between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney-General provides that it should be consultative. That was seen by the criminal justice review as the best way of ensuring visible independence of prosecutorial decisions. As a matter of law, a statutory duty of consultation requires meaningful consultations. It ensures that a wide range of matters will be discussed, including the code of practice for prosecutors.

The DPP will also be answerable to the Assembly for financial and administrative matters, but of course the DPP can consult the Attorney-General who himself will be able to answer questions in the Assembly.</p>

I thank noble Lords for their considered contributions to today&#146;s debate. I welcome the concern expressed because it is right and it is our duty to be honest, but I also welcome the active interest that noble Lords continue to take not only in this specific issue but in Northern Ireland in general.</p>

The Statement is as follows.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09030926000035"></a>&#147;Mr Speaker, with permission I should like to make a Statement about the horrific attack last Saturday at Massereene army base in Antrim. The focus for this sickening crime was civilians and young soldiers of the 38 Engineer Regiment, part of 19 Light Brigade.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09030926000036"></a>The House will know that Operation Banner&#151;the deployment of troops in Northern Ireland&#151;was brought to an end in July 2007 and that 38 Engineer Regiment is part of the Northern Ireland garrison. These men and women are part of the new arrangements in which soldiers are based in Northern Ireland for deployment anywhere throughout the world. They are not about a garrison to replace Operation Banner.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09030926000037"></a>These soldiers were in the process of being deployed for active service in Afghanistan, to support international efforts, to stabilise and to bring peace to that region. At the time of the attack, most of their colleagues had already left for this deployment. A small number remained, awaiting their deployment to begin within hours. While waiting, a small number of soldiers decided to order food from Domino&#146;s Pizza in Antrim. At about 9.40 pm, the delivery arrived in two separate cars. The soldiers came out of the main gate of the barracks. The cars delivering the pizzas were parked fewer than 10 yards away. As they did so, two masked gunmen opened fire.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_995"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 995</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90309-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09030926000038"></a>The initial volley of shots was followed by a second. The attackers clearly were intent to kill the soldiers and the civilians. They continued firing at the men even when injured; even when some had fallen to the ground. The firing lasted for more than 30 seconds. More than 60 shots were fired. Neither the soldiers nor the civilians had a chance against the premeditated attempt at mass murder. Two of the soldiers were killed. The families were informed yesterday and this morning the MoD released their names.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09030926000039"></a>Sapper Patrick Azimkar and Sapper Mark Quinsey were held in the highest regard by everyone in their regiment. Patrick Azimkar was just 21. He was looking forward to facing the challenges of his first operational tour in southern Helmand. Mark Quinsey, who was 23, was equally looking forward to the operational challenges that he would face in Afghanistan. Two more soldiers were seriously injured. The attack was just as barbaric on the civilians from the pizza company. Both were injured&#151;one extremely seriously. There can be no doubt that those responsible were intent to take the lives of all of these men. Before commenting further, I know that the House will want to join me in expressing our deepest condolences to the families of those who were murdered and to send our sympathy to the injured and all those families, who too are victims of this act of terrible violence which has rightly been described as evil.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09030926000040"></a>Immediately after the attack, fellow soldiers from 38 Engineer Regiment went to the aid of their friends. They tended the wounded and cared for the dying. I had the honour of meeting some of these young men and women yesterday morning. Today my right honourable friend the Prime Minister flew to Northern Ireland and with him I met this group of outstanding young soldiers. I put on the record the admiration that we all have for these young men and women. They are the greatest credit to our country and I know that I speak for the whole House in saying how proud we are of them.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09030926000041"></a>It is now the job of the PSNI to conduct the investigation to bring to justice those who murdered and injured these soldiers and civilians. A major investigation is now under way. This morning both the Prime Minister and I had further briefings with the chief constable Sir Hugh Orde, our intelligence advisers and Brigadier George Norton, Command 38 (Irish) Brigade and NI Garrison.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09030926000042"></a>The House will wish to know that everything that can be done is being done. It is too early for me to report on the progress of the criminal investigation. However, I should tell the House that yesterday evening the so-called Real IRA claimed responsibility for this act of extreme brutality. Whatever self-styled name these murderers choose to use, the House will correctly recognise them as barbaric criminals who are prepared to carry out an act of pre-meditated mass murder&#151;callously murdering innocent people going about their daily business. They are simply brutal and cowardly killers.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09030926000043"></a>The numbers of people who make up these criminal groups are relatively few. However, they are no less dangerous for their small numbers. We know that they

The police have asked for everyone in the community who has information to come forward. They should do so as a matter of urgency. Anyone in the Antrim area or beyond on Saturday who may have seen anything suspicious in the vicinity of Domino&#146;s Pizza or on the Randalstown Road, close to Massereene Barracks, should contact the PSNI.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09030926000044"></a>The House will want to know that all political leaders and political parties in Northern Ireland have condemned this evil act. They are all united not only in their condemnation and their expressions of condolence to the families but in their demand that anyone who can help should come forward. They join in these expressions with my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and all the party leaders in this House. It is only right for me to record the expressions of support and sympathy that we immediately received from the Taoiseach and President McAleese. Indeed, messages of support and condolence have come from the United States, including from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and President Obama last night made his position very clear, condemning in the strongest terms the attack and making clear his support for the people of Northern Ireland who have chosen a future of peace, reconciliation and prosperity.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09030926000045"></a>It may be helpful if I provide the House with further information about the current levels of security threat in Northern Ireland. As the House will know, both the chief constable and I have made public our view that the level of threat posed by dissident republicans has recently been higher than at any time in the past six years. Since 2008 they have mounted 18 attacks: 15 during 2008; and three so far this year. The House will be aware that last week the Security Service raised the level of threat from Irish-related terrorism from substantial to severe in Northern Ireland. This was a carefully calibrated decision, based on the overall assessment of the past nine months. This period includes the attempted murder of police officers, the savage attacks on those dropping their children at school and the failed car bomb in Castlewellan on 27 January 2009.</p>

<a name="90309-0007.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09030926000046"></a>There was some uncertainty last week about the wisdom of raising the threat level. I believe that this was the right decision and entirely justified. Policing in Northern Ireland enjoys the highest levels of confidence from the public. In my judgment it is absolutely essential that the chief constable has operational independence. Of course he is accountable to the Policing Board under the Patten arrangements. He will, if he sees fit, enjoy the same rights as any other chief constable in the UK to request further technical back-up if so needed. That would be the case in, say, dealing with a threat from al-Qaeda and international terrorism; so, too, for any terrorist threat.</p>

<a name="90309-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09030926000047"></a>Indeed, we made that clear at the end of Operation Banner. In a Statement to this House on 31 July 2007, my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence, Bob Ainsworth, said that after 1 August the vast majority of military support in Northern Ireland would be broadly comparable to the assistance that is currently provided in Great Britain, tailored for the particular circumstances in Northern Ireland. He also

<a name="90309-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09030926000048"></a>Whatever concerns honourable Members may have expressed last week&#151;and it may be appropriate to comment on the serious distortions and misleading reports in some of the media at that time&#151;I hope that they will now feel reassured about the role of any technical support being used to tackle the current threat. As the chief constable has repeatedly said, this is not about the return of troops to the streets but about protecting the public proportionately and protecting those who provide that protection, such as police officers and those who work to protect the international community or on international theatre operations.</p>

<a name="90309-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09030926000049"></a>It has been 12 years since the death of a soldier in Northern Ireland. This has been a very dark few days for Northern Ireland, but it is a temporary darkness at the end of a tunnel of considerable light. The peace process and political progress, as part of shared power, have transformed Northern Ireland. The perpetrators of this attack believe that they can stall that progress and, in stalling it, instil seeds of self-destruction. Indeed, they have clearly chosen to act in this evil way only because the politics of a shared future is working. The determination and resolve of all political leaders in the face of this brutal act is working proof of a unity of purpose.</p>

<a name="90309-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09030926000050"></a>We are all united in our resolve that the criminals will not succeed. Our confidence will be stronger, our resolve even greater, and while the House will understandably be sombre as a result of this murderous attack, the greatest memorial to Patrick Azimkar and Mark Quinsey and their families will be in our determination to unite behind the peace process and political progress in Northern Ireland. Let us make sure that those responsible for this attack are not given any opportunity to stall or prevent the progress of Northern Ireland. Let us join together; let this House send an unequivocal message. The men of violence will not succeed. These criminals will not succeed&#151;not now, not ever&#148;.</p>

The murdered men were about to travel to Afghanistan to serve their country and to support the Afghan people. The awful events of the weekend remind us, once again, of the bravery of all those who serve in the Armed Forces, the PSNI and the security services. We also thank the emergency services and medical staff; we are, indeed, all indebted to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09030926000053"></a>The Independent Monitoring Commission review confirmed our concerns about the dissident threat. We have raised those concerns here and in another place. The attack follows a succession of near misses on police. The chief constable of the PSNI has been consistent and increasingly public about the threat posed by dissident republican groups. That must tell  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_998"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 998</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>us how seriously he viewed the severity of the situation. I confirm our firm support for the operational independence of the chief constable. Like every other chief constable in the United Kingdom, he must have the right to enlist the help of specialists. Can the noble Baroness confirm that the decision of the chief constable to call in reconnaissance experts would not have been affected had criminal justice and policing been devolved?</p>

<a name="90309-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09030926000054"></a>The aim of these attacks is to try to disrupt normal policing, forcing police into barracks and armoured vehicles away from the public. We must not allow that objective to succeed but, rather, we must ensure that a balance be struck between the need to increase protection for officers and to ensure that the police are visible and known to their communities.</p>

<a name="90309-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09030926000055"></a>The Government raised the threat level from substantial to severe last week. Was that change due to specific intelligence received or a response to the general security situation? Were civilian guards briefed on the current threat level and individual establishments chased up to ensure that it was understood and that appropriate measures had been taken to account for it? Given the understandable and desirable pursuit of normalisation, which we on these Benches strongly support, will the Government conduct an immediate review of the security arrangements at police stations and military installations? Lastly, in this context, what are the implications for defence installations in the rest of the United Kingdom?</p>

<a name="90309-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09030926000056"></a>The attackers showed a chilling ruthlessness in shooting their victims a second time, on the ground. Do the Government not agree that such cold brutality suggests that these were experienced terrorists? The crime scene will reveal valuable ballistic and forensic evidence. The experience from previous investigations shows that speed is of the essence. Will the noble Baroness confirm that these murders will receive top priority and that the most competent and experienced officers will be in charge of the investigation?</p>

<a name="90309-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09030926000057"></a>I confirm that the position of the Official Opposition is to support the Government&#146;s efforts to bring these criminals to justice. We believe that they have no support in the wider community. The support for the police investigation from all political parties is welcome. The key to defeating terrorism in Northern Ireland lies with all parts of the community. I endorse the Secretary of State&#146;s appeal yesterday for anyone with information on these criminal acts to come forward; even the smallest piece of information could be vital and might help to bring this investigation to a swift conclusion.</p>

<a name="90309-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09030926000058"></a>Thanks to the peace process, which was begun by the previous Government and continued by this one, Northern Ireland has been transformed. An unrepresentative minority of dissidents are determined to undo the good work of the past 15 years. It is incumbent on us all to respond to this shocking attack by going about our business normally, but with increased vigilance; the good work of recent years must continue. Terrorism in any form must never succeed.</p>

Those two young men were doing their duty and serving the whole community, before proceeding to Afghanistan. Our condolences go to their families, friends and colleagues&#151;some of whom are still in Antrim, some already in Afghanistan. We also send our thoughts and sympathies to the families of those injured in the attack and continue to have in our thoughts the staff of Antrim Area Hospital, who continue to care for the wounded.

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09030926000060"></a>We utterly condemn this outrageous atrocity. As we saw and heard from the people of Antrim in the media this morning, this attack has been roundly condemned and received no justification or support from any quarter. These brutal murders serve no cause, nor have they resulted in anything but suffering for the families involved. We add our voice to those who have appealed for anyone with any information about this shocking attack to report it to the police, and to co-operate with the police investigation. We also reinforce our support for the chief constable, Sir Hugh Orde, and his PSNI officers who have been subject to several&#151;thankfully, so far, unsuccessful&#151;attacks in recent months.</p>

I have two questions for the noble Baroness. First, will she confirm that any additional resources that are needed for this investigation will be given to the PSNI? Secondly, does she agree that the people of Antrim have sent a great message to those who carried out this barbaric act? By coming together in a quite remarkable and quiet dignity, they have shown that nothing will set the peace process back and that there is no appetite from the people of Northern Ireland to go back to the violence of the past.</p>

With every ounce of sincerity that I can muster, I appeal from these Benches that there should be no retaliation in Northern Ireland for the dreadful execution that occurred at Massereene barracks. It is important to us all. It would be an insult to the families of those who have lost loved ones if any retaliation took place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09030926000067"></a>On the issue of intelligence, I have had 12 responses to Parliamentary Questions in the past three or four months; 50 per cent of these have been non-answers in so far as I have been told that this is an operational intelligence matter. Particularly in the light of the Prime Minister&#146;s unequivocal statement that these killers will be brought to justice, I should like to know the state of intelligence in Northern Ireland at the moment. We have had the chief constable for months tell us about the dangers. We have had the recent warning. We have had an unequivocal statement by the Prime Minister. Yet one Parliamentary Answer that I got seems to contradict it all, saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09030926000165"></a>&#147;The PSNI is also unable to provide information on charges relating specifically to dissident republican attacks as they are not attributed to individual dissident groupings. The Public Prosecution Service does not record what organisation a suspect is believed to represent in its conviction statistics&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/11/08; col. WA318.]</p>

<p><a name="09030926000161"></a>Is there not a contradiction? Are we not having a cover-up? Is there intelligence and, if so, why is it not acted on? Is there no intelligence and is that why we find ourselves with this guessing game, which was not at the weekend successful?</p>

There is widespread distaste at what occurred at the weekend across the whole of Northern Ireland, in both communities. However, one has to say that there seems to have been a lack of security at Massereene barracks. We should not hesitate to say that. There had been a severe warning, and what kind of security existed at the barracks at that time must be fully investigated.</p>

So often it is the same pattern: they were congregating or queuing up outside the entrance to a police station in Baghdad. That seems to occur so regularly in Iraq. The trouble is that in a situation in which there is a serious threat from the Real IRA, you should not be meeting or congregating outside barracks or police stations.</p>

However, at the same time, there is an adverse effect that must be a warning. People are concerned and become more divided when instances such as this happen. The one message that I got in Northern Ireland today, mainly from the unionist community, was that they were told that the Provisional IRA had done away with all its firearms and explosives. This new Real IRA has Semtex&#151;and now we see that it as automatic weapons. Was that Semtex and were those automatic weapons owned previously by the Provisional IRA, or has the Real IRA imported into Northern Ireland new explosives and new automatic weapons?</p>

In addition, following any such attack, the security at all barracks is looked into again, and I am confident that that is taking place now. As to whether the Semtex was a new source or whether these were missiles or guns which had been in use in the past, I do not know. If I can, I will come back to the noble Lord in writing.

In relation to the pursuit of the perpetrators, we do not know where they come from, but I am confident that there will be proper co-operation, if necessary, with the police in the south as well as with the PSNI.

I was therefore very glad to hear that its investigation will receive top priority.

The Statement is as follows:</p>

<a name="90309-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09030926000087"></a>&#147;Mr Speaker, the Chancellor is travelling to Brussels, ahead of the meeting of the European Community Finance Ministers tomorrow, to discuss the G20 Finance Ministers&#146; meeting this weekend. He has therefore asked me to make this Statement.</p>

<a name="90309-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09030926000088"></a>The asset protection scheme was announced in January. In his Statement on 26 February, my right honourable friend gave details of the participation of the RBS Group, and he mentioned the negotiations under way with Lloyds. The approach we adopted with Lloyds is similar to that with RBS. Discussion involved a large amount of complex detail and it was important to take time to reach a satisfactory conclusion. An agreement, in principle, has now been reached

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09030926000089"></a>Under the asset protection scheme, the Government will provide protection against certain credit losses on particular assets in exchange for a fee. A first loss, similar to the excess in insurance policies, remains with the institution. Lloyds will meet all of this. The protection provided by the Government will cover 90 per cent of the remaining loss. The other 10 per cent will remain with the institutions as an incentive to manage the assets prudently. The Government will accept applications to the scheme from other eligible institutions until 31 March.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09030926000090"></a>Lloyds announced on Saturday its intention to place &#163;260 billion of assets in the scheme, on which it has already taken impairments of some &#163;10 billion, and through the first loss mechanism it will retain a further exposure of &#163;25 billion. Any losses beyond this will be borne 90 per cent by the Treasury and 10 per cent by Lloyds. The protection will cover a range of assets, including mortgages, unsecured personal loans, corporate and commercial loans and Treasury assets.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09030926000091"></a>Lloyds will pay a fee of &#163;15.6 billion in new non-voting B shares. These will count as core tier 1 capital. The Treasury has also agreed to replace its existing &#163;4 billion of preference shares. Current shareholders will be able to purchase these ordinary shares as part of an open offer. The Treasury will take up its pro-rata share of the open offer, so maintaining its minimum voting share at 43.5 per cent, and will subscribe for any additional shares not taken up by existing shareholders. If no other shareholders take up their entitlements, the Treasury&#146;s ownership of ordinary shares will increase to 65 per cent. Taking into account B shares paid as a fee, its economic ownership will reach up to 77 per cent.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09030926000092"></a>As my right honourable friend set out, the asset protection scheme is a key step to put banks on a stronger footing, insuring their balance sheets and boosting lending to businesses and individuals. As part of this deal, in return for access to the asset protection scheme, Lloyds has agreed to increase its lending by an additional &#163;14 billion over the next 12 months: &#163;3 billion for homebuyers and &#163;11 billion for business lending. It has made a similar commitment for 2010. Consistent with RBS, Lloyds will also be required to present a detailed implementation plan to the Government and to report monthly on compliance with the lending agreements. The Government will publish an annual report on these arrangements, which will be made available to Parliament. The agreements are binding and will be reflected in the performance-related pay of bank staff involved.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09030926000093"></a>Another condition for Lloyds&#151;as for any bank participating in the scheme&#151;is a requirement to develop a sustainable long-term remuneration policy. This means reviewing policies and implementing new policies consistent with the FSA&#146;s new code of remuneration practice. We have agreed that no discretionary bonuses will be paid in 2009, except to junior staff earning on average &#163;20,000, and that there will be no annual free award of shares at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09030926000094"></a>At the heart of the current financial and economic problems around the world is a crisis of confidence about bank assets. Lack of confidence is having profound effects on UK companies and individuals who are not able to secure business loans or mortgages. The critical obstacle to expanding lending is uncertainty about the value of banks&#146; balance sheets, so we are acting now to enable the banks to clean up their balance sheets, making them more able to lend to individuals and businesses. Transformation will not happen overnight, but this is the essential starting point, and it must go hand in hand with broader reform of banking supervision and regulation.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09030926000095"></a>Action must be taken, not only here but by Governments across the world. The alternative is a failure of the banking system, here and elsewhere, which would make the recession longer and more painful, and put more jobs at risk. Getting the banks to lend again is essential to our economic recovery and to our fight against the global recession.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09030926000096"></a>The Government are clear that British banks are best owned and managed commercially, and not by the Government. The future of the UK as a financial centre, and the future of our economy and thousands of jobs, depends on being able to run banks commercially. All countries are having to deal with the same problem: how to isolate assets which are damaging confidence in the banking sector and preventing banks from lending more. Over the coming weeks, we will continue to discuss with other countries, including the US and the European Union, how best to co-ordinate our approach to the common challenges we face.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09030926000097"></a>As part of our presidency of the G20, the Chancellor recently wrote to Finance Ministers setting out a set of shared principles for dealing with asset protection and insurance.

<p><a name="09030926000163"></a>What shares, and what open offer? Are there to be two offers, one to the Treasury and another to shareholders, or is there to be one offer only? If it is to the shareholders, they had probably better watch out. They are a pretty sad collection, who have had their savings almost completely wiped out through the merger with HBOS&#151;a merger brokered by the Prime Minister which has proved to be as disastrous as his sale of gold. I know that it was not opposed by my party, but that was on the assumption that the Government would have taken appropriate steps to ensure that they knew what they were doing with the step that they were promoting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09030926000101"></a>The Statement says that the Government will not be interfering in the running of the bank. How can that be reconciled with specifying lending levels and dictating salary particulars? Lloyds is to lend &#163;14 billion in the next year and another &#163;14 billion the following year. What will happen if it fails to meet these targets? Will it be forced into making loans that it might otherwise not make, or which it deems to be imprudent? Is another banking bubble being created? We are where we are today because of inappropriate and imprudent lending. Pressure on banks must inevitably mean pressure to make marginal loans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09030926000102"></a>If bonuses are to be forbidden in the current year, will this result in constructive dismissal for some senior executives? If so, have they had to be compensated with higher basic salaries, which are, after all, the other side of the remuneration package? Or have all the senior executives voluntarily surrendered any bonuses to which they may have been entitled? Mr Daniels of Lloyds bank said that he was not able to do proper and due diligence before Lloyds bank purchased HBOS. Can the Minister say whether there has been a proper look at the enlarged bank before committing so much more money on this occasion?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09030926000103"></a>Each time that a new injection is made to the banking sector, fresh assurances are given. How many more times will fresh capital, fresh guarantees or other forms of financing be needed? Perhaps the Minister could tell us. Where the Government are a shareholder, are they capable of permitting a good commercial decision if it is a bad political decision? Or will the difficulty of doing this make it impossible for the Government to leave banks to be run on a commercial basis, as they have said that they will?</p>

The Statement says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09030926000168"></a>&#147;The Government are clear that British banks are best owned and managed commercially and not by the Government&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030926000164"></a>The truth is that both RBS and now Lloyds Banking Group are effectively owned by the Government. The big issue with which we are still grappling&#151;and the Government certainly are&#151;is what this means in terms of the management of the bank and whether, having put such huge amounts of public money into it, the bank will now be run in the public interest.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09030926000105"></a>The Government have said they are not going to be involved in the running of the bank. We might be less concerned about this, given that they have set out some general principles, if Mr Daniels had not described taxpayers&#146; shareholding as just another name on the share register. For the British public, that attitude is not acceptable. Does the Minister believe that Mr Daniels, if that is his view, is the right person to continue in his position at the bank? Can the Minister also tell us what the consequences of today&#146;s announcement are in terms of the composition of the board of the bank? Will additional government directors now be appointed?</p>

What is not clear to me is what that is additional to. Is it additional to the amount of lending that Lloyds was undertaking a year ago or additional to some unspecified level of lending that the board agreed but of which we are ignorant? Given the high amount of government involvement, additional expenditure and commitment to the bank, we need greater clarity on what this alleged additional expenditure is going to consist of.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09030926000107"></a>Remuneration is clearly going to be looked at by the Government. A number of issues will no doubt arise about existing members of staff. Will Sir James Crosby still be entitled to his pay-off and pension pot and will the same apply to Mr Cummings, whose disastrous commercial property loans helped destroy HBOS but who still has a &#163;6 million pension pot? The Government say there will not be bonuses to the extent previously planned. Can the Minister confirm that &#163;80 million is still being planned as bonuses for the coming year? We accept that the bank&#146;s staff may be unhappy to have their bonuses removed, even low-paid bonuses; that may not be good for morale, which is the reason given for retaining bonuses. But can the Minister accept that the decisions that the Government have had to make in respect of the banks are bad for the morale of the British public when it sees billions of pounds going into institutions which would otherwise be bust? Given his long-standing commercial experience and understanding, can the Minister tell us whether any other company in this circumstance would still be offering bonuses to staff for any reason whatsoever?</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09030926000108"></a>Finally, can the Minister accept&#151;I am sure that he does&#151;that private shareholders feel deeply aggrieved about what has happened to them and are unclear about the options which were explored by the Government when the merger between Lloyds TSB and HBOS went ahead? The Government have published part of their evidence in respect of this to the Office of Fair Trading. That evidence explains that they were looking at alternatives to the merger at that point but not why they rejected them. Can the Minster explain that now?</p>

If existing shareholders take up their shares and the Government take up only their pro-rata ownership, the Government&#146;s ownership shareholding will be maintained but private shareholders will also maintain their shareholding. If private shareholders do not take up the shares consequent on the conversion, the Government&#146;s shareholding will increase.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, asked about the lending conditions and whether these were not evidence of the fact that the Government  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1008"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1008</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>were engaging in the management of the banks. It is necessary to see those lending conditions&#151;on which I will say more in a moment in response to a question from the noble Lord, Lord Newby&#151;as being an integral part of the transaction, the exchange of value. The Government are providing additional support for Lloyds Banking Group in exchange for Lloyds Banking Group entering into lending commitments. Lloyds believes that it can meet those commitments in accordance with its existing credit criteria. There would be no sense at all in the Government encouraging banks to lend irresponsibly.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09030926000111"></a>No one is being constructively dismissed from Lloyds Banking Group by virtue of the decision on bonuses. A number of members of the board of Lloyds Banking Group have voluntarily surrendered their rights and entitlement in respect of bonuses, and for that I commend them. They set an example which others should have followed.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09030926000112"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, mentioned questions concerning due diligence and the observations made by Mr Eric Daniels to the Treasury Select Committee that he had insufficient time to carry out due diligence on behalf of Lloyds TSB before proposing the acquisition of HBOS. The Treasury has carried out considerable due diligence on the loans which Lloyds is putting into the asset protection scheme but there is still a great deal more work to be done. That is why these asset protection agreements will not be completed until early summer.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09030926000113"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, asked whether I believe that the board of Lloyds and Government will be able to make the distinction between a good commercial decision and a bad political one. The fact that the Government wish to keep the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group in the listed company sector, accountable and responsible to all shareholders, is clear evidence of the fact that we recognise that these banks must be run in a commercial manner, accountable to all shareholders rather than treating one shareholder as being more influential than another. That also answers the first of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, about these two banks being nationalised. They are not nationalised; they are public companies in which the Government are a large shareholder, but only temporarily.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09030926000114"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked whether Mr Eric Daniels was the right person to continue in his position at the bank. I would encourage noble Lords to take account of the excellent record of Lloyds TSB under the leadership of Mr Eric Daniels when seeking to form a view on his competence as the chief executive of a banking group. His capacity to manage in an effective way the day-to-day affairs of a major bank was very evident in the way he performed those duties at Lloyds TSB. However, it must obviously be a matter for shareholders whether they regard Mr Daniels and his colleagues as the right people to be leading the enlarged group.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09030926000115"></a>In making that observation, I also draw attention to the fact that some 80 per cent of the assets that Lloyds Banking Group is placing into the asset protection programme come from the old HBOS business as opposed to the Lloyds business, which provides some  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1009"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1009</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>further verification of the skills of the Lloyds banking team. Noble Lords will no doubt be aware that the senior management of the new Lloyds Banking Group is drawn almost solely from previous employees of Lloyds TSB, with very few of those senior positions being held by former executives of HBOS. Lloyds Banking Group is able to make these lending commitments, which are in addition to the loans that it had already intended to extend&#151;they truly are additional loans&#151;in the light of the fact that it now has, at a 14 per cent level, one of the strongest core tier one capital ratios of any bank in the world. In the steps that we have taken with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, we have put the capital levels to levels that compare very favourably with those in many other jurisdictions.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09030926000116"></a>Questions were also asked by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, about the pensions and other entitlements of Sir James Crosby and Mr Peter Cummings. Noble Lords will no doubt be aware that the executives of UK Financial Investments, the body that holds these shares on behalf of the Treasury, has asked Sir Victor Blank and Sir Philip Hampton, respectively chairmen of Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, to carry out investigations into the conduct of directors in the Royal Bank of Scotland and in HBOS. Those investigations are being carried out with the support of external legal advisers, and no doubt reports will be made back to those boards. I emphasise to noble Lords that the decisions taken will be for the boards of the new RBS and the new Lloyds Banking Group, rather than for individual shareholders.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09030926000117"></a>There was a final question from the noble Lord, Lord Newby, as to the circumstances in which a loss-making group can pay bonuses. The answer lies in good schemes that attempt to localise performance objectives and tie them up within an overall corporate objective. For example, you can have a branch that has performed exceedingly well. You can have a counter clerk who, through her performance, engagement with customers and helpfulness has achieved individual performance goals. Many of these schemes attempt to ensure that there can be that localised identification of an exceptional contribution by an individual, notwithstanding that the group as a whole may not achieve its targets. From my experience, we had similar challenges at Marks and Spencer during a difficult time, and this is not an easy issue to get right. I believe that is why the directors of Lloyds Banking Group, if they were here rather than me, would explain that they are attempting to pay modest bonuses, notwithstanding the very large losses that the newly combined group has reported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09030926000119"></a>I have another question. As the Treasury is effectively underwriting the rights issue and the share price that will be in that rights issue, does that mean that the Treasury has approved a particular price in advance of the due diligence that it is now doing?</p>

It is a scheme that is designed for banks; it is not designed for organisations whose primary activity is in another line of business.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09030926000121"></a>The agreements reached with the boards of the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Lloyds Banking Group are sufficiently detailed for those boards and the Treasury to enter into commitments, while recognising that much further work needs to be done to be assured that we understand the toxicity of the assets and to ensure that we are putting a sufficiently strong and robust ring fence around the most at-risk assets. The structure of the scheme is designed to ensure that the first loss arising from the normal course of business will continue to be held by the shareholders of the banks, whereas extreme loss, or high-stress loss, will fall into the asset protection scheme in respect of 90 per cent of that loss.</p>

<a name="90309-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09030926000122"></a>Finally, my noble friend asked whether we are underwriting. We are not underwriting a public offer in the sense that we have already committed &#163;4 billion of equity to the Lloyds Banking Group, which is currently held in the form of preference shares. Those are tier one capital, but not core tier one. By converting them to ordinary shares, they become core tier one, and it is those shares on which we are offering a claw-back facility to the other shareholders of Lloyds Banking Group. If those shareholders do not take up those shares, the Government will continue to have a &#163;4 billion exposure, albeit now in the form of ordinary shares rather than preference shares.</p>

The merger was promoted by the board of directors of Lloyds TSB, agreed by the directors of HBOS and agreed with alacrity and a very huge majority by the shareholders of both banks. The Government subserviated the interests of competition to the need for financial stability in the context of enabling the merger to take place but did not in any circumstances promote such a transaction.</p>

I have spoken in the past at this Dispatch Box about the inadequacies of supervision. Boards clearly failed in their supervision, management and direction of these major banking institutions and they were enabled in that failure by institutional shareholders who inadequately engaged with them and in many cases approved the strategies which proved to be seriously value-destructive. Sir David Walker is carrying out a review of the governance of banks and I will be making a speech on this subject at the National Association of Pension Funds in Edinburgh later this week. I wish I could share what I am going to say but, as I have not decided what to say, I cannot do that. No doubt some junior Treasury official will give me some words which I will either use or not use, depending on whether I find them appealing. I will try to maintain my own freedom of thought, despite the oppressive powers of the Civil Service to constrain a Minister from expressing his views on anything. I say that in the knowledge that they cannot get to me when I am standing at the Dispatch Box.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Turner, will on 18 March be producing his report on regulation. I believe that will produce a number of important themes around capitalisation, macro-prudential regulation, liquidity management and the responsibility of directors. There is also a global context which we need to pursue as part of the G20 and revisiting the role of the Financial Stablity Forum and the IMF.

You could have said that every syndicate in Lloyd&#146;s was toxic but most of them survived that process and came to a very big fulfilment. The only way to approach the so-called toxic fund is to regard it as another reconstruction and renewal fund. For that purpose there is one thing the

The businesses in this toxic fund are not sole-banked with Lloyds Bank or the Royal Bank of Scotland. They are often syndicated among many other banks and you have to prevent the virus from spreading to the destruction of the banks around them. If the Minister brings in the principle of London Rules, he will have the means of regulating the multi-bank process now and giving an enormous advantage to the rescue process.

I did use the word &#147;toxic&#148; and it probably is an incorrect word. I have no difficulty in saying sorry. The issue around these assets is partly to do with the fact that they are poisonous, in that correct definition of toxic, but also that they are currently suffering from illiquidity. One of the virtues of the type of scheme that we have offered the banks is that it provides an opportunity for time and patience to see values recover. As the noble Lord, Lord James of Blackheath, knows, the London Rules worked rather well in a different environment. I am not sure they would work as well now in an environment in which loans are so widely distributed and where the lenders are based all over the world and the asset is now often in the hands of a hedge fund rather than in the hands of a bank. The London Rules operated in a previous environment in which most lending was domestic and mostly under the supervision of the Bank of England.</p>

While I seek to move Amendment A125, I will speak to the others, or should I say address the issue they have in common. At first sight, the amendments might appear to delete thought from the process. Deleting &#147;it thinks that&#148; or &#147;the appropriate authority thinks&#148;, or &#147;the MMO thinks&#148; might suggest we are seeking to induce an absence of thought into the Bill. This is not the idea, however. On the contrary, my amendments in this group seek to explore in a little more depth the management of the designation process and the basis on which the assessments in this part will be made. There is a certain amount of judgment to be exercised in the designation and implementation of marine conservation zones.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09030926000137"></a>As I am sure the next group of amendments will show, there is a great deal of disagreement about the relative importance of the many factors that could or should be taken into account. It is clear from conversations with Defra and the relevant stakeholders that Natural England and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee have already been tasked with and funded for the organisation of consultation panels. That appointment follows the existing practice of designating and managing existing conservation sites such as SSSIs. Some questions, however, have been raised about whether this is the best way forward. At this Dispatch Box, we have referred to many occasions on which the MMO&#146;s areas of responsibilities have been restricted or removed. My noble friend Lord Cathcart has been keeping a list, which I believe is nearly into double figures. I am afraid that we are rather inclined to view the provisions as yet another addition to that list.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09030926000138"></a>We fully appreciate the point that the statutory conservation bodies represent a wealth of experience and expertise in conservation matters and that it would be counterproductive to separate them into marine and terrestrial-based organisations. However, our understanding of the MMO from discussions on the earlier part of the Bill was that it should be an umbrella organisation with the links and responsibility to coordinate between and rely on more specialised bodies in a relevant area when necessary.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09030926000139"></a>Why, therefore, is the MMO being completely isolated from any involvement in the designation of zones that will impact enormously on its responsibilities to draw up and implement marine plans, and on its ability to  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1014"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1014</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issue licences? Does the Minister feel that the MMO could play a very useful role not only in maintaining an impartial role in negotiating between conflicting interests and ensuring that all relevant voices are heard but also in contributing its knowledge and experience to the designation process directly?</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09030926000140"></a>Naturally, we have received some very strong representations from the conservation bodies that they would prefer to keep control of the process of designation. They have some concerns that, if control of the process is given to a body that does not have conservation as its sole focus, the end result will be too watered down to be effective. However, the MMO has a responsibility to contribute to sustainable development and will, we hope, have an even stronger duty in this area by the time that the Bill leaves your Lordships&#146; House. It is also subject to scrutiny by Parliament and directions and guidance by Defra. What grounds are there for thinking that it would be an ineffective champion of an effective and manageable conservation network?</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09030926000141"></a>There is, of course, a further safeguard in this Bill that the zones are to be designated by the Secretary of State, based on recommendations. The current thinking is that any unfeasibility in the conservation objectives can be caught and amended here. If a planned development clashes with a proposed zone, it appears to be the expectation that the Secretary of State will spot the conflict and will ensure that the necessary adjustments, either to the relevant plan or the zone, are made.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09030926000142"></a>This seems to be a very inefficient way of proceeding. Why not build in at a much earlier stage an appreciation of where difficulties are likely to develop? Alternative sites for either the development or the zone could then be considered and a more optimal solution found. I prefer a system that resolves conflicts of interest early and locally. Much greater reassurance would also then be given to stakeholders that their views would be heard at an earlier stage, eliminating the current incentive to postpone the resolution of conflict until a later stage to keep to targets, with all the usual reviews, readjustments and appeals that such a policy tends to produce. I beg to move.</p>

I fully recognise the point that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, raised about the importance of being sure about the way in which the appropriate authority should seek to designate marine conservation zones and the way in which the MMO carries out public consultation in relation to by-laws. I fully accept that, in moving the amendment,  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1015"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1015</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the noble Lord raised a number of interesting points about the role of Ministers&#151;the hierarchy of decision-making, if you like&#151;and the role of the MMO in providing appropriate advice. Clause 114 makes it clear that the appropriate authority for designating marine conservation zones will be the Secretary of State, Welsh Ministers or Scottish Ministers for the Scottish offshore region, in the last respect acting with the consent of the Secretary of State because the function was executively devolved, as we have previously discussed.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09030926000145"></a>The idea is that the appropriate authority&#151;in other words, the relevant Ministers&#151;will want to act on advice and recommendations from the statutory nature conservation authorities and other marine bodies with expertise, such as the Marine Management Organisation. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that I regard the role of the MMO in this regard to be important and would not, I hope, be added to the list of the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart. We are only too well aware of the importance of the MMO.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09030926000146"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said that some take the view that the designation of sites should be placed on statutory nature conservation bodies. I make it clear that the Government do not have that intention. We believe that the duty to create a network of sites must lie with the Secretary of State. The various international conventions and European directives will place requirements on the UK to provide a network. Surely it is Ministers who ultimately must make the decisions and be held accountable for them.</p>

Am I right in thinking that Ministers have executive responsibility for the designation of areas of outstanding natural beauty in the terrestrial planning field precisely because Ministers need to be accountable for such designation? Is that the comparison that he would make? Is that the precedent that he would make? I have some sympathy with that argument; that is why we did not support the amendments tabled by the Conservative Front Bench; we believe that designation is an executive decision rather than an advisory one.</p>

I am clear that it should be a ministerial decision but Ministers can then be held accountable to Parliament. The role of the various other bodies that have been mentioned so far must be to provide the necessary advice.</p>

Our view, which informs the Bill&#146;s provisions, is that, given the nature and importance of these matters, they are for Ministers to decide. Later on in our debate we will be talking about the hierarchy of decision-making. The debate is about information and how it comes to the Ministers who make decisions.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09030926000151"></a>The effect of Amendment A125 would be to require the appropriate authority to be sure that it is desirable to designate a site, rather than enabling it to do so when it thinks that it is desirable. That would impose an objective test, as opposed to the current test in the Bill, which is based on expert judgment and which gives more discretion to the designating authority. The reason for having discretion is that otherwise, the bar for designation might be raised too high. In earlier debates, we were taken to task over marine nature reserves. Only two have been established since 1981. Arguably, one reason is that very high hurdles were set for such designation.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09030926000152"></a>The purpose of Part 5 of the Bill is to provide the tools to protect areas so that they can recover their diversity and thereby enrich our seas. Some areas may represent a significant proportion of our network of sites. In those cases, it may not be realistic to require the appropriate authority to be sure that designation will contribute to conservation. We want the appropriate authority to be able to designate a site when it has good reason for thinking that the site should be designated.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09030926000153"></a>Amendments A142 and A144 concern consultation over the designation of sites. The provisions in Clause 116 have been designed to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that every interested person is consulted before a designation order is made. Clearly, public consultation requires a degree of judgment by the appropriate authority, because in practice it cannot always be certain that it has consulted in the best way. My department follows best practice on public consultation, and my department will be carrying out this consultation. It is important that the wording of the Bill enables the Secretary of State to reflect this objective.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09030926000154"></a>On rare occasions, an area may need urgent protection through immediate designation. Clause 116(10) and (11) therefore allow designation to take place on an interim basis without public consultation. Amendment A147 might restrict the power to designate urgently, so that it could be exercised only where there was definitely an urgent need. Paradoxically, this could weaken the protection of vulnerable and threatened sites, because the appropriate authority could only act when it was sure that the designation was urgently required. We have heard much in previous debates about the need to reflect the precautionary principle. One risk of the amendment is that it might leave the Secretary of State with too strict a test to operate to secure the urgent protection needed for an environment when information is incomplete.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09030926000155"></a>Clearly, the Secretary of State will not act lightly. He will need to take advice on the site from nature conservation bodies and from the MMO, and be clear in his mind that there is an urgent need to protect it. By the time enough evidence for certainty is produced, the features of the site might already have been damaged   


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1017"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1017</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or destroyed. That is the reason that we want to allow the appropriate authority&#151;in this case, the Secretary of State&#151;to exercise some judgment.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09030926000156"></a>Amendments A187 to A192, and Amendments A194, A195 and A197, remove the words &#147;the MMO thinks&#148; from Clauses 126 to 129, which relate to the making of by-laws, emergency by-laws and interim by-laws. These words acknowledge that the MMO will need to exercise its expert judgment in deciding how best to publish them. The aim is to ensure, as far as is reasonably possible, that the details come to the attention of all interested parties. There may be different opinions on how best to achieve that, and we think it right for the Bill to reflect this. I assure the House that the MMO will operate best practice on consultation and on publication of its intentions; that the guidance that the Secretary of State issues to the MMO will be clear about this; and that the MMO must then do what it thinks is best.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09030926000157"></a>I hope that, in responding to these amendments, I have explained why the Bill is worded to allow certain subjective judgments, either by the Secretary of State or by the MMO. It does not give the appropriate authorities and the MMO complete freedom. They will need to act reasonably, and can be legally challenged through judicial review if they fail to carry out their functions in a reasonable way. That is sufficient protection against any arbitrary decision-making. I hope that I have made it clear to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that the MMO will have a valuable role in this process; and also that, as far as concerns decisions by the authority, it is right that Ministers should take them.</p>

In the broadest terms, we agree with him. We certainly agree that ultimate political accountability should lie with the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90309-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09030926000159"></a>As I said when introducing the amendments, the essential reasoning behind them was to beef up the role of the MMO. The Minister has accepted that the MMO has an important task. What he said implies that the MMO will be central to the designation process. I am not seeking to exclude from the process statutory bodies with conservation experience: without their expertise, the MMO could not function at all. The MMO is the key link between the marine policy statement, marine plans and marine licensing. The designation of conservation zones comes into that process, and it is very important that there is a continuity of decision-making that involves the MMO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09030926000160"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for addressing these issues. I do not think that we are a million miles apart on this matter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09030935000002"></a>In the main, they focus around Clause 114(7), which ensures that the appropriate authority has the power to consider the social and economic consequences of any designation. We consider that reasonable. Indeed, we have added our names to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, to make certain that those consequences are considered. Surely it would be completely counterproductive to seek to deny the Secretary of State the power to consider all consequences of a designation when choosing whether to implement the recommendations. The subsection places no obligation on the appropriate authority to decide in favour of the social and economic consequences, just to be aware of them. As I have argued on the previous group, our preference would be to have social and economic factors regarded rather earlier in the designation process to try to minimise future disagreements. To proceed with MCZs with no regard at all to other legitimate users of the sea would appear to be analogous to sticking one's head in the sand. Conservation bodies may not like some of the other users of the sea, but ignoring their claims on its resources entirely is not the most constructive way forward.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90309-0011.htm"/>


<a name="90309-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09030935000003"></a>Instead we have tabled an amendment which we hope will reassure the conservation bodies that there is genuine commitment to establishing a meaningful conservation network, which we certainly hold, but accepting that there will be disagreements. Our Amendment A140A expresses the Sandford principle, which is already at work in the designation of national parks. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict between conservation objectives and other factors, the conservation objectives would win out. We feel that that places an appropriate level of legislative support for the critical importance of the marine conservation zones.</p>

<a name="90309-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09030935000004"></a>An alternative approach would be our Amendment A140B, under which social and economic factors would be taken into account when two sites of equal conservation value were being considered. More of our amendments in this group highlight some of the factors which might be considered other than purely conservation objectives, such as climate change and energy security. We have debated this topic a few times before, but I felt it would be useful to highlight briefly the wide range of social and economic factors that should be considered. Addressing climate change by promoting renewable energy is, of course, a matter of conservation as well as economics. It is a good example of why the factors that should be regarded should be widened rather than narrowed.</p>

<a name="90309-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09030935000005"></a>Finally, the remaining amendments in this group address consultation. The Bill enables the Government to proceed, as we have mentioned, with the statutory conservation bodies in control of the consultation and recommendation procedure and as sole statutory providers of advice to public authorities on the ongoing management of zones. Our amendment would open up the possibilities for consultation a little wider,

He and I will probably cancel each other out tonight as we are taking different views on considering socio-economic factors in the designation of marine conservation zones. I entirely understand where he is coming from, but I would like to try to persuade him that he is wrong. I have tried this once privately and failed, so I shall now try publicly.</p>

<a name="90309-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09030935000007"></a>Clearly, having a network of marine conservation zones which protect the areas of the highest importance for conservation is an absolutely central part of this Bill. It is one of the elements of the Bill for which we have argued for many years. If this were to be a weak part of the Bill, it would take the heart out of it because it originally started as a conservation Bill and has only recently become a Bill on which everything else has been hung.</p>

<a name="90309-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09030935000008"></a>I want to look at the history of creating marine protection areas in the UK. The Minister referred to this, so he knew he was going to get it in the neck on this argument and we may as well carry on. Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 the designation of marine nature reserves was dismal&#151;that is the only word to use. In more than 25 years, only three small sites have been designated. The big problem was that, at the time, there was huge pressure against designation from socio-economic interests. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, would say that that was the time to face up to them, to get them out into the open and to take a balanced view, but in reality all that happened over the 25 years was that it was almost impossible to get a designation through.</p>

<a name="90309-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09030935000009"></a>My second point is how we overcome what, in the case of the Wildlife and Countryside Act provisions, was virtually a veto by socio-economic interests. How do we ensure that we do not end up with a network of sites where no one can envisage some socio-economic requirement which would mean that they can be selected? In the process to be adopted for designation of MCZs, there will be a strong regional role and a strong consultative role. The risk is that the poor Minister, in making a decision, will be heavily lobbied by socio-economic interests of all kinds and he will be put in the position that Ministers were in for 25 years under the previous rules where he will find it impossible to move ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09030935000010"></a>Scotland will stand out like a shining beacon in all this. Under the Scottish provisions, its conservation zones will be designated entirely on scientific conservation criteria. We are already seeing a difference between the four countries. On the terrestrial environment, not only is there not a requirement to take socio-economic conditions into account at the time of designation of sites of special scientific interest, but in the case of European sites, for special areas of conservation and special protection areas under the Natura 2000 series, it has been tested in law that socio-economic conditions may not be taken into account in selecting those sites.  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1020"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1020</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The process is: let us identify and designate those sites which are really important for nature conservation and, when we know the nature of proposed management activities or planning and development activities, it will be possible for the planning authority and, ultimately, the Minister to do the balancing act between socio-economic conditions and the importance of the site and so make decisions about the management of the site or the development and planning proposal which has come forward. Alas, if the Minister does that at a point of abstraction, when people are saying, &#147;This may be important in a socio-economic way for the future; we might want to put a wind farm here; we might want to put a tidal barrage here; there might be aggregate extraction here; or this may be an important fishing area&#148;, the Minister will have so many reasons for not designating that he will find it jolly difficult to designate.</p>

<a name="90309-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09030935000011"></a>Marine conservation zones have been heavily misunderstood because they are not areas where no development is planned or no economic activity can be permitted. There will be many economic activities which are perfectly combinable with the conservation interest of a particular site, depending on what that conservation interest is, but the appropriate time for that balancing decision to be made is when one knows what economic development is being proposed. There is a huge signalling role in designation. Having already signalled to people that, whereas in the marine environment in general socio-economic requirements may well be incredibly important, in this bit, most of the time if they are in conflict we will want the conservation of natural features to win out. That signalling activity is very important to make sure that people exercise ingenuity in looking at where they can direct their socio-economic development away from the most important sites for nature conservation, the places that are irreparable, the jewels in the crown, which is what SSSIs are in the terrestrial environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09030935000012"></a>I was trying to think of a good example. Noble Lords may remember the Salisbury bypass, which I am glad to say I campaigned against and which was never built. It ran perilously close to damaging Salisbury Cathedral. It went through the water meadows and could well have had an impact on the cathedral. If we had not had a designation for that cathedral and we had been operating the system that would exist in the marine environment, the Minister would have been saying, &#147;I wonder if we should protect the cathedral because, actually, the road is jolly important too&#148;. I do not think that any noble Lord would ever suggest that some of the wonderful heritage treasures that are subject to the highest level of protection would ever be traded away for socio-economic purposes. They are designated simply on their heritage value, not on whether they are in an area that could get a bit crunchy in terms of planning and development.</p>

<a name="90309-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09030935000013"></a>My belief is that the marine conservation zones&#151;and I refuse to believe that we will have a huge number of them&#151;that will make up this important network ought to be designated on their scientific evidence-based conservation value alone. That is why I tabled Amendment A135A and which is why&#151;I think I have probably said enough&#151;I would not support Amendment A136, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, which says that

Although I approve of the Sandford principle in some circumstances, Amendment A140A, which is a Sandford bastardisation&#151;if that is not an unparliamentary word&#151;seems to insert it at the wrong time. It is saying that we might not designate something because of socio-economic conditions but, if there is a bit of a push and a shove, perhaps the environmental objectives should prevail. If that is the intention of that clause, designating on the basis of choosing those sites that are most important for conservation would have a similar net outcome, so perhaps I could persuade the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that Amendment A135A is better than Amendment A140A.</p>

We have a genuine dilemma here; there are several options before us, but the whole designation of MCZs will be so critical to the success of the Bill that there will be huge disappointment if we do not get this right. We have looked very hard at the various options, and we accept that Clause 114(7) is critical to this discussion. The options before us are simply to take it out, which is the noble Baroness&#146;s suggestion, to strengthen it&#151;the purport of Amendment A136&#151;or to modify it quite dramatically by attempting a Sandford solution under Amendment A140A. Simply omitting the subsection will probably not be a successful solution to this problem, for the precise reason the noble Baroness indicated, because we are signalling an important aspect of the Bill. Simply taking the subsection out will not mean that the appropriate authorities ignore the economic and social consequences; they simply will not know how to rate them. Similarly, it would be going to the opposite extreme and quite ridiculous to strengthen this commitment to economic and social consequences by inflating from &#147;may&#148; to &#147;must&#148;. I cannot support that. That is going in the wrong direction altogether.</p>

Whether that is bastardising Sandford or not, I think the noble Baroness would agree that it is an attempt to do just that. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, because he has attempted to do what many of us have wanted to do from the outset, which is to make sure that there is a sequence of priority and that that priority is firmly stated in subsection (1).</p>

However, simply removing them from the Bill by taking out subsection (7) altogether seems pretty

It has been shot down by heavy flak from my noble friend Lady Young and the Liberal Democrat Front Bench. As for the Sandford principle, we must remember that the Bill will stand for quite a long time before we have another marine Bill, and with power supplies probably becoming scarcer as time goes on, there could well be situations where the Secretary of State will have to give precedence to power generation sources. It would inhibit the Government somewhat at the moment to write the Sandford principle into the Bill.</p>

One of the worries and anxieties that I have had derived from the original Explanatory Memorandum issued by the Government that stated in relation to subsection (7):</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09030935000038"></a>&#147;Where an area contains features that are rare, threatened or declining, or forms a biodiversity hotspot, greater weight is likely to be attached to ecological considerations.

<a name="90309-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09030935000019"></a>I think that my noble friend put this the other way around to ensure that the interests of marine life triumph over the socio-economic factors. None the less, there is the potential here for considerable conflict, and my worry as the Bill goes on&#151;and that worry increases&#151;is that the Government&#146;s position is being progressively weakened. It seems to me that, somewhere behind the scenes, powerful voices representing other interests are coming to bear on this legislation to reduce the original objective which I thought the Government had set themselves in bringing the Bill forward.</p>

<a name="90309-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09030935000020"></a>When this whole subject was being considered and marine reserves were being canvassed on and discussed in 2001, eminent marine experts considering marine reserves concluded that those reserves resulted in,</p>

<p><a name="09030935000035"></a>My noble friend has strengthened that a little further, which is a wrong step to take. I have sympathy with the views that he has expressed from the official opposition Front Bench, but the right approach is that of the noble Baroness, Lady Young. Why is it not possible for the marine environment and areas of high protection to be given the same treatment that is given on land  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1023"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1023</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>through the medium of SSSIs? SSSIs completely exclude other activities that might damage the purpose and objective behind the creation of the SSSI. There is no question of these other factors being brought to bear. Representations can of course be made, just as they could be made in the case of areas of high protection in the marine environment. I am sure that the IPC would ensure that its voice and the interests that it will represent will be sufficiently strongly heard. In fact, an almost parallel power is given to the IPC in the representation that it has from the Marine Management Organisation membership within its own ranks to ensure that its voice is fully taken into account. I do not see why it is necessary to import socio-economic factors at this stage when we are trying to protect the marine environment.</p>

<a name="90309-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09030935000022"></a>There is a view that you can parcel up an area of the sea and allow within that area a variety of different activities that could include dredging and turbines for power generation, for example, and that somehow marine life will go on and accept these things and take them in its stride. Surely we have learnt enough already to know that that is not the case and that we need to emphasise as strongly as we can the need to protect marine life: marine flora and fauna. If that is not spelt out strongly enough, the Bill will be weakened, and, when it becomes an Act, many other voices will be heard and many other representations will be made and its whole objective will have been lost. I hope that, somehow or another, the Government will go back to their original concept and seek to give full power to the MMO to establish marine conservation zones and areas of the highest possible protection within those zones to ensure that our marine life has the opportunity to replenish and recover from centuries of depredation by mankind.</p>

When we consider legislation of this kind, I always think someone should think about that. Even long ago, in my days in the Government, it seemed to me that every Cabinet needed a special Cabinet Minister whose job was, in every debate, to say, &#147;Well, that is all very well, but I am speaking for the next generation and the generation after that.

Her amendment starts to make amends for the weakness we still have in this Bill. It begins in the Long Title, which does not describe anything to do with nature conservation. It is a very functional description of activities at sea and so on. Nor do we have the purpose of the designation of the MCZs. Unless the Government spell out that purpose in some way, we will continue to have to have this sort of debate and the balance to be struck by the MMO simply will be that much more difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09030935000028"></a>Perhaps there are some misunderstandings of the fact that sometimes it will be completely reasonable to have no other uses in the MCZ. Some of the highly protected zones simply should exist&#151;on our previous Committee day, I think the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, called it a pristine environment&#151;as of right for everything that lives in the sea. That is why I am surprised to see his Amendment A139, which refers to the impact that designation may have on legitimate uses of the sea. Apart from pirates, we probably do not have many illegitimate uses of the sea. It implies that there is a gradation. The most legitimate use of the sea is probably that of the creatures which originally lived there and have to live there still. I hope that the noble Lord will come down on that side. Given the fact that we do not have a spelt-out purpose for Clause 114, I hope that the Government will look favourably on the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, which seems to be gaining consensus.</p>

Presumably, when Scottish Ministers are considering inshore waters, they will develop the habit of thinking purely about conservation, and when they consider offshore waters, they and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who they will have to consult, will consider economic issues as well. Have the Government faced up to the fact that two different qualifications will apply from the point of view of Scotland? Do they realise that in Scotland the Administration in the Scots Parliament are making a great point of just talking about &#147;our Scottish waters&#148;? They completely ignore the differentiation when they are talking about it. There will be a curious situation which people will find rather hard to understand. Has this been discussed with Scottish Ministers? Have the Government realised the two different aspirations that they will be expected to have in the two parts of the sea?</p>

In particular, I cannot think through this matter without thinking that it may be a recipe for conflict. The situation, for example, in the Severn estuary and the possibility of a large barrage, or not as the case may be, at present is being considered and is extremely complex. Let us we put aside for a minute the generation of electricity and look at the area as a matter of conservation need. Unquestionably, it would be designated a special MCZ for special preservation. The number of SSSIs and the number of protection zones already in place, and the designation by the European Community as a special area, bring forward a very complex situation legally in that area.</p>

<a name="90309-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09030935000031"></a>If one looks at the economic and social consequences of producing a big barrage in the Severn estuary, clearly there will be economic benefits and a complex situation socially. Undoubtedly, it will bring south Wales and the west of England much closer together. One has to come down on one side of the argument or the other. The Conservative amendment to insert the word &#147;must&#148; will make it much more abrasive and make it difficult to protect a special conservation area of this kind. The Bill must give more powers to the MMO. I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Eden, on that. He made his points extremely well in this respect. There is a case for removing subsection (7) of Clause 114 because if it is left as it is the steamrollers will move in.</p>

The aim would be for sites to be designated on the basis of their conservation interest according to scientific evidence. That does not mean that there would be an absolute requirement for that conservation interest to be predominant in subsequent decisions. It would be open to people, through the normal processes of decision-making about development and socio-economic development and planning, to take the view that the economic proposition is more important than the nature conservation interest.</p>

However, that does not mean that by simply designating on the basis of their nature conservation interest, you have to be stuck in a straitjacket of protecting that nature conservation interest irrespective of any other consideration. That is the case when a planning application on an SSSI goes ahead, as a result of a planning process conducted by the local authority, which ultimately goes to planning appeal for the Secretary of State to make a decision.</p>

Yet it is in the way that they are managed afterwards that they succeed or fail. It will be similar for MCZs. The fact that they should be designated because they have some features that are worth protecting, as decided by the scientists, is surely unarguable. To continue with the land analogy, you could have a SSSI that was grazed, with a number of farming activities and recreation for the public, which might be closed some of the year&#151;all the arguments that we heard during the passage of the CROW Act. Nevertheless, it is an SSSI and is designated as one. That is the model that we should be following, which is exactly what the amendment proposes.</p>

We then establish their value, which becomes a subsequent factor under consideration in the planning process. In the end, democracy is about the reconciliation of conflicting interests, but we need to establish securely what those interests are so that we can proceed to wider judgements about which interests the Government, on behalf of society, think should prevail. The approach of the noble Baroness, Lady Young, is right in principle and clear in practice. Moreover, it is based on very well tried and tested principles that are long established in planning law.</p>

I cannot support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Young, to delete subsection (7) from Clause 114. I have worked alongside her many years

Along with the many noble Lords who have spoken, I hope that I am a great conservationist as well. However, it would be unwise to delete that provision and have no regard for economic and social consequences.</p>

<a name="90309-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09030938000010"></a>I hesitate to say it, but over these past 12 or 15 years, those who are interested in pure conservation and have strong feelings about it have become very articulate, and I have no doubt that they will fight their corner with the Minister or whoever gives approval. They are not the underdog in this. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, was perhaps suggesting that they might be overridden, but I think that they are very robust people who rightly take a great interest in nature conservation. I do not fall into the camp which says they will not have their voice heard. On some of the other Bills that we have taken through this Chamber&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, mentioned the CROW Act&#151;I have been inundated with lobbying, and very vocal those representations were, too. It is not as though those people do not love nature or wish to conserve it&#151;I ask noble Lords not to think that I am not one of them. But&#151;and it is a big &#147;but&#148;&#151;there needs to be a balance. Removing subsection (7) from Clause 114 would tip the balance too far the other way.</p>

<a name="90309-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09030938000011"></a>In some of the conservation zones, there may be no difficulty or conflict for the person taking the decision. In some areas, conservation may come up as a priority; in others, socio-economic factors will obviously override it. That balance will have to be struck whatever we do. If we removed subsection (7), I would be very concerned about it. I hope that people do not think that I am not keen on conservation, because I am, but if we remove subsection (7) we run the risk of creating a slightly unbalanced view in this part of the Bill.</p>

I recall this as one of the central parts of our debate at Second Reading those many months ago, and understandably so. We have heard differing views expressed around the Chamber. It is always tempting in that situation to say that it shows that the Government have got the balance right. I shall certainly not resist that temptation, but I clearly accept that this is in a sense one of the most important debates that we shall have on the Bill. It goes to the heart of marine conservation zones, our marine environment and what it is for, and our intent to protect it. However, it also recognises that important socio-economic matters need to be taken into account when we consider the marine environment. In a sense, Clause 114 seeks to encapsulate that balance. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, thinks that we have not got it right. He would like to see Part 7 moved up and become a factor in the work that is taken forward to consider in the first place whether a particular part of the sea should be conceived as a marine conservation zone. I shall say in a minute why we think it is rather better to do it in the way in which the Bill is constructed.</p>

<a name="90309-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09030938000013"></a>However, I want first to respond to the noble Lord, Lord Eden, who made an eloquent speech. He recognised the potential for conflict. I think that we have always understood that there are inherent tensions in the management of the marine environment. The Bill to  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1029"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1029</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an extent understands and seeks to reflect them, albeit within the overall intent to ensure that we do everything we can to protect the marine environment. The noble Lord said that the Government&#146;s position has weakened. I am not aware of that. This Bill has of course had contributions from very many government departments; it represents the Government&#146;s view and their commitment to protect the marine environment, but it also, as I said earlier, reflects the Government&#146;s view that there are important socio-economic activities that take place within the marine environment, and may do so in the future, which have to be taken into account.</p>

<a name="90309-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09030938000014"></a>I very much enjoyed the contributions of my noble friend Lord Judd. I understand entirely what he meant when he said that we need around the decision-making table the presence of people who can say, &#147;Well, it&#146;s all very well for today, but what about future generations?&#148;. Of course, the protection of our marine environment is very important for the future but so, too, are socio-economic issues. They are important and at the very least ought to be taken into account when the decisions are made.</p>

<a name="90309-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09030938000015"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Byford&#151;</p>

He did not suggest that we should put our Titans there&#151;he and I have debated Titan establishments in previous debates. That is not how I see it. Of course, it is about our future. All noble Lords who have taken part in the debate are concerned about the environment and understand the need for conservation. But we cannot ignore the fact that other activities that are also important to the future take place in the marine environment.</p>

<a name="90309-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09030938000018"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young, suggested that having received proposals and then having to look at Part 7, Ministers would be swamped by business interests that would make it very difficult for them to make a decision on designation. I do not underestimate the challenge of the decision-making that will fall on Ministers. That is surely why we believe that it is they who must make those decisions. We would hardly be bringing this legislation before the House were Ministers not determined to ensure that we do the right thing by the marine environment and that we designate zones and networks.</p>

<a name="90309-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09030938000019"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that I do not see conservation bodies as being some sort of mild supplicants or underdogs in this process. I have seen the power of these organisations during the ever-lengthening debates on this Bill in your Lordships&#146; House. Ministers will make proper balanced decisions, and the way in which the Bill is set out allows them to do that.</p>

<a name="90309-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09030938000020"></a>Clearly, we want to provide more protection for some areas of our sea. We want to build consensus as far as possible among those with an interest in the sea,  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1030"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1030</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and it is important to make that point. Although there will be tensions we should not think that all the users of the sea and those interested in conservation will always be at war with each other. Surely we want to do everything we can to ensure that there is consensus and that conservation needs are fully considered. We also need to take into account the impact on people&#146;s lives and livelihoods of designating marine conservation zones. I am going back to the wording, which I am glad to say is consistent with the wording in the Explanatory Notes to which the noble Lord, Lord Eden, referred.</p>

<a name="90309-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09030938000021"></a>Of course, there will be cases when the need for conservation will carry the greatest weight, but we should take decisions in the knowledge of what the impacts are likely to be. That is why in implementing the Bill, Ministers will expect an impact assessment to accompany each proposal for designation. There will be cases when there will be other options, when the conservation constraints are fewer, and it will be sensible to take account of socio-economic considerations in deciding where a site or group of sites should be designated.</p>

<a name="90309-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09030938000022"></a>For example, we might be considering a large area of representative habitat of which a small proportion is geologically suitable for wind-farm development. In that situation it might be appropriate to exclude that area from the proposed marine conservation zone area, particularly if it makes no difference in conservation terms. This part of the Bill is constructed so that we start with the case for conservation. I must admit that I disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller; maybe we shall come on to debate this in future.</p>

I agree that the clause says what it is doing, but it does not say why. I simply said that it would be stronger if it were quite clear on the purpose of designating the MCZs. As the debate on the socio-economic angles and so on has shown, that purpose can tend to get lost in all of the arguments that must be balanced. That balance would actually be helped by having a clear purpose at the beginning, against which the arguments could be weighed.</p>

It is quite clear to me what this is all about, and from reading the Bill,</p>
<ul><a name="09030938000126"></a>&#147;it is ... for the purpose of conserving ... marine flora or fauna ... marine habitats or types of marine habitat ... features of geological or geomorphological interest&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09030938000116"></a>et cetera. No doubt we can debate that; I think a later amendment goes into it in more detail. My point is that a clear process is described here, about the grounds under which an appropriate authority may make an order. We think it better that that authority goes through the proper process of considering that and then, in coming to a view on whether it is desirable to designate an area as a marine conservation zone, it may have regard to any economic or social consequence for so doing.</p>

<a name="90309-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09030938000027"></a>In other words, it is much better that the rigorous process is gone through in order to come to a view on designating a particular MCZ; at that point, &#147;the appropriate authority&#148; must, at least, &#147;have regard to&#148; the socio-economic impact. It is probably better to do it that way, in a sense, than to say right up front that that impact needs to be considered alongside conservation issues. I realise that there is room for argument here, but that is why we have constructed the Bill as we have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09030938000028"></a>This has been an interesting debate, but very few of the Committee have spoken to the detail of the amendments in the group.

The process of designation happens at a single point in time. It will happen once and then the site will be designated for many years, one assumes. At that point, the Minister will be expected to take into account socio-economic issues as they currently exist, whatever the propositions are to use the site for extraction, fishing, power generation, or whatever. The designation will last for however long. I do not know how old the SSSIs are, but they may be 30 or 40 years old, and there are economic propositions coming up that we could not have had any inkling of at the time of designation.</p>

<a name="90309-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09030938000032"></a>If you take the socio-economic conditions into account at designation time, you will be forced to try to project forward and anticipate the economic needs that are unthought-of at the time of designation. That is why it is quite dangerous to take socio-economic conditions into account at the point of designation. Yes, it can be done at the point of deciding what kind of management is going to be permitted and, yes, it can be done whenever a planning application comes up. It is perfectly possible for the Minister to make such balanced decisions in that regard&#151;but the point of designation is absolutely the wrong time for socio-economic conditions to be taken into account. That is why to some extent either my amendment or something close to it needs to be brought in, along with amendments later in the Bill that make it clear that MCZs are not no-go zones.</p>

I agree with her on that, but I do not agree with her on her general point&#151;that because you cannot at any one point project years ahead, or at least it is very difficult to do so, this should not be a consideration. One should not see designation as a once-and-for-all decision, as it can be amended under Clause 118. So there is some flexibility there.</p>

I wanted to conclude by assuring noble Lords that including subsection (7) is not an attempt to undermine the essential protection of the marine environment. It is not an underhand way in which to ensure that commercial operators will get the upper hand at the expense of conservation. We would not be bringing this Bill before your Lordships if we did not believe in the importance of protecting the marine environment. But we cannot ignore the socio-economic impact that these matters inevitably bring to the fore, nor the economic importance of the sea. We attempt here to get a decent balance.

So we are almost dependent on debate to try to find our way towards it. The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, mentioned this and the Minister has explained that marine conservation zones may not be absolutist. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, reminded me that it was my use of the word &#147;pristine&#148; which was meant to describe the most highly protected marine conservation zone, or an area within a marine conservation zone. I hope I am right in seeing marine conservation zones in this way because it is going to be the most efficient way of setting them up.</p>

The whole House can accept that they will not go away. My noble friend Lady Byford said that she understood the need for balance on this issue. My own position is that I am not here as an advocate for the socio-economic consequences. I am here in order to try and make sure that we articulate the case for balance, which I think is the Minister&#146;s position. Governance requires that advocacy of interest should be in the public interest and not in a cause. I am just as much against marine conservation zones being designated to a socio-economic agenda as I would be to them being solely designated on the conservation agenda. I am seeking to find a way whereby marine conservation zones can be considered durable and sustainable so that they are worthy of the investment made in them by those who believe in marine conservation. Socio-economic activities do exist in the sea and how they can be part of marine conservation is, surely, what the whole of this Bill is about.</p>

Both Ministers who have answered two previous debates on these issues gave some comfort and useful explanation in support of the principle. For that, of course, we are duly grateful. So far, however, they have not been prepared to agree that this should be made clear in the Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1034"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1034</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09030938000039"></a>I therefore move Amendment 130, which would add &#147;seascape&#148; to Clause 114 as a separate ground for designation. By &#147;seascape&#148;, I mean an area of sea, coastline and land, the character of which results from the actions and interactions of land with sea by natural or human factors. This definition is based on the definition of &#147;landscape&#148; set out in the European Landscape Convention, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory. It is intended to reflect the fact that the convention embraces the seas as well as land. Adoption of our amendment would contribute to the fulfilment of the Government&#146;s obligations under the convention, which is in itself an important point.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09030938000040"></a>The amendment would ensure that, by broadening the purposes for which marine conservation zones are designated, our nationally important seascapes can be formally recognised. In so doing, we would ensure that the full breadth of the marine environment is protected within a truly sustainable framework contained in the marine plans in the Bill. The Bill relates to one, albeit important, dimension of the marine environment, about which we have just now heard a considerable amount: nature conservation.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09030938000041"></a>However, the important point is that seascapes are not defined simply by the view. They embrace not only the natural world as expressed in terms of biodiversity and physical features, but also the human world in terms of historic and cultural heritage, opportunities for recreation and enjoyment, scenic resources&#151;another way of saying &#147;views&#148;&#151;and connections and associations between them. Amendment 131, spoken to on a previous Committee day by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, also sought to do this, but perhaps in a slightly wider way. In support of the Government&#146;s obligations under the European Landscape Convention, English Heritage has been undertaking a programme of historic seascape characterisation, the results of which should help the Government in reaching their conclusions.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09030938000042"></a>The issue for coastal protected landscapes is that there is no means of recognising seascapes in statute. The current system of planning and management of coastal protected landscapes does not embrace the marine environment. There is an artificial divide between land and sea, with no recognition of the continuum between them that is so important for our coastal protected landscapes. The statutory management plans and development plans for these areas stop at the mean low-water mark, rendering them useless for planning and managing the special qualities derived from the marine environment. This is why we want to try to do something about it.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09030938000043"></a>The Bill provides an opportunity to address the issue, but it does not provide a mechanism for designating seascapes, notwithstanding the indication in the marine Bill consultation of 2006 that a mechanism was under consideration that could protect, inter alia, important seascapes and views. This possibility was not followed through in the White Paper of 2007; however, it was indicated that important seascapes and views from land would be considered in the marine planning process, and that the United Kingdom&#146;s marine policy statement could include objectives describing the importance of seascapes and views and how we wish to treat them. More detailed plans would allow us to  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1035"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1035</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consider seascapes and views in the context of the priorities for specific areas. While in some ways it will be important for the conservation of seascapes and views from land to be addressed in the marine plan process, the absence of any mechanism for defining our nationally important seascapes, including the seaward extent of our coastal-protected landscapes, is a fundamental weakness of the marine planning system proposed in the Bill that could so easily be put right if our amendment were accepted.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09030938000044"></a>I suspect that the Government will deploy the argument that the marine planning statement and the marine plans will be the way that seascapes can be dealt with. I accept that this is one way of doing so and will welcome any statements from the Minister which make this clear. There remains the concern that there is no mechanism to designate nationally important seascapes without amending the Bill. Can the Minister explain why, during the consultation on the Bill in 2006, Defra seemed to think that seascapes could be dealt with by marine conservation zones&#151;then called marine protected areas&#151;and on what basis this was dropped? Also, how will the national importance of particular seascapes be expressed in the marine policy statement or in marine plans without any form of designation process?</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09030938000045"></a>I am troubled by the Government&#146;s attitude to our amendments on these issues. There seems to be an assumption that it is not necessary to take advantage of this Bill to protect not only natural flora and fauna but also our marine heritage. Goodness knows it has taken long enough to reach these heritage amendments because of the extent of debate on other aspects of the Bill, suggesting it is not regarded as perfect as it stands in many respects. The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, said earlier that it will be a long time before we have another opportunity of a marine Bill and that is why we want to take full advantage of this one to do as much as possible to get our marine heritage protected. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer reminded us, conservation issues are not mentioned in the long title and heritage issues are in the same boat.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09030938000046"></a>There is considerable concern in your Lordships&#146; House on this issue and many organisations worry about the outcome of our deliberations. I will mention some because it is a distinguished group&#151;the Campaign for National Parks, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales, the English National Park Authorities Association, Europarc Atlantic Isles, the National Association for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the National Trust, the Welsh Association of National Parks Authorities and English Heritage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09030938000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Chorley, had hoped to be here to support the amendment, and he asked me to say that it has his full support but, unfortunately, he had to leave. There are many others who wish to speak in support of the amendment, so I should allow them to have their say. I beg to move.</p>

I owe a quick apology  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1036"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1036</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, who gave us an extremely useful introduction to this issue when he spoke to what was in a different incarnation Amendment 106CA all that time ago; it was actually only last week. I was not cited on his amendment at that point, which I anticipated being grouped with this one at a later stage.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09030938000049"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hooper&#151;I regard her as a friend&#151;has just given noble Lords a list of organisations that support her amendment. That is a very formidable body of expert opinion, which speaks on behalf of a very formidable body of public opinion. I hope that the Minister will take this issue with a corresponding seriousness.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09030938000050"></a>The amendment adds &#147;seascape&#148; to an already bruised and battered Clause 114. It is not easy to arrive at a satisfactory definition of &#147;seascape&#148;. It is not straightforward, but it is not impossible. The noble Baroness gave a very useful definition, but she will not mind my saying that it is neither elegant nor precise. Noble Lords should not worry too much. It derives from the European Landscape Convention, and if it sounds like what it is&#151;a translation of bureaucratic Eurospeak&#151;I hope that noble Lords will not allow that to put them off, because it deals with an extremely important reality. As the noble Baroness suggested, to ensure that there is definition and rigour in our terminology and that we pin down this important reality, English Heritage has for some years been engaged in a programme called England&#146;s Historic Seascapes, extending the methodology of historic landscape characterisation into the marine zone. The programme has addressed the challenges involved in compiling a GIS database to present an area-based view of the historic character of England&#146;s coastal and marine zones.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09030938000051"></a>The need for an informed understanding of the interacting cultural and natural factors bearing on any given area is as vital for the future management of marine zones as it is on land. I make the point, which the Minister must regard as valuable, that this work that English Heritage has been doing for some years has been funded by Defra through the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund. Pilot studies were made and have been evaluated, and the upshot is that English Heritage now has established a robust method for historic seascape characterisation. I understand that, thanks to the prospect of further ALSF funding which has been committed, by 2011 some 75 per cent of England&#146;s seas and adjacent waters will have been studied using this method. As the noble Baroness said, it makes no sense whatsoever to persist with an artificial divide between land and sea in our policy for planning management and development control.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09030938000052"></a>Consider how many areas of outstanding natural beauty, how many national parks and, of course, how many heritage coasts adjoin the sea and draw much of their special character from that relationship. One example is the Isles of Scilly, which the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, mentioned in a previous speech. I would add the north Norfolk coast, the Gower peninsula, the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park&#151;areas which I personally know and love. The relationship between the sea and the land is crucial in all the aspects the  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1037"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1037</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Baroness mentioned. Yet, as she said, at present our statutory management and development plans stop at the mean low-water mark.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="09030938000053"></a>In the 2007 report on the inquiry into the proposed South Downs national park, the inspector recommended that consideration be given to statutory provisions that would allow marine areas beyond the mean low-water mark to be part of a national park. It is curious that the Bill omits to deal with this issue. As the noble Baroness reminded us, in the marine Bill consultation in 2006 the Government indicated that a mechanism was under consideration that could protect important seascapes and views. The White Paper in 2007 was a little more blurred but not discouraging. So what has happened? Why has this been left out of the Bill? This amendment is intended at the very least to jog the Government&#146;s memory. In so doing I remind the Minister that the power already exists in Scotland to create coastal and marine national parks. We need equally for England statutory power to designate our finest and most important seascapes, including the marine dimension of nationally protected landscapes on the coast.</p>

I support what the two previous speakers have said. The noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, spoke of the interaction between sea and land. When we are legislating we should bear in mind that that legislation should be meaningful to the general population. Looking at this clause and what it designates, it refers to geological and geomorphological features, which are important, but seascapes, as described by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, are what make it real to people. It is no coincidence that the BBC series <I>Coast</I>, which is now a long-running series on another channel as well, is so incredibly popular. It is no coincidence that, when the National Trust has had an appeal to buy bits of coast, hundreds of thousands of people have given some money. The area between land and sea is very special to them.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09030938000055"></a>It is a gap in the Bill that it can refer to geology and geomorphology but not bring things together to refer to seascape. The noble Lord, Lord Howarth, mentioned the AONBs, the National Parks and so on. Many of the AONBs got their designation primarily because of the seascape; primarily because of that interaction which is so exciting. I am lucky enough to live in one in North Devon and enjoy it every weekend. It never fails to excite, even if you walk only a very short part of the coast path. The Government are so right in having the ambition to bring the coast path to the whole country, as it is aiming to do with the Bill. What a shame it would be if it did that without recognising the important part that seascapes play.</p>

It is a very good Bill, which I have warmly welcomed&#151;any deliberations that we have had have simply been about how to improve it even further. It is an historic Bill. It would be very sad, when we are passing such an excellent Bill that has so much to be said for it, if we missed this opportunity of recognising seascapes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09030938000057"></a>We talk a great deal these days about what it is to be British and about Britishness. The great thing about Britain is that it is a group of islands. Characteristic of that group of islands&#151;its reality&#151;is the interplay between land and sea. We have a tremendous opportunity to get that reality&#151;that creative, imaginative reality; that wonderful dimension, which is unique in some ways to the United Kingdom&#151;into the heart of the Bill. I hope that my noble friends will take seriously the arguments that have been put forward so well and I look forward to their response.</p>

I happen to have Pembrokeshire blood in my veins. The creation of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, to which the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, referred, was a great achievement. Its coastal path is about 180 miles long and is breathtaking in many respects. Some of my family originate from the small hamlet Amroth, from which you can see Tenby and the tremendous seascape at the start of the Pembrokeshire coast path. From there, around Stackpole Rocks, the whole of the Pembrokeshire coast is a magnificent thing. Even Milford Haven, despite its oil terminal and so on, retains a bit of a wild factor. Somehow or other that development has lived with the national park&#151;sometimes precariously, particularly when gas is mentioned. That has been a way of achieving recognition of a seascape, and it is a wonderful heritage for future generations.</p>

We can all immediately think of half a dozen wonderful seascapes that should be preserved. Anyone who lives near the sea would feel that their view of the sea is of a seascape that should be preserved. The Government and other noble Lords will be aware that the proposed offshore wind farm site off the Jurassic Coast in Dorset has been moved nearer Poole. I am not certain whether that will please the rich residents of Sandbanks. From another point of view, it could be argued that the seascape from the Isle of Wight looking down over the Needles is particularly wonderful. How will that stand if a wind farm appears in the distance?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="09030938000061"></a>I reinforce the point made by my noble friend Lady Miller. Many issues in this Bill will be of concern to a comparatively small minority. The major issues of conservation, fishing and so on are important but to a comparatively small minority. As the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, we are now talking about issues that are of considerable importance to a huge number of our population. Some people think of the heritage of Britain in terms of us as a maritime nation&#151;the interrelation between the land and the sea and the communities around our coastline; they are incredibly important to a huge number of people. It would be very sad if we thought of that as a less important issue than the scientific preservation of species in the marine environment. It is important to our nation that we recognise the significance of what the noble Baroness has inserted in this amendment&#151;the seascape. It is not an easy word to define, but we all know what we are talking about. I strongly support the amendment.</p>

There have been few debates that have matched the poetry of the contributions of various Members. Even the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, waxed poetic about the view of Poole from the Isle of Wight, although he was less enthusiastic about the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09030938000063"></a>The amendment would add greatly to the appeal and prestige of the Bill. My noble friend rightly raises a feature of the marine environment that gives enormous pleasure to a large number of people, as well as encompassing unique and valuable natural landscapes and features.</p>

<a name="90309-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09030938000064"></a>We have already discussed the difficulty of defining precisely where the UK marine area starts and the land stops. This is also a problem for conservation bodies based on land. Many features in need of protection straddle both land and sea, where current legislation does not extend. As the Minister has reminded us throughout our work in Committee, the Bill presents a rare opportunity to provide protection for our marine seascapes that will complement the existing territorial provisions. I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to my noble friend&#146;s points, and reassure us that these features will be included in the Bill.</p>

The proposal is to introduce the term into the Bill, but it is difficult to define and the noble Baroness&#146;s gallant attempt did not meet with the complete approval of one of her keenest supporters on these issues, my noble friend Lord Howarth.

The concept was a good deal vaguer than that, and the definition lacked elegance. I hear what my noble friend says when he insists that he supports the principle: I do not for one moment suggest otherwise. I was just sharing with him a slight hesitation about the inelegance of the language. That is because it was designed for another role, not for the purposes of definition in the Bill. The landscape quality objectives&#151;as expressed in the language of Europe&#151;were to be implemented through the Council of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09030938000068"></a>This Bill is more precise than the rather vague exhortations contained in that definition.

Inevitably in its prescriptions, the Bill has aspects of clear definition. How could it be otherwise when the Bill is premised on the assumption of serious scientific evidence? That is the basis of this conservation measure. Most of the time, noble Lords, speaking with great passion, are equally assertive about the precision and scientific basis of the conservation measure which this represents. Therefore, they should not be surprised if, from the Dispatch Box, I am somewhat reluctant to take on board an amendment which introduces one concept called &#147;seascapes&#148;, when it is not entirely clear how we would define that in legislation and we certainly do not have an amendment which does that. We could enjoin on the Government the concept, &#147;Let them find a definition&#148;. Of course, in general terms, we accept the principle put forward with regard to the Council of Europe, but we too have difficulties with this.</p>

I listened very closely to what my noble friend Lord Judd said&#151;it always pays to listen carefully to my noble friend. I heard what he said about the national parks. I think the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, reinforced the point, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper. When has it been suggested that the national parks, created as my noble friend said by a most reforming and radical Government after the Second World War, have been under threat because they do not have a definition of &#147;seascape&#148; from their perspective? It does not exist in legislation and I am not sure that noble Lords have proven the case for it to exist in this legislation. A great deal of thought is needed before the Government can be persuaded on this point.</p>

Has anyone suggested that any of those areas is under threat&#151;that it cannot protect its interests or cannot protect its areas of outstanding natural beauty because it does not have a definition of &#147;seascape&#148;?</p>

We are talking about seascapes as a reason to designate an MCZ. Let us suppose that seascape is under threat because there is a lot of dredging of aggregates and the sand on the beach starts to shift. The Minister talks of East Anglia where he knows the speed with which the sand can shift at places such as Woodhenge and along the whole East Anglian coast. That seascape can be altered by natural events, but also by manmade activity. The manmade activity in that case is very likely to alter the seascape. That is one example. I could give the Minister about 50 more but I shall not detain the Committee. We are talking about designating the MCZ in order to protect the seascape, which would do a lot more than protecting a geological feature, for example, which is less under threat, although the Government have correctly seen fit to put that in the Bill.</p>

She is obliged to say that the shifting of the sand might in any case be natural and nothing to do with manmade constructs, but she is also forced to recognise that if there is a question of manmade constructs with regard to the shifting of the sand, they would be for other objectives, even for preserving the land on which people would need to stand to enjoy the seascape. In those terms, if the noble Baroness will forgive me, we come back to the issues that the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, introduced in the previous amendment; namely, the wide considerations that we have to take into account with regard to the Bill. It may be necessary to include such socio-economic factors and aspects in the Bill. They were ably defended by my noble friend during the debate on the previous amendment. I merely want to indicate that due regard has to be given to the fact that there are considerations beyond the aesthetic concept of a seascape. I would be the last person to suggest that there are not very important aesthetic qualities to the views that we all experience and enjoy, but that is a little different from talking the language of conservation, which the Bill is about.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, emphasised that a large number of people enjoy these perspectives and views and value the national parks. Anyone or any authority concerned with the Bill has to have regard to the interests of the national parks in those terms. We would not dream of producing a Bill that set the position of national parks at anything except important.</p>

It is obvious that we cannot develop the policy without having due regard to the land authorities that are contiguous with the sea. I am merely saying that in areas of outstanding natural beauty and in the parks, it is not conceivable that a proposal could come forward for a conservation zone that did not take into account the interests of the national park.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09030938000076"></a>My noble friend was right, as he usually is on these matters, when he said that these issues were mentioned in earlier marine Bill documents, especially the marine planning and marine nature conservation sectors when we dealt with the White Paper a few years ago. They may not be mentioned in the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, but the Bill derives from the White Paper, and they will be part of the Marine Management Organisation when it starts to develop its marine plans. I want to give the Committee every assurance that it is not conceivable that the Marine Management Organisation could do its job properly without them.</p>

First, he says that it is impossible to define the seascape, and he has poured a lot of cold water on the definitions that some of us have attempted; but now, if I understand what he has been saying in the past few minutes, he is giving the Committee an assurance that the MMO and the authorities will, in the designation process, take full account of the particular considerations that we have all been arguing are important. He cannot have it both ways. Now I have given him an opportunity to read all the interesting notes that have been coming from the Box, I hope that he will be able to give us a more substantial answer.</p>

First, the defences for areas of outstanding natural beauty and the position of the national parks are not inadequate. Secondly, it is extremely difficult to specify seascapes in legislation. The noble Lord, I notice, has not taken on that particular challenge. I will give him time. After all, there will be other stages to the Bill: that is, if we ever get to Report. One sometimes wonders in which month in 2009 we will get to Report, but we will eventually get there, so we will have another chance to rethink this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09030938000079"></a>I emphasise that the Bill is primarily a conservation measure that is based on very clear aspects of scientific evidence. The problem with the seascape&#151;in no way, shape or form is the aesthetic any less important than the scientific&#151;is simply that its definition belongs in a different Bill. That is not the objective or purpose of this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="09030938000080"></a>I emphasise that the Government are concerned about the protection of areas of marine beauty, the messages about which have come through loud and clear this evening. We had an earlier debate on these issues, which the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, presented with her usual clarity and force. The debate was substantial. The concepts will be included in the high-level marine objectives that underpin the development of the marine policy statement. The statement has to set out all the policies on the marine environment, and the plans will address the interests and concerns of all those who are connected with the sea. However, that is different from putting alongside the precise, scientifically based concepts of the Bill a concept that is much more difficult to define and which is not scientific but aesthetic. Within that framework, I do not have the slightest quarrel with the objectives of the amendments. Far from it; I enthusiastically endorse them. I have no reservations about them whatever, and I speak on behalf of the Government. I am saying merely that they do not fit into the clause because the clause is based on an objective that is different from the objective that noble Lords are introducing at the moment.</p>

He knows that in our literature, poetry and history, seascape has been a central and living concept. He goes on and on about the precise scientific measurements of other elements of conservation.

Nor would the Government want it any other way. We share with all Members of the Committee exactly the propositions so accurately defined by my noble friend, which I was humbly seeking not to repudiate but to demonstrate Government support for.

This mirrors the approach on land, where features of interest can be notified as sites of special scientific interest. The wording is deliberate. Whether something is of interest can be easily determined, but whether it is important is probably a matter of opinion and may well be hotly debated. More than that, we do

We need to leave it to common sense. Amendment A135 would include a reference to vulnerability to human activities.

Undoubtedly the Government want to take account of the best available scientific evidence in making designations. Scientific considerations will underpin the whole process of site selection and designation from start to finish. The regional projects that are currently being established to advise on site selection will draw on scientific information from all available sources, including data from industry and sea users.

As he rightly says, they are a matter for resolution by common sense. However, there are interesting issues of principle on the whole business of population protection when numbers come in. Many things that are quite plentiful may still need to be preserved to maintain the ecology of a particular climate. I speak as a land-based individual with an interest in horticulture and botany. The noble Lord knows my business interests. In analogies with land-based natural environments, plenteousness does not necessarily mean that such populations are not valuable and not in need of protection. This is a much more complex matter than can possibly be legislated for. By seeking to put science into the Bill I wanted to try to make sure that decisions were as objective as possible. I sought to emphasise the great complexity of arguments that have to be considered in terms of individual species. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<ul><a name="09030938000127"></a>&#147;provision for the marking of&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09030938000117"></a>marine conservation zones,</p>

<p><a name="09030938000118"></a>That is important inshore, where some heavy use of marine conservation zones may be allowed and, more particularly, where the licensing of such zones has been highly restricted so that almost nothing is allowable. If I take as a model the existing zone around Lundy&#151;one of the very few examples that we have&#151;you are not even allowed to drop your anchor there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="09030938000105"></a>If there is to be a series of marine conservation zones all around the coast, which shipping will have to observe, which divers should observe and which both commercial and recreational interests must have knowledge of then they will, at the least, have to know where they are because they will be expected to abide by the zone rules. They have to be able to see what is where&#151;for example, where they can drop anchor and where they may not even be allowed to go. They might have to observe other sorts of limitations; some boats, for example, still empty their dirty water into the sea. I should hope that would not be possible, particularly within the special conservation zones where the ecosystems are deemed to be vulnerable to such things. There are all sorts of reasons for having them clearly marked.</p>

<a name="90309-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="09030938000106"></a>The Minister will know, as he kindly organised it, that I met with his Bill team, who explained to me that there would be difficulty in marking these zones on the charts because the chart-producing companies&#151;I presume that means the Hydrographic Office, but there may be others&#151;are not in public ownership. Having mulled it over, that does not seem a good reason to me for not marking them. I believe it absolutely essential for both commercial and recreational interests that some form of marking takes place, at least on paper and GPS, while in certain areas&#151;particularly in high-use areas&#151;it may be necessary to put buoys, for example, on the surface of the sea.</p>

<a name="90309-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="09030938000107"></a>It is commonly understood that where a buoy is off a headland, for example, it is saying, &#147;Do not go inside this buoy; you have to stay to its seaward side&#148;. That is common knowledge for all sea users, and it would be quite easy to develop a similar system for MCZs.

I am very pleased to be speaking to it, as I did not think that I would be contributing to this Committee.</p>

<a name="90309-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="09030938000109"></a>Clause 113 enables the appropriate authority to designate marine conservation zones. The discussions around MCZs have raised many issues during this Committee. We have not always been in agreement about the best way to designate the zones, but across the House the clear intention is to make sure the zones are drawn up in the best way to maximise their potential to fulfil the requirements of this Bill. However, we have not yet addressed how people who use the marine environment, for work or recreation, will know when they are entering or leaving MCZs.</p>

<a name="90309-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="09030938000110"></a>I absolutely agree with the noble Baroness that it is of vital importance that these zones are marked in an obvious manner which is easily accessible to those who use the marine environment. The rules and regulations surrounding MCZs will mean very little if they are not adhered to because of general ignorance about the precise location of the zones themselves. The Joint Committee reported that it, too, was unclear about how the MCZs would be marked and identified. Without this clarity, it will make successful enforcement very difficult. The boundaries will need to be clearly marked and the type of conservation objective for each zone clearly identifiable. What are the Government's plans in this regard? Does the Minister think that charts, GPS systems and marking on the surface of the sea will be the most effective way of marking the zones, or does he have another cunning plan? If so, could he tell the Committee?</p>

<p><a name="st_181"></a>
<a name="09030938000111"></a><b><a name="90309-0015.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030938000186"></a>Lord Greenway:</b> I support this amendment&#151;indeed, I have raised the subject of marking the conservation zones on a number of occasions, including only last Thursday. I also raised it in the joint scrutiny committee.</p>

<a name="90309-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="09030938000112"></a>There are problems associated with this, because of the different degrees of conservation in the various zones. I certainly think that the highly protected zones should be marked not only on charts with notices to mariners and, possibly, by buoys&#151;although then it becomes a question of who is responsible for laying the buoys, whether it is Trinity House, a local authority or a harbour authority. There are problems, too, with the innocent passage of shipping and yachts, even in some highly protected zones. It may be quite possible for a small ship or yacht to transit that zone, even if it is not allowed to anchor. Charts at the moment carry certain areas where there is no anchoring&#151;where there are submarine cables or naval exercise areas, for example. It is important that the whole idea of marking the zones is thought about very carefully, and I support the amendment.</p>

The issue is whether the amendment is necessary for that careful consideration to be carried out.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1050"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column 1050</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90309-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0903102000002"></a>Clause 121 already gives public authorities such as the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office a duty to further the conservation objectives of sites in carrying out their functions. When there is a need to mark sites on charts, they will therefore be under a duty to take whatever steps are appropriate, provided that it is compatible with their functions. So we respond to the amendment by saying that of course the concept behind it is important but we think that the Bill already provides adequately.</p>

<a name="90309-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0903102000003"></a>What primarily appears on navigational charts is, of course, driven by safety criteria, as the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, would have emphasised if he had spoken at greater length. Chart compilers are, frequently, in possession of a large amount of information from which they choose those features they judge to be critical for safety. The art of producing a good chart is to avoid cluttering it with information which is not essential to the navigator&#146;s task. I am sure the Committee recognises the significance of that point. We delight in the fact that Admiralty charts have a worldwide reputation, precisely because they are well judged with respect to what is necessary and what is not.</p>

<a name="90309-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0903102000004"></a>Therefore, the Bill does not need to contain specific powers for the marking of sites, but they will be marked on Admiralty charts where it is necessary and appropriate. As an example, the existing marine nature reservation around Lundy, which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, mentioned, is currently charted. A text note refers mariners to Admiralty sailing directions where they can find out more information on Lundy. The noble Baroness questioned whether there were other suppliers; there are indeed. GPS systems are produced by a number of commercial suppliers using data provided by the Hydrographic Office or unofficial providers. They should continue to have commercial discretion to display whatever information they think is relevant to their customers, because the customers will soon find out and the worthwhile quality of what has been provided will become general knowledge. The point is that people are more likely to be interested in knowing where restrictions apply which directly affect them than in knowing the location and boundary of the marine conservation zones. They are going to be interested in those matters which affect the pursuit on the sea which they are following. Some say sites may be designated which will require no restriction on mariners at all. It is therefore difficult to see that mariners would be particularly interested in knowing where those sites were, if there is nothing within the site which affects the navigation they are involved in.</p>

<a name="90309-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0903102000005"></a>It is also important to remember that by-laws might apply to only part of any marine conservation zone, or might extend beyond the boundaries of the zone where it is necessary to protect features within the site. This subject is not easy. The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, indicated that there are difficulties with regard to these concepts, and I am reflecting that point.</p>

<a name="90309-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="0903102000006"></a>With regard to the physical marking of sites, I am informed that the laying and maintenance of buoys in the open sea is very far from straightforward. Therefore, Natural England has hardly, if ever, used its existing powers in relation to marine nature reserves and European

If an NCZ needs to be marked, we would expect the MMO to take the action&#151;with the agreement of Trinity House, which has overall responsibility in these terms&#151;but we would not need to specify a particular power or duty in the Bill to achieve this.</p>

<a name="90309-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="0903102000007"></a>I am not disagreeing with the noble Baroness&#146;s intent in exploring this point in relation to her amendment. She sought the reassurance that I hope that I have given from the Dispatch Box&#151;that this has been considered very carefully. There are a whole range of quite difficult issues with regard to the designation, but we have the powers and the structure which will guarantee that, where it is necessary for the sites to be charted and even, in some circumstances, where features need to be marked, the powers exist. I hope, therefore, that the noble Baroness will feel confident enough to be able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I recognise that it is a tricky subject. Of course, it cuts both ways. It may be marking where the restrictions are but, at the same time, it may be marking where the zones are, because they are areas where the public would go to observe some of the natural history of which we have spoken, some of the really interesting things that they can see. It is not just about marking restrictions, but about marking interesting things.</p>

<p><i><a name="0903098000121"></a>Debate on Clause 19 stand part resumed.</i></p>

<p><a name="0903098000005"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0903098000099"></a>Earl Howe:</b> Before other Members of the Committee rise to speak, I wonder whether we might deal with a particular matter arising from our adjourned debate last Thursday. During that debate the noble Lord, Lord Laird, stated on more than one occasion that small shop keepers in Northern Ireland were supportive of the proposal to ban point-of-sale displays of tobacco. He used that as an argument to suggest that small shop keepers in England who opposed the ban were isolated in their view&#151;I hope I am not misrepresenting him.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000006"></a>Since last Thursday I have been contacted by two organisations representing smaller shop keepers in Northern Ireland: the Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association and the National Federation of Retail Newsagents (Northern Ireland District). Both organisations emphatically repudiate the noble Lord&#146;s assertion that Northern Ireland retailers have accepted the proposal to ban tobacco displays. In fact the NFRN says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0903098000080"></a>&#147;Nothing could be further from the truth&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000067"></a>In the light of that, would the noble Lord like to correct or possibly withdraw the statement that he made last Thursday?</p>

<p><a name="0903098000007"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0903098000100"></a>Lord Laird:</b> I appreciate the noble Earl&#146;s words. In the debate in the Northern Ireland Assembly that took place last Tuesday on this issue, a spokesman for the  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC382"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC382</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Northern Ireland Health Committee indicated that the Northern Ireland small retailers association, the one to which I referred, was supporting the effort to do away with the displays. Of the organisations that the noble Earl has talked about now, at least one has been in contact with me to indicate that it was opposed to the change because it would not make any difference. That is a rather odd argument&#151;if it does not make any difference, why not let it go through?</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000008"></a>It was well known that these issues were going to be debated in Stormont. If the organisations knew about that, why did they not come along and put their views to the health committee? If you read the debate, you will see that the Northern Ireland Assembly, without a vote and without any dissent, passed the Motion seeking to introduce at the first available opportunity the legislation to do away with displays.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000009"></a>These retailers in Northern Ireland seem to be extremely well informed about the debate that took place last Thursday. I am very pleased that there are small retailers in Northern Ireland who spend a lot of time reading these debates and are then able to send extremely interesting and detailed e-mails listing exactly what happened and who said what to which and for whom, although I do not know if that is very good for their trade. It is interesting that this Committee is having a heavy impact among the retailers of Northern Ireland, who are watching it with great concern.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000010"></a>I am quite prepared to accept that there are retailers in Northern Ireland who are opposed to this measure. However, my basic point sticks. I come back to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. Last Thursday, he mentioned that the retailers in Northern Ireland do things differently and that they are different. I do not understand that point. When I go into retailers in Northern Ireland I see that they have the same size of shop; they have customers, things on display and cash machines. The retailers in Northern Ireland look exactly the same as the retailers I find in the part of London where I live during the week. The only possible difference&#151;and I accept there is a difference&#151;between retailers in Northern Ireland and those in the rest of the United Kingdom is that Northern Ireland was the first place in the UK to impose a total ban. We also have a land border with the Irish Republic, so we understand the effect of a ban in a place that is not very far from us. This is where I acknowledge the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. The retailers of Northern Ireland understand about removing the displays and the attack on smoking, especially for young people, which the Assembly has led in Northern Ireland and the Irish Government have led in the Republic, because they have had experience of it. That is the only difference that I can see, and I accept that it is a difference.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000011"></a>In a debate in the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Minister of Health said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0903098000081"></a>&#147;The stark facts are that in 2007, almost 9% of children aged between 11 and 16 in Northern Ireland were regular smokers. These children are 3 times more likely to die of cancer due to smoking than someone who starts in their mid-twenties. In fact, the vast majority (77%) of adult smokers in Northern Ireland started in their teens. These are shocking statistics and it is clear we must address this issue urgently&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000068"></a>I wonder what the noble Earl would like to do, if he and his party wish to remove this clause about displays. In what other ways will we stop people taking up smoking? How will we stop children taking up smoking? As I indicated on Thursday, the purpose of these displays is to catch young people.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000012"></a>Over the weekend I did an experiment in a supermarket in London. I stood beside the tobacco counter to see whether anyone who came to the counter asked the assistant if he was selling cigarettes, what type he was selling, whether he could recommend a brand, how many cigarettes were in a packet, what colour they were, and so on. I stood there until a security man took an interest in me, and I left immediately. However, not one customer did anything other than go straight to the counter and ask, &#147;Can I have a packet of x, y or z?&#148;. Could not those cigarettes be dispensed from another part of the counter? Could they not be dispensed from underneath the counter?</p>

I think that the point he is raising is one to which we will come in a later debate. We really ought to be mindful of what the Chief Whip said. We will have an extra day on this Bill. For goodness&#146; sake, let us try to make the arguments short, sharp and to the point. I hope the noble Lord does not mind the intervention.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000014"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0903098000102"></a>Lord Laird:</b> No, I very much appreciate and acknowledge those remarks. However, this is an extremely important debate. I listened carefully to what the Chief Whip said, but it strikes me that if we need an extra day, we need an extra day. If we need an extra week, we will take an extra week. This is important. I had a heart attack two years ago and my consultant said to me: &#147;Go nowhere where you are likely to be confronted with smoke&#151;not passive smoke, not in the street&#151;because you cannot take it. It is a threat to your existence&#148;. I make no apology for being totally opposed to smoking and speaking passionately against smoking. I will use every opportunity to do so, at this and every other stage.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0903098000082"></a>&#147;Why is it that the retailers of Northern Ireland support this ban? What is the difference?&#148;&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/3/09; col. GC 370]&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0903098000069"></a>that is, the difference between Northern Ireland and England. I sought to reply to that and said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0903098000083"></a>&#147;My father used to live in Northern Ireland; it is a great place with great people. I welcome the fact that they are of independent mind and that they will do things in their way rather than in our way&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/3/09; col. GC 375.]</p>

<p><a name="0903098000070"></a>In reports from other sources it would appear that retailers in Northern Ireland want to do it England&#146;s way. So the strictures of the noble Lord, Lord Laird, against me are misplaced.</p>

Do we or do we not wish to take what happened in Northern Ireland as an example? It is not a case of talking about Canada or Iceland. Northern Ireland is mentioned in the Bill as an example of how to handle smoking; let us use it.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000017"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="0903098000105"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised some important facts about the statistics and evidence in this matter. Perhaps I may give the background to the statistics that I gave. I said that about 70 per cent of pregnant women under the age of 20 were smokers. That is from the <I>Infant Feeding Survey 2005</I><I>. </I>In fact, 68 per cent of those women smoked before or during pregnancy and 45 per cent smoked throughout pregnancy. I thought that it might be helpful to the Committee to have the details of those figures.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000018"></a>I am grateful to the noble Earl for the research that he has undertaken. It is important that we bear the concerns of newsagents in mind, and he has identified a substantive problem with the evidence. Bans on tobacco displays are relatively new in origin and it is still difficult to be sure of their impact on both shopkeepers and children. A small survey of children in Saskatoon indicated reductions in smoking rates while the ban was in effect. When the ban was temporarily lifted the decline in smoking stopped, to recommence when the ban was reintroduced. The statistics produced by the noble Earl related to adults and adult smoking rates. I have not yet sent him these details but I will. I thought that he would like to be aware of them.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000019"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0903098000106"></a>Lord Rea:</b> In my contribution last Thursday I referred to a speech in December 2006 by Geoff Good, the global brand director of Imperial Tobacco. It has been pointed out to me that I misinterpreted his speech when I reported him as saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="0903098000088"></a>&#147;new methods of maintaining sales and attracting young people to tobacco smoking must be devised&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/3/09; col. GC 371.]</ul>
<p><a name="0903098000071"></a>His actual words were as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0903098000084"></a>&#147;The reason I&#146;ve chosen L &amp; B is that the UK is now a Dark Market. In 2003 we saw the introduction of the Tobacco Advertising &amp; Promotions Bill, which effectively banned us from promoting all tobacco products and means there is no main media advertising, no point-of-sale advertising (apart from one A5-size notice)&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0903098000072"></a>I would question that&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0903098000089"></a>&#147;no direct marketing and no promotions. In this challenging environment, the marketing team have to become more creative&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903098000073"></a>I agree that he did not mention &#147;young people&#148; or &#147;children&#148;, and I apologise for implying that he did. Of course, he would not have been so unwise. However, I suggest that the word &#147;creative&#148; could, in these circumstances, include the sort of prominent display at point of sale that we have been discussing.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000020"></a>I pointed out that the tobacco industry pays for these so-called gantries to be installed, and it is very unlikely that it would do so if market research did not show them to be effective in promoting sales. In fact, after the word &#147;creative&#148;, this piece goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0903098000085"></a>&#147;We therefore decided to look at the pack design. Although Lambert and Butler was clearly the No 1 brand in the UK with a perfectly good design, given the limitations, in 2004 we decided to research a new version which would celebrate the fact that the brand has been on the market for 25 years. The research surprised us&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000074"></a>I am nearly coming to an end. It continues:</p>
<ul><a name="0903098000090"></a>&#147;We looked at various alternative designs, and all the packs were rated very highly by smokers. However, the pack which became known internally as the &#145;Celebration&#146; pack, was the winner&#151;indeed it was the most positively received pack change we have had from consumers in the life of the brand&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903098000075"></a>I realise that we are to have an amendment later on this very topic but, unfortunately, I shall not be present. So my occupying the Committee&#146;s time now will save time later.</p>
<h5><a name="0903098000094"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0903098000021"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="0903098000107"></a>Lord Naseby:</b> I think that we forget too easily some of the basic facts of this market. The situation now is that we are down to 21 per cent of people smoking; we are down to the lowest level of young people smoking, at 6 per cent; those in the 21 per cent do not all die from lung cancer; and certainly the rest of us do not die from passive smoking. There are 5,000-plus direct employees in the tobacco industry; 80,000 jobs are dependent on that industry; government revenue amounts to &#163;9.9 billion; the huge amount of illegal imports costs the UK Government somewhere between &#163;3 billion and &#163;4 billion; and 25,000 small shops will be directly affected by this clause. Therefore, in my judgment, anything that we do in this Bill has to be proportional, evidence-based and rational.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000022"></a>I should like to pick up a few of the issues that, from my reading of <I>Hansard</I>, I do not think have been discussed already, and I have been here for the vast majority of this Committee. First, the powers to make regulations governing displays were provided in 2002 in the last Bill, in which many of us took part. There were consultations with trading standards following the regulations tabled by the Government, and in 2006 trading standards found that there was good compliance. There were also discussions about some amendments. However, what I do not understand, and perhaps the Minister will tell me, is why the Department of Health refused to take part in any of those discussions.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000023"></a>Secondly, the consultation on product display was flawed. Three options were in the original consultation paper put out by the Department of Health, but the only two that were considered were numbers 1 and 3&#151;that is, maintaining the status quo or total prohibition. I do not understand why option 2 put forward by the department&#151;the making of regulations to restrict displays&#151;was totally ignored. That seems to me entirely wrong, and it is not just me who feels aggrieved by it. The code of conduct on consultations put forward by the present Government says&#151;and it should be adhered to by all government departments&#151;that all options should be considered.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000024"></a>The consultation was at further serious fault in not taking account of the large number of people likely to be substantially affected by the proposals on tobacco, particularly small-scale retailers, who, frankly, we all know are unfamiliar with the complexity and form of language in a consultation paper and did not find it accessible. Where accessibility is so limited, engagement beyond the printed word is considered by the new department of BERR to be a consideration to which departments should have regard.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC386"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC386</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000025"></a>These serious shortcomings of the consultation paper and process were brought to the attention of the Equality and Human Rights Commission by the Tobacco Retailers Alliance. It agreed that this was wrong but, as yet, we have had no further response from it. In short, there were most serious omissions and shortcomings in the consultation process and the paper. Frankly, there is no satisfactory remedy to that situation other than to reject Clause 19.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000026"></a>Thirdly, the results of the consultation, flawed as it was, seriously misrepresented the situation. I discovered that of the 90,000 responses, 49,000 came from Smoke Free North West and comprised written postcards or e-mails. Is anybody suggesting that that is real consultation? Perhaps we ought to look at who provides the money for these organisations. I further discovered that 79,000 out of 90,000 representations came from government-funded bodies. Therefore, it is not surprising that they responded as the Government wished them to. The Government provided the money for them to respond; they responded as the Government wished, and then they say there has been consultation. I do not believe that is genuine consultation. I do not believe that any Minister of any Government could stand up and say that that was genuine consultation.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000027"></a>So far I have seen no relevant and convincing evidence to demonstrate that the banning of product displays would lead to fewer young people smoking. Certainly, a display ban would have a serious impact on retailers, particularly small community shops and stores. The situation is very different in Canada. Any of us who have lived in Canada will know that you get modular stores in Canada, whereas there are very few small modular stores in the United Kingdom. It may cost only &#163;300&#151;as converted from the dollar rate when the consultation was carried out in Canada&#151;to convert a gantry in Canada. However, if I wanted to change my daughter&#146;s shop&#151;thankfully, it does not sell tobacco or sweets; it is a cookware shop&#151;I would get a UK shopfitter to give an estimate for changing a gantry or anything else. I certainly would not use&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0903098000028"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0903098000108"></a>Baroness Young of Old Scone:</b> I am a regular shopper in the noble Lord&#146;s daughter&#146;s shop, which is a very upmarket, glitzy cookware shop in Bedford. With respect, it is absolutely not relevant to the situation of a small-scale newsagent.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000029"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="0903098000109"></a>Lord Naseby:</b> I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for her patronage. She will know that there are hundreds of tiny little items on a gantry in the shop, most of which cost less than &#163;10. If that is upmarket, so be it.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000030"></a>It is to be hoped that the Minister will give the Committee guidance on precisely how the relevant regulations governing the selling of a retailer&#146;s legitimate tobacco products will be framed. I wish to spend a few moments discussing the illicit market, which I do not think anybody has addressed with the exception of my noble friend on the Front Bench, who did so relatively shortly. As I said in my opening remarks, we should be clear that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue is losing something like &#163;3 billion to &#163;4 billion a year through counterfeit tobacco products and illegal smuggling.  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC387"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC387</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Seventeen per cent of all cigarettes, and 59 per cent of hand-rolling tobacco, are estimated to be brought into this country illegally. Since 2000, something like &#163;26 billion worth of such goods have come into this country. The appeal of the illicit products is obvious&#151;the price. There is a 50 to 100 per cent price differential between the UK and the Continent. I am sorry to say that these illicit products are particularly attractive to young people. Why? If you are a student or a young person who has just started work, your income is restricted. Obviously, if you want to smoke, you buy from the cheapest source; and if the cheapest source is the local boot fair or the local environmental fair, that is where you will go.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000031"></a>In the last survey undertaken by Trading Standards North West, a large survey involving 11,000 14 to 17 year-olds, some 36 per cent claimed that they had bought cigarettes from an illicit trader, while 56 per cent had bought packets with a foreign language health warning&#151;in other words, not duty paid, and they probably could not understand the health message either. So this is a very serious point, and it is no good the Department of Health suggesting that out of sight is out of mind because that presumption is totally incorrect. It needs to get its act together in this area because I am a great believer in public health. It is one of the reasons I came into politics at all, and certainly when I was leader of the London Borough of Islington, it was clear that public health is absolutely vital. This trade is totally undermining our public health policy, it will grow and grow with a display ban, and the Government need to be very conscious of that.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000032"></a>I conclude by saying that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, gave an extremely good pr&#233;cis of the situation in relation to the effects on competition, and I do not need to repeat a word of his other than totally to agree with him. With that, I end my remarks and hope that I have followed what the Chief Whip requested, and I look forward to listening to and hopefully getting some real, positive and clear answers from the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000033"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="0903098000110"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I should like to put a brief question to the noble Lord. I believe that I am correct in saying that he has some expertise in and experience of the world of marketing. Given that, does he think it possible that the prominent positioning of tobacco products in newsagents close to where children regularly buy their chocolates and sweets, so that they can clearly see the cigarette packets, is unlikely to influence whether children choose to smoke?</p>

<p><a name="0903098000034"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0903098000111"></a>Lord Naseby:</b> The noble Earl is correct that I have considerable marketing experience. He, along with all other noble Lords, will know that there is a damn great sign alongside the gantry stating that it is illegal to sell tobacco to people aged under 18. The first words to hit anyone looking at a cigarette packet on the gantry are &#147;Smoking kills&#148;, and there is nothing wrong with that. It is the primary communication made by the gantry, and if it is the right communication, I think that we can be well satisfied with aspects of the 2002 legislation. However, I do not believe that young people are influenced by it. They might find the new pictures a bit more fascinating than the old ones,  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC388"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC388</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because the graphics are extremely interesting, but the fact is that half of them will not understand what they are about. I would even question whether Members of the Committee would be able to diagnose what they were about if we had not put the explanations underneath. The primary message, usually to be found just behind the cash till, is that it is illegal to sell cigarettes to under 18 year-olds, while the two words &#147;Smoking kills&#148; are what is communicated to anyone who looks at the gantry.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000035"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="0903098000112"></a>Lord Monson:</b> There are three further reasons why Clause 19 should be rejected, over and above those advanced so ably by the noble Lord, Lord Naseby. The first is that during the passage through Parliament of the 2002 Bill, Ministers in both Houses said repeatedly that they were content with the way tobacco products were displayed at the point of sale, and how they are displayed has not altered noticeably since then. The second is that even the zealots, by which I mean above all ASH, have conceded that the evidence is shaky. Indeed the ASH Daily News wrote that,</p>
<ul><a name="0903098000091"></a>&#147;it is not possible to definitely claim causation at this stage&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903098000076"></a>The split infinitive does not detract from the validity of that admission.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90309-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000036"></a>The third reason is the valuable contribution made last time round by the noble Baroness, Lady Golding. She took the trouble to investigate how young people aged between 14 and 17 or thereabouts actually think and behave as opposed to how political theorists imagine they think and behave. She told us that young people do not go into tobacconists, grocers and supermarkets to buy their cigarettes; they get them from friends in the playground, from people at street corners and so on. This is borne out by the figures just quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, from a survey of 11,000 teenagers undertaken by Trading Standards North West. All these things put together make an overwhelming case for rejecting Clause 19.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000037"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0903098000113"></a>Lord Palmer:</b> I raised at Second Reading the problem of the imported illegal tobacco trade, and I re-emphasise the words of the noble Lord, Lord Naseby. Indeed, I concur with my noble friend Lord Listowel: the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, has great marketing experience. Indeed, I was fortunate enough to work for him very many years ago. I reiterate that we must know what plans the Government have to crack down on that illegal trade. That is very serious.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000038"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0903098000114"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> I beg indulgence for two minutes, because I was not here on Thursday and I must confess to being totally lost about what procedural point we have reached. I want to say two sentences, and that is all. The two sentences are these. If the advertising makes no difference, why do it? If it does, there is every reason for us to ban it.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000039"></a>I have been going around looking in corner shops recently. It is quite clear to me that the displays are advertising and that the tobacco advertising Act should have ensured that they did not continue. I have spent years dealing with children, their perceptions and how   


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC389"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC389</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they learn and respond. I know that children are influenced by colour and connection. The displays are colourful and connected to sweets, which says to children, &#147;Sweets are sort of okay&#148;&#151;I have an issue about sweets and obesity, but sweets are a treat&#151;&#147;so cigarettes, which are next to them, must be sort of okay&#148;. All those things are true.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000040"></a>I apologise for interjecting, but having listened to the last few speakers, I felt provoked to get up to say that there are some unrealities and the real argument is: if they do not make a difference, we do not mind losing them anyway; if they do, there is every reason to ban them.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000041"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0903098000115"></a>Lord Naseby:</b> May I just clarify that for the noble Baroness? Advertising is paid-for communication through all sorts of different media. Putting a product in a pack to look after the quality of the product inside the pack is not advertising. The fact that you put on the name of the brand is therefore for consumer recognition between one pack on the shelf and another, both of which have cigarettes inside.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000042"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0903098000116"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> I do not propose to detain the Committee for long in the light of what the Chief Whip said a little while ago. I was unable to be here on Thursday, but having heard the speeches this afternoon, I want to make three small points. First, tobacco smoking is one of the greatest health hazards of the age. It causes not just lung cancer but many other forms of cancer. It is a major cause of heart disease and stroke. It is a tremendous medical scourge and anything that we can do to reduce the incidence of tobacco smoking is in my opinion crucial in the interests of the health of the community.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000043"></a>The issue of tobacco advertising was debated at length in this House and elsewhere in Parliament and the Government in their wisdom decreed that advertising should be banned. I said at the time that I smoked my first cigarette in a mining village in Durham county when I was 10 years of age. By the time I was 14, I was smoking not regularly but frequently when I could avoid being spotted by my parents. By the time I was in the Army in 1948, I was smoking 25 cigarettes a day because I could get a 50 can of Senior Service for one shilling and eight pence on my hospital ship. I did not know the hazards at that time. I gave up smoking completely when I was in my mid-40s. Happily, the statistics show that if you give up in your mid-40s, the incidence, the risk of cancer and so on, after another five years falls to that in the non-smoker.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000044"></a>Recently agreed guidelines to the WHO framework convention on tobacco control define retail displays, vending machines and tobacco packaging as forms of advertising and promotion and recommend that parties to the FCTC, which includes the UK, should ban retail displays and the sale of tobacco products in vending machines and consider the adoption of plain packaging. I warmly support all those initiatives.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000046"></a>I wholly support many of the remarks made in favour of this clause standing part of the Bill. Smoking is absolutely one of the biggest health challenges facing us. I do not believe that this provision will drive small shops underground or make them defunct. With 15 per cent of our 15 year-olds smoking, and with smoking probably one of the biggest contributors to the health inequality of social class 5 compared with any other cause, I believe that we ought to let this clause remain part of the Bill. I hope the Minister will not mind me giving her that support.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000048"></a>I listened very carefully to the noble Earl&#146;s opening remarks, as I always do, because I hold his views in very high esteem. He was, as ever, succinct and compelling. We have had a lengthy debate, both last week and today, and the clause has provoked strong reactions. Like the noble Earl, I spent a large part of the weekend reviewing the evidence on which the Government&#146;s case rests and reading the <I>Hansard</I> report of Thursday&#146;s debate. I have to say to the noble Earl that I find the evidence convincing. If I may, I shall spend some time explaining to the Committee what our aims are; what the Bill will mean in practice for retailers and customers; why we believe that the measure is necessary, effective and proportionate; and also to touch on the underlying evidence, in sufficient but not too much detail.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000049"></a>Let me be very clear about our aims in removing tobacco displays. We want to protect children from the marketing of tobacco products and also support those who are trying to quit smoking. Perhaps I may explain how the clause would do that.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000050"></a>Section 7A of Clause 19 prohibits the display of tobacco products in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This means that the shelving in shops, known as gantries, would have to be covered up. That does not mean that cigarette packets would have to be moved and stored elsewhere. We have no intention of dictating that tobacco products have to be located in any particular place, such as under the counter or overhead. Retailers would be free to cover the gantry as they see fit provided that they comply with the regulations. In practice, and as many noble Lords have said, the majority of customers would ask to buy their regular brand. The shop assistant&#151;I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Laird, for his research; I hope he did not get into trouble with the security services in the supermarket he visited&#151;would reach to the existing gantry and simply lift a flap or slide back a cover to take a packet out and then immediately close it again. The flap could be sprung to be self-closing. Some Canadian systems have magnetic flaps that close automatically. In serving customers the shopkeeper would have to reveal a limited display which could of course be seen incidentally by anyone nearby, including children, but as long as the display complies with the regulations no offence would be committed.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000051"></a>The approach likely to be taken in regulations is to define the maximum area of display that it would be legal to reveal at any one time and to say that it must only be revealed for as long as is reasonable in order to  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC391"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC391</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>serve a customer. The area could, for example, be set as one or two square feet, but this has yet to be decided and will be the subject of consultation. Let us not be obtuse about this. This is not about preventing any viewing ever of a cigarette pack by a child. But there is a big difference between seeing a single cigarette pack and being exposed to a large, brightly lit and colourful gantry in your local corner shop next to your sweets.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000052"></a>I support the noble Lord, Lord Monson, in his aim to reduce children&#146;s exposure to the glamorisation of smoking&#151;a point that he made in our debate last week. I personally wish that models and celebrities would quit smoking for their own sake and for that of thousands of young people, particularly young women, who believe that smoking is glamorous and will keep you slim.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000053"></a>However, this policy is about preventing the tobacco industry promoting smoking through the well established marketing tool of display. We must be practical, which is why new Section 7B(2) provides that there will be no offence for a &#147;requested display&#148;. I do not want to repeat the debate that we have already had on this but I should like to explain.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000054"></a>In reality, the majority of smokers know which brand they are going to buy when they go into a shop. Research shows that less than 10 per cent of smokers change brands each year, and only 1 per cent say that their decision to do so is based on the display. However, some customers will need the chance to see a particular cigarette packet before buying it. Under the &#147;requested display&#148; provision, customers would be able to ask to see a cigarette packet. The retailer could show them the pack and this would not be an offence, provided the customer was aged 18 or over. The real effect of the &#147;requested display&#148; provision would be to ensure that shop assistants challenged customers who might be underage at the earliest opportunity, as soon as they asked to see a tobacco product. After all, there is not much point in showing them cigarettes if they are not legally able to buy them.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000055"></a>Customers would still need to know what tobacco products a shop sold and, as discussed previously in response to the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge&#151;or perhaps it was the noble Baroness, Lady Barker&#151;on Section 7C, retailers would be able to display price and availability lists. We are already working with the Association of Convenience Stores and the British Retail Consortium to develop appropriate regulations on the display of products and price lists.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000056"></a>The clause also makes an exemption from the general prohibition for the tobacco trade, enabling wholesalers to continue to display their products for sale to the retail trade. We are considering making further exemptions by regulation, such as for specialist tobacconists.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000057"></a>Finally, Section 7D provides regulation-making powers to control the display of tobacco products and their prices on a website where the service provider of that website is based in the UK. Therefore, retailers in this tobacco display-free world could continue to display a generic &#147;tobacco&#148; or &#147;cigarettes for sale&#148; sign outside their shop. Customers could check the products available and their prices on a clearly displayed, plain price list.  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC392"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC392</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The retailer could select a product from a covered gantry knowing that the small number of cigarettes on display for a short period of time would not constitute an offence. Our children would be protected from tobacco marketing, and smokers who want to quit would also be supported.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000058"></a>I should like to take some time to set out why this is an important public health measure. As has already been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, smoking is the single biggest cause of preventable illness and premature death in England. It results in more preventable deaths each year than from suicide, alcohol, road traffic accidents, illicit drugs and diabetes combined. It is the primary reason for the gap in life expectancy between rich and poor. Since the Second Reading debate, we can confirm that the latest figure for the number of deaths caused by smoking in England each year is 84,000. The Royal College of Physicians tells us that smoking is now positively associated with more than 40 diseases, and the list continues to grow.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000059"></a>We know that the nicotine in tobacco products makes them powerfully addictive. We also know that tobacco manufacturers have purposefully designed, engineered and marketed cigarettes to enhance both the development and maintenance of addiction. According to the US Surgeon-General, nicotine is five to 10 times more potent than cocaine or morphine in producing the behavioural and psychological effects associated with addiction. The Royal College of Physicians says that, in comparison with other substances, including cocaine and heroin, initial use of nicotine is more likely to lead to addiction. The prevalence of addiction among smokers is higher than it is among users of other drugs.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000060"></a>The latest figures show that nearly seven in 10 adults who smoke say that they want to quit, and 45 per cent will make a serious attempt to quit. Most smokers will try quitting 10 or more times before succeeding. Some two-thirds of current and past smokers say that they started smoking regularly before they were 18 years old. That means that they were hooked on nicotine in tobacco before they were old enough to make an informed adult decision about whether or not to smoke.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000061"></a>Among young people who try smoking cigarettes, between one-third and one-half are likely to become regular smokers within two to three years. However, evidence shows that signs of addiction can emerge within weeks of trying to smoke. In 2007, nearly 200,000 children between 11 and 15 were already regular smokers. The Government strongly believe that we have a responsibility to do everything we can to protect young people from becoming addicted to tobacco.</p>
<h5><a name="0903098000096"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000062"></a>We also believe we should do everything we can to support those people who are already addicted but want to quit. I am delighted that the noble Earl and many other noble Lords are fully signed-up to our public health objectives. I shall now set out why this policy will be effective in helping us to achieve them.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000063"></a>The first point to consider is the role of display. Product display is a well-established marketing principle deliberately used across the retail sector. It is one of  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC393"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC393</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the last remaining means of promotion of tobacco since the comprehensive Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 and subsequent regulations. In the past few years we have seen tobacco displays grow to become large, brightly-lit features of most shops, incorporating promotional aspects such as clock and tower cases. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, pointed out that our consultation document indicated a lack of research on this point. I am pleased to inform him that, since the publication of the consultation, ASH has commissioned a report on tobacco points of sale summarising evidence from 153 retail premises across 20 different local authorities. The report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0903098000086"></a>&#147;In all premises the packs are prominently displayed ... in such a way as to promote the product to customers ... Photographic examples clearly show that such displays are used as a marketing tool ... The displays are believed to be typical across the retail trade as a whole&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903098000077"></a>I strongly urge the noble Earl and other noble Lords to look at these photographs&#151;I shall be happy to make them available&#151;and compare them with displays in 2002. They are significantly different. Since we stopped the tobacco industry promoting smoking by other means, tobacco displays have got bigger and brighter.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000064"></a>The second point to consider is whether the tobacco industry&#146;s investment in display has been worth it. My noble friend Lady Golding relayed her conversation with a 15 year-old who said we should talk to children before removing tobacco displays. Indeed, last week, when we held the presentations that I had arranged with Professor Gerald Hastings, that is exactly what he reported to us from the interviewing of 13 year-olds about tobacco displays. The comments were striking:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0903098000087"></a>&#147;If you don&#146;t see them you might not think about it then go for a day without them ... In some shops the tabs&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0903098000078"></a>which is slang for cigarettes, in case noble Lords are in doubt&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0903098000092"></a>&#147;are just out on display and the kids just look at them and think, &#145;I want that&#146;&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903098000079"></a>They say that if these displays were not there, the cigarettes would be out of sight and out of mind.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000065"></a>It is right that we should talk to children before making policies which will impact on them. We were delighted to receive responses to our consultation from a number of young people&#146;s groups. They were strongly supportive of this policy and other tobacco control measures.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0903098000066"></a>On experimental evidence, Cancer Research UK recently published a summary report detailing findings of primary research with UK adolescents and the extensive existing evidence base for this policy. The primary research was based on a long-term study, the <I>Youth Tobacco Awareness Survey</I>, which examines the impacts of tobacco advertising restrictions on young people in the UK. A number of peer-reviewed academic papers have been published based on this work and one focused specifically on how tobacco marketing continues despite the advertising ban currently in preparation. The first wave of data collection for the primary research took place in autumn 1999, more than three years before the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act; the second wave was conducted in summer 2002, approximately six months before the  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC394"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC394</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ban; the third in summer 2004, about 18 months after the ban; and the final wave was collected in summer 2006, about three and a half years after the ban.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000001"></a>I am going into this detail because the noble Earl was concerned about the robust nature of this research. The data collection involved face-to-face interviews and self-completion questionnaires. The participants were a cross-sectional group of 11 to 16 year-olds covering a variety of backgrounds, social groups and lifestyles. In total, 4,479 children took part over seven years. The study looked at how aware of tobacco marketing children were, and this impacted on their behaviour and attitudes towards smoking. If noble Lords are interested in reading the report I would be most happy to make it available to them. The findings of the summary report are key and worth quoting. The first is that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030923000170"></a>&#147;Prominent point of sale displays ... can distort perceived smoking norms by making smoking seem a more normal and common activity than it is in reality&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000002"></a>The second is that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030923000171"></a>&#147;International evidence suggests that removing packs from sight at point of sale could reduce adolescents&#146; exposure to cigarette brand impressions in stores by as much as 83%. It would also help adults to quit&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000003"></a>The third is that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030923000172"></a>&#147;There is clear evidence that tobacco point of sale has a direct impact on young people&#146;s smoking&#148;;</p>

<p><a name="09030923000004"></a>and the fourth is that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030923000173"></a>&#147;Among established smokers, point of sale does not facilitate brand choice ... it stimulates impulse purchases and undermines efforts of smokers to quit&#148;.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000005"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, questioned the logic of the author of the report based on a conversation. I hope that he might go back and take a second look at the evidence. We have taken advice on the quality of evidence for the measure from peer-reviewed academic research, from internationally recognised experts and from widely respected academic and charitable organisations. Although it is of course his prerogative to disagree that the evidence is sufficient to justify the policy, he has not presented any evidence to dissuade me from my view that the evidence supports our policy.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000006"></a>Bearing in mind the need to be brief, I have simply summarised the evidence base so far. If noble Lords wish to consider the evidence further they might like to read the Cancer Research UK report and the impact assessment accompanying the Bill. They may also wish to see the Department of Health website, which provides a factsheet, and the presentations from the authors of the point-of-sale and Cancer Research UK reports.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000007"></a>I move now to the question of proportionality. We want pragmatic solutions to the issue of removing tobacco displays. That is why we are already talking to key stakeholders, such as the Association of Convenience Stores, the British Retail Consortium and the Association of Independent Tobacco Specialists, and I have a meeting arranged with the National Federation of Retail Newsagents for tomorrow evening. I should point out that for many years I was chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Retail Group before joining the Government, and I worked for the Co-Op for   


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC395"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC395</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>15 years as part of my career. So I do understand retailing and marketing. I have a record of support for the British retail industry, including small stores.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000008"></a>The Association of Convenience Stores and the British Retail Consortium are arranging for officials from my department to visit a convenience store in order to assist with the drafting of regulations. I actually hope that they will visit more than one. International experience shows that removing tobacco displays need not be costly. One acceptable low-cost solution which my officials saw during their visit to Canada has been used by many stores across that country. We have received a quote from the company which provides this solution and supplies 85 per cent of the Canadian market, and it would cost 15 Canadian dollars&#151;around &#163;8.40&#151;per square foot of display covered. Although I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, that this is not Canada, I would also suggest that that is a reasonable indication of the type of cost we are talking about.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000009"></a>The point-of-sale report I referred to earlier found that small independent newsagents had a minimum display area of 1 metre by 1.3 metres&#151;or about 3 feet 3 inches by 4 feet 3 inches in old currency. The cost could be as little as &#163;120. Even a display of 25 square feet could be covered at a cost of around &#163;210. I should emphasise that there would be economies of scale to be gained for larger display areas or if several shops worked together. So it is not a simple matter of multiplication for larger stores.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000010"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09030923000194"></a>Baroness O'Cathain:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but it struck me that all these display gantries are actually paid for by the tobacco industry.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000011"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09030923000195"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> The noble Baroness is correct. I am coming to that point next. The Government have set out in the regulatory impact assessment accompanying the Bill the potential cost of these measures to business, using an estimated average cost of &#163;1,000 a store. That is a generous assessment which more than allows for the stores that may choose more elaborate means to remove their tobacco displays. In its response to our consultation, the Association of Convenience Stores said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030923000174"></a>&#147;We do know that it is commonplace for tobacco companies to pay for gantries and their replacement&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000165"></a>The noble Baroness was, as ever, ahead of me. We understand from experience in Canada that the tobacco industry continued to fund the cost of tobacco gantries even after a prohibition on display. The suggestion has also been made that removing the display of tobacco would impact on business by reducing footfall trade, by which I mean the sale of other items such as newspapers and sweets to customers who buy cigarettes. I think we should be realistic about this.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000012"></a>First, people who choose to smoke will continue to buy their cigarettes and secondary purchases even after tobacco is removed from display. Secondly, the provisions of this Bill will apply equally to all tobacco retailers, so it will not favour one over another; there will be a level playing field for all businesses. Finally, retailers understand that they cannot rely on the sale  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC396"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC396</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of tobacco for ever. The market for tobacco will continue to decline, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, and a fact for which we make no apologies. This means that small retailers need to diversify their businesses to take account of customers&#146; changing spending patterns, a fact acknowledged in <I>Convenience Store</I> magazine in May last year when it stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030923000175"></a>&#147;We are investing heavily in non-tobacco areas. Frankly, that is where the future is&#148;.</p>

However, we are aware that in the current economic climate, small businesses are struggling, and that is why we would not commence this legislation until 2011 for larger stores and 2013 for small ones. We understand that small convenience stores replace their tobacco gantries every five years or so, and that means that refurbishments would be able to be made in the normal refurbishment cycle for many stores. Providing an extra two years&#146; lead-in time for implementation will enable small shops to take advantage of the innovative solutions that I am sure will be developed, and that extra time has been welcomed by the Association of Convenience Stores.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000018"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, noted concerns expressed by retailers, particularly in the growth in membership of the Tobacco Retailers Alliance. I hope that he is aware that the alliance is funded by the Tobacco Manufacturers&#146; Association, which represents three of the largest tobacco companies: British American Tobacco UK, Gallagher and Imperial Tobacco. Of course we could trade statistics on who has written to whom about what consultations, but I should like to note that the Save our Shops postcard campaign that lobbied for many Members of this House and the other place was run by the Responsible Retailers&#146; Campaign, which is also funded by the tobacco retailers.</p>

It is important that the Minister gives the dates of her surveys because this is a moving market and it is very difficult for Members of the Committee to keep track if evidence is given which has been overtaken by other events in the market.</p>

However, I think that it is very unlikely that young people are not buying their cigarettes from shops. As I say, I will check that, but our information shows that the vast majority of children get their tobacco products from shops. The noble Lord, Lord Naseby, referred to the consultation process. We received more than 100,000 responses to the consultation: 10,586 responses from small retailers, including the pre-prepared postcards or e-mails made available to respondents from third parties; 11 responses from large retailers; 21 responses from retail industry representative organisations, including trade organisations; and seven responses from organisations that receive funding directly from the department for programmes of work relating to smoking. We received 85,000 responses from members of the public, which also included pre-prepared postcards or e-mails made available by third parties.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000026"></a>The noble Lord said that the consultation was unsatisfactory in terms of Asian shopkeepers and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. I have dealt with the correspondence on this issue and have invited representatives of the relevant association to a meeting tomorrow. However, the organisation which was helping them to submit letters to the Equality and Human Rights Commission was funded by the tobacco industry. In view of the Government&#146;s policy on this matter, I cannot meet with an organisation which is funded directly by the tobacco industry. However, as I want to take their concerns on board, I have invited them to join my larger meeting tomorrow, if they wish to do so.</p>

Is she saying that Her Majesty&#146;s Government will not meet with any organisation that receives money from the tobacco industry, but will meet with ASH and all the other bodies to whom they provided funds, which  then make representations to them? Is that a level playing field?</p>

It is very straightforward. I think that we shall discuss this later.</p>

The Foreign Office already has that guidance as regards how it operates overseas. We will come to that later.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000030"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0003.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09030923000209"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I thank the noble Baroness for those comments. The general public are concerned about youth smoking. In a public opinion poll conducted by ICM in October, more than eight in 10 people said that they were concerned about children and young people starting to smoke, and agreed that the Government should do more to discourage them from doing so and help those who do smoke to quit.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000031"></a>Nearly seven in 10 people agreed that tobacco displays should be removed from shops if there were evidence that it would discourage young people from starting to smoke, and we are confident that there is robust evidence. There is also significant support for a prohibition on display from a wide range of organisations, including: the Royal College of Physicians, Asthma UK, the British Heart Foundation, the British Medical Association, the Local Government Association, Marie Curie Cancer Care, the National Children&#146;s Bureau, the National Heart Forum, the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, as well as numerous local authorities and NHS bodies. Internationally, a growing number of jurisdictions are removing, or planning to remove, tobacco displays. They include Iceland, 12 of the 13 Canadian provinces, Thailand, the British Virgin Islands and Norway. In addition, four states in Australia are consulting or planning to legislate.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000032"></a>Noble Lords referred in our debate on Thursday to New Zealand. The New Zealand Government have changed their mind. They are ignoring a recommendation from their health committee to remove displays. That change of heart came about after a general election that installed a Conservative Government. They have provided no evidence above and beyond that available to the committee that first recommended that policy. That is not an example that we intend to follow. Most important for us, perhaps, is Scotland's decision to remove tobacco displays. It would be a shame if it were only the children of Scotland&#151;and, indeed, Ireland&#151;who were protected from tobacco industry promotion. It is an essential measure to reduce smoking by young people and to support smokers who want to quit, and it should stand part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000033"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0003.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09030923000210"></a>Earl Howe:</b> Last Thursday, the noble Baroness, Lady Young, questioned where I was coming from in arguing against the provisions. Very simply, I come from a school that rates personal and commercial freedoms more highly than many societal goods. I do not come from the school of big government.  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC399"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC399</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Big government may sometimes be necessary, but we have to justify its intrusion into our lives before allowing it.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000034"></a>It is right that we look at the scientific evidence both for and against, but in the end this is a political judgment. It is a judgment that weighs up prospective public health benefits on the one hand and the risk to commercial freedoms and the viability of businesses on the other. Therefore, this debate is both appropriate and necessary. Those of us who were prepared to sign up to the ban on tobacco advertising and smoking in public places judged that the case for those measures had been sufficiently made. I fear that in this case I am in the other camp. Unfortunately for her, the Minister's reply has taken me no further forward in accepting the Government&#146;s arguments, although I shall of course look carefully at all the sources of reference that she highlighted.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000035"></a>It is not clear to me why, if the Government are so exercised about point-of-sale displays and the possibility that they may have come to resemble de facto advertisements, they do not regulate to restrict the size and content of such displays instead of banning them altogether. After all, it is not so long ago that Ministers felt able make a clear distinction between what constituted an advertisement, which, in their eyes, was harmful, and what constituted a display, which they felt was not. If we accept for a moment without further evidence that some displays have changed and become more eye-catching and glitzy, why not regulate to make them less glitzy and take us back to how displays supposedly used to be? That option does not appear to have been considered at any length by Ministers.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000036"></a>Another issue needs to be mentioned, but the Minister did not do so. If tobacco companies are prevented from engaging in commercial competition at point of sale, which is what a display ban would mean, they would resort to competing on price. One brand of cigarette is already trying to do that. The recommended retail price of that brand per pack is only 1p above the aggregate amount of government taxes. What do we want to achieve? Do we want cigarettes to become cheaper? As far as the young are concerned, the cheaper, the better. We have only to think of the damage done by the illicit market in smuggled tobacco, which can be half the price of the duty-paid product to appreciate the risk that we are running with this measure.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000037"></a>Incidentally, is the Minister aware that the black market in cigarettes does not feature in Iceland? That is another reason why comparisons with that country are somewhat dangerous. The Canadian Convenience Stores Association stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030923000176"></a>&#147;In Canada (since the inception of display bans) we have seen unprecedented growth of contraband/illegal tobacco and now one in every two cigarettes sold are sourced through the black market&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000166"></a>If we look at what drives young people to take up smoking, the main influences are: peer pressure; image consciousness, because it is seen as being cool; and having parents who smoke. We are simply not  in a position to say that they take up smoking because of displays in shops. There is no evidence for that other than repeated assertion. We can produce a collection of speech bubbles from kids who have been  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC400"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC400</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>interviewed about the eye-catching nature of displays but we cannot base an evidential case on speech bubbles. The most that these show is that some displays are eye-catching; they do not show that they affect smoking behaviour.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000038"></a>A number of noble Lords, including the Minister, have pointed to legislation in other countries. Perhaps I may end by stating the obvious. Passing legislation in this House is not a matter of routinely copying other countries or jurisdictions. If it were, our lives would be immeasurably easier. It behoves us as responsible legislators to decide these issues for ourselves, looking at the circumstances particular to our own country. I do not think that we should be deflected in the slightest from having a thorough debate and reaching our own conclusions. We will doubtless continue the debate and reach those conclusions at the next stage of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000039"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09030923000211"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</b> The Question is that Clause&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09030923000040"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0003.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09030923000212"></a>Lord Stoddart of Swindon:</b> We have not finished yet. When I objected to the Bill being taken in Grand Committee, I was told, &#147;There will be plenty of time to debate it in Grand Committee&#148;. The noble Baroness treated us to a very long explanation as to why this legislation should go through. I very much appreciated that, but I came to the conclusion that she was talking about not a ban on displays but a ban on tobacco,  full stop.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000041"></a>If it is true, as the Royal College of Physicians has apparently told the noble Baroness, that smoking is more dangerous than cannabis and cocaine, then it should be banned. Let us have a little less hypocrisy. If that is the case and the Government accept that case, they should ban it. They should make tobacco a class A drug. Why do they not do that? Why do they keep coming to us in dribs and drabs, banning this and that, now banning displays and vending machines and what have you? Why are they messing about with it? Why do they not come clean and say that they want a complete ban and bring forward a Bill that would do that? It may very well be that they do not want to do that because there is &#163;10 billion at stake, but let us have the truth. If that is the case, then we can understand why these restrictions come along in dribs and drabs: they want to hang on to the money but they want to bombard the smoker and the tobacco companies with all sorts of restrictions.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000042"></a>With regard to the Government&#146;s refusal to talk to the tobacco industry and anyone who is promoted by them or receives promotion from them, do they talk to the drug companies? The drug companies are very well known for giving gifts and so on to GPs to promote some products which have proved to be dangerous, such as thalidomide. It is no good saying &#147;Gosh&#148;; we are having an argument about something which affects 80,000 jobs in the retail sector and 22 per cent of the population who smoke. They are constantly bombarded from one side or the other&#151;if not the Government, then some health authority or whatever. Let us hear from the noble Baroness.</p>

Some noble Lords, particularly those who are members of new Labour, might be interested to know that we have heard from the trade union UNITE. It does not support these clauses at all.

<p><a name="09030923000167"></a>It says that exports are worth &#163;984 million and,</p>
<ul><a name="09030923000186"></a>&#147;the illegal trade in tobacco products is costing the UK tax payer and the public sector &#163;4.3 billion&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09030923000168"></a>per year. That is not from me but from a trade union that gives a lot of money to the Labour Party. It is worried, as it is entitled to be, about the jobs of its members at a time when there is a very serious depression. We have to take these things into account.</p>

Before speaking to the detail of the amendment, it is perhaps worth my making a general point. The measures contained in the Bill are designed to bear down on the prevalence of smoking, particularly smoking by children. That is the main justification put forward for them, and the underlying aim is of course wholly right in public health terms. However, both of the Bill&#146;s main measures in this area&#151;the ban on point-of-sale-displays and restrictions on vending machines&#151;impinge in one way or another on personal and commercial freedoms.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90309-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000066"></a>The balance to be struck between public health and personal and commercial freedoms, and the proportionality of the measures in the light of the evidence available, is where the debates tend to be centred. On point-of-sale displays in particular, as we have just discovered, it is a debate of some complexity. I contend that the arguments about balance and proportionality are made more difficult if, in making them, we cannot say that we have done as much as we can to make the current law work effectively. Parliament has made it illegal for cigarettes to be sold to anyone under 18. It is perhaps too soon to tell how well or badly that law is working. However, Parliament has not put in place measures that would back up and buttress that law and give it the best possible chance. There are several things of that kind that could be done, none of which impinges to any great degree on personal or commercial freedoms. I have picked on one of those measures in this amendment, and it relates to proxy sales. When we consider the subject of underage smoking, we should remember one important fact, which is that one of the most likely ways for a young person to get hold of cigarettes is from adults. This is true both for their first ever cigarette and for underage regular smokers.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000067"></a>Currently there is no legal deterrent to adults who purchase tobacco on behalf of young people and supply it to them. It was therefore disappointing to see that in the Government&#146;s consultation of last year, they stated that they are not minded to make it illegal to proxy purchase, and gave two reasons. The first reason was that there was little evidence that proxy purchasing is a common practice. That statement was extremely puzzling. The Government&#146;s own figures as  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC404"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC404</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>quoted in the consultation document show that 89 per cent of young people cite that they either buy or are given cigarettes by another person. Thus, proxy purchasing, far from being uncommon, is the most serious component part of youth access to tobacco. The second reason given by the Government was that the law would be difficult to enforce. Here it is true that the burden of evidence required to prosecute a proxy purchaser creates an enforcement challenge and that there are barriers in the way of action on this front, mainly to do with resources.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000068"></a>However, recent developments in the enforcement of alcohol legislation show that it is possible and can be cost-effective. One example comes from the community alcohol partnership approach that is currently being trialled in parts of the country. In St Neots in Cambridgeshire, local agencies have been working with retailers and focusing resources on deterring and detecting underage alcohol sales using a combination of intelligence-led action against proxy sales and confiscation powers. As a result of this approach, a real reduction in underage drinking in the town was achieved, and the enforcement costs were no different from more standard enforcement approaches.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000069"></a>Although a proposal to make proxy purchasing an offence was briefly debated by Members in another place during the course of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, it was opposed by the Government. I do not believe that the issues have yet been fully debated&#151;I am not aware that they have been debated in this House&#151;and I strongly believe that such a measure would command public support. ACS recently commissioned an independent poll by GfK NOP, where 92 per cent of those who responded supported the introduction of penalties for adults who supply tobacco to children. Knowingly buying tobacco for a person who is legally too young to smoke is unarguably immoral and, I believe, should be illegal. The evidence available shows that it is one of the main routes by which underage smokers get hold of tobacco products, and that is why I believe that a strategy in this area that does not include a credible means of deterring adults from supplying tobacco to children is both incomplete and likely to fail. I beg to move.</p>

My only concern relates to the fact that, as he has suggested, to implement a statute along these lines might ultimately be very difficult to police. But that does not mean that attempts should not be made to introduce legislation to protect youngsters from other people who might buy cigarettes on their behalf.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000071"></a>I confess that I was somewhat surprised by his comments in the last debate that he recognised the health hazards associated with smoking but was concerned with issues relating to commercial freedom. I remember very well&#151;I have already shared my personal smoking history with the Committee&#151;that when I became a medical student in 1941, the dean of medicine who was then a professor of anatomy advised all the medical students to smoke, particularly in the dissecting room, to try and dispel the odours.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000072"></a>During the war all cigarettes went under the counter. I was a regular smoker, as were all my colleagues, and none of us had the slightest difficulty in obtaining cigarettes even though they were not on display; our friendly local newsagent sold them to us from under the counter. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent retailers from continuing to sell cigarettes. All it will do is make it much more difficult for them to do so on the basis of displays which are likely to attract individuals. Having heard the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, I cannot resist quoting from <I>World Tobacco</I>, the tobacco industry journal, which stated in 1999:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030923000184"></a>&#147;If your brand can no longer shout from billboards let alone from the cinema screen ... at least court smokers from the retailers&#146; shelf&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000169"></a>That is an important point. However, the principles underlying the amendment are worthy of warm support and I hope that the Government will give it a fair wind.</p>
<h5><a name="09030923000189"></a>5 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09030923000073"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030923000235"></a>Baroness Coussins:</b> I support the noble Earl&#146;s amendment to create a new offence of proxy purchase. I do so because of my experience in campaigning for the introduction of a similar offence in relation to alcohol when I was chief executive of the Portman Group, and from seeing the value of that offence in action once it was brought into law in the Licensing (Young Persons) Act 2000, which came into force in January 2001. However, it is relevant to add that in Scotland proxy purchase for alcohol has been an offence since 1976.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000074"></a>Comparisons with alcohol legislation are relevant to the tobacco issue. If I remember correctly, the proxy purchase proposal on alcohol began life in another place as a Private Member&#146;s Bill, although in the end, as the noble Earl said, the Government supported it. One of the most compelling parts of the evidence which supported the offence in relation to alcohol was a research finding that showed that the people most likely to approach strangers in the street and ask them to buy alcohol for them were 13 year-old girls. I am not aware of any parallel evidence in relation to tobacco, but I bet 13 year-old girls are the group most likely to approach strangers in the street. Those young girls, of course, will expose themselves to all manner of other dangers as well as to the dangers of smoking.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000075"></a>If an offence of proxy purchase was a good idea in relation to alcohol, how much more so is it a good idea in relation to tobacco? I hope, for example, that, as with alcohol, it would trigger a large number of awareness and enforcement campaigns&#151;there are already dozens of these all over the UK in relation to alcohol&#151;involving the police, PCSOs and trading standards officers working together to raise awareness of the law and to enforce it.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000076"></a>Of course, comparisons between alcohol and tobacco are not always, or even often, justified and relevant. I support the proposals in the Bill to restrict some of the marketing freedoms around tobacco, but were they made in relation to alcohol I would not support them. That is not to say that there is not sometimes a need for legislation in relation to alcohol, not least for a legal purchase age, but with alcohol there is a genuine role for education to promote moderation and  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC406"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC406</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>responsibility; that is not the case in relation to tobacco. There is a sensible drinking message but there is no sensible smoking message. However, the amendment which proposes an offence of proxy purchase would introduce a measure which holds good across both alcohol and tobacco. I believe it would command broad support across a wide range of stakeholders, from parents to retailers.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000077"></a>We have seen with the smoking ban, first in Scotland and then more recently in England and Wales, that there is an interesting relationship between legislation and culture change; no one now thinks it is right or normal to light up a cigarette in pubs or restaurants. A new offence of proxy purchase is now needed to help change the culture so that unscrupulous adults no longer think it is either right or normal to go into shops and buy cigarettes to pass on to children in the street. Perhaps this time the Government could be on the front foot and not leave it to Scotland to try it first or to a Private Member&#146;s Bill. The Government should give serious consideration to this measure, take the lead and bring it into the main body of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000078"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09030923000236"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> Although the noble Earl will know that I cannot support him in relation to displays or vending machines, and I do not see this provision as a replacement, I support the amendment and ask the Government closely to consider it. If the only argument against it is that it is difficult to police, many other things are difficult to police but we ensure that we do our best. It is very difficult in some areas of the country that I know well to police the distribution of certain drugs, but we would not say that because of that we would fail to try to do so.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000079"></a>We know that LACORS, which is the organisation with responsibility for policing those areas, would like to combine the policing of tobacco and alcohol because the two are not unrelated when young women are trying to find someone to make purchases for them on the street. I therefore ask the Government to look carefully at this, although I hope that the noble Earl understands that I see it as a package rather than a replacement.</p>

In particular, I endorse her point that this is part of the much wider approach on tobacco control contained in the Bill. It is in no sense a stand-alone or alternative measure. I certainly welcome the noble Earl's determination to do something about young people being able to get hold of cigarettes and this is a way to do that. I must tease him slightly because there is even less research evidence to support the view that this would work than there is for the proposition on point-of-sale display, which we have already spent so much time debating in Committee.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000081"></a>If this is part of a comprehensive package which includes banning point-of-sale material and vending machines, plain packaging and the licensing of tobacco, which is the subject of Amendment 106 to be moved by the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, we may be able to do something about the problem of young people and smoking. This is part of the approach.

I chair CitizenCard, which is a proof-of-age card mostly funded by the tobacco industry&#151;not by the Government&#151;and by other industries that contribute to the sale of goods such as alcohol. The provision would be a very good thing. At the moment, shopkeepers who belong to our scheme&#151;almost 2 million proof-of-age cards have been sold&#151;keep a diary on the desk. If a child whom they think is under age comes to them and asks to buy tobacco and they refuse because they have no proof of age, they keep a record that they have refused the child. However, if an adult comes into the shop at the same time, buys the cigarettes and passes them to the child, the tobacconist is then tarred with the same brush. Many small shop keepers would welcome the provision and it would certainly help them with the very difficult problem of controlling the sale of tobacco to underage children.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000083"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09030923000239"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Amendment 86 would make it illegal for adults to buy tobacco on behalf of children, a practice known as proxy purchasing.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000084"></a>The noble Earl&#146;s intention behind the amendment, to reduce the number of underage people who can access tobacco, is of course completely commendable and we agree with it. We all agree that it is wrong for adults to supply children with cigarettes. It undermines the law and encourages young people to experiment with and take up smoking, with all the long-term health consequences that we have discussed.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000085"></a>At the moment, the Government feel that the law must be enforceable and proxy purchasing is a difficult offence to pursue. This is partly confirmed by our experience of the rarity of prosecutions for proxy purchasing of alcohol, although I take on board the broader points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins. Proxy purchasing for alcohol is not currently undertaken by local authorities but by the police. For local authorities to implement proxy purchasing for tobacco, they would need formal authorisation to undertake surveillance. This would therefore place a burden on local authorities requiring them to observe shops to monitor sales and subsequent provision of tobacco to young people. Furthermore, other means of obtaining cigarettes are more commonly used by underage people. As we have discussed, in 2006 almost 80 per cent of children aged between 11 and 15 bought their own cigarettes from a shop.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000086"></a>New sanctions against offenders will come into force on 1 April 2009, which will mean that magistrates will have the power to impose orders prohibiting the sale of tobacco for periods of up to a year by persons or shops that are found to have sold tobacco to people under 18. The Government have made additional resources available to local authorities through LACORS for the enforcement of tobacco-related legislation. These additional resources are to enable local trading standards officers to carry out tobacco test purchases  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC408"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC408</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more frequently. The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 increased the sanctions against retailers, for example, who persistently sell tobacco to under age people. We are working with local authorities and retailer representatives to ensure that the law is understood, retailers are given guidance and support and trading standards officers are able to take action against irresponsible retailers who persistently continue to sell tobacco to children.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000087"></a>Better enforcement of existing legislation is, at the moment, likely to be more effective than adding another offence which is difficult to enforce. However, a similar amendment on proxy purchasing of tobacco was debated in this House in March 2008 and was withdrawn following a debate on the issue. The Government then promised to keep the position under review; we are doing so and I make that promise again. We would certainly welcome evidence on the issue of proxy purchasing of tobacco.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000088"></a>Although I am sure that noble Lords would agree that reducing children&#146;s access to tobacco is extremely important, at the moment we believe that creating an offence for proxy purchasing would be difficult and unenforceable.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000089"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09030923000240"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I cannot understand what my noble friend means by &#147;under review&#148;. Surely, if proposed new subsection (2A) were inserted into the law, a person would know they were committing an offence if they walked into a shop and attempted to buy tobacco on behalf of an individual under the age of 18. Irrespective of whether they were prosecuted, they would know that they were committing an offence. Surely that would affect their conduct in deciding on whether they were going to enter the shop and buy the cigarettes for the person under 18. So I cannot see what has to be kept under review there.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000090"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09030923000241"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> The issue that we are keeping under review relates, first, to seeing how the new sanctions being introduced on 1 April will work. Also, 49 per cent of children are given cigarettes by their friends. This involves children and young adults buying a packet of cigarettes and sharing them with their friends. This is another issue that would need to be resolved if this proposal became legislation. We would have to be careful not to criminalise those young people rather than trying to enable them, as the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, said, to make responsible choices and decisions.</p>

She told us about her experience with the alcohol industry where she said it is already an offence for anyone to procure drinks for a person under the age of 18. What is the evidence of prosecutions for such an offence relating to alcohol?</p>

I will endeavour to get the actual figures for the noble Lord, but these are rare offences. The noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, made the powerful point that the introduction of the legislation allowed a large amount of education and information to be made available and a campaign to take place on that issue, which was beneficial. That campaign could not take place in this instance because, as she pointed out, as there is no safe level for smoking.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000099"></a>I am sure she would agree that we are after a cultural change in the area of youth smoking. Creating parity between alcohol and tobacco in the way that the law treats proxy purchasing would send out a powerful message to children, parents and, for that matter, all adults alike, but it would also rebalance the burden of responsibility in this area. When it comes to enforcement, retailers are naturally in the front line. It is up to them to enforce the age limit for tobacco sales, and they run the risk of legal sanctions if they fail to do so. If the Government get their way, retailers will also be landed with the burden of enforcing the ban on displays at the point of sale. To make it illegal for an adult to buy cigarettes or tobacco on behalf of a minor would tackle the demand side of the problem by putting a legal onus on the purchaser, not just the seller.</p>

If the Government are not minded to go quite as far as prohibiting vending machines, four of the amendments provide that they can be prohibited with a small number of exceptions. That is the purpose of these amendments. I declare an interest as a council member of the British Heart Foundation, from whom I have received briefing, but it should be said that I have received briefing material from those on both sides of the argument. I should also say where I am coming from: as a former Permanent Secretary, I understand the Minister&#146;s dilemma in seeking the correct balance between the rights of individuals to do something that is legal, the rights of businesses to carry on a legal trade and the Government&#146;s wish to help people to give up smoking and to stop children from purchasing cigarettes. It is a difficult balance and part of my argument is that I do not think that it is right on this occasion. We are in danger of coming to a poor compromise rather than a good balance.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000103"></a>Vending machines are designed for convenience so that people are able to purchase goods, quite often without supervision&#151;indeed, for some of the goods they purchase in this way, they may not wish to be supervised. It would be easy to think that they would be ideal for children to use if they wanted to purchase cigarettes without being seen by those supervising them. The figures show that that view is right. One per cent of the tobacco market comes through vending machines, so it is a small but material amount. A 2007 survey showed that 17 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 15 used vending machines as their usual source of supply. That translates to one in six children, and thus 46,000 children between the ages of 11 and 15.</p>

The figure is not quite as high as 99 per cent, but it is substantial. That is partly why we have a muddle here because children actually do find it relatively easy to get access to vending machines.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000106"></a>As I have said, 17 per cent of children use vending machines as their usual source of supply. A survey in 2008 showed that 5 per cent of adults had used a vending machine in the past six months. So there is a simple argument that these machines make it much more convenient for children to purchase cigarettes,  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC411"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC411</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but that if they were not there selling tobacco, they would not disadvantage many adults who in any case have other sources of supply. That is the major part of the argument, but I want to make a number of subsidiary points in support and to look at the level of what the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has described as the &#147;collateral damage&#148; of introducing such a prohibition.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000107"></a>First, this would be in line with every other bit of government legislation dealing with products that are banned for children. It would be ridiculous if alcohol was available in vending machines; we would find that quite extraordinary. There is some comfort for the noble Baroness in that every other aspect of UK legislation treats products not available to children in the same way. We know also that 22 countries in Europe do not permit the sale of tobacco in vending machines. Again I agree entirely with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, but that is not a reason for us to do it. However, if the body of opinion suggests that people are not allowing cigarettes to be sold in vending machines, the burden is on us to show why we are different, not why we would be the same if we did what other people in Europe do.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90309-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000108"></a>The third point is that public opinion would probably be with a prohibition. Again, like the Minister, I am somewhat suspicious of surveys of public opinion. Nevertheless, the figures I see here show that 65 per cent of the general public would support a prohibition on the sale of tobacco in vending machines. In other words, the public are two to one in favour of such a prohibition. So there are many reasons why I would encourage the noble Baroness to be brave enough to put this prohibition in the Bill. After all, she can simply say to the public without appearing as though she is a nanny, or whatever else she may be accused of, &#147;We are prohibiting the sale of cigarettes in vending machines because, although relatively few adults use them, they are a significant source of supply for children. Adults have other ways of obtaining cigarettes; children will find it much more difficult&#148;. That seems to be a very straightforward argument.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000109"></a>Let us look at the collateral damage. I started by talking about vending machines as being about convenience, and I think that they are about convenience rather than liberty. I do not think that the Government are infringing people&#146;s liberty by prohibiting the sale of tobacco from vending machines. It is hard to argue that buying a smaller packet of cigarettes at a higher price from a machine rather than having to go and get it from a man or a woman at a bar is a pretty fundamental liberty.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000110"></a>The commercial arguments, in general, do not look very strong either. Presumably adults will switch to other sources and that may benefit the small newsagents and traders, although I have seen no evidence as to what the effect will be on overall sales of tobacco. Therefore, it is difficult to judge what the effect will be on tobacco companies, although I appreciate that they will want as many outlets and opportunities as possible to put their product in front of the customer. I imagine that the real losers will be those who manufacture and maintain vending machines, but perhaps they have other products that they can put in them.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000111"></a>I come to where I think we are at a compromise&#151;</p>

They are specialist machines produced by special manufacturers. I shall cover the exact numbers when  I come to speak to my amendment but there are 200 private cigarette vending machine businesses employing 1,000 people. I suppose that another 1,000 on the dole does not matter but I happen to think that that is quite important.</p>

One can think of loads of products that could equally easily be sold from those machines. There is nothing special about them being tobacco vending machines; they are vending machines that could sell something else.</p>

Perhaps I may move on to say that this is a somewhat muddled compromise. The obvious thing would be to say, &#147;Let&#146;s try and make sure that only adults and not children have access to vending machines&#148;. That would be a very sensible route, and it seems that it is being suggested in two ways. One, as the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, has already said, is to put the machines in places where children are not allowed&#151;that is, in bars. The figures that I have suggest that something like 75 per cent of vending machines are in pubs and the others are in a range of other facilities, some of which are licensed premises. Nevertheless, we note from the figures that at the moment 17 per cent of children get their supply of cigarettes from vending machines.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000116"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09030923000257"></a>Lord Naseby:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord. In the survey to which he referred, the children were asked where they &#147;usually&#148; purchased and where they &#147;often&#148; purchased their cigarettes. They were given a choice of 14 locations. The total number of answers to those questions amounted to 227 per cent, because inevitably some people gave more than one answer to some questions. So, if my maths are correct, adjusting downwards to 100 per cent the gross figure of 17 per cent would become 7.5 per cent. Furthermore, the noble Lord keeps referring to the word &#147;usually&#148; but the word on the questionnaire was &#147;often&#148;. I think that we should be accurate in relation to these surveys.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000117"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09030923000258"></a>Lord Crisp:</b> I do not think that my argument depends on 17 per cent being the precise figure. My argument is that many children are able to, and currently do, purchase cigarettes from vending machines wherever they happen to be.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000118"></a>The Department of Health, in association with business and commercial bodies, has issued guidance that recommends that vending machines should be located within the sight of a supervisory person at the  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC413"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC413</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bar. That does not seem to be borne out by colleagues from the British Heart Foundation who did a short pub crawl around this area last Tuesday or Wednesday and identified two pubs within walking distance of here where the vending machine was not in the line of sight of someone behind the bar. If the Minister wishes to check this out for herself, it is much nearer than Saskatoon. As things stand at the moment, the guidance does not seem to be working. In a busy pub with five doors and which is crowded at different times of the day, it is quite easy to see how children, particularly those who look 15 or 16 rather than 10 or 11, can get in and get cigarettes. Whatever the precise figure is, there is sufficient evidence that a number of children do that.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000119"></a>The other route to curb this is to have a system of an age ID card. I do not have any hard figures but we probably underestimate the skill of our children if we think they will not be able to get around it. This has been introduced in a number of countries, including Germany&#151;there is also an article on it in the <I>Irish Times</I>&#151;but some surveys suggest that these kinds of mechanisms generally do not work. However, I do not want to put too much weight on those surveys because they are not yet complete.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000120"></a>In order to preserve vending machines we are trying to set up systems which will not work very effectively and will have loopholes that will allow children still to be able to purchase cigarettes. We are making life much more complicated than we need to when a simple solution is available to the Minister: that is, to prohibit the sale of tobacco in cigarette machines. Adults who are disadvantaged can easily go somewhere else, and that may well benefit the small corner shop. She does not need to be brave to go down this route because the amendment is in line with all other government legislation on this kind of issue, in line with much of what our European neighbours do and, so far as we can tell, in line with public opinion. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000121"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09030923000259"></a>Baroness Finlay of Leadoff:</b> I strongly support the amendment for several reasons. It is slightly worrying that the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, is supporting as a good thing the findings of a survey which found that children under the age of 18 are smoking. I do not think anyone is arguing that we should deregulate smoking to include under-18s. The problem is that when under-18s start smoking, the addictive potential is extremely high. That is precisely why the tobacco companies have a great interest in very young people smoking.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000122"></a>The Minister referred earlier to the report from the Royal College of Physicians that compared the addiction factor of nicotine to that of other drugs. Nicotine came top when compared with heroin, cocaine, alcohol and caffeine in terms of dependence among users; equal top in terms of difficulty in obtaining abstinence; equal top in terms of tolerance, that is, the need for a higher and higher dose to get the same effect; and top in terms of its serious effects on society through deaths from cigarette-related diseases.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000123"></a>The point made by my noble friend Lord Crisp is that although vending machines account for only 1 per cent of all sales, they account for 17 per cent of all sales to the under-18s.</p>

Therefore it is 7.5 per cent. Furthermore, is she not encouraged that that is one-third down on the previous survey in 2004? It is too high, I agree, but let us have the right figure.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000126"></a>We would never contemplate alcohol or fireworks being sold in vending machines. Vending machines are easily accessed by youngsters. In an exercise carried out in Solihull in September 2008 where a 16 year-old was commissioned, if you like, by the council to see what could happen, the 16 year-old was able to buy 100 cigarettes from five different cigarette vending machines in Knowle and Solihull town centre without being challenged. In Bournemouth, trading standards officers carried out a similar undercover operation and found that a 15 year-old could buy cigarettes from seven out of eight vending machines without being challenged. In one case, the owner even helped the boy to find some change.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000127"></a>Our main concern must be for the long-term health of young people, the under-18s. This move would cut off a ready source, an easy source for them to access tobacco, which has a high addictive potential and will therefore hook them for the rest of their lives. It will not harm the small shop keeper, as has already been said. In fact, I would have expected small shop keepers to be flooding the Committee with welcome for the amendment. As has been said, those machines can take boxes of a certain size into which anything could be put. We should not have this debate, but, for the record, contraception being more readily available to youngsters to avoid unplanned pregnancy would certainly have my support; but having tobacco in those machines does not.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000128"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09030923000262"></a>Lord Monson:</b> The noble Lord who moved the amendment asserted that adults who wanted to buy cigarettes could easily get them from somewhere other than vending machines. That is by no means always the case. Many cheaper hotels, chain hotels of a type such as travel lodges&#151;not merely those but other, larger hotels in city centres that cannot afford the heavy overtime costs associated with keeping the reception desk or the bar manned all through the night&#151;have vending machines because they often effectively close down completely between 9 pm and 7 am. Children do not normally go into hotels to look for vending machines. Noble Lords supporting the amendment should reflect on that fact and consider compromising by accepting the excellent Amendment 90 in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Howe.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000130"></a>I mention that because I spent four years desperately trying to stop, lying to friends, ever denying that I was smoking, desperate to buy cigarettes in small quantities, which I could not. An amendment may turn up on Report that deals with the ability to buy cigarettes in small quantities, to which I would be sympathetic because of my problem: whenever I wanted to buy any cigarettes, I had to buy 10. I think that we should make it as difficult as possible for people to buy cigarettes, especially those people who are trying to stop. I remember going out at midnight or one o&#146;clock in the morning, getting in my car and driving around the town looking for any source of cigarettes that I could purchase to deal with my problem&#151;the problem of desperately trying to stop.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000131"></a>I am not alone. I have talked to many people over the years who have tried to stop. We all know people who are trying to stop. We buy patches; we buy all kinds of things. The availability of cigarettes in machines makes it very difficult for those who want to stop, because invariably they find out where they are. I would firmly support any amendment to restrict availability to people who are in the position I was in at that time.</p>

I always find it slightly illogical that we have reached a point where there is no smoking in public places, yet still there are vending machines in hotels, restaurants and pubs where you cannot smoke what you have bought from those vending machines. That means that you will have to go out anyway, and there is usually a corner shop not that far away whose business could be enhanced.</p>

I am also concerned about age-verification systems, because those who say that we can deal with the matter by providing ID cards should know that ID checks are still not being carried out stringently enough on alcohol sales. According to Home Office figures, in 2004, 22 per cent of 10 to 17 year-olds who had drunk alcohol had obtained it from bars and pubs; 34 per cent of on-trade venues failed to check ID cards for young people. If a significant number of under-18s are still able to obtain alcohol from pubs and bars, it is highly questionable that an ID-based age verification system will be sufficiently foolproof to stop underage tobacco sales from vending machines.</p>

The issue was that vending machines were being changed to operate with tokens. The study noted that in 79 per cent of premises where the vending machines were token operated, thereby requiring the purchaser to buy tokens first from a staff member, minors&#151;that is under-18s&#151;were prevented from buying cigarettes, while in only 24 per cent of premises where machines were coin-operated were minors stopped from buying tobacco. Although this is not in the amendment, perhaps at Report we should bring in an amendment to make sure that vending machines can be token operated. That would stop it.</p>

I do not know whether any noble Lords can remember those rusting and out-of-use Cadbury vending machines on railway stations. My mother used to say that before the war you could get a bar of chocolate out of those machines for a penny. I do not know whether that gave me a lifelong aversion to war, but I certainly remember vending machines very fondly. The love affair continued into my medical student days when often the only cigarettes available late at night, when one had finished work, were from a vending machine. They were usually Embassy, and they were awful, but they were from a vending machine somewhere in a dark back street. So I support what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours said. If you want to give up, you can always find a cigarette somewhere, and a vending machine is usually the source.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000138"></a>I support the amendment because children, as we have heard, find it very easy to get cigarettes from vending machines. I should add another point; I knew a teenager who used to brag about how he could get two packets for the price of one, because he was good at operating the drawer of the vending machine. He never taught me how to do it, as I had given up smoking long before then. Young teenagers find vending machines a challenge, and they brag about how they can get stuff out of them. There is no need. If an adult wants to get his cigarettes and it is late at night, our shops do not close at 5.30 any more. There are even shops that operate for 24 hours. You can always get whatever you want at any time of day. There is therefore no excuse to have something that is so dangerous to people&#146;s health available from a vending machine.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000139"></a>I support the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, in her remarks about condoms. I well remember, as a local councillor, trying to introduce a condom vending machine in our local college. The opposition to that was tremendous: it would pollute our youth, it would make them ill; I do not know what else a condom vending machine would do to them. But, of course, cigarette machines were easily available all over the borough. I rest my case.</p>

This is one of those cases where the Committee wishes to go a little further than the Government seem ready to, and I rather hope that when my noble friend reports back to her colleagues on how this debate has gone today&#151;and how I suspect it will go again on Report&#151;the Government will be willing to look at the possibility of a complete ban, rather than this halfway house of a system of tokens, age restrictions for the issuing of them and so on.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000143"></a>As other speakers have told the Committee, children are extraordinarily ingenious in getting around technical obstacles that to most of us would be insuperable. I have no doubt that the copying of tokens and the begging and borrowing of them would be a great sport for young people who wanted to get their cigarettes from vending machines in future. It would be so much easier if we followed the practice of 22 other countries&#151;which is about to include Scotland as well&#151;and say that cigarette vending machines have had their day and we do not want them any more.</p>

With one exception, Amendments 97 to 103 would make equivalent changes to mirror them in Clause 21, relating to the regulation of tobacco vending machines in Northern Ireland. Since those groups have the same effect on Clauses 20 and 21, I will speak to them all.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000145"></a>The main effect would be to compel the Government to prohibit tobacco vending machines, as outlined by my noble friend in his last contribution. In this instance, and at the moment, we believe that we need to take a proportionate approach, giving vending machine operators and owners an opportunity to prevent underage sales before prohibiting tobacco sales altogether&#151;

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000146"></a>The groups of amendments would make a number of changes and I shall take each in turn. First, a number of them would create an absolute duty on the appropriate Ministers, compelling them to ban tobacco vending machines outright. We have amendments, which will be discussed shortly, to remove the power to ban vending machines, and amendments that would simply ban them. We believe that at the moment we should take a middle road. It may help if I explain how we intend to use the powers in England.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000147"></a>We agree with the principle of the amendments&#151;that we must prevent underage sales from tobacco machines. I was struck by the contribution of my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, who said that there was also a need to support adults who try to give up smoking, notwithstanding the love affair of the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, with vending machines. We intend to bring in regulations to restrict access to vending machines by children and young people under 18, while maintaining this source of cigarettes for adults. We intend these restrictions to apply from 2011. However, we will review the effectiveness of the new requirements over a period of two years following implementation. If it appears that restrictions are not successful in preventing underage purchases, we will reconsider moving to ban the sale of tobacco products from vending machines altogether.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000148"></a>The approach that I have outlined to the Committee clearly requires both options to be available&#151;for regulations either to impose requirements or to prohibit tobacco vending machines. In this respect, therefore, it is vital that the powers remain discretionary, but I assure noble Lords that, as a minimum, powers to regulate vending machines will certainly be used.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000149"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, referred to token-operated machines. In determining how to take forward regulations to require age-check mechanisms for tobacco vending machines, we will explore international evidence to compare the effectiveness and practices of different methods of age restriction. As the noble Baroness mentioned, a number of European member states have introduced age-restriction mechanisms on vending machines, and we shall seek to learn from their experience to ensure that our age restrictions are applied effectively in preventing underage sales.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000150"></a>Amendments 92 and 100 would add explicit powers for regulations to make exemptions from the prohibition of vending machines. If the aim is to exempt certain types of vending machine, or certain types of premises where they are located, then the amendments are not needed. New Section 3A(7) in Clause 20 already allows us to make exemptions in regulations for particular cases, should we decide that that is appropriate.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000151"></a>Currently we do not see the case for any exemptions but we do not rule them out. In determining how to take forward the detailed requirements for age-check mechanisms, we will seek the opinions of stakeholders, such as the National Association of Cigarette Machine Operators, and we will listen and give serious consideration

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000152"></a>I note that Amendment 90 is due to be discussed next and that that touches on this issue. We see practical difficulties here but perhaps we should defer discussion until the noble Earl, Lord Howe, moves his amendment.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000153"></a>Next come Amendments 95 and 103. These create duties on appropriate Ministers to consult persons likely to be affected by the regulations before making them. I am happy to agree that open consultation is an important principle and I am pleased to be able to give reassurance on this. However, I wonder why it is felt necessary to consult when the other amendments would do away with tobacco vending machines altogether. In that case, what would we consult about?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90309-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000154"></a>The Government will work with trade bodies, enforcement organisations and other stakeholders to inform the development of secondary legislation. We then intend to conduct a full three-month formal public consultation on draft regulations following Royal Assent. This would give business both certainty and ample preparation time by laying regulations as early as possible and, in any event, well before the first commencement dates due in 2011.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000155"></a>In England, officials in the Department of Health are already working with their colleagues in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform on arrangements for these initial discussions to take place. In Northern Ireland, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety also intends to carry out a full three-month formal public consultation on the draft regulations and is fully committed to engaging with key stakeholders on the implementation of the proposed new measures.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000156"></a>In recognition of the importance of these measures, all regulations relating to vending machines in England, Wales or Northern Ireland would be subject to approval by affirmative resolution of Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales or the Northern Ireland Assembly, so ensuring an appropriate opportunity for scrutiny and debate.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000157"></a>Lastly, I come to Amendment 96, which is the exception. It applies only to Clause 20 and has no mirror in Clause 21 in relation to Northern Ireland. This amendment would remove subsection (2), which makes a breach of the regulations on tobacco vending machines a &#147;tobacco offence&#148; for the purposes of restricted premises and restricted sales orders. I understand that if we have no power to impose requirements, this provision may appear unnecessary. However, it would still be needed in respect of any breach of a future prohibition on tobacco vending machines, particularly if there are exemptions to an outright ban.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000158"></a>These orders are part of a new system of &#147;negative licensing&#148; which aims to tackle those retailers who persistently sell tobacco to underage people. We will discuss this system in further detail when we discuss Amendment 106 concerning positive licensing. Suffice it to say for now that these orders may be applied to those retailers shown to have made underage sales at least three times over a period of two years. This is a

The aim of the system is to stop underage sales of tobacco.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000159"></a>We believe that it is appropriate to include breaches of the new offence relating to vending machines because clearly a breach of a requirement aimed at preventing underage sales is relevant. Such a breach is highly likely to have resulted in sales actually being made to young people under 18. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment and I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

<p><a name="09030923000160"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09030923000272"></a>Lord Crisp:</b> I thank the noble Baroness for her reply. I understand that she is being cautious in reaching a rather poor compromise rather than going for full prohibition straight away. Frankly, I do not understand why she feels she needs to do that. It does not seem to me that it is in the interests of small shop keepers. It is not in the interests of smokers, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said. As someone who has given up smoking at least 20 times&#151;for the past 20 years, successfully&#151;I understand precisely that having cigarettes available in a bar makes it too convenient to get hold of them. Further, it does not seem to prevent underage people getting hold of cigarettes.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030923000161"></a>I come back to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, and the article from the <I>Irish Times</I> which she has just handed to me. Restrictions introduced to stop children gaining access to cigarettes and vending machines may work in the first instance, but we underestimate children. They will rapidly learn to get round those restrictions, however complicated we make them. The normal lures of the market economy will apply. I would not be surprised if children soon began to trade in tokens in playgrounds and schools. That is what always happens in these situations. We will get into an escalating arms race, as it were, introducing ever more complicated methods to try to stop children using these machines, and children will get a cracking education in learning how to get round the restrictions we introduce. Therefore, I do not see the point in the caution. I hope that the noble Baroness will reconsider it between now and Report. Having said all that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09030925000001"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09030925000090"></a>Lord Naseby:</b> Bearing in mind the debate we have just had, I can be relatively brief on my amendment. It states that vending machines should be regulated, not prohibited. I have two key points to add to what was said in that debate. First, I, too, will welcome the day when no young people smoke. I congratulate the Government; the percentage of young people smoking is falling. I quoted from the survey that showed that between 2004 and 2006 the incidence of young people had fallen by one-third. That is good progress, although further progress is needed. Conversely&#151;and I find this worrying, as I mentioned in my earlier speech, and my noble friend on the Front Bench has mentioned it&#151;the main sources for those young people who still smoke are other people and illicit buying from people who have smuggled cigarettes in and are selling them off cheap at boot fairs and so on. If the Government want to reduce smoking among our young people still further, those two sources have to be tackled. My noble friend has put forward an amendment in relation to adults buying on behalf of young people. We have talked about alcohol; that is a key area that the Minister needs to take seriously. The second area, smuggling and illicit supplies, needs to be cracked down on by Her Majesty&#146;s Customs.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000002"></a>Secondly, can regulation work? That was the implication of the Minister&#146;s response to the previous amendment, and that is encouraging. No one  suggests that this whole thing is working beautifully on the ground but it was interesting that here, in London, Trading Standards carried out a vigorous enforcement action. It has an intensive programme of activities, including letters and personal visits, aimed at those premises whose compliance with underage legislation was poor. The organisation then went back after a period of time to check whether or not there was compliance from those sources and, quite remarkably, it got a 100 per cent compliance rate. If you have good, strict regulation you can get compliance, and you can make it difficult for those who do not comply. There was a similar story in Wales. Obviously other parts of the country are failing, and I suggest to the Government that it is high time that they cracked down on those local authorities that are not putting the same energy into this that London and Wales are.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000003"></a>I look to the department for a proportionate response and to see the regulations being enforced properly, and the Minister indicated that that was going to happen. There is still a threat of prohibition&#151;even the Minister&#146;s tone of voice goes up a bit when that word comes in&#151;and there is a problem: if there is an emphasis on possible prohibition, people will not put in the investment that will be required to ensure that they shift the machines round a bit, or whatever. I hope that the Minister will put her emphasis on good regulation and see that it happens. At this stage, my amendment would delete the word &#147;prohibition&#148;. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09030925000004"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09030925000091"></a>Earl Howe:</b> I shall speak to my Amendment 90, which is grouped here. I view the Government&#146;s proposals on vending machines in a very different light from those relating to point-of-sale displays. There is a real issue regarding vending machines, which is that young  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC422"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC422</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people frequently have access to them. It is a clear means whereby the law on sales to minors can be circumvented, and I support the proposals to regulate in this area.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000005"></a>What I do not support, however, is preventing adult smokers from purchasing cigarettes from vending machines if they wish to do so. Vending machines are an expensive way of buying cigarettes but it should be open to an adult smoker to use this route. I do not want to detain the Committee by dwelling on the ground so ably covered by the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, and my noble friend in the last group of amendments, but there are some 70,000 vending machines in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, most of them in licensed premises such as pubs and clubs, and there is a voluntary code which is supposed to ensure that machines are located in areas that are supervised and monitored to prevent them being accessed by those who are under age. That code is clearly not adequate for the purpose; we know that many young people buy from vending machines. Quite how many is a matter for debate but the impact assessment to the consultation concludes that about 7.5 per cent of schoolchildren often obtain cigarettes from machines. That is not an acceptable state of affairs and it is clear that more needs to be done.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000006"></a>More has been done in terms of enforcement penalties in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 and the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008, but there need to be additional measures to make it even harder for young people to access tobacco from these machines. The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, referred to the technological means by which this could be achieved, in particular ID cards. I understand there are also ID coin systems and remote control. I am not qualified to judge whether these systems are likely to work well enough to achieve the desired purpose of eliminating illegal sales, but they are certainly likely to make an impact. ID cards, for example, are in use in a number of other countries.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000007"></a>The Government have stated, and the Minister has repeated today, that they intend to make regulations, to take effect in 2011, which would introduce age-restriction mechanisms, and these regulations would be given two years in which to prove themselves. If after that time they have not done so and underage sales from machines persist, the Government reserve the right to regulate for a complete ban on tobacco vending machines. I am unhappy about this. There are locations which, of their very nature, are accessible only by adults&#151;for instance, members-only clubs and similar establishments. The case does not seem to have been made for banning cigarette machines from such places. Like my noble friend Lord Naseby, I should like to hear the Minister&#146;s reasons for leaving this possibility open.</p>

<p><a name="09030925000008"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09030925000092"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> The amendments would remove the power to prohibit tobacco vending machines and limit regulations so that they could apply only to machines to which persons under the age of 18 are likely to have access. As we debated under the previo us group of amendments, Clause 20 provides that regulations may prohibit or impose requirements on tobacco vending machines.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC423"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC423</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000009"></a>I agree that it is important that the impact of new legislation on business is justifiable and is seen to be a proportionate response to the problem. I have already explained that our intention therefore is for regulations to first restrict access to vending machines by children while maintaining them as a source of tobacco or cigarettes for adults. We wish to give the tobacco vending machine suppliers and operators ample opportunity to make changes to eradicate under-age sales of cigarettes from their machines, so these restrictions will not apply until 2011. Let me be clear that if measures to stop young people buying cigarettes from vending machines are successful there will be no need for the Government to use the power to prohibit vending machines. However, we are committed to protecting children and young people from accessing tobacco, and if the restrictions fail to prevent underage purchases, we will then move to ban cigarette vending machines altogether. But we will allow at least two years&#146; operation before considering whether a complete prohibition of tobacco vending machines would be justified. In effect, those that operate vending machines or have them on their premises, have from now until at least 2013 to show that they are able to stop children buying cigarettes from their machines.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000010"></a>The evidence to justify action is clear: vending machines are the usual source of cigarettes for 17 per cent of the 11 to 15 year-olds who smoke. The British Heart Foundation estimates that 46,000 under-16 year-olds purchased cigarettes from vending machines in 2006 in England alone. It is therefore important that we retain the power to prohibit tobacco vending machines without further primary legislation should it be shown to be necessary.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000011"></a>I should point out, as have other noble Lords, that vending machines supply only 1 per cent of the adult cigarette market, so a complete prohibition on this sort of purchase would not, we believe, seriously inconvenience adult smokers as there would still be many alternative retail outlets from which they would be able to carry on buying cigarettes. It is important that we use this opportunity to take the power to prohibit tobacco vending machines, should we need to do so in the light of experience with a more limited approach. I cannot therefore accept Amendment 88.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000012"></a>Amendment 90 limits regulation-making powers to only those machines likely to be accessed by children; and I can appreciate the argument that if the aim is to tackle underage sales, it may not be necessary to impose requirements on tobacco vending machines that no one under 18 can use. First, however, I should like to take this opportunity to mention that new subsection 3A(7) already provides a power for regulations to make different provisions for different classes of case or circumstances. This power allows us to make exemptions, should we decide that that is appropriate.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000013"></a>I appreciate that some tobacco vending machines are in pubs and clubs that limit entry to patrons or members who are 18 or over. If we can be absolutely certain that young people would always be asked for proof of age before entering a particular premises, I can see that it could be argued that further requirements on how vending machines operate in such premises might seem unnecessary. But when we consider how  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC424"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC424</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this would work in practice, the risks and the burdens for enforcement become clear. First, how would we know which premises to exclude? There would need to be a process for premises to provide the necessary evidence and assurance that they consistently operate robust and reliable age-limiting policies and procedures whenever the premises is open to the public, and I am aware that club premises primarily used in the evenings or later at night may also be available for use during the daytime, which might mean that younger people are allowed access.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000014"></a>Secondly, there is the question of enforcement. Who will be responsible for deciding whether the premises were liable under the law or not? Local trading standards officers, perhaps, which would add to the burden and work of local authorities. Thirdly, what would happen if the age policy changed in the club? Would we need an offence of failure to notify a change in circumstances, and again who would keep track of such changes and take on the extra work that this would involve? The system would be rather difficult and burdensome on local enforcement authorities, and in addition it would be inflexible. We found that allowing such exemptions was proving ineffective in reducing underage tobacco sales. Under this amendment, our hands would be tied and we would be unable to bring those premises into the scope of the regulations without further primary legislation.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000015"></a>As I have explained, there is already a power in new subsection 3A(7) which would allow us to make exemptions or to impose different requirements in relation to different types of premises, should we decide that this is appropriate. So I do not rule it out at this stage. I remind noble Lords that in recognition of the importance of these measures, all regulations relating to vending machines in England and Wales would be subject to approval by affirmative resolutions of Parliament or the National Assembly for Wales as appropriate. Parliament would then have the opportunity to debate further whether a ban on tobacco vending machines would be justified. For these reasons I am not able to accept the amendment and hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

She is right to draw attention to the opportunity given to the House by the affirmative resolution procedure. I suppose my only plea to her is that her department should consult with London Trading Standards, which has clearly done a lot of effective work in this area, and hopefully learn from that experience. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

There have been a lot of comments today about piecemeal legislation, with things happening one year, then a little bit of legislation the next, and so on. Many feel that legislation has already gone too far in the banning of tobacco while some, like me, think that it has not yet gone far enough and that people should be discouraged even further from smoking tobacco. The Government may not accept any of the amendments that have been tabled during the course of the Bill, although I hope that they will reflect on them and make the Bill stronger by doing so.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000020"></a>It is patently obvious that in two years&#146; time, at the maximum, the Government should come up with a full strategy for the control of tobacco. It should be comprehensive and all-embracing so that everyone knows just where the Government are going and what they want to do about the issue of tobacco. Added to that, we need to know what is happening on the tobacco-smuggling front. That has been mentioned now and then in Committee, but we still do not have any clear evidence whether these measures will increase or decrease smuggling, or of what will happen. A strategy is needed, and we are proposing that by 2010 that strategy should be produced.</p>

<p><a name="09030925000021"></a>On a personal note, I wish that we could move ahead to a royal commission on all drugs, including alcohol and tobacco. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, commented earlier that we are saying that tobacco is more dangerous than cannabis; indeed, I think it is. We need to look at all the drugs that are available and consider all options for the control of drugs, including tobacco and alcohol. I hope that the Government will consider that in preparing their strategy.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000023"></a>I agree that we need a comprehensive strategy that encompasses all the issues relating to smoking and its reduction, particularly in the young. Throughout the world, the best tobacco-control interventions are those that are part of a clear, evidence-based plan that comprehensively addresses supply and demand alongside the problem of second-hand smoke. If we are to continue to drive down the prevalence of smoking and ensure that the legislation achieves all that it can to prevent youth smoking in particular, the measures proposed in the Bill must be part of a comprehensive strategy.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000024"></a>Internationally and domestically, comprehensive strategies have been shown to be the most effective means to reduce smoking prevalence. The steady fall in smoking prevalence since 1998 in the UK can be attributed to the series of interventions which resulted from the publication of <I>Smoking Kills</I> and the additional funding that accompanied it. Internationally, that model has also found success. There are plenty of examples, Canada and New York being the key ones.<I></I><I>Smoking Kills </I>had a broad vision that is still necessary to address the enduring problems of health inequalities, youth uptake of smoking, exposure to second-hand smoke and the levels to which some groups are addicted to nicotine.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000025"></a>Ambitious targets are needed. The targets from<I></I><I>Smoking Kills</I> have largely been met, but we need new targets to address the heavy inequalities caused by smoking, smuggling and the continuing problem of exposure to second-hand smoke. The key area is evaluation and reporting. Perhaps the greatest shortcoming of <I>Smoking Kills</I> was the absence of an evaluation plan. It is vital that any new strategy should have a plan for evaluation running through it from the start. When we embark on innovative public health policy, we are morally bound to evaluate it. I make a plea for the Government to produce a strategy that encompasses all that in one plan spanning a period of time with clear time lines and ways to evaluate how successful the strategy is. I emphasise the need to have an evaluation strategy built in from the outset, an oversight panel of health experts and other stakeholders, from which we should exclude the tobacco industry, and clear milestones with opportunities to review the various components.</p>

<p><a name="09030925000027"></a>I return to my experience in the early 1990s when I was trying to stop smoking. I wanted information on the effectiveness of the various options to help me to stop smoking, but that information was simply unavailable. I remember that on one occasion I was advised to go to Harley Street, and I went for hypnosis because I was told that that was a way to deal with it. I think that I wasted about &#163;100. The point is that there was no authoritative source of information to guide me on whether to go for treatment in Harley Street and have hypnosis. I was advised that I should use patches. Again, the manufacturers of patches were very keen to tell us how wonderful they were, but I had no knowledge at the time, nor do I to this day, as to the incidence of success.</p>

<p><a name="09030925000028"></a>I remember being told that I could have acupuncture. I did not know whether acupuncture worked. Some people say that it does but, again, there was no authoritative source. I should have thought that any strategy document presented to Parliament would deal with the various options available to the public, enabling them choose which route they went down, given the options available.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000029"></a>If I recall correctly, in the mid-1990s, Frank Dobson introduced health action zones, where money was made available for anti-smoking strategies. An evaluation was done, but I remember reading the report from my health action zone. I never felt that the information that it provided was authoritative in the sense that it could pinpoint real success as against information that the health authority had gleaned and was using to justify the expenditure involved in the health action zone.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000030"></a>I should like to see in the report an explanation of the amount of money that has been put into research into helping people to stop smoking. I have always wondered why there was not a substitute drug on the market, which we could take in a pill or even an injection, to help us to stop smoking. If we can put a man on the moon, I cannot see why someone, somewhere has not been able to invent a product which would be a substitute for nicotine or smoking and which would enable us to run down. I understand that even to this day these products are not available. My sister has been trying to stop smoking for the past five years but she simply cannot stop.</p>

There certainly needs to be something else&#151;a dummy perhaps. Nicotine patches will substitute for cigarettes if it is nicotine that you are addicted to.</p>

Maybe they do work but, again, where is the assessment; where is the leaflet which sets out all the options distributed; where is the report to Parliament which sets out in detail all the options and how effective they are? I strongly support the amendment. I hope that it deals with the options for those who are desperately trying to stop.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC428"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC428</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

I preface my comments by saying that we have moved a long way. I am going back many years but I remember discussing in the Chamber nicotine patches and whether they should be available for free on the National Health Service. All that was pooh-poohed. I also remember a Member of the House who movingly spoke about being addicted to heroin or crack cocaine and managing to get off it through a lot of treatment. He still speaks openly about it, but he has never been able to get off smoking. The only time he was able to do so was through the sheer force of his wife&#146;s power. Every time she became pregnant he stopped smoking, but after three children she decided that she did not want to go on with that option.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000034"></a>Similarly&#151;I am generalising from the particular&#151;my sister was an alcoholic. She was dried out but she still could not give up cigarettes. She said it was so much easier to go dry and not give up cigarettes. She eventually died of cancer, but even to within a year of her death she still could not do it.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, made a very good point: there is a lot of information going around about what one can do about cancer&#151;exercise, look after your diet, do not smoke, of course&#151;and there is a great deal of emphasis on it. Similarly with heart disease: exercise, diet, do not smoke But no global statement is made by the health authorities and the Government&#151;and why should it be made by them? The commentators in the newspapers who talk about lifestyles should say that smoking is the one thing we should all try to do something about. When listening to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, I jotted down that we need to support those people who realise it is an addiction and just cannot break it. Too often when we see people smoking we say, &#147;Why do you not give up, for heaven&#146;s sake. You know what it is doing. Every single cigarette you smoke is taking five minutes off your life&#148;, but support is what they need, not criticism.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000036"></a>We need additional research into the means of stopping smoking. The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, mentioned patches, and they have been effective for people whom I know. However, no body of research or opinion is available to help people who desperately want to give up smoking that outlines the options and indicates which are best for those who have a certain lifestyle, work in a certain place or are overstressed. We need to encourage that because there is no question that smoking kills. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the proposed strategy.</p>

<p><a name="09030925000037"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0007.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09030925000103"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I offer my support for a comprehensive strategy. Indeed, my name is added to Amendment 107A, which proposes such a strategy. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, spoke about youth. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, described how difficult it is to give up as an adult. We know that  80 per cent of smokers begin smoking when they are children. I would welcome a strategy that focused on what more we can do to prevent children smoking. Sixty-eight per cent of teenage mothers are smokers and 45 per cent of them smoke during their pregnancies. That must be a further way of holding them back,

This country in particular needs to think about the welfare of its children. On many occasions my noble friend Lord Northbourne has raised in the House the difficulties experienced by families. The right honourable Iain Duncan Smith has reported on the difficulties that many of our families face. A recent UNICEF report placed us bottom of the developed world in terms of the welfare of children, with the United States just above us. The Children&#146;s Society&#146;s Good Childhood Inquiry highlighted how many children are now growing up in the absence of one or other parent. A third of our 16 year-olds now live apart from their biological father. When parents are absent, overwhelmed or unprepared, society has to do more to give children the right lead. Given these difficulties, we need to think very carefully about how we can avoid children getting sucked into a lifetime habit which will be so harmful to themselves and to their children. I hope that the noble Baroness will give this amendment very serious consideration.</p>

<p><a name="09030925000038"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09030925000104"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> I am pleased to add my support to both these amendments, which are similar and have a common aim. I again declare an unpaid interest as a trustee of Action on Smoking and Health and as a patron of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, drew attention to the need for more research on ways to encourage people to stop smoking. Greater effort should also be made to determine the causes of lung cancer. It is very easy to say that it is a self-inflicted smoking disease and therefore that there is no point in carrying out research on it. However, that is not entirely the case. A lot of medical research is carried out&#151;a lot is carried out at the University of Liverpool&#151;into the causes of lung cancer, particularly as regards its prevalence. It is done very much on a shoestring. There is very little funding for that research from the Department of Health. However, it is an important part of a complete strategy to tackle smoking.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000039"></a>As others have said, we have made remarkable progress in the 11 years since <I>Smoking Kills</I> was published. The fact that smoking prevalence in England is now down to 22 per cent, compared with between 25 and 30 per cent 20 years ago, shows that the measures we have pushed through Parliament have made a terrific difference; for example, the introduction of the ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship and the major reforms introduced in the most recent Health Act. However, although these prevalence rates are good for those of us who like going to restaurants, bars or public places and being in a smoke-free environment, they mask the fact that the social inequalities around the smoking prevalence figures are still enormous. Smoking prevalence rates are still 60, 70 or 75 per cent in some communities, particularly poor, working-class areas in the north of England. The message has not got through to them. A new, comprehensive strategy must take account of smoking inequalities and address communities where that is a real issue.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000040"></a>Certainly, one of the most important parts of a strategy is what we are attempting to do in this Bill, which is to discourage young people from starting smoking. Some countries have achieved dramatic

Canada and New York were mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Patel. Canada went from a prevalence of 30 per cent in 1990 to 19 per cent in 2006, and there is a prediction that it could go as low as 12 per cent by 2011. That shows what can be done if you address your mind to it. However, any action has to be taken across all sections of the community and, in particular, it must address the poorer sections of the community to whom normal health education messages are not getting through.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000041"></a>I hope very much that we will see a new strategy document from the Government. We need to bring <I>Smoking Kills</I> up to date and we need to look at new ways of encouraging people not to start and to give up if they are addicted. Smoking is a legal activity, it is what people want to do, and there is nothing in these measures or in the Bill to prevent that. However, we have a duty to try to help people to give up and we also have a duty to help children not to start smoking. A comprehensive strategy should include those items in particular.</p>

A 10-year programme would help those organisations and would necessitate a thorough examination into all the claims that are made about tobacco, for and against. For example, we could establish what information was accurate and what information was not, and what science was good and what science was junk. There is quite a bit of junk science around the tobacco industry.</p>

I think that we should also look at any benefits that there might be. I have to tell the Committee that, when I was very young and suffered from a bit of constipation, I went to see the doctor, who said, &#147;What you should do is sit on the lavatory and smoke a cigarette. That would help a lot&#148;. However, that was a long time ago and I am still here. As I said, we should then be able to test all sorts of assertions.</p>

<p><a name="09030925000055"></a>Very often there is a flaw in our approach to legislation.

What I like about this amendment is that it is saying that we really should

I wish we did that more often. It is terribly important.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000056"></a>I must declare an interest from my self-education; one of my daughters was pioneering some years back a combined local authority and National Health Service project on persuading pregnant women and young mothers not to smoke. I was startled by two things that she said, because she was totally committed to the cause. She said: &#147;You know, you do have to reflect on the realities with which I am sometimes faced. The first is that I work partly with young mothers, pregnant women, midwives, hospitals, training courses and the rest, but one of my biggest difficulties is working with general practitioners, many of whom do not take this issue as seriously as they should&#148;. If we are serious about achieving results on smoking, there is an issue that needs to be part of a comprehensive strategy.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000057"></a>What made an even greater impression on me was when she said, &#147;I have to face it that for some of these single mothers on limited means, living one hell of a life, their fag is the only enjoyment they really get in life&#151;the only break they get&#148;. This did not put her off her course, but she was suggesting that if we are going to make progress we have to look at the social context in which we are operating and at all the factors that have a bearing on the situation. What I like about the amendment is that it introduces that concept by saying, &#147;Yes, we should make it more difficult to smoke; yes, there are all sort of ways that we can curb the easy availability of tobacco, which is, of course, a bad thing&#151;but at the same time we really need to look (a) at whether we are achieving results, of course, but (b) at whether we are taking fully into account all the factors that we should be&#148;. I commend those who drafted the amendments, and I hope that the Government will take them seriously.</p>

<p><a name="09030925000058"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0007.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09030925000113"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> I, too, support the amendments. This seems to be a therapeutic part of the evening where we are all letting out our personal experiences. At the age of 17 I tried really hard to smoke. I bought a wonderful holder that was black, sort of ebony, with a silver ring around it. I thought I looked so elegant; I wanted to be like Audrey Hepburn. Sadly, though, there was no way. I could not smoke; I never got to like it.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000059"></a>With regard to the amendments, it is a good idea to have a strategy. Governments are keen on strategies, and the noble Lord, Lord Judd, is right that we have the strategies but the implementation is difficult. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, that one of the things the Government have tried to do is to get GPs involved. They have smoking cessation clinics, and their pay and QOF points are related to it. Pharmacists are now getting into smoking cessation clinics as well. Real attempts have been made.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000060"></a>My other point is about smuggling. In 2006-07 Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs estimated that between 9 per cent and 17 per cent of cigarettes&#151;that is a large gap, but I suppose it is hard to define&#151;and between 48 per cent and 59 per cent of hand-rolling tobacco were smuggled. As a result, the Government lost revenue

That is something that they should be tackling; we cannot afford, especially at this time when we are in such dire straits financially, to lose those sorts of sums of money. What action are the Government taking to try to stop the smuggling?</p>

I was relieved that he was actually on the side of the good and the great, as I always say, but I was pretty appalled by his final statements&#151;I would not like to be associated with them, although I thought he was great on some of the issues&#151;that it does not really matter if we all give up smoking here because BAT and Imperial Tobacco will be able to flog all the cigarettes they like to Africa and to Asia.

If one is to have a successful strategy, one needs to concentrate hard on promoting health and well-being so that people identify with having a better quality of life. It should not just be telling people what they cannot do, but showing them how much better their lives could be. A positive element must run through this, and again that is the argument in favour of a strategic approach.</p>

Indeed, many speakers have focused on children and the next generation because it does not really matter if older people smoke; the damage has already been done. When they look like prunes, their legs are dropping off and they cannot get up the stairs, whether they carry on smoking or stop is not going to make a huge amount of difference. I say that because I am distressed by those times when patients, having developed lung cancer in particular, say that they have now stopped smoking. The only response is just not to reply because  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC434"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC434</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one wants to say, &#147;It&#146;s too late&#148;. But damage to the baby in utero when the mother carries on smoking is crucial and we need to prioritise. Such prioritisation might also focus research money, which would be an important outcome.</p>

Interestingly, I may also be the only Member of the Committee whose GP smokes as well, but perhaps that is by the by. It was interesting to listen to the experience of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, because as a resident of Scotland there may be a leaf to be taken out of NHS Scotland&#146;s guidelines on how to stop smoking. I think I am right in saying that there is now a 24-hour helpline which people can call for counselling and advice on how to give up.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000069"></a>Once again, I want also to mention the terrible problem of smuggled goods. Lots of figures have been bandied around and there is a wide margin, but the figures I was given last week suggest that the Treasury is losing some &#163;3.8 billion a year. However much the Treasury loses, presumably it is absolute madness for it to lose anything at all. I, too, look forward very much to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

<p><a name="09030925000070"></a><b><a name="90309-gc0007.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09030925000122"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I remind the Committee of what was said earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Golding, and the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, about what goes on in schools. Some children sell cigarettes or there might be an exchange of coupons. Perhaps the noble Baroness could provide us with a note on what is currently being done to address smoking in schools, detailing the training of teachers and so forth. Further, with regard to newsagents, it occurs to me that they could become part of the strategy in terms of first reassuring them about the impact of these changes to their businesses, and then recognising that they are at the front-line in terms of dealing with children. Perhaps they might be incorporated into discussions with children who ask to buy cigarettes by telling them why it is so bad for them and why they should not start now. They might have a useful role in developing the things we have been discussing in the debate. Many newsagents are family businesses. People work extremely hard for their families in those businesses and they are concerned about the welfare of children.</p>

I missed the proposal to move these amendments, but I support them. I want to check a couple of thoughts with noble Lords which are for information purposes. First, I presume that there are UK-wide surveys and strategies to be worked out. My other point concerns smuggled tobacco being sold in UK shops. In Northern Ireland, where there is a lot of former paramilitary activity, smuggled tobacco is not sold in shops but on street corners and other socially unacceptable places. The issue has to be looked at more broadly than just on the basis of smuggled tobacco being sold in shops.</p>

I shall approach it in two major parts. The first is to talk about strategy and evaluation; the other is to talk about the Government&#146;s work against the illicit tobacco trade.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90309-gc0008.htm"/>


<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000073"></a>Both Amendments 104 and 170A would create a duty on the Secretary of State to publish a comprehensive tobacco strategy, but they vary in the details that they would require. Amendment 104 would insert a new clause that would place a statutory duty on the Secretary of State to provide a report to Parliament by 2010 on a comprehensive strategy to reduce tobacco usage, including an assessment of efforts to reduce the amount of smuggled tobacco sold in UK shops. Amendment 107A also requires a strategy, but states that it should be published by 21 July this year and that it should include an evaluation programme for the strategy to be updated in the light of new evidence. It would also require the strategy to set various targets.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000074"></a>The amendments highlight an important point. I would not want the Committee to think that the new provisions for tobacco control introduced by the Bill are the whole story. The provisions are just one part of an overall government strategy to reduce the health harms from smoking.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000075"></a>The Committee will know that last year we published our <I>Consultation on the </I><I>Future of Tobacco Control</I>, a public consultation that received nearly 100,000 responses. The report of that consultation exercise was published in December. We made it clear that consultation was the first step towards developing a new national tobacco control strategy, and I am sure the Committee will be pleased to learn that I can confirm that the Government intend to publish a comprehensive strategy on the future of tobacco control before 2010&#151;in fact, it will be issued later this year.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000076"></a>However, I would not want to commit in legislation that the new strategy be published by 21 July, as we need to leave adequate time for the strategy to be developed to take account of Parliament&#146;s decisions regarding the tobacco proposals in this Health Bill, for example, and to take on board comments made during the course of our debates&#151;for example, in the past hour of our discussion. When the strategy is published, the Secretary of State will make a Statement in the other place and copies will be placed in the House Libraries.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000077"></a>Before I address the illegal tobacco trade, perhaps I may respond to a few of the issues on the government strategy and points raised by noble Lords about stopping smoking. The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, raised the NHS Stop Smoking Services. I agree that local NHS Stop Smoking Services provide excellent support to smokers in communities across the country. Recently, England was assessed as having one of the best smoking-cessation services in the world. Not only is nicotine replacement available on prescription from the NHS but most formats can be bought from shops, including supermarkets.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000078"></a>I am not sure whether we have a 24-hour helpline, but I intend to find out whether we do. We would certainly want to follow that example. I will write to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, about the detail of his remarks. I know that advice is available for teachers  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC436"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC436</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and in schools&#151;it is part of the government strategy for health in schools&#151;but I will make the detail of that available to him and other Members of the Committee.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030925000079"></a>My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours raised the issue of evidence and support to quit smoking. He is probably aware that progress has been made since he was making his attempts to stop smoking, but I do not doubt that it is a very difficult thing for people to do. If we are all telling our smoking stories, I stopped at the beginning of 1983. My husband and I did it together. It was not an easy thing and I know that if I had one fag, I would be back on 10 or 15 a day. It is an addiction that is not easy to beat.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030927000001"></a>Over the past decade, the Government have delivered a very ambitious programme of tobacco control. We have set up an extensive network of local NHS stop-smoking services in communities across the country and have put high levels of investment into those services, which means that most of them have a fully resourced smoking cessation programme. We are running a marketing and communications programme that reaches out to millions of smokers. That gives them information on how to stop smoking and provides support in quitting. I think that the noble Lord said that there is no point in battering people with this; you have to give them support.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030927000002"></a>I agree with noble Lords&#151;this was mentioned in particular by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege&#151;that tackling the illicit trade in tobacco will continue to be a vital element of the Government&#146;s strategy. Relaxing the pressure would allow the illegal trade to undermine all the good work that we are doing and the investment that we are making across other areas in an attempt to reduce the prevalence of smoking and help smokers to quit. In particular, the availability of illicit tobacco is a significant factor in perpetuating health inequalities, and that alone makes it a top priority.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030927000003"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the illicit share of the tobacco market is estimated to be 13 per cent, but more than half of hand-rolled tobacco is estimated to be illicit. That is why reducing the availability of these products is a priority for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the UK Border Agency and, at the retail level, local authority trading standards. We are not, and must not be, complacent.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030927000004"></a>The Government have already made significant progress in reducing the illicit tobacco market. Since the Government&#146;s Tackling Tobacco Smuggling strategy was introduced in 2000, there has been an investment of over &#163;200 million. We have cut the size of the illicit cigarette market share by a third; we have seized more than 14 billion illicit cigarettes and more than 1,000 tonnes of hand-rolling tobacco in the UK and abroad; we have broken up over 370 criminal gangs; we have successfully prosecuted more than 2,000 people; and we have issued over &#163;35million-worth of confiscation orders.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030927000005"></a>Tackling illicit tobacco remains a priority for the Government. In November 2008, we published <I>Tackling Tobacco Smuggling Together</I>, an integrated strategy for HM Revenue and Customs and the new UK Border Agency. I recommend that noble Lords look at  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC437"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column GC437</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this updated strategy to see how ambitious the Government are with regard to reducing the amount of illicit tobacco.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030927000006"></a>The new HMRC/UK Border Agency strategic partnership will be central to the future of the strategy, which is underpinned by these key principles: making it harder for smugglers to source tobacco; disrupting the supply and distribution chain; increasing the risks and reducing the rewards of smuggling; and tackling demand by raising public awareness. Under this partnership, HMRC is committed to strengthening its work with the police, local government and health and business stakeholders to tackle the demand for and supply of illicit tobacco. The Department of Health is working with HMRC to encourage collaboration in the fight against illicit trade, particularly at the local level, and is supporting the development of a new marketing strategy aimed at changing attitudes and behaviour around illicit tobacco.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030927000007"></a>We must recognise that tobacco smuggling is a global problem requiring global solutions. A detailed international protocol on illicit trade is being developed under the World Health Organisation&#146;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and HMRC is taking a lead role in its development. Nevertheless, it is important to note that very little smuggled tobacco is made available through formal retail channels; rather, it is available through other locations such as workplaces, car boot sales or even people&#146;s own homes. I have to say that the Holloway Road, a route that I drive down, seems to be one of the main places. Therefore the second part of the amendment, relating to reporting on the sale of smuggled tobacco in UK shops, is likely to be of limited value.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030927000008"></a>Analysis by HMRC suggests that, today, most illicit cigarettes are counterfeit or non-UK brands. Enforcement authorities have the means to detect counterfeit cigarettes through covert anti-counterfeit markings, while fiscal markings now mean that it is very difficult for non-UK brands to infiltrate the legitimate retail sector. I reassure noble Lords that each year HMRC publishes an assessment of the illicit market share for cigarettes and hand-rolled tobacco, which is the key measure of our success in tackling tobacco smuggling.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030927000009"></a>I turn to the issue of valuation targets. The Committee will be aware that progress in reducing the harm associated with smoking has been measured by public service agreements, and I am happy to say that the latest figures from 2007 show that we have met our targets for the overall adult population of 21 per cent. We are also on track to meet our target for the routine and manual group of 26 per cent. We need to build on this momentum to ensure that health inequalities are tackled and that the harms caused by smoking become something of the past.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030927000010"></a>We already collect a wealth of data on smoking behaviour in England, and we keep abreast of new research on how to protect people from the harms of smoking. The new strategy is being developed to make the best use of all the relevant information and data,

I hope that answers the questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Patel.</p>

<a name="90309-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030927000011"></a>In the light of that new evidence, Ministers will take a view on whether any further evaluation or target-setting is needed or warranted, given the need to keep to a minimum both costs and any burden associated with the collection of data. However, I assure the Committee that we will continue to be ambitious in bringing down smoking prevalence in the population. We will seek to apply the measures in the new strategy that are most likely to support that aim. I hope that those assurances are sufficient for the noble Lord to feel able to withdraw these amendments.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="0903095000040"></a>Airports: Economic Regulation</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="0903095000003"></a><b><a name="90309-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0903095000035"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Lord Adonis):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Geoff Hoon) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0903095000004"></a>I am today publishing a consultation document on proposals to reform the economic regulation of airports. Economic regulation plays an important role in ensuring that airports, particularly in the south-east of England, make the best use of existing capacity, have regard to the environmental impact of their operation and deliver a responsive service to their customers, at an acceptable price.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0903095000005"></a>There has been considerable criticism of the current legislation, which has remained essentially unchanged since the privatisation of the British Airports Authority over 20 years ago. I have listened carefully to the points made by the aviation industry, passenger representatives, airport operators, the Competition Commission, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and other interested stakeholders. I have also taken advice from Professor Martin Cave and a panel of regulatory experts, who have been undertaking detailed work over the past few months.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0903095000006"></a>These proposals are designed to put the passenger at the heart of the regulatory regime. To demonstrate this, I am proposing a number of key changes.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0903095000007"></a>First, I propose that the CAA should be given, in its role as the economic regulator for airports, a primary duty towards the passenger. Secondly, I propose to put the consumer representation for air passengers on a statutory footing for the first time. I intend to do this by transferring the functions and expertise of the Air Transport Users Council to Passenger Focus. Passenger Focus has a well-established reputation as an effective advocate for rail passengers. It is also taking on a similar role for bus passengers. Giving it responsibility for air transport will enable a traveller&#146;s end-to-end journey to be considered within a single organisation.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0903095000008"></a>As further evidence of the Government&#146;s commitment to air passengers, I am also publishing a report <I>Understanding the Airport Passenger Experience</I>, which gives more insight into the end-to-end airport journey and the types of improvements passengers actually want. Together with this, I am publishing advice from the CAA on improving the air passenger experience, and the results of a passenger survey. Copies of these reports and the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0903095000009"></a>I want economic regulation to be targeted, flexible and efficient. I am therefore proposing the introduction of a licence-based scheme of regulation, similar to that which exists already in other regulated sectors. Only the very largest airports&#151;those with over 5 million passengers per annum or with significant market power&#151;would require a licence. This will deliver greater certainty  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS72"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column WS72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about the ability of airport operators to finance the necessary investment in airport and runway capacity needed to improve the passenger experience. In addition these proposals, while ensuring that passenger interests will continue to be safeguarded, will remove 42 smaller airports from economic regulation.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0903095000010"></a>It is also essential that airports take fully into account the environmental consequences of their operations. I intend to give the CAA an environmental duty with respect to its economic regulatory functions. This will ensure that, when operating as an economic regulator, the CAA will consider the environmental consequences of its decisions.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0903095000011"></a>I propose that all 13 airports with more than 5 million passengers per annum should be required to produce an annual report on the environmental impact of their operations, and their mitigation measures. This would happen alongside the publication of their annual report and accounts, and will give the airports and the communities which they serve important information.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0903095000012"></a>I believe that these proposals are not only an important step forward in their own right, but that they are important enabling measures around which further environmental policy can be developed and implemented. These proposals are in addition to the department&#146;s work on aviation and the environment which were outlined to the House in my Oral Statement of 15 January 2009.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0903095000013"></a>As part of our comprehensive environmental approach we will also be consulting later in 2009 on the operation of a proposed &#147;green slots&#148; arrangement at Heathrow Airport and on the details of how to apply enforceable mechanisms&#151;to which we are committed&#151;ensuring that noise and air quality limits at Heathrow are met. We will also consult on proposals to implement Sir Joe Pilling&#146;s recommendations to update the CAA&#146;s overall strategic remit. I will inform the House in due course as we make progress on this work.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="0903095000014"></a><b><a name="90309-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="0903095000036"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0903095000015"></a>The board of inquiry into the tragic loss of 14 personnel as a result of the Nimrod XV230 crash on 2 September 2006 made a number of recommendations to improve the safety of the fleet. Following on from this work the Nimrod fleet is currently undergoing modifications to replace a number of fuel seals and the engine bay hot air ducts. These programmes were due to complete by 31 March 2009 but, unfortunately, problems with the provision of replacement fuel seals mean that both programmes will be delayed beyond that date. </p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="0903095000016"></a>Our technical experts have advised that in order that the risks involved in operating the aircraft remain tolerable and as low as reasonably practicable, no Nimrods should fly after 31 March 2009, unless their hot air ducts have been replaced. Ministers and the Chief of the Air Staff accept this advice. Delays to the  


<notus-date day="9" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS73"></a><b>9 Mar 2009 : Column WS73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>replacement of fuel seals will, however, have no impact on flying since our experts assess that the risk is tolerable.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="0903095000017"></a>For this reason, our priority now is to ensure that we modify the remaining aircraft as quickly as possible so we are temporarily withdrawing Nimrod aircraft from overseas operations until early summer. This will allow us to free up the maximum number of aircraft for the modification programme while also allowing Nimrod to continue with its critical homeland security tasks. During this period, we will use other UK and coalition assets to maintain an effective surveillance capability overseas.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="0903095000018"></a>We are also allocating additional service engineering personnel from RAF Kinloss and RAF Waddington to the modification programme. The reallocation of these personnel will cause a temporary reduction in routine UK-based Nimrod flying but will not affect our ability to protect UK interests at home.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="0903095000019"></a>We have reassessed the situation in the light of these developments and concluded that the Nimrod fleet remains airworthy and safe to fly, subject to the measures outlined above.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="0903095000020"></a>Separately, QinetiQ has provided the second report on the Nimrod Ageing Aircraft Systems Audit.  It does not identify any significant airworthiness issues and the findings of the report do not alter previous assessments that the Nimrod aircraft remains safe to fly.  Copies of the report will be placed in the Library of the House and on the MoD website.  A copy is also being passed to Mr Charles Haddon-Cave QC for inclusion in his review of Nimrod safety.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="0903095000025"></a>On 18 January 2007 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 933), my right honourable friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood announced the planned annual increases in the TV licence fee under the BBC&#146;s six-year funding settlement, which began in April 2007. In line with that settlement, from 1 April 2009, the fee for a colour television licence will be &#163;142.50 and the fee for a black and white licence will be &#163;48.00. I have today laid before the House the regulations necessary to bring these new fees into force.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="0903095000028"></a>I am today publishing a consultation document <I>Together </I><I>W</I><I>e </I><I>C</I><I>an </I><I>E</I><I>nd </I><I>V</I><I>iolence </I><I>A</I><I>gainst </I><I>W</I><I>omen and </I><I>G</I><I>irls</I>, which seeks views on how to prevent and combat violence against women and girls. Copies of the consultations will be available from the Vote Office and placed in the House Library.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="0903095000029"></a>Violence against women and girls is unacceptable, whatever the context, whatever the circumstances. This consultation is intended to raise awareness, discussion and debate on how together we can end violence against women, and overcome its debilitating impact on individuals, families and communities. Over the past 10 years this Government have worked alongside voluntary organisations to deliver a package of measures to protect women from violence and to support those who have suffered violence. Together we have made a real difference.</p>
 the number of incidents of domestic violence has more than halved since 1997; the rate of conviction in domestic violence cases has significantly increased. Now, the vast majority (72 per cent) of perpetrators who have been charged and brought to court result in a conviction;the number of women killed by their partners or ex-partners in 2007-08 (72) is the lowest recorded figure for more than a decade; the conviction rate for rape cases when a case gets to court are at their highest for 10 years; the Government have successfully intervened in over 400 cases of forced marriage last year alone; and we have taken a stand on human trafficking and rescued over 150 people through Operation Pentameter 2 led by the police. 
<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="0903095000030"></a>This is the first time we have consulted on how to combat violence specifically against women and girls.

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="0903095000031"></a>My vision is that we can create a society in which women and girls feel safe and confident in their homes and in our communities, so that they can live freely, contribute to society, and prosper in their daily lives.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="0903095000032"></a>I am proposing that we need to take more action to prevent violence against women; help women feel safer when they are out, especially at night; further improve the help women get when it is needed; and that we act to catch and convict perpetrators.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>

As part of this consultation, we will be holding a series of regional events in every part of England over the next three months to enable everyone to tell us what they think. Discussion and debate are essential if we are to raise awareness of the scale of the problem, and to improve the confidence of women and girls.</p>

<a name="90309-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="0903095000034"></a>Violence against women is an enduring social issue affecting women and their children. We have done much to address the problem already, but we can all do more. We can end violence against women and to do that we must harness all our energies across government and within our communities.</p>

This provides CEOs and AEAs with a defence to any civil and criminal liability that would otherwise arise. It is also applicable to the execution of warrants of distress for criminal enforcement.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_17"></a><a name="09030914000032"></a>To achieve our ambitions for all children in care, we need a better understanding of what types of provision for children in care are most effective at meeting different children's needs.

The Conflict Prevention Pool (CPP) and stabilisation aid fund (SAF) both operate on the basis that they will finance some activities which qualify as ODA, and some which will not. As a result some of the transfers to the CPP and SAF may not score as ODA. We expect that most of the other transferred funds will finance activities which score as ODA. Overall, the transfers will not significantly affect the UK's ODA/gross national income ratio.</p>

However, modifications which are currently being made to the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) Public Protection Unit Database (PPUD) will enable such information to be stored centrally, albeit in respect of those prisoners whose pre-tariff parole review commences on or after 1 April 2009 and I will write to provide you with that information at that time.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_87"></a><a name="09030914000139"></a>The National Offender Management Service, working in conjunction with the Parole Board, is devising a new and integrated parole process for considering the cases of prisoners serving life and indeterminate public protection sentences. The new system, which is due to be introduced from 1 April, is aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the process, with the performance of every agency being monitored centrally. This process brings for the first time a unified timetable with an overall end to end target, monitored by performance on PPUD.</p>

These groups are highly likely to be serving a long sentence. The offender management model requires a community-based offender manager to oversee the sentence from start to finish, paying particular attention to the transition from custody to the community. The offender manager prepares a sentence plan to cover the custodial period of the sentence, ensuring that the offender receives the interventions required to enable him or her to resettle in the community. Following release, long-term prisoners are subject to a period of licence when they will be supervised by the probation service.</p>

There are also a range of short programmes which help prisoners with personal finance and family relationship issues. Prisoners receive help with meeting accommodation needs. NOMS is currently working with key stakeholders to pilot an initiative to enable prisoners to open bank accounts while in custody. NOMS also works with the Department for Work and Pensions and Jobcentre Plus to ensure that prisoners due to be released have appointments made with local jobcentres and benefits offices.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_391"></a><a name="09030914000453"></a>Functional categories are based on the UN classification of the functions of government (COFOG), the international standard. Economic categories are based on the treatment of spending in the national accounts. These figures differ from departmental spending analyses because they include local government and public corporations as well as central government, and devolved Administrations as well as English departments.</p>
