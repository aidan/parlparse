<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="0705081000021"></a><b><a name="70508-0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0705081000556"></a>The Lord Speaker (Baroness Hayman):</b> My Lords, it is with great regret that I have to inform the House of the death of Lord Weatherill on 6 May. On behalf of the whole House I extend our condolences to his family and friends.</p>

<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="0705081000022"></a><b><a name="70508-0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="0705081000557"></a>The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My Lords, I rise to pay tribute to Lord Weatherill. Bruce Bernard Weatherill, known to all as Jack, made his mark on public life as Speaker of the House of Commons. He reached a far wider audience than his predecessors because his tenure as Speaker from 1983 to 1992 coincided with the introduction of television cameras to the Commons Chamber. He became known to millions for his interventions during Prime Minister&#146;s Questions. In Parliament he was known for his belief in making government accountable and in making Parliament matter.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="0705081000023"></a>Lord Weatherill was born in Guildford. His father owned a Savile Row tailoring business and it was into this trade that he was apprenticed aged 17 after completing his education at Malvern College. He remained involved in the family business throughout his life. Commissioned in 1940, he served as a Bengal Lancer during the Second World War. He referred to this period as &#147;formative years&#148; and many of his experiences clearly had a lifelong impact. He was proficient in Urdu, became vegetarian after seeing famine in Bengal and practised meditation. He maintained an interest in the region throughout his life. Noble Lords may recall his interventions in this House on the subjects of the Kashmir earthquake and the readmission of Pakistan to the Commonwealth.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="0705081000024"></a>After the war he focused on the family business. In 1964 he won election as the Conservative candidate for the seat of Croydon North-East. He retained his seat until 1992, standing as in independent candidate in 1987 after he had become Speaker of the House of Commons. He served as a Whip in opposition and, in government, as Deputy Chief Whip. He was elected as the 154th Speaker of the House of Commons in 1983. His years of service were marked by a desire to encourage the free flow of debate and the expression of all opinions. He championed the role of Back-Benchers and his tenure as Speaker was sometimes an uncomfortable period for the Government of the day.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="0705081000025"></a>Lord Weatherill also made a significant contribution to this House. He was raised to the peerage in 1992 and from 1995 to 1999 served as Convenor of the Cross Benches. From the beginning he commanded tremendous respect from all sides of the House. He  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1258"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1258</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was a Convenor at a critical time in the development of the role of the Cross Benches and was always helpful and absolutely fair in his dealings, ensuring that the interests of the Cross Benches were well represented in the usual channels.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0705081000026"></a>Lord Weatherill was always modest about the role he played during the passage of the House of Lords reform Act of 1999, but this House will not forget it. It was in large part due to him that an agreement was reached which allowed the Bill to pass. He used his skills to considerable effect at what was an extremely challenging time for this House.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="0705081000027"></a>It is difficult to do justice to a life characterised by such a broad range of interests and experiences. Lord Weatherill will be remembered as a remarkable man; respected by all and missed by many. He is survived by his wife Lyn, their three children and seven grandchildren. I am sure that all sides of the House will wish to join me in sending our condolences to Lord Weatherill&#146;s family and friends.</p>

<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="0705081000028"></a><b><a name="70508-0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0705081000558"></a>Lord Strathclyde:</b> My Lords, I agree wholeheartedly with the Leader of the House in everything that she said about the late Lord Weatherill, whose death has saddened the whole House. We on this side, who were proud that he was a Conservative, deeply share her expressions of sympathy for Lady Weatherill and the family. They have lost much, but they will know that they were also given much, as was every one of us.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0705081000029"></a>Jack Weatherill was a rare figure; someone who had, as Speaker of the Commons, been for millions the embodiment of that House but who, in coming here and being chosen as Convenor of the Cross-Bench Peers at such a critical time in their history, became part of the fabric of this House also. Those of us who saw him well into his 80s, with that crisp, swift, upright walk along the corridors, could have had no doubt that he was a military man in younger days&#151;a cavalryman, indeed, who saw service in India and retained not only his love of horses from those days but some of his habits of life; his vegetarianism, for example, and his practice of meditation. As a horseman, it was apt that he personally sewed the riding breeches used by the king and queen at the Trooping, and it was no accident that the Royal Warrant was given to his firm.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0705081000030"></a>It is as a true parliamentarian&#151;someone concerned for, and about, the standing of Parliament inside and outside these walls and for his great and dedicated service to Parliament&#151;that Lord Weatherill will be remembered. It has been widely commented that he was the Speaker who encouraged, over the heads of many doubters, the introduction of television to the other place&#151;a House, incidentally, that was so much more reluctant to innovate than this House was at the time. That introduction was to the good of Parliament, as was so much that he did. He was rough only with Ministers who preferred the &#147;Today&#148; studio to the House for their announcements. One of today&#146;s obituaries calls him, rightly, a great Speaker. He was famously independent, not always to the delight of the Government, but he won the trust and affection of all Members; his ready wit and light humour were always there to defuse any situation that might risk getting out of  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1259"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1259</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hand. He opened up the Speaker&#146;s House to all Members and to their families, and he took pride in the fact that at least once in every Parliament an MP and his wife would have been to dine.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0705081000031"></a>When Lord Weatherill came to this House, he was Convenor of the Cross Benches at a time when a government Bill threatened the removal of 226 Cross-Bench Peers, nearly two-thirds of the then strength of those Benches, which are so vital to the character of this House. As the noble Baroness has outlined, Lord Weatherill played a major role in the compromise that led to the eventual House of Lords Act, moving the Weatherill amendment that shaped that legislation and saw the present House created with massive majorities in both Houses. Out of conflict he helped bring compromise and a House whose performance and independence since 1999 should surely have gladdened him who helped to mould it so much.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0705081000032"></a>For all his great offices and achievements, Jack Weatherill always retained a great humility, symbolised by the famous thimble that he carried to remind him of his origins. For his epitaph, he wanted simply this: that he always kept his word. That he did; and with that word he kept a trust, a faith and a dignity that all of us who knew him will sorely miss.</p>

<a name="0705081000033"></a><b><a name="70508-0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0705081000559"></a>Lord McNally:</b> My Lords, since the Lord President and the Leader of the Opposition have not mentioned it, I start my tribute with the story that Lord Weatherill told so often against himself. He used to say that when he was elected in 1964 as a young Conservative Back-Bencher, he found himself in the gents&#146; toilets down the other end of the Corridor and heard two of the Conservative knights of the shire talking. One said to the other, &#147;I think this place is going to the dogs. My tailor is in here now&#148;. He loved to tell that story.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0705081000034"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, has said, it would be difficult not to see Lord Weatherill as both a tailor and a solider: dapper, crisp and well dressed. He was a skilled Deputy Chief Whip. Indeed, he has one of the few battle honours that any Opposition Whip could have: he brought down a Government, as the pairing Whip during the 1979 Government. As has been said, he was a respected chairman of Ways and Means, and an even more respected Speaker&#151;our first TV Speaker. The fact that he was able to move from a background as a Whip to Convenor of the Cross Benches is also a clue to his character. He had a personal integrity that allowed him to be at certain times partisan and at other times absolutely neutral. I once attended a dinner at the Pakistan High Commission when he was there, and was impressed by his affection for and deep knowledge of the subcontinent.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0705081000035"></a>I was never in favour of the Weatherill amendment, but admired the skill with which he played poker with the Government of the day. They blinked first. Apart from the epitaph given him by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, it can truly be said of him, &#147;If you seek his memorial, look about you&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1260"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1260</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70508-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0705081000036"></a>Lord Weatherill was a parliamentarian who had affection and respect at both ends of the Corridor. We on these Benches share the sense of loss that his family must feel at this moment, and send them our deep condolences.</p>

<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="0705081000037"></a><b><a name="70508-0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0705081000560"></a>Lord Williamson of Horton:</b> My Lords, the death of Bernard Weatherill&#151;always Jack Weatherill to his friends here&#151;is a sad occasion for the whole House. I express my sympathy, as others have, to Lyn and his children.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0705081000038"></a>Today is a particularly sad day for the Cross-Benchers, because Jack Weatherill was a most distinguished and respected member of the Cross-Bench group. Here in Parliament we think of him as a remarkable parliamentarian, embodying for me the spirit of our democratic Parliament; as a Member of the House of Commons, one of the most distinguished Speakers and a national figure in that office; and as a real star in this House. We on the Cross Benches also like to remember how he was always willing to share his knowledge and experience. He was invariably helpful, often humorous and a source of much wisdom.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0705081000039"></a>I had many contacts with Jack Weatherill myself, in particular because he was one of my predecessors as Convenor of the Cross Benches, from 1995 to 1999. He was a true independent Member and an independent spirit here, as we saw with his role in the last reform of the membership of the House. I learned a lot from him, and can honestly say that I never once failed to enjoy our meetings and discussions. He gave of his experience not only in this House but also more widely, in the organisations and charities that he supported. I particularly remember the Industry and Parliament Trust which he chaired for nine years and supported very effectively, reflecting both his affection for Parliament and his links with commerce and industry&#151;particularly small businesses, since he was not only a great parliamentarian but also, from experience before he entered politics, the best tailor in the House. His interests extended far beyond our shores. He held office in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association for many years and had lots of contacts with Parliament, Government and people, particularly in the Indian subcontinent and other countries with close links to the United Kingdom. We shall miss Jack Weatherill very deeply. Parliament has lost a great servant.</p>

We have the title &#147;Lords Spiritual&#148;, but Jack Weatherill was one of the Lords Spiritual in reality. We have heard about the integrity of his life and the thimble of humility; he was a genuinely spiritual person. In addition to the services to Parliament, about which Peers with better right to speak have referred, he cared for the coherence of the whole of society. I think of his work on the Speaker&#146;s Commission on Citizenship, for example, which gave birth to the Institute of Citizenship Studies.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0705081000041"></a>He saw his own contribution to the story in the light of the continuous story of the generations. He looked back to some of the great Speakers of the past; he located himself in a continuing story and saw

The Speakership was almost a perfect expression of his gifts.</p>

<a name="70508-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0705081000042"></a>He was conspicuously fair and inclusive. It was typical of Lord Weatherill that he was the patron of the Three Faiths Forum, and its members were all keen to share him as their own. I remember vividly him describing the first time that he was under fire, not politically but in that period to which the Lord President has referred&#151;the Second World War. He was in a vehicle, the bullets were buzzing around him and it was being driven by a Sikh. The Sikh turned round to him and said, &#147;Put your trust in God, sahib, he&#146;s a very reliable fella&#148;. So we believe, but so, more importantly, Jack Weatherill lived.</p>

I had just been made a chairman of a Standing Committee there. I was very wet behind the ears. My first big committee meeting was a housing committee. At a Division, I thought that all the Members were there, I called for the doors to be locked and for the Division to take place. I had locked out the Opposition Whip and the Opposition Front Bench Member dealing with the Bill. A hullabaloo broke out. It was a Thursday morning and I spent a terrible weekend because I knew that I was being reported to the chairman of Ways and Means, whom I did not really know. On Monday morning, I went into Jack Weatherill&#146;s office to see him and confess all, believing that my days of chairmanship were well and truly over. I opened the door and he came in and said, &#147;come along, Betty, come and sit down. I don&#146;t care what you&#146;ve done, but I am totally in support of you. I am on your side&#148;. Throughout the years that I worked with Jack Weatherill, that was his attitude to all those who worked with him. He was totally loyal, committed and supportive. He was my dear friend and mentor. I shall miss him very much indeed.</p>

This will also enable him to promote the year-long &#147;Learning Together&#148; initiative which was launched in March as part of the 50th anniversary of the EU.

The two need not be rivals. Although we have the Commonwealth Day service in Westminster Abbey, there seems to be a lack of enthusiasm about distributing information about the Commonwealth to schools. This country&#146;s place in the Commonwealth network is vital for our future position and prosperity, so will the Minister urge her colleagues and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to give far more emphasis to the future importance of the Commonwealth, which contains some of the richest and most advanced countries in the world and whose development is crucial to the stability of the whole planet?</p>

It is entirely proper that we raise awareness about the Commonwealth. I draw the House&#146;s attention to the &#147;Global Gateway&#148;, a government initiative for schools.

I very much hope that schools such as Eton are also a part of these projects but I do not have those facts at my fingertips. As for a cost-benefit analysis, although I know what the noble Lord is referring to, many such studies are already available in this country.

If decision-making is so difficult, how has the European Union been able to agree a very important open-skies agreement with America, and a climate change agreement which Chancellor Merkel described as historic?

As he will know, between 2002 and 2007, DfID has given more than &#163;1 million of support to the Fairtrade Foundation, and the UK is in the lead in the fair trade movement. It is very welcome that, between 2005 and 2006, UK fair trade sales increased by about 50 per cent with sales now estimated at about &#163;300 million.

Smallholder co-operatives and other organisations must be instruments for the social and economic development of their members. Issues such as standards of employment and health are also incorporated in the standards. Price is a question of negotiation, but the system is such that the fair trade criteria establish a minimum guaranteed price for the producer that covers its costs of production and ensures a living wage for the workers and growers. That can vary, but obviously it is tailored to the particular needs of the producers.</p>

I have carefully studied the data on the availability of combat vehicles in Afghanistan, and can confirm to the House that requests for combat vehicle equipment that come up through the chain of command from theatre have been met in all cases. Those in theatre do have the combat vehicles that they require to carry out operations. I had a conversation this morning with the Chief of the Defence Staff on this very subject, and he confirmed that to be the case.</p>

It is extremely damaging to morale, not least to that of the families of those who are going to serve in both these operational theatres. Will the Minister undertake to publish and put into the Library a full response from the Government to all the points made, not only about armoured vehicles but about the general issue of all the equipment referred to in the article, so that, if he is correct that there are no shortages, this matter can be officially confirmed? Otherwise, it is extremely damaging.</p>

The Minister will be aware that the reports in the press are drawn from the leaked document, <I>Equipment Reverse&#151;SITREP No. 2</I>, which since the weekend has been in the public domain. It confirms what the Minister said&#151;that the forces are well equipped on operations&#151;but it spells out in detail the difficulty of sustaining that situation. The phrase it uses is &#147;LAND&#146;s cupboard is bare&#148;: in other words, the cupboard of the headquarters of the Army&#146;s operations is bare. What changes is the Minister making, given his new responsibilities, to ensure that he can sustain the necessary spares, which are lacking; replace the equipment, which is wearing much faster than expected; and change the assumptions on attrition rates?</p>

The level of operations with which we are now coping puts pressure on equipment and means that equipment priorities for operations have consequences for the availability of equipment at home base. Dealing with these issues is about investing in more equipment where required. We are addressing the availability of spares. More importantly, the reforms we are putting in place and the way we manage equipment&#151;for example, the whole-fleet management of combat vehicles&#151;is at the heart of improving the availability of vehicles both for operations and back at base. These reform initiatives, which we are putting in place as a result of investment and the proactive approach to reform that comes from bringing together defence equipment and defence support, are at the heart of these issues.</p>

The key is for commanders to have a range of vehicles from which they can choose the most appropriate for the given mission. The measures that we have put in place to deliver to theatre a much greater range and number of vehicles give commanders what they need to do the job. There is no magic solution that will provide perfect protection for our troops. We need to recognise that.</p>

<a name="70508-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0705081000124"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the subject matter of the amendment was given consideration at an earlier stage of the Bill. As so often during that time, the noble Baroness expressed the view that the language of the Bill was already sufficient to ensure that the failure of the Office for Legal Complaints in the eyes of the Legal Services Board would not render a stalemate and that it would be possible to bring about changes. However, on further reflection, it has appeared to my noble friends that the position is not entirely satisfactory and that the Legal Services Board has no adequate powers to investigate the Office for Legal Complaints.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1273"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1273</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70508-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0705081000125"></a>There is no direct provision for the board to intervene if it believes that the Office for Legal Complaints is not handling complaints properly. The amendment would transfer to the Legal Services Board the current powers enjoyed by the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner. The powers would allow the board to look strategically at how the Office for Legal Complaints is operating and to intervene if it appears to the board that the OLC is not handling complaints efficiently and effectively. That would help to ensure that information on complaints can be used to improve the whole system of legal services delivery for consumers. It seems clear that if the OLC fails to deliver an efficient and effective service, appropriate sanctions should be available.</p>

<a name="70508-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0705081000126"></a>Even at this stage of consideration of the Bill&#151;it has been thoroughly trawled&#151;it is not entirely obvious who would deal with the OLC and how. Clause 118 allows the Legal Services Board to set performance targets for and to monitor the OLC, which is welcome. But there are no further direct powers over the OLC, particularly in the event of its failure, other than the power and ability to remove the OLC chair and board, which might be thought to be a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The inclusion of the power to investigate concerns would allow for sensible and reasonable target setting if this became necessary. It is also desirable to consider how to stiffen the Legal Services Board&#146;s ability to ensure the OLC&#146;s compliance with its directions. I hope that these amendments will commend themselves at this stage to the Government. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="0705081000127"></a><b><a name="70508-0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0705081000633"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord who, as he has indicated, returns to an issue that we debated in Committee. The amendments would produce a hybrid between the present Legal Services Complaints Commissioner and the proposal in the Bill in relation to the LSB and the improved regulators. Having looked again at the provisions in the Bill, as I said I would do, I believe that we have satisfactory arrangements to make sure that the board has the appropriate range of controls over the OLC.</p>

<a name="70508-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0705081000128"></a>I will demonstrate this in six key ways. First are the overall arrangements in Part 6 which provide for the OLC to operate through a series of rules which, in Clause 152, must receive the consent of the LSB before they can take effect. The LSB will have complete oversight of the way in which the OLC&#146;s rules are framed and, provided they are adhered to, how the OLC operates. Additionally, in Clause 153, the board may amend or modify any of those rules if it considers that they are deficient.</p>

<a name="70508-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0705081000129"></a>Secondly, in Clause 115, the OLC is accountable through its annual report to the LSB, which must deal with any matter that the board has directed. For example, they may have to show how they have dealt with the speed with which complaints are resolved. Of course, the OLC has a separate annual report to the LSB because it has a distinct function and its status is as a distinct non-departmental public body. The LSB will present both its annual report and the OLC&#146;s annual report to the Secretary of State, who will lay them before Parliament. This will reflect the fact that the OLC reports to the LSB.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1274"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70508-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0705081000130"></a>Thirdly, Clause 117 allows the board to require the Office for Legal Complaints to prepare a report on any matter relating to its functions. This might include, for example, a strategic plan for how it proposes to remedy a particular failure to meet a performance target. Fourthly, the power to set performance targets in Clause 118 allows the board to impose conditions on how those targets are met and, crucially, to monitor performance against targets. This will allow the LSB to monitor systematically how complaints are being handled.</p>

<a name="70508-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0705081000131"></a>Fifthly, the LSB&#146;s ultimate power in relation to the Office for Legal Complaints is at Schedule 15(8)(b). As the noble Lord has said, this allows the board the power to remove members of the OLC. The noble Lord described this as, perhaps, a &#147;sledgehammer to crack a nut&#148;, but it is important as the ultimate power, only to be used on members of the OLC where there is obviously a significant failure in the discharge of their duties. Finally, in addition to the above statutory powers, as a non-departmental public body, the Office for Legal Complaints will be accountable to Parliament for the efficient use of resources and the discharge of its statutory responsibilities in a way that the current complaints-handling and regulatory bodies are not.</p>

<a name="70508-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0705081000132"></a>We consider that, taken together, these six key points provide an appropriate and effective control over the Office for Legal Complaints and the way it operates, intentionally different from those the board has in relation to approved regulators, designed specifically to govern the relationship between two distinct non-departmental public bodies with different functions, but with the OLC being subordinate to the LSB. On that basis, I hope the noble Lord can withdraw his amendment.</p>

This group of amendments, aimed at further protecting the consumers of legal services, responds to amendments debated in Committee which I agreed to take away and consider.

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0705081000151"></a>Amendments Nos. 352 and 353 respond to amendments helpfully moved by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in Committee. They will require scheme rules to make provision permitting specified persons to continue a complaint following the death or incapacitation of the original complainant. This means that the Office for Legal Complaints must give proper consideration to, and consult on, which persons should be allowed to continue a complaint. Complainants and their relatives or representatives will be certain whether and when they are eligible to continue a complaint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0705081000152"></a>Amendment No. 355 arises out of helpful points made in Committee by my noble friend Lord Whitty clarifying the limits on the power of the Office for Legal Complaints to award costs against a party in  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1276"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1276</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>favour of the OLC. As I said in Committee, it is important to strike a balance between allowing the Office for Legal Complaints to call to account complainants who, although they may have a genuine complaint, add disproportionately to the costs of determining it by utterly unreasonable behaviour, and preventing members of the legal profession from abusing this provision by deterring well founded complaints by suggesting that the complainant might have to contribute to the costs. We think that the wording of this amendment will produce the right balance. Noble Lords agreed in Committee that it is enormously important that the ombudsman scheme should not deter in any way genuine complainants from complaining, and therefore this amendment sets a high threshold for the award of costs against a complainant.</p>

<a name="70508-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0705081000153"></a>Amendments Nos. 357, 358, 359 and 360 make it clear who can exercise the power of summary dismissal of a complaint. I agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on the fifth day in Committee that this should be a power exercisable only by an ombudsman, and the wording has been reconsidered with a view to making it entirely clear.</p>

<a name="70508-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0705081000154"></a>Amendments Nos. 379, 380 and 382 have been drafted in response to amendments tabled earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and my noble friend Lord Whitty. In those circumstances, which we expect to be rare, where a respondent fails or refuses to comply with an ombudsman&#146;s determination, these amendments will give ombudsmen the power to take enforcement action in relation to that determination on a complainant&#146;s behalf, and we will set out the exact details in the scheme rules. These amendments therefore provide additional protection for vulnerable people who might not wish or know how to seek a court order themselves. Individuals may of course take action themselves, if they so wish, without the ombudsman&#146;s assistance.</p>

<a name="70508-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0705081000155"></a>Amendments Nos. 394, 395 and 446 address concerns expressed in Committee by my noble friend Lady Henig, who is not in her place today. They enable approved regulators to respond quickly and effectively in cases of widespread wrongdoing, where potentially large numbers of consumers may be affected, but they may not know that they have a complaint or, indeed, the procedure for complaining. In circumstances where an approved regulator suspects widespread wrongdoing, these amendments will ensure that approved regulators can require authorised persons to investigate their files, and if they find signs of potential wrongdoing, alert the consumer and initiate the internal complaints process. Because of the importance of maintaining a clear role for the Office for Legal Complaints in providing redress, the amendments I have tabled do not allow approved regulators to award redress or require authorised persons to pay redress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0705081000161"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I will speak also to the remaining amendments in the group. The most important reason for supporting the amendment, and those that flow from it, is one of principle. Those exonerated following investigation or litigation should not be penalised for being found blameless. Accordingly, to require an authorised person under the Bill to pay the Office of Legal Complaints for the costs of handling a complaint when the complaint is unfounded and the person has handled the matter properly in house would be wholly unjust.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0705081000162"></a>It would also deter practitioners from acting in those fields of law where unjustified complaints are disproportionately likely such as in the areas of criminal and family law. In any case, since it will not be the Government or the OLC but the authorised persons in general who will have to pay instead through the general levy, neither the Government nor the OLC have any financial interest in sustaining the scheme set out in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0705081000163"></a>The Bill&#146;s provisions are founded on the approach adopted by the financial ombudsman scheme. There, financial service providers are required to pay charges in respect of the handling of a complaint whatever its outcome. The Government believe that the OLC should be free to adopt the same approach; but the circumstances of the provision of legal services are different from the provision of financial services. Unfounded complaints, for example, from those who have lost a court case or whose house purchase has fallen through, are far more likely than in financial services. Furthermore, some practitioners are disproportionately likely, as I have indicated, to be the subject of such complaints. We  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1278"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1278</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>think it is imperative that the administrative convenience of the OLC is not allowed to cause the clear injustice to lawyers of having to pay costs even where a complaint is not upheld and where their in-house handling of the complaint has been exemplary.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0705081000164"></a>Yet if the OLC has an unrestricted power to charge, it is likely to opt for a case-handling fee in all circumstances simply because that would be administratively more convenient to operate. I would add parenthetically and, I hope, reassuringly that of course we accept that the power to order authorised persons to pay charges cannot sensibly be confined only to cases where the complaint is upheld after a determination by an ombudsman. The likelihood is that the great majority of complaints will be conciliated in one way or another. It would not be satisfactory if authorised persons could avoid any liability to pay simply by settling the matter shortly before a determination would have to be made.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0705081000165"></a>Our amendment would also have the added attraction of encouraging practitioners to operate proper in-house complaints resolution systems. Failure to operate proper in-house procedures damages one of the Bill&#146;s key objectives; namely, ensuring that complaints can be resolved as rapidly as possible. Leaving all matters to be sorted out by the OLC is unsatisfactory from the perspective of complainants and involves putting an additional burden on the OLC. There is no reason why the profession collectively, rather than the practitioner who has failed to deal properly with the matter in-house, should bear the cost of that.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0705081000166"></a>In conclusion, it is important for the Bill to set out the limits of the OLC&#146;s discretion to impose charges. It would be quite wrong to put administrative simplicity ahead of the need to avoid causing injustice to those authorised persons who are the subject of unfounded complaints. I need add nothing to what I have said about the Minister&#146;s proposition that complaints that have got as far as the OLC must be partially justified. That assertion was effectively demolished in Committee. I beg to move.</p>

There is not, and never has been, any entitlement to costs. An award of costs is entirely a question of discretion. In this case, with the ombudsman or the OLC, it is an exercise of quasi-judicial discretion. There is no entitlement; there never has been. The exercise of quasi-judicial discretion imposed by a mandatory costs order under primary legislation is anathema; it is ill-conceived and outrageously unfair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0705081000168"></a>The exercise of such discretion, whether judicial or quasi-judicial, takes due and fair account of factors relevant to the case.

There was another in your Lordships&#146; Appellate Committee, in which I lost and I did not have to pay any costs. The details do not matter&#151;they are all recorded in the law reports&#151;but what matters is the principle on which the court or the tribunal makes a fair decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0705081000169"></a>Is it really the business of Government to impose a costs order upon a lawyer who has committed no misconduct because he or she happens to have rendered legal services? How on earth did this happen? Well, you start off by calling the lawyer a &#147;polluter&#148;. You take a spin for a placebo to feather, perhaps, the legacy nest. You conjure up in your mind a puppet show on the seaside in the old days: consumer with a truncheon clobbers bewigged polluter, and everyone screams with enjoyment. Why on earth were the recommendations of the Joint Committee, on which I had the privilege to serve, rejected? I would like that question to be answered.</p>

I have not entirely made up my mind about this; I remain to be convinced. Prima facie, I do not think that the Government&#146;s approach can be justified. I find it mysterious that they have moved in this direction. For that reason I remain to be convinced about the arguments.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0705081000173"></a>I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, that there ought to be discretion here, as there is at the moment. Why does my noble friend depart from that view? I also share the view that in exercising that discretion&#151;which the Government purport to avoid&#151;the court should not be deprived of being able to listen to the arguments conveyed and make up its own mind. As I say, I find this whole thing very mysterious. I hope that it will be possible for the Government to change their mind.</p>

I am particularly concerned about Clause 133 and the requirement that the respondent who is in receipt of complaints by the applicant should be required to pay charges to the OLC. As a retired judge, I put a slightly different perspective on this. In some cases, judges force an agreement, settlement or, indeed, outcome over which the lawyer may have no control. They may be situations in which, for a number of very good reasons, there is absolutely no point in going to appeal but that is the basis of the complaint to the OLC. You cannot put the judge in the dock and it is extraordinarily unfair to put the lawyer in the dock for a situation over which he had no control. An absolute obligation that the respondent should pay charges would be manifestly unjust, like many other circumstances that have been referred to. I should not like to think that this Government acted unjustly in this sort of circumstance.</p>

First, the comparison with financial institutions really is not right. In so far as the buyer is concerned, this burden will fall primarily on those who practise in the less well remunerated fields such as criminal law and family law and primarily on the younger members of the profession who have to deal with the more difficult and unreasonable clients.

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0705081000177"></a>Secondly, there is the very important difference that if a nasty client who may cause trouble comes along, a financial institution can say, &#147;I am sorry, I do not want to do your work&#148;. The poor unfortunate barrister, according to the cab-rank rule, has to take on the work even if he knows that the previous six people who acted for this client have all had complaints made against them, and that he is absolutely doomed to a complaint unless by very remarkable chance he happens to win. There he is, he takes it on because the rules say that he has to, and then he is landed with a bill for costs as a thank you for doing so.</p>

The only issue that divides us on the amendment is whether we define in the Bill at this point how a charging regime might operate, or whether we leave that to the Office for Legal Complaints, which must do it in consultation with the approved regulators, with the consent of the Legal Services Board and of the Lord Chancellor and in line with the regulatory objectives.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0705081000185"></a>The Government&#146;s position is that the latter route is more appropriate in seeking to set out in the Bill how it would happen, not least because it allows for flexibility and it ensures that the charging system can change and adapt over time on the basis of the sort of experience and good practice that noble Lords would wish to see the OLC consider. I know that noble Lords are worried and concerned about how the Office for Legal Complaints would exercise that flexibility, but I emphasise that the flexibility does not happen in an unconstrained way. In drawing up its rules, the Office for Legal Complaints must have regard to the regulatory objectives, including the public interest, and to the ombudsman scheme best practice, which is in Clause 113. It is also under a duty to consult on the content of the rules, which is in Clause 195.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0705081000186"></a>The Legal Services Board will have to give its consent to the rules under Clause 152 and, in doing so, must have regard to the regulatory objectives we have debated at length. The consent of the Lord Chancellor is required under Clause 152 and, taken together, we expect the oversight of both the Legal Services Board and the Lord Chancellor to be an important check, if needed, on how the Office for Legal Complaints drafts the rules to ensure that they are fair and proportionate.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0705081000187"></a>I could add that the Office for Legal Complaints and, indeed, the Legal Services Board are responsible to Parliament for the operation of the scheme, including the system of case fees. They will have to produce the annual report and, if need be, appear before&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0705081000190"></a>As I was saying, the OLC can also be required to appear before a parliamentary Select Committee to give evidence on the operation of the scheme. Ultimately,  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1282"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1282</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the decision of both bodies which set out the rules is judicially reviewable on the usual grounds. So my first proposition is that the constraints ensuring that the system of case fees operates fairly are in place.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0705081000191"></a>We come to the proposition, which I have seen in briefing material for today&#146;s debate, that Clause 133 is manifestly unfair. I could not disagree more. Nowhere does Clause 133 say that a flat fee will apply for every complaint the OLC receives. Nowhere does it say that every lawyer will have to pay the same rate of charge. Nowhere does it say that the lawyers will pay the charge even if the complainant is vexatious or frivolous. It says that the scheme rules will set out how charges against lawyers are to operate. I have been through this in great detail because I was much taken with our debate in Committee. The implication of many speeches in your Lordships&#146; House has been that we were setting out a system under which every lawyer has to pay regardless. Nowhere does Clause 133 say that. It says that the scheme rules will have to set this out. As to whether it is human-rights compliant, I am the human rights Minister: it is my job to ensure, certainly within my own department, that it is compliant. It is.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0705081000192"></a>The critical point is that the clause does not say what has been implied, and there is therefore an unfounded concern in your Lordships&#146; House. It is possible that the OLC, having considered representations made and having read the deliberations of your Lordships&#146; House will decide that it would be unfair to charge a fee for complaints that are not upheld. There are other circumstances, as noble Lords have indicated at Second Reading and in Committee, and repeated today, where it might also be deemed unfair to charge a fee. My argument is simple: the Office for Legal Complaints should take a view on the circumstances in which fees should and should not apply, based on appropriate oversight and the consultation required under the clauses I have indicated.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0705081000193"></a>We cannot argue that the rules are unfair, because they have not been made. Nothing in the Bill suggests that there must be a blanket charge for any lawyer, whether or not they have fulfilled their obligations under an in-house complaints system, or have been taken to the Office for Legal Complaints in a vexatious way. Quite the opposite: the Office for Legal Complaints must draw up rules and, in doing so, consult the professions and the Legal Services Board, and consult and deal with the Lord Chancellor. There are currently no rules, and it is important that we let the Office for Legal Complaints design the rules within the process and constraints I have identified.</p>

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0705081000194"></a>On the case-handling fee being disproportionately high, nowhere in Parts 6 or 7 does the Bill say what the split will be between the levy and charges. Nowhere does it indicate how that will be calculated. Parts 6 and 7 say that the Legal Services Board and the Office for Legal Complaints should decide what the split should be between the levy and the charges under Clause 133. In the absence of their having made that decision, we cannot speculate on what the case-handling fee would be. The truth is that until they have decided we will not know what the split will

<a name="70508-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0705081000195"></a>In conclusion, I am arguing for flexibility; let the Office for Legal Complaints make the decisions within its constraints. It will take into account not only your Lordships&#146; words, but also its consultation with the professions. On that basis and with my assurances, noble Lords will see that there is nothing in Clause 133 that says that any lawyer has to pay regardless. It says that there should be rules that set out the circumstances in which lawyers should pay or not pay.</p>

I completely understand the concerns that have been raised.

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07050816000028"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendments Nos. 383, 392 and 393 provide for the delegation of complaints handling to an approved regulator by a direction of the Legal Services Board. Where such a direction is given, the approved regulator would be empowered to award redress to the complainant, which Clause 154 currently prohibits. The Legal Services Board would have power subsequently to vary or withdraw a direction. In deciding whether to give, vary or withdraw a direction, the Legal Services Board would be bound by Clause 3 to act compatibly with the regulatory objectives and the other regulatory principles of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70508-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07050816000029"></a>Part 6 establishes the OLC, the resolution body, for those who consider that their complaints have not satisfactorily been dealt with by the in-house arrangements of the relevant legal service provider. Under the Bill, the OLC will investigate service complaints itself but will refer complaints about misconduct to an approved regulator for resolution. However, approved regulators will no longer have the power to award redress to complainants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07050816000030"></a>The Law Society, representing 116,000 solicitors, received more than 17,000 new complaints against it in 2004-05, accounting for about 86 per cent of the total costs of legal complaints handling. By contrast, the Bar Standards Board, the regulatory arm of the  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1289"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1289</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bar Council&#151;the governing body for 14,000 barristers&#151;deals with fewer than 1,000 complaints each year. The Bar Standards Board estimates that about 3 per cent of cases referred to the OLC will derive from the Bar.</p>

<a name="70508-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07050816000031"></a>As we saw in Committee, about 70 per cent of complaints against barristers involve allegations that, if true, would require both compensation for inadequate professional service and proceedings for misconduct. The approved regulator, where appropriate, should be in a position to deal with both aspects. It is both inconvenient and confusing for consumers to have to deal with two different bodies about different aspects of their complaints, especially if one body accepts the facts to which the complaint relates but the other does not. There is also likely to be duplication of work and therefore unnecessary expense. Moreover, the approved regulator has a range of powers, including powers to award redress, which are far wider than those proposed for the OLC. This enables it to ensure that the most appropriate remedy or sanction is provided through a single procedure.</p>

<a name="70508-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07050816000032"></a>By contrast, the proposed new complaints-handling system will involve decision making by salaried non-lawyers who are unlikely to be able to supply the analysis and expertise currently provided free of charge. It is one of the,</p>

<p><a name="07050816000033"></a>That should not be lost by the Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, a former director of the Office of Fair Trading, warned us at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="70508-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07050816000034"></a>As we saw in Committee, the Bar Council has established a body of expertise and maintained a complaints-handling service that is widely acknowledged to be of an extremely high standard. As we saw in Committee, the Legal Services Ombudsman has consistently given high marks to the Bar Standards Board for the speed and quality of its complaints service. Robert Behrens, the Bar Standards Board&#146;s independent complaints commissioner, has said that there is a strong case for the Bar Standards Board to have delegated jurisdiction over complaints about poor service.</p>

<a name="70508-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07050816000035"></a>Clause 154 creates inflexibility in complaints handling and adds massively to its costs. We have concluded that the Bill as drafted is certain to offer a poorer service to consumers at vastly greater cost&#151;at least as far as the Bar is concerned. The Bar Standards Board, the approved regulator for the Bar, is an independent, ring-fenced, regulatory authority. It already deals with both service and conduct complaints. It already has a significant lay element, and its decisions are subject to a lay veto. This is emphatically not a case of lawyers deciding on complaints against lawyers. The independent Legal Services Ombudsman has repeatedly said that the Bar Standards Board does outstanding work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07050816000036"></a>We had hoped that the experience and expertise that barristers and lay members bring to providing a professional, cost-effective approach to complaints handling would, in the interests of consumers, be recognised in the Bill. Instead, the Government are

<a name="70508-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07050816000037"></a>The Government&#146;s proposals for amending complaints handling, and in particular the new clause inserted after Clause 154 by Amendment No. 395 and the new clauses after Clause 159 by Amendments Nos. 403 to 405, involve a voluntary scheme as an add-on to the main statutory one. However, the amendments do not address the problems that we have identified in the legislation. Nor do they answer our objections to the complete exclusion of approved regulators, with all their expertise from the ombudsman process. I beg to move.</p>

Therefore, accepting everything that my noble friend said, and his argument, I shall make a short point. This is a matter of principle. These are enabling amendments, which in no way break the structure of the Bill or the board&#146;s control under it. If the amendments were accepted, there could be no requirement on the board to direct any approved regulator in any complaint that lies within the jurisdiction of the ombudsman, and, indeed, after consultation with the OLC, the approved regulator and any other person. This essence of consultation is highly commendable, as is the essence of partnership, to which my noble friend Lord Kingsland referred in another context. The ombudsman has approved the complaints procedure, as it stands, in relation to the Bar, but that does not mean that the procedure cannot be amended in consultation from time to time or that the directions in proposed new subsection (1) of the amendment would not be wholly justified. We are not in a static situation, and the amendment takes due account of that. It would comply wholly with the Clementi soft-touch approach. I cannot speak for any branch of the legal profession&#151;probably not even for my own now&#151;but surely it is right in principle that the amendment should be supported.</p>

Up to now, independent reviews, especially those conducted by the ombudsman, have, year in and year out, unanimously condemned the Law Society&#146;s complaints schemes as defective, deficient and inadequate, whereas the system run by the Bar up to now has been praised as modest in charges and in price&#151;taking advantage of the barristers&#146; willingness to do this kind of work free of charge&#151;and has received a tremendous amount of praise. In the Bill as it stands, complaints about both solicitors and barristers are wrapped up together and given to a new statutory body, which will of course be quite expensive. The new system does not take into account the difference between the complaints systems of the two branches of the profession, which I have just mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07050816000040"></a>The Bar Standards Board, to which the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred, has a lay chairman and other lay members, as well as lawyers and barristers. Both kinds of people are helpful to one another, as I understand it. The Bar Standards Board can hardly be regarded as simply a lawyer&#146;s charade. The only case the Government have for wrapping up together the complaints systems for both solicitors and barristers is that it is &#147;tidy&#148; and, as it were, fair to both branches of the profession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07050816000041"></a>The Law Society, in its briefing to me&#151;and, no doubt, to other noble Lords&#151;has admitted that its own schemes have been deficient. It does not pretend that its history is as good as the Bar&#146;s in handling complaints. This amendment&#151;or something like it, if I may put it that way to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;is surely desirable to modify the Government&#146;s approach, to allow some flexibility which the history of complaints against the legal profession surely justifies.</p>

Uniformity does not necessarily mean that we will have a more efficient or effective scheme. The underlying concern about the basic thrust of the Government&#146;s proposals is that they risk creating a rather bureaucratic monster which is not apt to deal any better with complaints that would previously have been handled by the Bar Council.</p>

<a name="70508-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07050816000043"></a>The issue of cost remains extremely important. It is clear that the Bar Council&#146;s existing arrangements for handling complaints have been of great benefit to the consumer. We have not heard anything in the discussion of costs that has led us to believe that this problem will go away under the Government&#146;s new legislation. It is time to draw a line and say firmly to the representatives of the consumer lobby, who have expressed a preference for uniformity of treatment, that this does not necessarily work to the advantage of those whom they represent.</p>

<a name="70508-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07050816000044"></a>I have found it increasingly distasteful in the course of these debates to hear opinions which almost suggest that lawyers are the enemy of consumers. That is a complete travesty of the truth. Lawyers are very often necessary to ensure that remedies are obtained. Their skills as advocates, and in some cases their selfless preparedness to investigate allegations, are worthy of commendation.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="07050816000063"></a>That is simply a misrepresentation of the position of the Bar Council. Significantly, its conduct committee has 10 lay members whose decisions are subject to a lay veto, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, stated. If that is the best argument that can be produced in favour of this inflexibility, it is a bad argument which ought to be roundly rejected by the Government.</p>

I may be disappointed, but the noble Baroness may be about to stand up to tell us what good sense has been spoken. I sincerely hope so. It seems to me to be quite compelling to be able to save costs, to do justice better and to have less complexity, which would trump uniformity for the sake of uniformity every time. I very much hope that the noble Baroness will be able to give us more confidence than her recent headshake suggested.</p>

<a name="07050816000047"></a><b><a name="70508-0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07050816000445"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord is very gracious in the way in which he puts forward his comments. Noble Lords have made strong arguments about the role of the Bar and I hope that they will agree that at no point in our deliberations have I indicated anything other than the highest regard for the way in which the Bar handles complaints. On the work going on with the Law Society and its regulatory body, I read out its latest report on its quality and success in handling complaints. Although I do not have the figures with me, I think that noble Lords will agree that it is being done in a better way than previously. I do not begin for one second to suggest that we are bringing it together to suggest in any way the wrapping-up of all the regulators or that they are failing, or that taking complaints away is a form of punishment. That is absolutely not the objective.</p>

<a name="70508-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07050816000048"></a>We have approached this issue from a different perspective. We know that there is an issue of public confidence. It may be more perception than reality in the context of the Bar. I did not know how the Bar handled its complaints procedure until I was involved in this job. It is not really surprising if the public do not know about the way in which the Bar handles complaints. None the less, whether it is right or wrong, there is an issue about perception in public confidence and the way in which complaints generally are handled.</p>

<a name="70508-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07050816000049"></a>Inevitably, there is an inconsistency in the way that the various complaint-handling arrangements work. Among some people who wish to bring forward complaints, there is some confusion about where to take them. That is probably particularly important where, for example, a solicitor may have instructed a barrister and the consumer has to try to determine where the fault lies and to whom to complain. Noble Lords may not like it, but there is an issue about independence&#151;real or perceived&#151;of complaints about lawyers being handled by their own professional bodies.</p>

<a name="70508-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07050816000050"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, read out part of a letter, which I think that noble Lords have received. The letter is addressed to me, dated 4 May, from the National Consumer Council, Citizens Advice and <I>Which</I>?. The noble Lord may argue that they do not necessarily represent appropriately the people whom they seek to, but they are the most prestigious bodies we have for consumer affairs. Therefore, noble Lords would expect me to take note of what they said. As the noble Lord said, the letter states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="07050816000103"></a>&#147;Consumers will not trust a regulatory system that allows lawyers to judge their own&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1293"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07050816000064"></a>It continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="07050816000104"></a>&#147;Independence is the single most critical principle in any redress system. Separating the regulatory and representative functions of the professional bodies will be insufficient to command consumer confidence in this respect, especially given the relevant governance and complaint committees will continue to have professional majorities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050816000065"></a>That may be inaccurate in the context of the Bar, but that is what they say. They go on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="07050816000105"></a>&#147;The Bar can be reassured that the Office of Legal Complaints will be, and must be, an entirely new body. The emergence of alternative business structures will further blur the boundaries between the legal professions. In this new world, consumers should not be left to navigate a regulatory maze to resolve their disputes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050816000066"></a>Noble Lords will have seen the letter. I shall make sure there is a copy in the Library of your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="70508-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07050816000051"></a>As I have said, because we are also introducing alternative business structures, there will be opportunities for solicitors and barristers to work together in other ways. As the letter points out, this will add to the potential confusion for those who seek to complain. We believe it is more sensible in creating a new system to have one body that handles complaints about all legal professionals. That is clearer and more consistent; the system is straightforward, people know where to go and it can be dealt with properly. The most clear and consistent message since Sir David Clementi&#146;s report, and before that, is to make sure that we deal with any perceived or real loss of confidence in the way that legal professional bodies have dealt with consumer complaints about their members.</p>

<a name="70508-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07050816000052"></a>I have had the privilege of talking to the Bar Council and to Geoffrey Vos, who has passionately and straightforwardly put the concerns of the Bar. One issue has been to make sure that the expertise and experience that could be available to the Office for Legal Complaints is not lost. I have indicated to Geoffrey Vos that we have looked carefully at Schedule 15(15), because that allows the OLC to enter into arrangements with regulators to provide it with assistance as it sees fit. There is no question that the ultimate decision-making must rest with the ombudsman&#151;it must be an independent process. Yet I would expect the OLC to be in discussion with the regulators, and to think about what expertise might be available that it could usefully use while retaining the independent system. The Bar and other regulators may well assist under the new arrangements.</p>

<a name="70508-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07050816000053"></a>The key difference between this and what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, proposed is that, in line with Sir David&#146;s philosophy, the OLC can make the best of existing arrangements by drawing on the Bar&#146;s or any other bodies&#146; expertise, rather than completely delegating the responsibility it has to the public to ensure quick and fair redress. Within that context, I hope the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="70508-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07050816000055"></a>I find it difficult to understand how the noble Baroness can in one breath say that she absolutely accepts everything that has been said about the high quality of the Bar Standards Board and the way the Bar deals with complaints, and yet, in another breath, say that, even if in reality these standards are high, the public have doubts&#151;that there is a public perception that somehow these standards, which she knows are met, are not being met. Where does this perception come from? What evidence does the noble Baroness have that there is a public perception that, despite all the evidence, the Bar Standards Board falls below requirements that have been tested over a long period? There is no such perception.</p>

<a name="70508-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07050816000056"></a>Then the noble Baroness says that there is concern that it is lawyers judging lawyers. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, had the complete answer to that: there are 10 lay members on the Bar Standards Board. The ultimate say on whether a Bar Standards Board decision stands is made by a lay person.</p>

<a name="70508-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07050816000057"></a>Why does the noble Baroness think that the Legal Services Board has nothing to do with the law? There will be lawyers on the board. Further, why is she so convinced that the Legal Services Board is independent, whereas the Bar Standards Board is not? Did not your Lordships pass an amendment requiring the Lord Chancellor to have concurrent advice from the Lord Chief Justice precisely because the House does not believe that, as presently structured under this Bill, the Legal Services Board is independent?</p>

<a name="70508-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07050816000058"></a>I know how hard the noble Baroness has striven to resolve this particular problem in the Bill; but I have to say to her, most disappointingly, that I cannot accept her arguments as a satisfactory substitute for these amendments, and therefore again I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
&#147;A great deal of wholly legitimate public concern has been expressed over certain aspects of last Thursday&#146;s election. I entirely share these concerns. They focus mainly on three areas: the arrangements for the administration of postal ballots; the operation of e-counting machines; and the significant number of spoilt ballot papers.&#147;Mr Speaker, when it became apparent in the early hours of Friday morning that difficulties were emerging, I contacted Professor Sir Neil McIntosh, the Scottish Electoral Commissioner. I expressed to him my concern that these issues be addressed as part of the statutory review of the Scottish elections that the commission is obliged to undertake, as a matter of urgency. Sir Neil was able to offer me this reassurance and this investigation is indeed now under way.&#147;The Electoral Commission has a statutory duty to report on the Scottish parliamentary elections. At the request of the Scottish Executive it will also be reporting on the local government elections. The commission is an independent body and is committed to ensuring a full and independent review of the Scottish elections. &#147;In those areas where the commission itself has an operational involvement&#151;for example, in its statutory duty to promote public awareness of electoral systems&#151;the commission will ensure independent evaluation of its own work, as it has in previous statutory reports. The commission is currently finalising the scope and timescale of the review, but intends to publish a report in the summer.&#147;A focus of public concern has been the adoption of a single ballot paper for the Scottish elections and the holding of those elections on the same day as the local government election. The poll for the Scottish Parliament elections is set in the Scotland Act. It has a predetermined cycle that Parliament at the time supported fully. I am not aware of any calls to change that. The decision to hold the local government elections on the same day was entirely a decision for Scottish Executive Ministers. It was enshrined in legislation which was fully debated and passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2001.&#147;Without wishing to prejudice the findings of this inquiry I should like to set out to the House the sequence of recommendations, consultations and decisions that led to the adoption of a single ballot paper for both elements of the Scottish Parliament elections, which are matters for which the Government have legislative responsibility.&#147;On 25 May 2004, my predecessor as Secretary of State, my right honourable friend the Member for Edinburgh Central, announced the creation of  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1298"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a commission under the chairmanship of Sir John Arbuthnott to examine the implications of Scotland having four different voting systems. This commission was independent and included nominations from political parties. The commission issued a consultation paper in January 2005 and spent 12 months gathering evidence and carrying out a wide-ranging and extensive inquiry.&#147;The Arbuthnott commission issued its report jointly to my predecessor and the Scottish First Minister on 19 January 2006. The report contained a series of recommendations and suggestions&#151;some to the Electoral Commission concerning voter education; some to the Scottish Executive, such as a recommendation to move the date of the local government elections; and several recommendations to the Government.&#147;My right honourable friend made it clear that it was unlikely that we would be in a position to implement those recommendations from the report which would require primary legislation in time for the 2007 Scottish elections.&#147;However, there was one matter that could be progressed without the need for primary legislation&#151;the suggestion that the two ballot papers for the regional list and constituency member be combined into one, with the regional list on the left-hand column, based on the example of the New Zealand paper.&#147;In the light of the views of the Arbuthnott commission I decided to proceed with a wider public consultation in order to test whether the suggested move to a single ballot paper commanded more general support, and to explore the appropriate design of such a ballot paper.&#147;The Scotland Office launched this consultation on 9 June 2006. In addition, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary met a range of interested parties, including representatives from disability rights groups, to explore these issues. There was a significant level of support for a single ballot paper. Of 29 respondents, the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party, the Liberal party of Scotland, Enable Scotland and Capability Scotland were not in favour of a combined ballot paper. I have requested that all responses to this consultation are placed in the Library of the House.&#147;The major political parties that expressed a view were largely in favour: Derek Barrie, chief of staff, on behalf of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, responded on 15 June:<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="07050820000089"></a>&#145;The Scottish Liberal Democrats warmly welcome and fully endorse the proposal to have one ballot paper only for the next diet of Scottish Parliament elections in May 2007. This is one recommendation of Arbuthnott that we fully agree with&#146;.</p>
</ul>&#147;Peter Murrell, chief executive of the Scottish National Party, responded on 16 August 2006:<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a><a name="07050820000090"></a>&#145;The Scottish National Party is in support of the proposed move to a single ballot paper for both votes in the Scottish Parliament elections. We believe that this will aid understanding of both elements of the voting system and, in particular, remove any misunderstanding that the regional vote is somehow a second preference vote&#146;.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="07050820000093"></a>&#145;The SOLAR elections working group unanimously agreed to support the proposal that both Scottish Parliament contests be contained on one ballot paper&#146;.</p>
</ul>&#147;In order to further explore those issues in advance of a decision as part of the consultation, the Scotland Office also requested the Electoral Commission to research with voters the impact of any possible change to the ballot paper format. On 4 August 2006, Sir Neil McIntosh wrote to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, enclosing the findings of that research, which involved focus groups carried out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Inverness and Dundee. A copy of the research has been placed in the Library of the House, together with the covering letter from the Electoral Commission. In that covering letter, Sir Neil McIntosh wrote:<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="07050820000094"></a>&#145;As you can see, the research draws a number of clear conclusions for the design of the Scottish Parliamentary Ballot Paper. These conclusions point to the interests of the voter best being served by: A design of ballot paper that incorporates both the regional and constituency ballot papers alongside each other on a single sheet of paper&#146;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70508-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07050820000088"></a>The findings of the focus groups supported the move to a single ballot paper, with a significant majority of respondents agreeing with the overall preference in favour of a single combined ballot paper rather than two separate papers.</p>
 &#147;Only after that extensive consultation involving the widest possible range of stakeholders, the support of the main political parties that expressed a preference, the research received indicating the best interest of the voter being served by a single ballot paper, and clear official advice, was a decision taken to proceed with a single ballot paper for the Scottish parliamentary elections.&#147;There is also the issue of delays in the administration of postal ballots. The handling of postal votes is increasingly of public interest and concern, which is why we already have stiff penalties in legislation to prevent fraud. The use of postal votes in higher numbers than before makes that all the more important. When it became clear that such delays were occurring in the days prior to polling day, I instructed my officials to contact the Electoral Commission to ensure that these matters would be fully investigated. &#147;However, the process at local level for the preparation and delivery of postal votes is for returning

They make the contractual arrangements that they judge appropriate for their area. They are well aware of the tight timescales involved in getting out the papers to voters. When the Electoral Commission reports, I will of course examine whether there are steps that the Government can take to help ensure that the postal vote problems that certainly beset regions such as the Highlands, Dumfries and Galloway, among others, do not happen again.&#147;Finally, I will turn to the issue of e-counting. In 2005, the Scottish Executive approached the Scotland Office to discuss the option of using e-counting at the combined poll. That arose mainly because of the benefits of handling a count of ballots under the single transferable vote method. Manual counting of STV would take many days and be highly complex. My predecessor as Secretary of State, after careful assessment of advice, gave an agreement in principle to the option, but stressed the need for systematic testing and evaluation of the equipment and software.&#147;That took place through late 2005 and into 2006, up to the final procurement decisions. Many tests and demonstrations were held for electoral administrators, political parties, special interest groups and others. Various contingencies were tested, including power failures and ballot papers that had been creased or folded. The process was led by a steering group comprising officials from the Scotland Office, the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament, as well as representatives from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Association of Electoral Administrators, the Society of Local Authority Lawyers and Administrators, the Scottish Assessors Association and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives. I am advised that none of these simulations gave any evidence of the kind or scale of problems we saw in some centres on Thursday night and Friday morning. Clearly, this is an issue which will be absolutely central to the Electoral Commission&#146;s report.&#147;Mr Speaker, there are clearly a number of issues that need to be explored in relation to the problems encountered in the conduct of these elections. The Electoral Commission must now be allowed to undertake its statutory review which, as I have said before, will be available by the summer. I will, of course, update the House at that stage, in the light of their conclusions&#148;.

Speaking of the Scottish elections, it would be remiss of me not to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, who is unfortunately not in his place, on his successful election to the Scottish Parliament. His only sadness must be that it looks as though he is to be denied the opportunity of asking the same kind of congratulatory questions of government Ministers there as he was able to do in this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07050820000005"></a>Scotland has been wished four different voting systems. That has been a source of confusion for a

The Government were warned by no less an authority than the Electoral Commission, and equally by the Arbuthnott commission, of the dangers of trying to hold an election for two different systems on the same day. The Labour and Liberal Democrat Members of the Scottish Parliament were likewise warned by the Scottish Conservative Members of the dangers of combining the local government elections with the Scottish parliamentary ones. Still they persisted. Does this not bring to mind the fiasco that we have all witnessed over the single farm payments in England, where an arrogant belief in a rational and intellectual but complicated system runs completely foul of reality?</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07050820000006"></a>The outcome is causing anger and dismay across Scotland. Noble Lords will be aware that in one constituency, Shettleston, there were over 2,000 spoilt ballots. A small country that thought that it was being offered the chance of a higher profile on the world stage has been turned into a laughing stock. I notice that it was claimed in another place that all the spoilt ballots from a few constituencies are not known. Can the Minister tell us how many spoilt ballots are known?</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07050820000007"></a>The final legislation for both elements of these elections was passed through this House after a Grand Committee on 7 March. The Statement highlights the problems of postal ballots. There have been stories of postal ballots being delivered on 2 May for an election on 3 May, or not at all. Can the Minister say why so little time was given to the returning officers to complete their tasks? The Statement talks of the tests and demonstrations of the machines for the electronic counting systems. Was the lateness in finalising the design of the ballot papers a factor in the electronic counting fiasco? What proportion of the votes was subject to recounting? In particular, did they have to be recounted manually as a result of the e-counting malfunction?</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07050820000008"></a>The Minister is a good and decent man. In his heart of hearts he will be as dismayed as the rest of us by the mess that the Secretary of State has created; yet another example of the consequences of the Government&#146;s constant tinkering and messing about with our tried and trusted voting system. If the Prime Minister is looking for a legacy, he need look no further than the complicating and discrediting of a voting system once unquestioned anywhere. Once we sent out the international election inspectors and advisers; now they are heading to Holyrood to find out why Scottish electors are being robbed of their votes in their tens of thousands. What a shambles and a disgrace.</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07050820000010"></a>Is the Minister aware that in 11 general elections from 1964 the proportion of spoilt ballots was never more than 0.38 per cent, and usually below 0.2 per cent? In the first round of the recent French election, with 12 candidates and 37 million voters, spoilt ballots were only 1.4 per cent. By contrast, does he recall the fiasco of the London elections in 2004, the closest parallel to these events? Several voting systems were run in parallel on the same day and over 500,000 Londoners saw their votes spoilt; 3 per cent of mayoral votes and nearly 7 per cent of the Assembly votes were

What was said then? The senior returning officer said that the legislation was not passed in time. The Electoral Reform Society said that the problems were foreseen but ignored. The Government said that they would learn the lessons. The shameful reality is that they did not listen then and they did not learn. As a direct result, Scotland has suffered a similar fiasco.</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07050820000011"></a>It is all very well the Electoral Commission and the Government promising an inquiry now and the Liberal Democrats calling for one, but they have all been complicit in creating the debacle. The most obvious place to look for solutions is not from those who presided over the debacle in the first place. I do not consider that the appointment of an inquiry into this fiasco, while necessary, is enough to absolve the Government of all responsibility.</p>

Dismay at the outcome of the elections held on the same day is widely felt throughout Scotland. In passing, I note that the Scottish Conservative Party was not among those that gave advice about the process of having a double ballot on one paper. Some of us would prefer not to jump to conclusions as to which of the novelties was responsible for what appears to have been a catastrophically mismanaged election.</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07050820000013"></a>We welcome the Electoral Commission&#146;s decision to put in hand the inquiry into the spoilt ballots, the postal voting and electronic counting; all of them had novel features and appeared to have contributed in some measure to denying perhaps as many as one in 20 of the Scottish electors the opportunity of contributing to the outcome of the election, as they believed they had done. There have been instances of voting for two authorities on the same day in the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland in 2005. There was a warning issued by the Electoral Commission at that time. In the report on that election it stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="07050820000062"></a>&#147;If combined elections are to become the norm then much more needs to be done ... to ensure the electorate understands the different voting systems&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70508-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07050820000014"></a>I think that it is fair to say that not much had been done in Scotland prior to the elections last Thursday. The Minister&#146;s Statement indicated that the Government considered that there was not a sufficient gap between the decisions and the election to introduce legislation. Is legislation is really necessary to enable the education of the electorate to take place?</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07050820000015"></a>The problem has unquestionably vitiated the authority of those democratic elections. With such a high proportion of spoilt ballots, there must be great grievances in particular constituencies. It is extremely difficult for individuals who may have suffered from this to pursue their cause through an election court, particularly as there are so few precedents to guide the returning officers on what was appropriate behaviour and to enable the court to decide what would be unreasonable. I hope that, in considering these matters, the Electoral Commission will give thought to the possibility of manually checking e-ballots where the voter&#146;s mind  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1303"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1303</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was not able to be read. The old system of manual checking was regarded as being effective and pretty accurate by and large.</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07050820000016"></a>My final point is on the review. In so far as there may be questions about whether the Electoral Commission conducted all the necessary preliminary inquiries and took the necessary steps, and given that it is, in a sense, involved in the outcome of this election, the Government will have to give some thought to whether further independent consideration needs to be given to those matters where it might be invidious for the commission to pronounce on its own performance.</p>

We on this side will miss him, and I personally will miss him a great deal, as he has been a breath of fresh air.</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07050820000018"></a>I disagree with the noble Duke&#146;s point that this mess was created by the Secretary of State. That is a good political point, but if he listened to the Statement, as I am sure he did, he will know that the Scottish Executive made a number of decisions and local returning officers were responsible for many of the activities that resulted in the problems that he is laying at the feet of the Government. As I said, that is a good debating point, but it is not particularly fair.</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07050820000019"></a>The import of my right honourable friend&#146;s Statement is that a number of things have gone wrong. He and the Government are determined to find out what went wrong. We have asked the Electoral Commission&#151;an independent body with a statutory right and duty to look into these matters&#151;to look into all aspects and report back. As my right honourable friend said a few minutes ago in another place, if, as a result of the Electoral Commission&#146;s report, there is a need for further matters to be inquired into, we will not hesitate to do that. The intention is there; we are not avoiding any issue. That is an important point for all noble Lords to take on board.</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07050820000020"></a>Let me answer some of the specific points that the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, raised. The poll has been criticised, but the Scottish Parliament has, under the Scotland Act, the duty to come to those decisions. The local government elections are for Scottish Executive Ministers, not London, to decide on. There has been great discussion and concern about spoilt papers. As I have said, and as my right honourable friend said in another place, although that is a matter for the returning officers we think it would be unwise to comment upon it until we have the final tally. I am absolutely prepared to give an undertaking that these figures will be released once we have that tally.</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07050820000021"></a>On criticism of the Government about postal votes, and for not allowing enough time for those to be sent out effectively, their timetable is set by local returning officers. E-counting has clearly not gone as smoothly as anyone would have wished; that will also be an important aspect of the Electoral Commission&#146;s report.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1304"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07050820000022"></a>Again, we cannot give precise figures at the moment on the spoilt ballot papers. There is a figure of 100,000 going around, but there is just a feeling&#151;one to be confirmed or otherwise by the Electoral Commission&#151;that that is rather high. We have no details yet of the local government ballot papers, so again it is best to wait to see what the actual figures are. On the high incidence of spoilt papers, I must underline that the Electoral Commission is impartial and can get an independent element into the review if so needed. If there is concern about the Electoral Commission, I should say that it can and will get independent, impartial advice within its review.</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07050820000023"></a>I turn to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan. The combined poll issue will form part of the Electoral Commission&#146;s review, and the Government will consider carefully what is said on all points once that is available. I am afraid that we cannot comment on individual poll results, as there may be the possibility of further action. I hope that answers the major points that have been raised.</p>

First, I find it incomprehensible that some six days after an election we are not yet in a position to know the final tally of figures. It is the first election for 30-odd years, or nearly 40, at which I have not been present; had I had any involvement, I certainly would have been demanding that these figures be provided before the lights were put out in the counting stations. That point should be taken on board.</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07050820000025"></a>Secondly, none of us has any faith whatever in the Electoral Commission. Its ability to get behind the system in electoral politics seems almost the equivalent of a Chinese bureaucrat&#151;a mandarin looking at a complex problem&#151;who has a solution that does not necessarily bear any connection with reality.</p>

<a name="70508-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07050820000026"></a>Thirdly, on the counting of the papers, and the spoilt ones, as far as I can see there was no consideration given to a consistent approach to the issue. One would have thought otherwise, given the possibility for complexity&#151;and I speak as a first past the post person, for I like the British electoral system when it is simple, with a result where you can kick up hell if you get beaten, knowing at the end of the day that you must wait four years to really solve that. It is extremely naive to assume that we would somehow have spoilt papers of the order of 0.1 or 0.2 per cent, as we would in a general election. We who have participated in general elections all know that the spoilt papers come at the very end. Most people are tired&#151;the victors are elated and the defeated usually sickened&#151;and not in a position to make rational judgments. Although the returning officer may only start work at 10 o&#146;clock on election night, the rest of us have had rather a busy period before that and are probably too tired. Yet there is no excuse for abdicating responsibility and saying, &#147;We&#146;ll just set them aside&#148;.</p>

He regards it as a scandal and a disaster that spoilt ballot papers have not been counted several days after the election, but I have said that we will come back to that once we know the tally. We do not know it, and there is no point in noble Lords getting up and complaining about it when that reality confronts us today.

It is independent and quite brilliant in the work that it does. Section 5 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 requires the Electoral Commission to review the conduct of each parliamentary election. It can involve external elements in reviewing an area where it feels that any previous involvement on its part&#151;real or perceived&#151;could prejudice its impartiality. I call on noble Lords to have confidence in the Electoral Commission; I am convinced that, when it reports, it will deal with all the problems that we have been talking about this afternoon, and that we will then be able to learn from what has happened and move on.</p>

I have never seen so much buck-passing. It was the Government who introduced devolution and a different system for every set of elections in Scotland, and the Government must carry responsibility for this absolute scandal. With 100,000 people disfranchised, surely the issue we should be talking about is not whether the Electoral Commission should report, but whether we should rerun the election from start to finish. Hundreds of people have been disfranchised in their constituencies; the Minister has come here to say that we do not actually know how many spoilt ballot papers there were, when I heard them being declared&#151;two thousand here, a thousand there&#151;in constituencies where the majorities were tiny.</p>

I feel that the noble Lord is being most unfair to my right honourable friend in another place who, in my view, gave a Statement that accurately describes what has happened and said what was going to be done about it. We all need to learn from the unfortunate events of 3 May, and move on. I hope that all noble Lords will be able to move on with the Electoral Commission, once it gives its independent report.</p>

There were three of us from this House in the first Parliament; he is now the only one.

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07050820000037"></a>Seriously, my criticism of the Statement is that its tone did not seem to echo the gravity of what people feel went wrong in Scotland. I have spent considerable time in my retirement advising Parliaments and political parties and monitoring elections overseas. I do not know how I will be able to show my face in Africa in future, where I have seen counts conducted with chalk on the floor of a village school with much greater efficiency and accuracy than happened with our sophisticated system in Scotland. It is an acute embarrassment and a matter of public anger that so many votes were discounted. The tone of the Statement did not reflect that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07050820000038"></a>I also appeal for a proper, quick, independent inquiry into what went wrong for two reasons: not just because, as my noble friend said, some of those matters were the responsibility of the Electoral Commission but also because some of them were not. They fell outside its remit. The fact that the two elections were held together was not its responsibility. </p>

<a name="70508-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07050820000039"></a>Postal votes were decided by returning officers, not by the Electoral Commission. The Minister may want to know that my noble friend Lord Kirkwood was one of the many people who got a postal ballot paper for the wrong ward. Why was that allowed to be contracted out to firms that did not know the local geography? That is extraordinary. It was not the decision of the Electoral Commission; nor was the introduction of the counting machines. There is a compelling case for having a proper, genuinely independent inquiry, whatever the Electoral Commission may do internally.</p>

<a name="70508-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07050820000040"></a>The Minister said that he does not know the actual number of spoilt ballot papers although, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, said, we all heard them announced constituency by constituency. We have not yet been told how many spoilt papers there were in the local government ballot. It is a paradox that under the single transferable vote system for local government, there were far fewer spoilt papers than in the first- past-the-post ballot papers for the Scottish Parliament. As the ballot papers were modelled on those in

I suspect that it is more to do with the design of the ballot paper than the compilation of the paper in principle.</p>

<a name="70508-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07050820000041"></a>My fundamental point is that there must be a proper, independent inquiry and the Government must accept that.</p>

An independent inquiry is exactly what the law requires. That is why the commission will conduct its review. It is the body charged with doing that work. Here we are, three or four days away from those elections. The Secretary of State has moved very quickly to get the Electoral Commission on board to do exactly what the noble Lord wants it to do, which attacks all the problems that arose last week. If the report is not satisfactory, the way is left open for further review. Although I take on board the noble Lord&#146;s point that the Statement may not have underlined the gravity of the situation, it was absolutely clear from the debate in the other place taken in the whole, including the contributions from Front-Benchers and Back-Benchers, that it is seen as a very grave situation and one that must be addressed.</p>

<a name="70508-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07050820000051"></a>The Minister has fairly pointed out that the timing of elections was a devolved responsibility. If the Electoral Commission makes strong representations, will he be prepared to take them forward? If they relate to devolved responsibilities, will he be prepared to take them forward with the First Minister of the Scottish Parliament, who is about to be elected, and the Scottish Executive, who will be elected before long?</p>

I assume that if the Electoral Commission and independent advisers make powerful points about what has gone wrong and the reasons for it, the Scottish Executive and the Government will take great note of what is said. It is a serious matter that must be sorted out and solved. The Government are in no way trying to say anything different. Constructive views from the Electoral Commission will be considered very carefully.</p>

One is the e-counting machines. I understand very well the reasons for using them for the local elections: because of STV, it was thought necessary and a good idea to have e-counting machines. But for the parliamentary elections, I really do not understand why we could not have had manual counting. The parliamentary elections had not changed in any form, people were used to them, and we could have had manual counting. The only reason that I have heard given for having e-counting machines for all the elections is expense. Can my noble friend assure me that, in the light of what has happened, manual counting for the parliamentary elections will be reconsidered?</p>

<a name="70508-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07050820000054"></a>One of the real problems that led to so many voters voting inappropriately on the parliamentary ballot paper and thereby invalidating it was not so much because it was all on one ballot paper, but because of the instructions at the top of the ballot paper, which stated in very heavy print, &#147;You have two votes&#148;. Some people put two crosses in one column and none in the other, thereby completely invalidating their paper. Not just the question of whether there should have been one ballot paper but the question of what instructions go on the ballot paper should be carefully examined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07050849000005"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 385 and 386. These amendments relate to the important provisions in Clause 141 on information sharing. Similar amendments were raised in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and my noble friend Lady Henig on behalf of the Law Society. Although I felt at the time that the wording of the amendment raised at that stage was not appropriate for the Bill, I was persuaded by the importance of the intended effect. As a result, we have worked closely with the Law Society to return with these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07050849000006"></a>I am happy to report that they represent a solution that both the Law Society and the Government are satisfied with. I hope that noble Lords too will be satisfied. It is of vital importance to the regulatory and complaints-handling framework that approved regulators and the OLC work in co-operation. I am confident that these amendments will facilitate that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07050849000007"></a>Amendments Nos. 384 and 385 will strengthen the LSB&#146;s duties when specifying the requirements which the OLC and approved regulators must meet when drawing up their rules on information sharing. The LSB will now have to have regard to the need to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that the OLC and approved regulators, in sharing information, assist one another to perform their function. This elevation of &#147;desirability&#148; to &#147;need&#148; seems more appropriately to reflect the importance of the consideration that the LSB should give to these arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07050849000008"></a>Amendment No. 386 will require the OLC and approved regulators to consult each other prior to submission of rules or arrangements for LSB approval and to require that if there are unresolved disagreements, these are reported to LSB when the rules or regulatory arrangements are submitted for approval. This reflects the particular relevance of these matters to the relationship between the OLC and approved regulators and will encourage the OLC and approved regulators to reach a consensus on what information should be shared and how, and will therefore further facilitate a co-operative relationship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07050849000009"></a>Amendment No. 386 covers much the same ground as Amendment No. 387, tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.

This is one of the cornerstones of the new scheme that we are putting in place. It provides complainants and respondents with the certainty that they are entitled to&#151;a clear end to the complaints process. If the amendments to allow for an independent review were accepted, an ombudsman&#146;s determination would no longer be final, and neither complainants nor respondents would have the necessary certainty. This is not only our view, but the view of the British and Irish Ombudsman Association. As we, and it, have said, complainants do not have to accept the determination of the ombudsman. They are always free to reject that decision and to institute court proceedings. It would therefore be wrong to have an independent reviewer able to second-guess the ombudsman.</p>

<a name="70508-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07050849000036"></a>As explained in Committee, we envisage that there will be several internal reviews of a complaint before it is passed to an ombudsman for a final determination. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said that the amendments arose because the Government had,</p>
<ul><a name="07050849000144"></a>&#147;failed to replace the position of the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner and of the Legal Services Ombudsman&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/2/07; col. 1164.]</ul>
<p><a name="07050849000075"></a>However, although of course the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner and the Legal Services Ombudsman fulfil a valuable role under the present system, there is no need to create these roles under the new system that we are putting in place. At present, consumers need there to be some independent oversight of the way in which the professional bodies handle complaints. This is because those consuming the services do not necessarily have confidence in a profession that is seen to be judging itself. That is not, however, the system that we are creating.</p>

<a name="70508-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07050849000037"></a>The amendments assume that the ombudsman scheme will work in the same way as the current complaints handling system, and so would require an appeals mechanism to an independent person. I hope it is clear, however, that the Office for Legal Complaints and the ombudsman are independent. The chairman of the OLC is a lay person, as is the chief ombudsman. Other ombudsmen cannot be practising lawyers, and every ombudsman is explicitly required to be appointed under terms that will guarantee independence. Ombudsmen&#146;s decisions should be final. If there were appeals, the certainty that we are seeking to create would be lost. That would not be good for consumers or the professions.

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07050849000042"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendments Nos. 400 and 401 have been brought back from Committee. They would impose a general duty on the Legal Services Board to consult&#151;a duty that, as your Lordships are aware, is otherwise absent from the Bill. In our brief exchange on this matter in March, the Minister agreed that,</p>
<ul><a name="07050849000145"></a>&#147;it is essential that the board consults on important points of policy and the framework under which it operates&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/3/07; cols. 148-49.]</ul>
<p><a name="07050849000076"></a>She concluded that it was an unnecessary amendment as the Bill already imposed enough specific duties to consult. At least part of her justification for her approach was that Clauses 8 to 11 already require the board to consult consumers, while her affirmation that she had accepted in principle what was then Amendment No. 38 meant that there would be a similar requirement to consider representations from approved regulators.</p>

<a name="70508-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07050849000043"></a>Her acceptance in principle has unfortunately not translated into acceptance on paper, so the Bill imposes no general obligation on the board to consider representations from the professional bodies. This is just one of the reasons why the overarching duty to consult proposed by Amendment No. 400 would be so desirable.</p>

<a name="70508-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07050849000044"></a>Nevertheless, the other important arguments still remain. Accepting the amendments would add to some of the changes that noble Lords have already made to the Bill by reaffirming the board&#146;s role as a light-touch regulator by ensuring that the regulators would still have as much of a say as possible and by listening to the recommendations of Sir David Clementi. The Minister was reasonably receptive to these arguments in Committee. As what was Amendment No. 38 now looks unlikely to find its way into the Bill, perhaps she might consider these amendments more warmly. I beg to move.</p>

It might be helpful if the Minister gave us a more detailed explanation of what has been going on behind the scenes. She gave us such a clear commitment in Committee, particularly with regard to Amendment No. 38, but that commitment seemed to disappear somewhere. Either she has been got at in some way that has not yet penetrated the consciousness of the Chamber, or she has changed her mind. In either case, we need an explanation. Amendment No. 400 seems to accord so much with the argument that the Minister previously accepted that it is surely right that there should be a general duty to consult practitioners and consumers on the extent to which the Legal Services Board ensures that its general policies and practices are consistent with its duties in Section 3. Amendment No. 401 lays down a reasonable structure within which the board&#146;s general duty to consult would be exercised, and it is very difficult to understand why this is no longer as acceptable as it was. Perhaps the Minister has a convincing explanation, but we have not heard it yet. We await her response with eagerness and anticipation.</p>

Let me describe the general context of Amendment No. 38, which we have discussed. It is absolutely right to say that I took the amendment away and considered the principle behind it, although I did not accept the amendment on the day on which we discussed it because it would have ensured that the Bill afforded consumers and the professions equal treatment. I think that noble Lords broadly accepted that putting in a consumer panel recognised that there was no coherent body representing consumers that would have the necessary force in the legislation but that there were organisations in the professions that had that coherent voice.</p>

<a name="70508-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07050849000047"></a>I took it away to consult officials and we went through the Bill. Having done so, I contend that the Bill affords, in equal weight, opportunities for the professions to have their voices heard, either because they are, as noble Lords know, well organised, well funded and very well established bodies, conversant in the art of putting forward their views; or, indeed, because the legislation itself requires that they are consulted at various points. It is not that I do not accept the principle behind what I said, but we believe that the Bill already does it. Noble Lords may disagree with that; that is for noble Lords to determine. There is nothing behind the scenes, as such. On examination, it was our view that we had achieved what was wanted. That is why I have not brought forward another amendment.</p>

I have not yet found any such provision. This is now such a huge Bill, with so many government amendments, that there may well be hidden away something that would satisfy us, but I have not yet found it.</p>

I cannot win on this. The Government bring forward amendments in order to respond; indeed, a number of amendments are specifically designed to support issues raised by the Law Society. A lot of them are very small, technical changes, but none the less important. That is why there appear to be many more amendments than usual.</p>

<a name="70508-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07050849000050"></a>Noble Lords will, I have no doubt, return to this issue at Third Reading, but that is my explanation. I shall deal with one particular point raised in the amendments. I have indicated that there are sufficient opportunities. Clause 3 specifically requires the board to have regard to key principles, including any other principle that appears to represent the best regulatory practice. In line with best regulatory practice&#151;for example, the Better Regulation Executive&#146;s code of practice on consultation&#151;the board should consider representations made, especially if they come from those affected by its function. The code of practice does not require us to set out consultation provisions in legislation, but it sets out a number of principles of best practice. They include: identifying the relevant interested parties and those likely to be affected by the policy; providing feedback on responses and how they have influenced the policy; and paying particular attention to representative bodies, such as business associations and trade unions.</p>

<a name="70508-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07050849000051"></a>Given the requirement that the board follows best practice in respect of consultation, we should not have to set out in legislation practice which could become outdated and irrelevant as we move forward and become more detailed about the kind of consultation we wish to see. I do not want to narrow the focus of the board&#146;s consultation, which I fear the amendment might if we were to limit the board&#146;s consultation to the extent that its general policies and practice are consistent with its duty under Section 3, or the degree to which the board&#146;s proposed activities are appropriately targeted, and whether or not the proposed programme of work is proportionate.</p>

<a name="70508-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07050849000052"></a>Instead, I submit that the combination of Clause 3 and the provisions that must be followed in respect of representation is the best approach. This would include the requirement for the board to have regard to any representations made to it in respect of policy statements, covered by Clause 49, rules made under the Bill, covered by Clause 195, and ensure that consumers and the profession have the opportunity to influence decisions by the board. The principles that I have outlined would also apply to any work plan, but it is not necessary to put a duty in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70508-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07050849000053"></a>The board is also under a duty, in Clause 3, to ensure that its activities are targeted and used only where appropriate and necessary. This, along with the duty for the board&#146;s accounts to be laid before Parliament, provides sufficient financial accountability. I hope this explanation suffices and that the noble Lord is able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I refer first to Amendment No. 38. In our discussion on that earlier in the Report stage, I asserted that the noble Baroness had given an unequivocal undertaking to incorporate Amendment No. 38 into the Bill. The noble Baroness begged to differ and was going to look at the matter and come back to the House at Third Reading. Of course, we still await her explanation of what she has decided to do about the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07050849000055"></a>The purpose behind Amendment No. 38 has some influence over the amendment that we are discussing now. From what the noble Baroness says, I understand that she is reluctant to place Amendment No. 400 in the Bill. Nevertheless, her explanation for not wishing to do so appears to be that, in effect, the Bill already says what Amendment No. 400 states. Can I therefore take it that the Minister&#146;s interpretation of the Bill is that the board is obliged to make and maintain effective arrangements for consulting representatives of practitioners and consumers, on the extent to which its general policies and practices are consistent with its duty under Clause 53?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07050849000072"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment and those associated with it are designed to ensure that the Government meet the start-up costs of the Legal Services Board and a proportion of its running costs. As noble Lords are only too well aware, the Legal Services Bill is currently drafted on the basis that the whole cost of the regulatory structure, including the supervisory tier&#151;the Legal Services Board&#151;should be borne by the legal profession.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07050849000073"></a>We accept that the profession should meet the full cost of the first tier of regulation; that is to say, the work of the approved regulators and the Office for Legal Complaints. However, the costs of the supervisory tier are another matter. The supervisory tier serves a purpose distinct from that of the front-line bodies. The regulatory structure could work perfectly well without a Legal Services Board. The approved regulators, having separated their representative arms from their regulatory arms, could simply be left to get on with the task. The Government have decided, following Sir David Clementi&#146;s advice, to create a supervisory tier, the Legal Services Board, to provide a check on front-line regulators, to promote consistency and to resolve disagreements where necessary.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07050849000074"></a>The board, provided it operates as a &#147;light-touch&#148; supervisor, may well discharge a useful function; but the Government&#146;s decision to require the legal profession to meet the whole cost of the Legal Services Board is unreasonable.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07050830000073"></a>Sir David Clementi said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_134"></a><a name="07050830000253"></a>&#147;The issue arises as to how the LSB should be paid for. At present a substantial part of the oversight function is paid for by the State: judicial oversight falls to the taxpayer, as does the cost of the oversight function carried out by Government departments. The arguments in favour of the Government contributing to the cost of oversight functions beyond the fact that it does already are ... that the LSB, in pursuit of its objectives ... such as &#145;access to justice&#146; has a wider role in the public interest than the oversight of practitioners in the legal sector; and that an element of payment by other than the bodies being regulated confirms that the regulator is independent of the regulatee&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050830000185"></a>He adds:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_135"></a><a name="07050830000254"></a>&#147;There is an interesting precedent in the proposed funding of the Financial Reporting Council. Its funding is to be split, two thirds falling to the private sector and one third to Government. How the split should be made between the private sector and Government for the LSB would need to be covered in statute and would, therefore, be the subject of Parliamentary scrutiny&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70508-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07050830000074"></a>As Sir David Clementi points out, the Government meet one-third of the cost of the Financial Reporting Council. The Government also meet the full cost of the supervisory tier of healthcare regulation, the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence. The Government have given no adequate explanation of why they consider it appropriate to meet part of the supervisory tier of regulation in the accountancy field, but not in respect of legal services. So far as the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence is concerned, the Government have suggested that it is appropriate to pay because it is important to demonstrate that the CHRE is independent  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1321"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1321</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the medical profession. But that argument applies at least as strongly to the Legal Services Board, which needs to be demonstrably independent of the Government and of the legal profession.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07050830000075"></a>One function of the Legal Services Board will be to consider whether additional legal services should come within the regulatory net. This function is currently carried out within government. It does not form part of the regulation of legal services and is carried out entirely in the public interest, rather than in the interest of providers of legal services. It is particularly unreasonable for the Government to expect those costs to be borne by the legal profession. The Joint Committee considered this issue and concluded that the legal profession should not be expected to finance public policy considerations currently funded by the Government.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07050830000076"></a>The Government&#146;s proposals would, in effect, transfer cost from the Government to the legal profession. The Government currently meet the costs of the Legal Services Ombudsman, whose functions will be absorbed in the Office for Legal Complaints, which will be funded exclusively by the legal profession, and part of the costs of the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner, whose post is also abolished by the Bill. The Government also meet the costs associated with the Legal Services Consultancy Panel, and the costs of the work in relation to legal services regulation of the Lord Chancellor and the senior judiciary. Continuing to contribute towards the cost of regulation would thus maintain the existing position, rather than represent a new spending commitment from the Government. The examples that the Government gave for regulators funded entirely by regulatees&#151;the FSA, the FOS and the Pensions Regulator&#151;are entirely beside the point. They are frontline regulators. We have no quarrel about that.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07050830000077"></a>Ensuring a continuing contribution from the Government might also act as a brake on any tendency of the Legal Services Board to expand its activities unjustifiably. There is an obvious risk that if the board can simply re-charge the cost to the approved regulators it will grow substantially beyond what the Government say that they envisage. It is important for the Government to have a financial incentive to ensure that the board operates as the light-touch supervisory body that they have so often said they wish to establish.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07050830000078"></a>It should also be recalled that this issue has to be seen in the light of the steadily increased estimate of the start-up and running costs of the board. The noble Baroness very generously did not need any probing to let us know that, yet again, last month&#146;s cost estimates for the establishment of the board have gone up. We are now talking of a sum of no less than &#163;46 million, with annual running costs approaching &#163;30 million. These figures are a far cry from the context in which Sir David Clementi was operating. At the time he reached his conclusions, the estimated start-up costs of the Legal Services Board were less than &#163;10 million. So the changing financial picture ought to be a very convincing new component for the Government in changing their view about how this new system is to be financed. I beg to move.</p>

I supported the line of reasoning expressed in Committee and have few additional points to make. However, the public interest in the Legal Services Board&#146;s operating economically and effectively will be best discharged by the Government&#146;s direct interest being continued through the financial mechanism. If the body is established and passes its costs on to the consumers of legal services, the Government&#146;s continuing interest in maintaining the body in the form in which it has been described from the beginning will be put at grave risk.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07050830000080"></a>The Government have clearly departed from the advice of the Clementi report, particularly on start-up costs. It is not surprising that the estimates for these costs have risen since Sir David Clementi reported. The duties which the Bill imposes on the Legal Services Board are far reaching and are by no means consonant with the concept that the board would intervene only when something had gone wrong. It is creating a huge framework of supervision by the indicative policies that the Bill requires it to embark on. These changes may or may not be necessary; although I am persuadable that the Government are right in thinking that they are required, there are downside cost consequences.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07050830000081"></a>The second major point of principle, to which I think the amendments are addressed, is that the public have an interest in the delivery of justice in our society, which goes far beyond the ability of individuals to have access to justice. They have an interest in justice being done, being seen to be done and being available to all. The more expensive that this process of regulation becomes, the more inaccessible justice will be. If the professions have to bear the full costs, there will be no way of recouping them other than by increasing the cost of their services. I simply cannot understand why there is this belief that the proposal is in the consumer&#146;s interest. The danger is that ever more people will find that legal assistance and access to the courts and advice are beyond their means. The Bill could contribute to that if it does not share out the costs between the taxpayer and the professions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07050830000082"></a>This is so much a point of principle that it does not seem capable of being dealt with other than by a direct rebuttal by the Government. I would find it difficult if the Government did not take the point. Costs are predicted to escalate although it may not be possible now to determine the precise amount. I cannot believe that the Minister has any expectation other than that the figures which have been produced are more than a base from which the costs will rise.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07050830000083"></a>I hope to get this Bill off to a proper flying start. As the Minister knows, I have been a supporter of the Bill and, like noble Lords on all sides of the House, believe that it is necessary. She will recognise that citizens&#151;citizens, as opposed to petitioners to courts for redress regarding the non-delivery of services&#151;have an interest in this being done appropriately. Citizens will be prepared to pay the price.</p>

That was encouraged by the Legal Aid and Advice Act which the Labour Government brought in soon after World War 2. The legal profession, and I mean both parts of it, has always professed that it must have in mind the interests of the public&#151;citizens in general&#151;and not just their clients. Its behaviour, codes of practice and professional conduct require that that should be so. As we know, however, the legal profession has not always in practice come up to the high standards professed in the codes of professional conduct and the codes that, at annual meetings and so on, it maintains that it has.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07050830000085"></a>I know that opposition parties do not agree fully with every aspect of the Bill but, bearing in mind the professions&#146; deficiencies in dealing with complaints, it is difficult for them to suggest that the Bill&#146;s surveillance elements regarding the Legal Services Board are not required. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, distinguishes between the front-line regulators&#151;which, as he would say, are properly paid for by the professions&#151;and the Legal Services Board, which, on behalf of the public, ensures that it does a good job, or at least that is what it is meant to do. That is not a strong distinction. They are all needed. The surveillance of the Legal Services Board is needed because of the professions&#146; recent history. It is in the public interest to ensure that the professional standards which the professions have maintained and stated they believe in over so many years are in fact and in practice maintained.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07050830000086"></a>It is rather difficult to argue that the people who use the services of lawyers should not pay for the work of the Legal Services Board as well as for the front-line regulators. I certainly do not see as a matter of principle the distinction drawn by noble Lords opposite on this matter. I recall certain connections with the regulation of the accountancy profession. I do not see any objection in principle to the fact that it does it by means of the Financial Reporting Council, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. There is a split, and some sort of split is desirable. I know that Sir David Clementi thought that that might be suitable in the legal profession.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07050830000087"></a>I stress that the Government&#146;s proposals are not out of the question or unprincipled in suggesting that those who need and have to pay for the services of lawyers should also pay, rather than the general taxpayer, for the provision of the surveillance of the Legal Services Board as well as for the front-line regulators.</p>

That was why Sir David Clementi said that the Legal Services Board should have a wider remit in the public interest than just the oversight of the practitioners in the legal services sector. He also said&#151;I felt persuasively&#151;that to have a contribution from other than just the

If all its money came from the professions over which it had oversight, then issues such as access to justice and independence would not be seen as having the wider remit that the public would want.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07050830000089"></a>In demonstrating my support for the words of my noble friend Lord Kingsland, and also finding myself in complete agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, I should also add that I am becoming increasingly concerned about the cost. When we last debated the Bill, on the second day of Report, we had just seen an extract from a report by Frances Gibb in the <I>Times</I> that the costs were escalating to a degree that none of us had really contemplated. In the Joint Select Committee, the estimate of costs was said to be, if I recall correctly, &#147;at best speculative&#148;. But I do not think that any of us on the Joint Select Committee contemplated that they would double before the final figures were known. It might be helpful if the Minister could bring us up to date in particular on the start-up costs but also on the running costs. It is a little while since we saw that report.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07050830000090"></a>The Minister at least indicated that she shared our concerns about the costs suddenly running away from us in a way that would impinge on access to justice if the professions had to bear all those costs. Who is going to pay? The answer is that the consumer of legal services ultimately will pay through increased charges. I am very worried indeed about whether we have yet seen the final picture. When we last debated these issues, the noble Baroness said that she was taking a close look not only at the start-up costs but at the running costs as well. Now that we have this debate and a number like it this evening, it might be helpful if she could bring us up to date with where we are on the issue of costs so far as the Government are concerned.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07050830000091"></a>Finally, experience tells me that written in bold capital letters on the Minister&#146;s brief from the Treasury will be the word, &#147;Resist&#148;. I have come to have considerable respect for the Minister and I know that she would ignore any such mandate if she felt that there was a case to be argued. I do not know whether she will let us in on what arguments may be going on with the Treasury behind the scenes, but my noble friend Lord Kingsland has made a very strong point in moving this amendment. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not reject it out of hand.</p>

<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="07050830000092"></a><b><a name="70508-0010.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07050830000327"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> My Lords, I have not had any conversations with the Treasury. I do have the word &#147;Resist&#148; written on my brief, but it is not from the Treasury. Indeed, we have been in consultation with the Treasury to do precisely what the noble Lord has invited me to do, which is to give an update on the costs. Noble Lords will recall that when we considered this issue on 16 April, I said that I was concerned to look at the figures reported by Frances Gibb in the <I>Times</I>, as well as to consider the further analysis undertaken with the Law Society and the Bar Council. Rather helpfully, those with whom we shared the figures raised different points that they wished us to reconsider, which I duly asked officials to do. I also  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1325"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1325</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>asked my officials to give me figures that I could use this evening in order to set out for noble Lords the position as it currently stands.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07050830000093"></a>We have been looking to refine the implementation plans and to consider the amendments that have been made to the Bill, so it is absolutely right to reflect the current position by updating the costs. Noble Lords will recall that the original forecast by PricewaterhouseCoopers was &#163;26.8 million. Following our further analysis, the figure now stands at &#163;32 million, which takes into account inflation&#151;that is, the costs are restated at 2007-08 prices&#151;and includes VAT. It also reflects other adjustments which have led to decreases in costs in some areas and increases in others. In addition, in relation to the Office for Legal Complaints, we have assumed a year-on-year increase in the volume of complaints. That is based on an analysis of the compound annual growth rate of Law Society complaints, which account for approximately 96 per cent of the total annual volume of complaints. Building in this annual growth rate has impacted on both implementation and running costs, with the result that it is predicted that in 2007-08 the running costs are now predicted to be &#163;19.9 million compared with the PricewaterhouseCoopers estimate of &#163;16.8 million. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, specifically asked me for that figure. However, the revised figure still represents a saving on the current complaints-handling arrangements, costed by PricewaterhouseCoopers at &#163;32.5 million in 2005.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07050830000094"></a>While the analysis we have carried out is robust and based on sound assumptions, any operation of this size involves risks, no matter how carefully planned and managed it may be, so we have put together a risk register. It is therefore prudent to build in a margin for unforeseen costs, and I have suggested that we build in a margin of 15 per cent, which is approximately &#163;5 million. That is based on an analysis of the risks associated with the reform process and the costs that may accompany those risks. It is right and proper to cite a figure that takes into account all the risks of change. Although I do not anticipate the risks, they could include problems such as not being able to find appropriate premises. These are risks that we do not believe will be realised, but none the less have to be taken into account.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07050830000095"></a>We have also looked at the possibility of a spike in complaints volumes occurring two to three years after the introduction of the new scheme. We have analysed what has happened in comparable sectors and the evidence suggests a tendency towards a spike two to three years in. However, I emphasise that our forecasts already take into account a year-on-year increase, and of course the experience of different sectors does not necessarily read across. In addition, in practice we would expect to see economies of scale and a decrease in cost per complaint.</p>

<a name="70508-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07050830000096"></a>It is obviously crucial that noble Lords and the legal professions have confidence in these figures, so I should like to emphasise that the adjustments which have been made are based on a robust analysis. What is more, I can confirm that the revised figure will now form the basis of the implementation budget for the

<a name="70508-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07050830000099"></a>Noble Lords will also want to know the detail of the adjustments that have been made. It may be helpful if I set out the position in writing as well as producing a revised RIA. I indicated previously that I would write, but noble Lords will know from our discussions on 16 April that I did not want to do so until I was convinced that the figures were robust. Indeed, I am grateful to our officials who have worked tirelessly during the past two weeks in order to drill down and make sure that the figures are right. Before Third Reading I shall write to noble Lords setting out the position in full, and that will include responses to questions raised by the professions about the position of VAT and double counting. We have been in contact with Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue &amp; Customs and received the best advice on the VAT position. I shall set all this out in detail, which I hope will be useful. I am grateful to noble Lords for their patience in allowing me to get to this point, one where the figures are now more robust. Noble Lords will see that the estimate is a decrease from the figure I was talking about for the professions, and I hope that that is welcome. However, I appreciate that they will want to see the detail before agreeing that the figures are indeed robust. Finally, noble Lords should feel free to put any questions to me before we return to these issues at Third Reading.</p>

<a name="70508-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07050830000100"></a>I turn now to the principle underlying the debates. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, put very well the concerns that have been raised on the issue of funding, but we remain convinced that it is entirely appropriate for the legal service providers to bear the costs of these reforms. Here I want to reiterate the basis of that conviction. I am glad to say that we have a thriving legal market with a turnover in 2005 of &#163;22 billion. The legal professions have a privileged position as the providers of reserved legal services. I believe that confidence in the system will increase as a result of the demonstrably independent regulation and complaints handling procedures, and I believe that the legal professions will benefit from that. I also think that the opportunity created in the Bill for alternative business structures will be to their benefit. They will be significant beneficiaries, and on that basis the Government think it entirely right for the significant beneficiaries to pay for the reforms.</p>

<a name="70508-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07050830000101"></a>I acknowledge that the Government will make some savings as a result of these reforms, but the job of government is to consider where to invest and what are the priorities. We believe that investment is most needed in other priority areas, particularly those where other sources of funding are not available.  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1327"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1327</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>While I agree with the noble Lords, Lord Maclennan and Lord Kingsland, that the Legal Services Board plays a public interest role, I do not accept that that provides an argument in favour of a government contribution to costs. At present the legal professional bodies raise fees from their members not solely to pay for the cost of regulation. They also fund important public interest activities performed by those bodies. I cite, for example, participation in human rights and law reform work. The same approach should apply to all the functions which will support the new framework provided for in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70508-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07050830000102"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and others discussed a number of comparisons, including the role of the Financial Reporting Council. I undertook to look at the funding arrangements for that organisation in more detail. The Financial Reporting Council&#146;s accounting, auditing and corporate governance activities are funded by a tripartite arrangement, funding received in equal proportions from the accountancy professions, the business community and the Government. Other costs, audit inspection, investigation and disciplining of accounts are funded entirely by the accountancy professions. However, the Government provide no funding in relation to actuaries. The FRC&#146;s funding arrangements in relation to its responsibilities for actuarial standards and regulation are as follows: 10 per cent from the profession, 45 per cent from the insurance companies and 45 per cent from the pension funds. As noble Lords would expect, I have also looked at the funding arrangements of a number of other regulatory bodies: the Financial Services Authority, the financial services ombudsman, the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, the pensions regulator, the office of communication and the claims management regulator.</p>

<a name="70508-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07050830000103"></a>That analysis highlights that there is no rigid approach in terms of government funding. There are cases where the Government fund establishment or running costs and cases where they do not. The decision in effect is taken on a case-by-case basis, but the Government&#146;s starting principle is that there should be no increase in public expenditure unless there is a compelling case for public funding. In this instance we do not believe that there is any such compelling argument. It is not inconsistent in terms of government policy to require the professions to pay. I know that the legal professions have argued that if the Government were making a contribution they would be incentivised to reduce costs. We are committed to ensuring value for money in these reforms and that is why we have built in the safeguards to ensure that. The levy rules are subject to the extensive consultation requirements, to the consent of the Lord Chancellor and to parliamentary scrutiny through the negative resolution procedure. Together these measures will ensure that the spending of the new bodies is properly contained.</p>

I was particularly thankful to the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, who made an exceptionally fine and demanding&#151;from the Minister&#146;s point of view&#151;intervention on behalf of our amendments. Although the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, sought to disagree with me he was at his most eloquent and my noble friend Lord Hunt has always found a certain amount of liquid in even the driest of water courses. I am most grateful to all of them.</p>

<a name="70508-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07050830000108"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, rightly said that we should look at the role of the Legal Services Board in a context wider than that of the regulation of complaints. We on these Benches accept the establishment of the Legal Services Board but at no stage in the Bill&#146;s course have we sought to amend it so as to remove the board. We also accept that there are certain functions of the board in supervising the complaints system that should legitimately be financed by the professions. But the functions of the Legal Services Board go way beyond the complaints arena. My noble friend Lord Hunt dealt particularly vividly with the wider public interest. A number of other public regulatory organisations have both their start-up and their running costs supported by the Government. I can think of no public regulator of the sort that the Legal Services Board purports to be that is not in some form or other supported by the Government. Moreover, the authorised persons will have no control whatever over the number of additional functions that might be heaped on the board for which they will have to pay. There is nothing in the Bill that controls that process on their behalf.</p>

<a name="70508-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07050830000109"></a>Moreover, a range of existing functions currently financed by the taxpayer will now be transferred and become a financial burden on the authorised users. The Government are a net beneficiary of that process. The legal profession will carry burdens in future that were formerly carried by the taxpayer. Given the scale of the costs that the profession is about to meet, that is, in my respectful submission, entirely unacceptable. Despite the noble Baroness&#146;s attempt at calming words, I find the situation entirely unacceptable. At this late hour we would probably be imprudent on both sides of the House to vote, but nevertheless I will give the noble Baroness a week longer to consider the position. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07050830000117"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I can deal with this amendment telegraphically. The noble Baroness will recall that the two regulators concerned with patents and trademarks were especially concerned about the considerable financial burden of the levy and start-up costs. They believe that further safeguards should be put into the Bill and have proposed in the amendment the same wording that appeared in our previous Amendment No. 142A in Committee. I know that the noble Baroness has set her heart against a definition of proportionality in the Bill but nevertheless I hope that she will accept that the concerns expressed by the authorities, and the fears that flow from them, genuine. Even if she is not prepared to accept the amendment I hope that she will be prepared to provide powerful words of comfort instead.</p>

I beg to move.</p>

I have already indicated that we have talked to the smaller regulators, because I understand their concerns. I said as well that I would look at what else we might be able to do on this issue to give them clarity and comfort about the situation.</p>

<a name="70508-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07050830000122"></a>I said during the debate in Committee that the board must be satisfied that the apportionment of the levy would be in accordance with fair principles before making the rules, and I still firmly believe that that, rather than a list in the Bill of what would inevitably be a prescriptive list of factors, is the appropriate provision. Noble Lords will know that I have a general aversion to lists as they can never be exhaustive, and often they could preclude a factor that we do not think of at the time but could subsequently become important&#151;perhaps more important than other factors. I do not wish to do that because it is important to enable the philosophy of proportionality to be interpreted with the factors at the time, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<a name="70508-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07050830000123"></a>I recognise that the list sets out what the board should consider inter alia, so other matters should be considered too, but any list puts pressure on the board to consider those matters before anything else for fear of being reviewed, and that would restrict the flexibility of the board, something the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys and the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys have said they do not want. They do not want a one-size-fits-all approach. I agree, and we would argue that flexibility is exactly what is needed to prevent that. Reducing that flexibility through a predetermined list could ultimately be to their detriment, and none of us wishes to see that happen.</p>

<a name="70508-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07050830000124"></a>I do not want to set out the principles. In our thinking we have followed the approach in Section 2(3) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act, which establishes that regulatory activities should be carried out in a way that is transparent, accountable, proportionate and consistent, and that regulatory activities should be targeted only at cases in which action is needed. We believe that the terminology set out in the Bill in respect of proportionality and fair principles has a natural meaning that is widely accepted and widely understood, but it gives the flexibility to provide for the smaller regulatory bodies, which I know are concerned about this. I hope, as we continue to discuss this with them&#151;we will certainly do so&#151;that they will feel increasingly reassured that there is no question that one-size-fits-all would be highly inappropriate in the context of ensuring the smaller regulatory bodies are well catered for. We are all in agreement on what we are seeking to do; our contention is that we have achieved it within the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07050830000125"></a>On Amendment No. 433, we would generally expect money owed in respect of the levy to be paid from practising fee income, and Clause 50(4)(b) provides that it can be. I do not want to set out in the  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1331"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1331</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bill that that is the only source of funds that could be used to meet a debt to the board, simply because we do not want to restrict the flexibility of the regulators to meet debt in the way best suited to their own financial arrangements. To do so could force an approved regulator to divert practising fee income away from essential regulatory functions in order to pay the board, when it might judge that it was less damaging to use some other asset or source of income. It is unusual for legislation to restrict the way in which money owed may be recovered and to fetter the court&#146;s ability to enforce payment of debts. We consider that the standard procedures that apply to the recovery of debt should apply in this case. It is a question of allowing flexibility for the regulatory bodies for circumstances we cannot foresee, where it might be in their best interests to provide for that money in other ways than simply using the practising fee. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord will feel he has some shreds of comfort, and will withdraw the amendment.</p>

There would be nothing to prevent the patent and trademark attorneys leaving their societies but, unlike the case of barristers and solicitors, continuing to practise as patent and trademark attorneys. That is likely to happen unless the terms of the amendment are what happens in practice. I accept entirely that the Minister hopes that the practice by the Legal Services Board will be as set out in Amendment No. 433.

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07050830000148"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment attempts to make explicit the relationship between regulatory obligations and other responsibilities, such as commercial concerns and the wishes of shareholders. As I recall, the Minister had considerable sympathy with this principle in Committee. She seemed satisfied that as long as a statutory duty to comply with the professional conduct rules exists, there would be no need for an override provision. But there would be no harm in including this in principle in the Bill; indeed, it would be desirable.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07050830000149"></a>It is almost inevitable that there could at some point be a conflict between the professional conduct rules and the duty to shareholders. An explicit override provision would then become highly desirable, if not entirely necessary. Making this relationship clear from the outset to potential investors in legal service providers would also ease the tension between the effective provision of legal services and pure commercial considerations. I beg to move.</p>

The amendment has particular relevance; indeed, even cogency, in the context of the proposed alternative business structures where direct conflicts might arise between duty to the regulator and duty to shareholders, which is one of the reasons we are so concerned about this development.</p>

Since we discussed this previously, I have consulted the Department of Trade and Industry. My officials have had discussions about the implications of the measure. It is true that ABS companies and the directors will already have a number of statutory duties under company law. Noble Lords could argue that these could potentially conflict but it is our contention that it is for the director concerned to ensure that any action which they take does not breach any of the statutory duties. While the same position applies in respect of directors of ABS firms, the Bill provides further safeguards. Lawyers and ABS firms have a statutory duty at Clause 169 to comply with their professional conduct obligations. In addition, at Clause 88 the Bill prevents any non-lawyers who are shareholders, managers or employees of an alternative business structure firm from acting in a way that causes lawyers to breach their professional conduct rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07050830000152"></a>My contention is very simple&#151;that a new override provision is not necessary. Having consulted, we know that there is a genuine concern that this would create uncertainty, in particular for company law and for other legislation. Noble Lords will not be surprised to hear that we believe that the Bill sets out that statutory duties must be respected and that an override clause could potentially have a detrimental effect on company law. Therefore, we believe that we do not need to accept this amendment and we hope that the noble Lord will withdraw it.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07050830000164"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, noted during Committee, these amendments are both numerous and technical in nature, and I shall therefore resist addressing each one in detail. Their intention is to amend Schedule 16 of the Bill, in turn amending the Solicitors Act 1974, the Administration of Justice Act 1985 and the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which relate to solicitors, recognised bodies and foreign lawyers.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07050830000165"></a>We agree there is a need to update those provisions further to ensure that they are consistent with practice among other legal professions&#151;we seek to make the Solicitors Act 1974 more flexible in order to do so&#151;to remove any anomalous provisions, to facilitate more competitive working practices between business and solicitors and to update legislation so that it reflects advances in current practice.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07050830000166"></a>This is one of a number of large groups of government amendments which make changes to existing legislation under which the legal professional bodies, and principally the Law Society, regulate their members. The amendments are largely inspired by the Law Society, and are intended to enable the society to more effectively regulate the profession. We believe that they achieve what is sought.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07050830000167"></a>In Committee my noble friend Lady Ashton confirmed to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that the Government intended to bring forward these amendments. However, I should draw to the attention of noble Lords that amendments in the next group relating to the Law Society&#146;s powers to rebuke and reprimand, and enhanced regulatory powers in relation to sole practices as well as the power to require information have not, as yet, been tabled by the Government.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07050830000168"></a>We want to make it plain that this is not because the Government do not support the principle, nor that there is anything between the Government and the Law Society in this regard. The reason for not bringing forward these amendments at this stage is simply because the issues are complex, and we need to do further work with the Law Society to ensure that the amendments we bring forward properly deliver the outcome both the Government and the Law Society want.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07050830000169"></a>I know that noble Lords will understand the amount of work that has been involved in bringing forward such a large number of amendments, which for the most part relate to the existing regulatory regime. But I hope that they will agree the value of these amendments and will indulge me in seeking a little more time to ensure that we get the remaining few amendments right.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07050830000170"></a>We will be able bring forward amendments to the Law Society&#146;s power to require information at Third Reading, and I am confident that the Government will be in a position to bring forward amendments in the other two areas at a later stage in the Bill&#146;s passage. However, I hope that noble Lords may take further reassurance from the fact that it would be possible to make these amendments under an order

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07050830000171"></a>The amendment, which responds to one made in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, provides a transitory power to modify the functions of bodies. Should it not prove possible to bring forward amendments during the passage of the Bill, I confirm that the Government would make these amendments a high priority for any Schedule 22 order.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07050830000172"></a>Although this group deals with amendments to Schedule 16, there is a matter under Schedule 17, tabled under a later group, which I would also like to address. We have endeavoured to table an amendment giving the Council for Licensed Conveyancers a power to charge in specific circumstances for carrying out an investigation into allegations made against a licensed conveyancer. That is the only outstanding issue for the council, and one with which we entirely agree. However, there are still some unresolved issues surrounding exactly how that power should be drafted to give effect to such an amendment, but we recognise the desirability of giving the council that power.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07050830000173"></a>As I said earlier in relation to the Law Society&#146;s requested powers, we are trying to see whether it is possible to bring forward an amendment that is mutually agreeable at a later stage in the Bill. However, if that is not possible, such an amendment would again be given a high priority under the list of modifications sought under a Schedule 22 order. I beg to move.</p>

I did not glean sufficient encouragement from what the Minister said to lead me to withdrawn those amendments but if, during the dinner break, which I anticipate is about to happen, the Government can assure me that all the concerns of the Law Society have been covered, I might well be inclined not to move those amendments.</p>

I am particularly looking forward to the maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, whose expertise will contribute greatly to this House.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07050836000004"></a>The education of young people in custody is an issue that troubles me, and I want to share some of my concerns and pose some questions to the Minister. A good touchstone for how we deal with young people is the <I>Every Child Matters</I> agenda, with its outcomes of the right of the child to economic well-being, health, safety, enjoyment, achievement and making a positive contribution. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that the welfare of the child is paramount. The same conditions set out in <I>Every Child Matters</I> and the UNCRC should apply to children in custody but often do not. I know that those young people have sometimes done terrible things; I am not saying that there should not be punishment. But for many young people, punishment simply does not work; punishment is just more of the same. Some 80 per cent of those leaving custody reoffend. Many of those young people have suffered cruelty, abuse, deprivation, lack of stimulus and rejection, and they are left with no aspirations. They are damaged children, and it does not help society or them to impose further damage. This morning, I spoke with the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England, who expressed his disquiet at the criminalisation of children. He told me that Canada has achieved a reduction of 60 per cent of children in custody since 2003 and a 6 per cent decrease in youth crime. Maybe we should look for examples of good practice further afield.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07050836000005"></a>The education that these children need is not just about literacy and numeracy, important though they are, but about social skills, health education and skills for life, including the ability to get a job or further education. We need to be visionary about this. Of course, custody should be the last resort but, once in custody, gaining education and skills is important. I welcome the first edition of the National Children&#146;s Bureau <I>Healthier Inside</I> magazine, which gives news and examples of good practice taking place across secure settings and themed around <I>Every Child Matters</I>. I highly recommend it to your Lordships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07050836000006"></a>The Learning and Skills Council, which has responsibility for education provision in young offender institutions, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_173"></a><a name="07050836000033"></a>&#147;The majority of 15 year olds in juvenile establishments have had little or no formal education or training. As well as low levels of basic skills, many of them will have particular learning difficulties that need additional support&#148;.</p>

<a name="70508-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07050836000007"></a>I have a few statistics. The Youth Justice Board reports that around 150,000 children and young people under the age of 18 enter the youth justice system each year, and about 70,000 of those are of compulsory school age. About half are underachievers, a third need help with literacy and numeracy, and 15 per cent have a special educational needs statement, in comparison to 3 per cent of the general population. Some 60 per cent have difficulties with communication, 83 per cent of boys had been excluded from school and 41 per cent were aged 14 or under when they were last in school. That set of facts presents a challenge for any

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07050836000008"></a>The Youth Justice Board has prioritised the provision of education and training, health and mental healthcare and support in finding accommodation after release from custody. But the way in which the secure regime works makes it difficult to provide consistent and relevant education. Sentences tend to be short&#151;on average four months&#151;and transfers between institutions are frequent. It appears that educational establishments are reluctant to admit young people who have recently served a custodial sentence. Indeed, Section 562 of the Education Act 1996 exempts local education authorities from having to provide education to children who are detained under a court order. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has expressed particular concern about the lack of a statutory right to education for young people in custody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07050836000009"></a>The DfES has identified many of the problems through responses to its consultation paper <I>Reducing Re-offending through Skills and Employment</I>. Those problems include negative experiences of learning; lack of continuity between school and offender provision; exclusion from school; transfer between agencies, which disrupts learning; the need for records of achievement; and the need for vocational options.

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07050836000010"></a>A recent Youth Justice Board report published research findings on the barriers faced by young people in the youth justice system when trying to access education, training and employment. The issues identified included low attainment, detachment from school&#151;sometimes due to bullying&#151;pupil/teacher relations, size of class, and disruption of education by being in custody. Youth justice practitioners see complex rules on benefits and allowances, lack of continuity of education between custody and the community, lack of support for special educational needs, and inability to access education because of being in the youth justice system. Strategic barriers included educationalists&#146; lack of knowledge of the youth justice system, confused responsibilities and lines of accountability&#151;such as whether the YOT worker, the school, college or Connexions adviser is responsible for the young person&#151;and so on.</p>

An educational plan should be tailored to individual young offenders and should follow the young person. Resettlement planning should have a specific education and training element, agreed with all partners. What joint work is there on young offenders between the Minister&#146;s department and other relevant government departments, particularly those with some responsibility for offender management and communities? Partnership and collaboration is essential at both government and local level to secure a better future for young offenders and for society.

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07050836000015"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, for giving me the chance to talk on this subject, albeit briefly. I will address a couple of points. One is the curriculum in custody. It currently appears to be very much at the LSC&#146;s level of thinking&#151;courses designed basically for people out there in the community. For a lot of these kids, we need to reach much deeper. We must get right back to the level of socialisation&#151;equipping them with the underlying human skills necessary to tackle life and education. We should start by creating a structure where they can develop a trusting relationship with staff. A lot of these children do not have any experience of that kind of relationship or, if they have, it has broken down. Once that is in place, we should work from there to offer a real experience of teamwork, getting on with people, giving and taking orders, and learning how to exist in relationships.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07050836000016"></a>If kids are only in for four months, that sort of thing might be achieved in that timescale. We must focus everything on that set of achievements. We must do away with things like 24-hour in-cell TV, which is immensely disruptive of any attempt to build relationships. Kids just hide themselves away in their cells, and do not need to engage with the outside. We must really concentrate on having a proper PSHE programme. You cannot learn anything unless you know the basics of PSHE; I do not mean the condom-on-a-banana sort of PSHE, but the kind of programme that is really well developed in schools such as Wellington and others which are really taking this forward. We

Once a kid is becoming socialised, you want to reintroduce them to education. That requires giving them a hook&#151;something that they can hang on to as a real motivation to get involved in education. Whether it be art, music or practical work, that must be the emphasis, and not some precipitate rush back into the academic curriculum which these kids have rejected, or which has rejected them.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07050836000017"></a>We can do a lot more to make these institutions educational institutions. We want to see the teachers in these places having a real career structure, with training at the bottom. I know that the Government want to see proper training, but it must be prison-specific. Teachers need to learn how to deal with extremely manipulative young men. They need to learn prison craft and how to build relationships in a way which is just not necessary for teachers outside; they are required to give that sort of one-on-one support. They need a career structure which leads upwards. It ought to be possible. I cannot see why a teacher should not aspire to become the number one governor of a YOI. That would give education a real status within the Prison Service. These institutions ought to have much better links with pupil referral units and the other educational institutions outside, which these children will be going on to. I see no reason why that should not be possible. Teachers run boarding schools. There is not an awful lot of difference.</p>

I will concentrate my remarks on the education of juveniles&#151;offenders aged 18 or under&#151;in young offender institutions.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07050836000019"></a>Education is crucial to the prospects of diverting young people from crime on release. Most young offenders in custody have been permanently excluded or have persistently truanted from school. A third of those entering custody have had no education at all in the previous six months. Youth Justice Board studies have shown that, when they are released, educational underachievement is one of the strongest factors associated with reoffending.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07050836000020"></a>The Government deserve some credit. Provision for the education of juveniles in custody has improved considerably since the establishment of the Youth Justice Board and the resulting injection of greater resources into custodial regimes for this age group, but there are some serious problems. All too often, juveniles in custody do not receive the minimum amount of education prescribed by the Youth Justice Board. The YJB requires a minimum of 25 hours in young offender institutions, and that this should be achieved for 90 per cent of young people. Against that, the reality is that 40 per cent of juveniles in young offender institutions were receiving less than 20 hours of education a week. At two establishments, over half the young people were receiving less than 15 hours. There is a gap between what is required and what really happens.</p>

<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1342"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1342</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to comprise basic skills education, one-third academic or vocational subjects, and one-third physical education, arts, IT and personal, social and health education. What is the reality? The range of vocational courses in many young offender institutions is far too narrow, restricting young people&#146;s ability to gain skills that will help them to gain employment or enter further training on release.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07050836000022"></a>What are the difficulties? The first is attracting teachers to work in young offender institutions and retaining them. Secondly, because education must be delivered for 50 weeks a year in custody, teachers do not benefit from school holidays in the same way as teachers in the community. Thirdly, the statutory probation year for a newly qualified teacher cannot be completed by working in custody, so staff often leave to complete the year in mainstream education and do not return. Fourthly, many do not feel that they are valued or rewarded for working with particularly difficult young people. Finally, there is no clear career structure comparable to the mainstream education system.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07050836000023"></a>For the short period which most young offenders spend in custody, 92 per cent of juveniles sentenced receive detention and training orders. These range from four months to two years, of which half is spent in custody and the other half under post-release supervision. Many young people are in custody for a few weeks or months, which makes it difficult for them to complete externally organised qualifications.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07050836000024"></a>How do we alleviate the problem? There is a need for streamlined arrangements so that young offenders may continue their education on release. However, we can expect that, even where young people have made educational progress, it will often break down quickly when they leave custody. A recent audit for the Youth Justice Board found that over half of young offenders had no arrangements for education, training or employment a month after being released. Only 6 per cent of youth offending teams said that young people were able to continue the education and training received in custody after release. In 2004-05, under 60 per cent of young people being supervised by youth offending teams following release were in suitable full-time education, training or employment. This compares with 74 per cent of all those supervised by youth offending teams now. There are many important aspects but time is short. I will pass my further notes to the Minister so that he can adequately deal with the questions that I wish to raise.</p>

The Portman Group&#146;s then charitable arm, the Drinkaware Trust, funded a project at Winchester prison where alcohol education sessions were run by the charity Alcohol Concern. The Drinkaware Trust is now wholly independent from the Portman Group, and is still funded by the industry but not controlled by it, which is the right arrangement and I was very pleased to have been associated with that development.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07050836000027"></a>Young people in custody need a better understanding of how alcohol affects their behaviour, because it could help to prevent them reoffending. We do not know how many young people are in custody because of alcohol-related offences. It is reasonable to assume that many of them would not be there if they had not committed offences while under the influence. The youth lifestyles survey found a strong relationship between drunkenness and offending, albeit not a causal one. A much higher proportion of offenders aged 12 to 17 were found to be frequent drinkers than non-offenders.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07050836000028"></a>Alcohol-related crime costs this country &#163;7.3 billion a year. If alcohol education could help reduce the level of reoffending, those costs would begin to come down. The second reason why these young people need alcohol education, whatever their offence, is that they are likely to have missed out on it at school. It is part of the national curriculum. However, as we have already heard, one survey found that 83 per cent of boys in youth offender institutions had been excluded from school.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07050836000029"></a>Alcohol education is not by itself a magic solution, but it can play a vital part in helping to inform and motivate personal responsibility. The Drinkaware Trust publishes an excellent resource called <I>Streetwise</I>, and I understand that tentative discussions are under way to adapt it for a youth offender audience. I encourage the Department for Education and Skills to get involved in this project.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07050836000030"></a>My final point is that interventions on alcohol need to be specifically identified, with dedicated resources. A survey in Winchester prison revealed that although 49 per cent said that they would like to make use of an alcohol counselling service, amazingly 37 per cent of that group were not eligible for it because they did not also have a drug problem. Alcohol misuse alone did not qualify for help. Similarly, in the school curriculum there is sometimes a tendency in PSHE lessons to concentrate on illegal drugs and forget about alcohol. &#147;Substance misuse&#148; is often interpreted as meaning drugs not including alcohol.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07050836000031"></a>The pendulum should not swing the other way and give alcohol undue prominence or blame. Alcohol is legal, drinking is normal and in moderation can even be beneficial. But young people in custody are more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds, including those with alcohol problems. Like over 90 per cent of adults in this country, they too will

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07050836000032"></a>The average time that a young person remains in custody is four months. That is surely enough time for them to benefit from some alcohol education. I hope that the review by the Department for Education and Skills will take this issue on board.</p>

It was refreshingly direct and well informed. I am sure that it augurs well for her contributions in the future. I am just sorry that she only had four minutes; I would have liked to listen to her for longer. Her wider experience in corporate responsibility and self-regulation are badly needed in much of our deliberations. We look forward to all that she will have to say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07050841000002"></a>My noble friend Lady Massey of Darwen is also to be warmly thanked for giving us the opportunity for even a brief word on this important subject. She was right to emphasise that many in young offender institutions have been failed by society and we must face that reality. The reasons that they have been failed are complex; there is a matrix. There are many things to be tackled in society itself. The challenge is to have fewer people falling into crime rather than discussing how we help those who have fallen.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07050841000003"></a>In the midst of all that we must never forget the issue of mental illness which is a highly relevant but very difficult issue. Many people in young offender institutions and prisons should not be there at all because they need more specialist support, analysis and help from professionals than can possibly be provided by dedicated staff in the institutions which basically provide custody.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07050841000004"></a>Rehabilitation, as I never tire of saying in these debates, must be the top priority in our penal system. Not to have rehabilitation as the top priority is madness: it fails the young; it fails the prisoners; it leads to more wasted, and continued wasted, lives; it is economic nonsense because of the cost of reoffending later. If we are to make rehabilitation the key priority and mean it, education is central to that; and if education is to be central, it must be not only formal education, certainly, but also skills education and wider social education, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, sensibly argued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07050841000005"></a>I was president of the YMCA in England. The YMCA works with young offenders in young offender institutions. I was fascinated by that work. It brought home to me how serious the lack of education is among many of those who end up in this situation. It also brought home how much could be done. With education we have the living evidence&#151;people who have gone on to make a success of their lives. Indeed, they have gone on to become university graduates and postgraduates, having been given the opportunity to release their talent and put it to good use.</p>

He will forgive me for making this point, but I never understood why in the last Act we did not endorse that principle. Our approach to young offenders has seen far too much emphasis put on punitive attitudes and policy. The challenge is to rebuild with the young people themselves their lives and to turn those young people into positive citizens. If we want to do that, resources are essential.</p>

<p><a name="07050841000028"></a>I should like to concentrate on how we educate young people in custody about relationships. Those young people have often never had the experience of being cared for. It is hard to follow the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, on this, but I shall try.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07050841000008"></a>Academic and vocational attainments are vital, as we have heard, but the other side of the coin is a young person&#146;s social education, or what the continentals contain in their discipline of pedagogy&#151;education in the widest sense. Custody officers need to model good relationships to their young offenders, as the Carlile report emphasised. While most sentences are brief, many young people will return on several occasions. Each time, their relationship with their personal officer and the wider officer community should be an educative experience. That is one reason why improvements in training and continual professional development for custody officers are so essential, as we have heard. To be consistent models and to effectively engage, officers need a theoretical foundation for their work, appropriate supervision, and consultation with expert practitioners and mental health professionals. The same should go for teachers working in these environments. Officer retention and stability in the workforce must be aimed for.</p>

<a name="70508-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07050841000009"></a>A separate point is that, with the recognition of the need for the secure estate, probation, social services, the health service and youth offending teams to work together to achieve reductions in reoffending, Her Majesty&#146;s Government should accelerate their programme of workforce development in the secure estate. That young people leaving custody too often walk off the face of a cliff serves no one&#146;s interests. Professional partnership requires parity of professional status.</p>

I recognise the important achievements of the Government in investment and staff development, but it is vital to go far further in developing officers and residential care workers. The personal officer/worker role must be thoroughly embedded and developed, but too many inspections point to its neglect. If we wish to prevent reoffending and break the cycle of low-achieving families, more attention needs to be paid to the social education of young offenders. Personal officers should be consistent, should take an interest in the welfare and progress of their young offenders and should keep their undertakings. They need to be trained and supported to do so. That is how the young men and women may have their first experience of a positive parental figure and how they may begin to learn how they might be consistent towards, take an interest in and keep their undertakings to their children. We need to stand up for, so to speak, bastards&#151;children in whom parents have not invested themselves. Otherwise we should not say,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07050841000013"></a>In my short contribution, I want to pay tribute to the teachers who teach young offenders in custody. It is not easy for any worker to work in a prison and for teachers there is a need for special patience and expertise. The 2004 report by the Esm&#233;e Fairbairn Foundation, <I>Rethinking Crime &amp; Punishment</I>, contains a fascinating quotation from the <I>Times</I> of 1867. It asks the question:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_175"></a><a name="07050841000032"></a>&#147;Which is best, to pay for the policeman or the schoolmaster&#151;the prison or the school?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050841000030"></a>Although I value our police force tremendously, in the context of this debate I would opt for the schoolteacher. As long as young offenders are in custody, we as a society have a major responsibility to provide the right education for them. For this, we need the expertise and specialisms of dedicated teaching staff. There can surely be no better dedication than to want to help children who are, for whatever reason, serving a custodial sentence.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="07050841000014"></a>I first became interested in this specialist teaching when a relative of mine left teaching in a school in Essex to teach young offenders in a nearby young persons unit. It was a bold step and she had to learn quickly about what often already damaged children were capable of and what their complex requirements were. Despite some traumas in the beginning, she ultimately found her experience both satisfying and rewarding. Some of her pupils on leaving the establishment in which she taught kept in touch with her. Some reoffended, but others did not. She took a certain satisfaction in hoping that she had helped them when they most needed it.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1347"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07050841000015"></a>To find out the situation facing teachers working in custodial establishments today, I spoke to members of the National Union of Teachers who work in this area. They made two key points. First, the main aim of teachers working in secure education establishments is to ensure that they play a major role in the pupil&#146;s overall progress. They want to be a key part of the throughcare that is provided by all the professionals working together. They want to ensure that they have a place in the investment and commitment that enable the young people to become stronger and less insecure, to function socially and to catch up academically. I know that your Lordships will agree that this is a worthy aim and I know that the Minister will do all that he can to help them to achieve it.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07050841000016"></a>The second issue is the age of teachers working in custodial care. At present, 70 per cent of the NUT teachers working in this area are between 40 and 60 and a further 11 per cent are over 60. Younger teachers are not considering working in the secure units or the local authority children&#146;s homes. Those already teaching there are rightly worried that their younger counterparts are not joining them. One of the main reasons appears to be that there is no career structure for those who choose to educate young people in custody, as the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, outlined. My noble friend the Minister may wish to consider this problem.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07050841000017"></a>Providing sound education must be one of the better ways in which we as a society can help in preventing reoffending. To teach young offenders takes special, caring, talented and motivated individuals, and we should pay tribute to them.</p>

In that spirit, I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, for sending those taking part in this debate a copy of the consultation document, which I had not seen before. I read it with a sense of d&#233;j -vu, because, 10 years ago, as Chief Inspector of Prisons, I started taking Ofsted with me into young offender establishments, writing reports giving all the details that I recognise here and making a whole stream of recommendations about what should happen. I find it rather galling that, 10 years later, we are saying exactly the same thing again.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07050841000019"></a>The advantage of these short debates is that people have to concentrate on one subject. I hope that the aggregation of the separate subjects will add up to fuel and ammunition for the Minister to cope with and take forward. I shall concentrate on one specific issue. While this report rightly concentrates on the delivery of education and what should be there, it has to be based on assessment. As the report itself says, assessment is one of the weakest aspects in what has happened so far because it is patchy. There is not enough information about a young person&#146;s learning progress and personal educational needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07050841000020"></a>As I have said in the House before, the only time that I discovered in any prison someone who was able to reach 100 per cent of all young offenders was when I was introduced in a young offender establishment, in Polmont, to a speech and language therapist. The governor said to me that if he had to get rid of all his staff, the last one out of the gate would be that therapist. When I asked why, he explained that she was able to unlock all the needs of all the young offenders&#151;in education, healthcare, behaviour and discipline&#151;because she enabled them to communicate. Only through that communication could they tell the people what was actually required. Importantly, this communication helped them to build the relationships that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and my noble friend Lord Listowel have mentioned as being so critical here.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07050841000021"></a>I have mentioned this many times before in this House and in reports as Chief Inspector of Prisons from 2000 onwards. Lady Helen Hamlyn funded speech and language therapists in two young offender establishments for two years and it was academically evaluated by a professor from the University of Surrey. The evaluation proved conclusively that these therapists were essential to the proper understanding of what these young people needed so that resources could be deployed to best effect. Still nothing has happened. Why? Apparently primary care trusts are responsible for speech and language therapists and they have to come in health plans. The Department for Education and Skills says that it is not up to it even though communication skills are essential. The Home Office consistently refuses to fund assessment. The Minister for Social Exclusion, to whom I have spoken about this, says that nothing is more socially exclusive than the failure to communicate and that communication is the scourge of the 21st century.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07050841000022"></a>Tomorrow sees the launch of a new Ministry which did not appear in the list talked about in the House: the Ministry of Justice. Could I hope that, on day one, the Ministry of Justice will realise that for several years what everyone knows is essential for so many of our young people has been denied, and get these therapists in to assess what can be done to make certain that young people who end up in custody get the education and the other things that they so badly need?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="07050841000024"></a>I think that all noble Lords who have spoken are agreed that one of the major factors that can be used to keep young people out of trouble is a good education. As we have heard, another major factor that young offenders have in common is their poor level of educational attainment. Many noble Lords have given us the horrifying statistics about attainment, and my noble friend Lord Dholakia has given us the horrible reality of education in prison. These are not the easiest of pupils to educate, as the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson of Market Rasen, emphasised. Many of them are in poor health due to  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1349"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1349</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a bad diet, smoking, drug and/or alcohol abuse. In her notable maiden speech, the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, emphasised the point about alcohol. I believe that one of the prerequisites for addressing their education is addressing their health first, with nutritious foods, sensible exercise, drug or alcohol rehab and speech therapy where necessary. If the diet and health of ordinary children in school is the concern of educationalists, which it is, how much more attention needs to be paid to those matters when dealing with young offenders?</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="07050841000025"></a>Another problem facing those who try to raise the educational and skills level of young offenders is their inability to concentrate for long. These are young people who have not been used to working hard at intellectual tasks; they need to learn to listen, speak and express their feelings just like a young child does. As the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, speech therapy is one of the things that these young people desperately need. The inability to express oneself leads to frustration and anger which often manifests itself in antisocial behaviour or criminality.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="07050841000026"></a>I have read the Next Steps document that follows on from <I>Reducing Reoffending Through Skills and Employment</I>. It contains much that is good and desirable. However, I detect a failing which I find rather concerning. Naturally, there is an emphasis on basic skills, which is right and understandable because no one can progress to other qualifications without basic literacy and numeracy. However, beyond that, I detect an emphasis entirely on skills which I believe is wrong. Of course the country needs a skilled workforce, and we have heard about the high percentage of jobs in the future that need skills. However, there is a tendency to assume that young offenders are fit for nothing but skilled labour. In fact, many young offenders are very bright with high IQs. They have been bored at school because the curriculum did not challenge or inspire them; so being bright and curious, they got into trouble. If only these young people could be inspired and challenged by a curriculum that met their needs in a learning environment that took account of their disadvantaged backgrounds, what might they achieve, not just in the direction of skills but, for some, academically?</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="07050841000027"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, said, many of these young people lack the social skills needed to work in groups. Many of them are emotionally very immature and have no idea how to resolve conflict by discussion and persuasion. In fact, many have been &#147;persuaded&#148; to do what their parents wanted through violent beatings, so they see violence as normal. Their backgrounds were not as enriched as those lucky cared-for children who were surrounded by books and toys from which they could learn, taken on trips to places of interest and had sports coaching and music lessons&#151;the sorts of things that enrich all of our lives. In the short time allowed by the majority of sentences served by young offenders, it is impossible to address these problems. That is why, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, rapid diagnosis of need is essential, as is an action plan which can be commenced in custody and followed through in the community, at college and other places, after release.</p>

I also thank the Minister for sending copies of the Green Paper.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07050840000003"></a>The debate has been marked by expert contributions and graced by the impressive maiden speech from the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins. There is no doubt that reoffending rates are increased by the insufficient provision of education and skills training for young people in custody. Although 46 per cent of the 150,000 children and young people under the age of 18 who enter the youth justice system each year are of compulsory school age, the average number of hours of education undertaken by prisoners held in young offender institutions is only 7.6 hours per prisoner per week.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07050840000004"></a>We are not talking about well adjusted children in classes with other well adjusted children, who would probably make the most of a meagre 7.6 hours per week of teaching. When we talk about young people and children in custody, we are talking about some of the most disadvantaged in the country&#151;the damaged children of whom the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, spoke so powerfully. Eighty-five per cent of them have mental health problems. More than half of them are addicted to drugs and alcohol. Half have spent time in care or under the supervision of social services and many have special educational needs. That is a bleak scene and I ask the Minister whether he considers that an acceptable level of educational provision for those children.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07050840000005"></a>It is devastating that nine out of 10 juvenile offenders on the intensive supervision and surveillance programme are re-offenders. That can be due in no small part to the disruption caused to education in custody by custodial transfers. I was struck by the words of Ann Creighton of the Prisoners&#146; Education Trust, who said:</p>
<ul><a name="07050840000357"></a>&#147;what&#146;s really needed is a scheme where prisoners are not transferred at all while they are on courses. This is critical but no one is grasping that nettle&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70508-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07050840000006"></a>It is surprising that the Government have so far failed to implement their recommendation that there should be an electronic transfer of individual learning records. That would at least ensure continuity. In the interests of future planning, can the Minister inform us how many young offenders of compulsory school age are transferred each year?</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07050840000007"></a>One of the pleasures of my enforced rest during the past three weeks has been watching daytime television. Last week, I was moved by an interview with Mark Johnson. Mark is a drug addict who has been in prison and lived rough on the streets. His history is heart-rending and heart-warming. With the help of the Prince&#146;s Trust and great inner strength, he has turned his life around and is now helping others. He has written a book. But for every Mark Johnson, there are countless others who slip through the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07050840000008"></a>The education of young people in custody is an essential component of their rehabilitation. It is vital to the prevention of re-offending. The provision of

That can only be good for them and for the whole of society.</p>

I also say how grateful we are to my noble friend Lady Massey for securing the debate on education for young people in custody and for introducing it with her customary insight and legitimate concern. We were especially glad to hear the impressive maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins. She brings to the House great expertise&#151;in particular, on alcohol abuse and education&#151;and we look forward to her future participation in our debates.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07050840000010"></a>I begin by stating unequivocally that custody should always be a last resort for children and young people. The criminal justice system is intended to do all that it can to keep young people from custody whenever there is a viable alternative.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="07050840000011"></a>The best antidote to youth crime is, of course, a caring family home and a good education. Better family support and better schools are at the heart of government policy. Sure Start children&#146;s centres have steadily increased the support available for disadvantaged families, assisting parents with children in their early education, and we have recently announced a &#163;30 million grant to create a new National Academy for Parenting Practitioners.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="07050840000012"></a>Extended schools are offering a broader range of services, including after-school provision for older children. A new and better relationship is being built up between crime prevention agencies and schools. Safer Schools Partnerships, for example, place specially trained police officers in schools in areas of high crime to promote respect, responsibility and a safer learning environment. I have visited many such schools and have been very impressed with the work and the warm welcome that the schools give to those specially trained police officers. Evaluations show that those partnerships have had a beneficial impact, improving behaviour and attendance and building a better understanding about the role of the police and better links between the police and community. Since January, local authorities have been required to provide positive activities for young people, including those at risk of social exclusion, throughout the school year.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="07050840000013"></a>In terms of criminal justice, the police and the courts deal with approximately 150,000 young people each year, of which only 3 to 4 per cent receive a custodial sentence lasting an average of four months. It is the Government&#146;s duty to ensure that young offender institutions provide appropriate support to meet these young people&#146;s needs, which are often  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1352"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1352</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>complex, as my noble friend Lord Judd rightly emphasised. Up to 40 per cent of young people entering custody have mental health problems; more than 80 per cent have tried drugs and are likely to bear the effects of substance misuse; alcohol misuse is common and a high proportion have special educational needs, which are often unidentified.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07050840000014"></a>Education plays a critical role in both rehabilitation and reducing re-offending, not least by making young offenders employable after release. Our aim is to give young people the practical and social skills to pursue crime-free lives at the end of their sentences. Yet, unsurprisingly, many in custody have had poor experiences of school. Young offenders are 20 times more likely to be regular truants than the general school-age population&#151;hence often the failure to diagnose and address special educational needs. Forty-two per cent of young offenders underachieve in school; most lacking basic literacy and numeracy skills.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07050840000015"></a>When we created the Youth Justice Board in 1998, one of its main aims was to ensure that young offenders receive a good education in custody. The same aim underpinned our decision to transfer responsibility for offender education from the Home Office to the DfES in 2001 and our subsequent decisions dramatically to increase both spending and minimum standards. I am glad to tell the House that the current chairman of the Youth Justice Board, Graham Robb, is a former head teacher and passionately committed to improving education for young offenders.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07050840000016"></a>I was glad to hear the positive comments of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, about the YJB&#146;s work. Although I fully accept that, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has said, much remains to be done. However, I think that he would accept that the position is better than when he was writing his powerful reports a decade ago.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07050840000017"></a>Since the creation of the Youth Justice Board, we have seen significant improvements in educational provision. During 2005-06, the 17 young offender institutions delivered an average of 28.2 hours of education, training and personal development activity per individual per week. That is a fourfold increase compared to 2002. In the 15 secure children&#146;s homes and the four secure training centres, the percentage of young people receiving 30 hours or more education and training was 79.9 per centand 99.4 per centrespectively.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07050840000018"></a>Government spending on young offender custodial education&#151;in my experience, spending is always the prime indicator of whether a Government are committed to something or not&#151;rose from &#163;5 million to &#163;20 million, a fourfold increase between 2002 and 2005, which has meant that more institutions can employ far more teachers. I echo the tribute that my noble friend Lady Gibson paid to the work of teachers in young offender institutions. That also means that they can employ more learning support assistants and arrange additional specialist services for young people under their care.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07050840000019"></a>From 31 July last year, all young offender institutions became part of the new Offender Learning and Skills Service, whereby their education and training programmes  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1353"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1353</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are planned and funded by the Learning and Skills Council. This is creating a more co-ordinated and consistent service and represents an important first step towards integrating offender learning with mainstream education and skills training, which&#151;and I say this in reply to my noble friend Lord Judd&#151;is my department&#146;s guiding principle for action in this area. Although I accept that he wishes that we had been able to go further in the recent Learning and Skills Act.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07050840000020"></a>One of the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s duties is to monitor the qualifications achieved by all young offenders. In 2005-06, 42.5 per cent of those in young offender institutions improved by one skill level in literacy and numeracy. The fact that we now have this kind of data responds to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. There is far better tracking of individual offenders than used to be the case. Given the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s more recent involvement in this area, we would hope to see this figure rise in the next set of results and to see much better and consistent tracking of individual young people.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07050840000021"></a>From 2007-08, we have also improved access to education maintenance allowances for young people in custody. With immediate effect, young people can apply for EMAs while in custody, without the need to submit evidence of financial income. That means that they will receive the EMA when they enrol on a valid learning programme. Such measures are simplifying the application process for offenders and are a vital incentive to engage in education or training immediately upon release. Another step we are taking is to review the local authority funding formula for Connexions services aimed at young people in custody, to help ease their transition back into community life. So we are making progress.</p>

<a name="70508-0014.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07050840000022"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, asked if we are satisfied with the status quo. I can tell her absolutely straightforwardly that we are not. We believe that much more needs to be done, while accepting that transforming the prospects of young offenders is extremely difficult, not least when, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, so rightly noted, some have serious behavioural problems, refuse to attend classes, or are distracted by other worries. Our concern is systematically to raise the availability and quality of provision, to reduce variations in the quality of teaching and support between institutions, and to gain a more accurate picture of performance in each as a spur to further improvements.</p>

There is now an inter-ministerial group on reducing reoffending, including representation from the Department for Communities and Local Government.

Many local authorities had, in fact, already set their own targets. Kensington and Chelsea, for example, is focusing on the percentage of 16 to 18 year-olds leaving custody who then participate in full-time education, training or employment. We would like more local authorities to follow that lead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="07050840000024"></a>We are now in the middle of a public consultation on the Next Steps document, which runs until 4 July. It covers all young people in England aged between 10 and 17 who are supervised by the youth justice system, both in custody and in the community, with a particular focus on offenders of compulsory school age. It includes consideration of all three types of secure establishment: young offender institutions, secure training centres, and secure children&#146;s homes. Responses to our consultation will play a key role in how we prioritise the issues and develop policy, and the Government are encouraged by the input from many working in the youth justice and voluntary sectors. In reply to the direct question asked by my noble friend Lady Massey, I can tell her that we are committed to publishing further plans by the end of this year in response to that consultation.</p>

<a name="70508-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07050840000025"></a>I shall briefly highlight four key areas covered by the Next Steps document, which are of direct relevance to today&#146;s debate. First, we are exploring ways of ensuring that custodial regimes are organised to best promote participation in education. For some young people, the structured environment of a custodial institution is conducive to education. For others with poor memories of school, however, other incentives are needed to engage them in learning. In particular, we recognise the high incidence of special educational needs among young offenders. Issues under consideration include the prompt sharing of information from existing SEN statements, and ensuring that the additional support identified in those statements is provided in youth custody.</p>

<a name="70508-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="07050840000026"></a>Secondly, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, rightly highlighted, we need a curriculum that is well suited to the needs of young offenders. Programmes should make teaching basic literacy and numeracy a priority, but they must also go on to equip young people with wider skills&#151;including PSHE, social skills, and relationship skills, which the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, mentioned&#151;which young people need both to apply for jobs and to become better citizens when they leave their custodial settings. This means identifying the means to provide consistent learning programmes across the secure estate, as transfers between establishments are sometimes unavoidable, and spanning the period before and after custody. It also requires the recognition that many young offenders in custody do not respond well to a traditional classroom environment. We are therefore considering how the current reforms to the 14-to-19 curriculum, including the introduction of new vocational diplomas, can be applied to young offenders. The transition from custody back to community is an especially critical point for young people. The supervision and support provided in custody must

This requires planning for education, training or employment early in a young person&#146;s sentence.</p>

<a name="70508-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="07050840000027"></a>The third area to highlight is workforce development, rightly mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and my noble friend Lady Gibson. A set of questions and points were raised in the contributions and I will respond to them in writing. Suffice it to say that we recognise the need for considerably greater attention to workforce development in this area.</p>

<a name="70508-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07050840000028"></a>The fourth area that we are examining is the accountability framework for custodial education. During the Committee stage of the Education and Inspections Bill, some noble Lords argued that local authorities should have greater responsibility in this area; we are looking at this issue.</p>

<a name="70508-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="07050840000029"></a>I hope I have been able to demonstrate the extreme seriousness with which we and the Youth Justice Board take this issue. When we say &#147;every child matters&#148;, that includes every child in custody. We will continue to improve the educational welfare of young offenders. We are very grateful for all the comments made in today&#146;s debate; I hope that they will help us to forge better policy in this area.</p>

I have now tabled these amendments which seek to address his concern by ensuring that the Bill acknowledges and defines the term &#147;barrister&#148;, creates a new offence of pretending to be a barrister when not qualified, and recognises the extremely important and valuable role played by the Inns of Court in training barristers.</p>

<a name="70508-0018.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="07050845000003"></a>The Inns&#146; role in calling and disbarring barristers is currently recognised in statute under Section 31 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 in respect of rights of audience. However, as a result of the changes to the way in which reserved legal activities will be granted in the future, it has been necessary to repeal that section. These amendments seek to address any imbalance caused and ensure that the public, consumers and members of the profession can be confident that any person using the title &#147;barrister&#148; has been properly educated and trained, and that they are appropriately regulated.</p>

<a name="70508-0018.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="07050845000004"></a>The offence provision is important as it brings parity with offences in respect of solicitors under Section 21 of the Solicitors Act 1974, so consumers can be confident that the same rules apply for both recognised professions. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will feel that I have reflected his concerns appropriately in this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

These are minor and consequential amendments that address a number of anomalies which have arisen as a result of amendments to the Administration of Justice Act 1985 and the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. For example, we have brought forward amendments to remove references to &#147;complaints&#148; in both Acts, avoiding confusion with Part 6 of the Bill. We have also discussed with the Council for Licensed Conveyancers the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in Committee. These amendments give the council additional powers to allow it to delegate its functions further, to directly reprimand a recognised body and to remove the requirement for an accountant&#146;s report to be prepared by a person qualified as company auditor under the Companies Act 1989 in favour of allowing those accounts to be audited by an accountant. We are persuaded that these powers are necessary to ensure that the council can effectively and efficiently discharge its regulatory functions, so this group of amendments also covers those matters.

Many of the bodies&#146; employees are former local authority housing officers who on transferring to the new housing management bodies lost the ability to exercise their rights of appeal as local authority employees. I know from our discussions with stakeholders that some concerns about the supervision of those employees and to whom they will be accountable if something goes wrong when they are exercising those rights have been raised. There are safeguards that will address those concerns. The right of audience and rights to conduct litigation will be exercisable only by employees of housing management bodies that have an agreement with a local housing authority under Section 27 of the Housing Act 1985. Those agreements regulate the activities of the housing management bodies and state what they can and cannot do on behalf of the local authority and must be approved by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.</p>

There is a concern that those rights are to be granted without such housing officers being subject to any regulation or training requirements. They will be the only group authorised to deal with complex litigation that is not required to comply with the regulatory scheme. Where a solicitor behaves in breach of his or her obligation to the court he or she can be disciplined or even struck off. There will be no mechanism for stripping housing officers of those rights save for persuading their employer to withdraw the written authorisation.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a><a name="07050845000040"></a>We would support in principle housing officers having rights of audience in that area, provided that they are subject to a regulatory regime with sufficient teeth to ensure that proper standards of administration are maintained. It is essential that those who conduct litigation and have rights of audience are under an obligation, for example, not to mislead the court, and that they understand their other duties to the court, such as the full disclosure of relevant documents. That is particularly important because, in many of the proceedings that housing officers will be conducting, applications will be included without notice where the opponent is not present.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a><a name="07050845000041"></a>The proceedings for which housing officers will have these rights include proceedings seeking injunctions, where a power of arrest can be attached to the injunction. In addition, possession orders could be made evicting tenants on a without-notice basis in serious cases. We believe that the public have a right to expect those representing landlords in such cases to be properly qualified and regulated.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="07050845000042"></a>Local authority employees may appear, though they cannot conduct litigation, in possession and other minor cases. The right to appear before the court is exercised by local authority officers under the supervision of local authority legal departments. We support in principle housing officers employed by management organisations being given the right to appear in similar routine cases, provided that the issues related to legal supervision can be resolved.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="07050845000043"></a>This government amendment appeared without warning after Committee was concluded. There has been no consultation with either the Law Society or the Bar Council on the subject. I am unaware whether or not there has been any consultation with the judiciary. Many of the matters covered by the amendment are serious cases where eviction is a possibility and where the facts may be hotly disputed. It is therefore vital that the advocates should be professionals, with the duties to the court that that implies.</p>

As my noble friend has pointed out, the restrictions on those rights serve an important public purpose; namely, that those who carry out the functions are properly trained and are subject to appropriate professional duties. It may well be that there has been some good reason for this new clause appearing at this very late stage without proper consultation. If there is, we look forward to hearing it.</p>

The issue raised with the amendment is that we now have a new system where we have people and arm&#146;s-length organisations who need to be able to have the rights we have talked about. I accept that concerns have been raised, not least by the Law Society, which, my briefing says, has raised the issue, which rather suggests that there has been some kind of dialogue. I know that the Law Society is looking, quite reasonably, to have certainty about the situation, and I will seek to provide that in my response to the questions noble Lords have asked. </p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a><a name="07050910000004"></a>The rights of audience and the right to conduct litigation will only be exercisable by employers of housing management bodies that have a formal management agreement with the local housing authority. That is covered, as I indicated, in Section 27 of the Housing Act 1985. The local authority will set the terms of the management agreement, thereby ensuring that there is sufficient accountability of the new housing management body. That agreement sets the respective roles, responsibilities and functions of the local authority and the housing management bodies, and should normally provide that parent local authorities continue to be legally liable for anything that housing management bodies do, or do not do, under the terms of the agreement.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a><a name="07050910000005"></a>As I indicated earlier, those agreements must be approved by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. Each and every agreement is thoroughly scrutinised by officials to ensure that it is robust. The employers will need written authority from the housing management body before exercising their rights. As with local authority housing officers, employees of housing management bodies will handle only routine cases. More complex cases will require the involvement of solicitors or the local authorities&#146; legal officers. The Department for Communities and Local Government is looking at making Section 27 agreements guidance more up to date, with particular reference&#151;I think this allays the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral&#151;to the need for all housing management employees to be supervised by a qualified lawyer.</p>

<ul>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a><a name="07050910000010"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment, which was discussed at an earlier stage, is intended to remove the exemption from the need to hold a practising certificate which applies to solicitors in government service. At present, all solicitors providing legal services in private practice are required to hold a practising certificate, and thus to contribute towards the costs of regulation. Solicitors in commerce and industry and in local government are also required to hold a practising certificate if they undertake reserved activities or if they are held out as solicitors. Government solicitors are wholly exempt from the need to hold such a certificate. Incidentally, there is no similar exemption for government solicitors in Scotland.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a><a name="07050910000011"></a>The Government have recognised the indefensibility of the present exemption in other contexts. When the Crown Prosecution Service was created in the 1980s, prosecuting solicitors who had formerly worked in local government and were required to hold practising certificates transferred to a central government department. The Government recognised that it would be unjustified for that change of employer to remove the need for them to hold a practising certificate, so the Prosecution of Offences Act specifically provided for solicitors employed in the CPS to hold a practising certificate. Similarly, when the Bar Council&#146;s practising certificate fees became enforceable as a result of the Access to Justice Act 1999, there was no provision excluding government barristers from the need to hold a practising certificate. The result is to create a quite discriminatory situation. Government solicitors are exempt from the need to hold a practising certificate while government barristers must pay.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a><a name="07050910000012"></a>The position might be understandable if government solicitors were regarded in some way as second-class lawyers not requiring the same qualifications and not subject to the same regulatory requirements as their colleagues in private practice; but this, of course, is not the case. Government solicitors are treated as being equally professional and equally subject to professional discipline.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a><a name="07050910000013"></a>Your Lordships may recall that, in Committee, discussion took place on this amendment and the Minister suggested that because government solicitors did not hold client money, they did not pose any regulatory risk. That argument is wholly misconceived. Regulation of the solicitors&#146; profession is not simply about the arrangements for holding clients&#146; money or for dealing with lay clients. It also encompasses establishing qualification requirements to become a solicitor, establishing the continuing professional development requirements, establishing the rules of conduct and monitoring and enforcing compliance with the rules of conduct. All those issues are as applicable to government solicitors as they are to those in private practice. Government solicitors frequently have to advise on the lawfulness of particular action where the wishes

It is essential that those advising in such circumstances are subject to professional duties, including duties to the court, to help ensure that they give independent legal advice rather than simply the advice that the Minister wishes to hear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_445"></a><a name="07050910000014"></a>We recognise that it is inappropriate for practising certificate fees to be the same for all sectors when there are significant differences in the extent to which different sectors require the use of regulatory resources. In the case of government lawyers and lawyers in commerce, industry and local government, the cost of practising certificate fees should be less than for solicitors in private practice because they do not hold client money. The apparatus to guard against mishandling of client money is not relevant to their sector. For those reasons, the fees for solicitors employed in government and in commerce and industry should be substantially less than those in private practice; but that does not mean that they should be exempt.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a><a name="07050910000015"></a>The present legislation does not allow the Law Society to charge differential fees in that way. However, amendments to the Solicitors Act, which are already incorporated in the Bill, will give that power to the Law Society in the future. Accordingly, a requirement to hold a practising certificate will not lead to an unfair burden being put on government lawyers or on their departments, which will in practice meet the cost of their practising certificates. It will simply ensure that government solicitors are no longer unfairly exempted from the requirement to contribute an appropriate amount towards the cost of regulating solicitors. I beg to move.</p>

This was something that the Joint Committee found difficult to understand, particularly the differentiation between solicitors and barristers and with those practising in Scotland. The Minister has always promised to come forward with a detailed explanation of exactly why the situation should be permitted to continue. As far as I can see, it is an anomaly that began somewhere in the 19th century, and no one can quite understand how it ever arose or why the exemption was originally provided for. Certainly, we have never heard any explanation of why it should continue. We await the response of the noble Baroness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_447"></a><a name="07050910000018"></a>Having listened to both the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Hunt, I noted one absolute omission from anything that they said.

<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1390"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1390</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lawyers is that is not presently catered for. There are anomalies, and I can go through them if the House wants, but at the end of the day there is a real, practical issue here. The amendment seeks a substantial sum of money to be paid by taxpayers to the Law Society without demonstrating what the public benefit would be. That is a difficult thing to justify when that would be the effect of the amendment.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a><a name="07050910000019"></a>The Government are the principal consumers in the case of those offices listed under Clause 184, not the public at large. To that end, the existing system adequately provides regulation for government solicitors. I know from my own responsibilities that there is a strong and proportionate system of regulation applying to government solicitors which includes comprehensive training and development programmes, ensuring that high standards are maintained across the Government Legal Service. The head of the Government Legal Service is the Treasury Solicitor, who is responsible for what takes place.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a><a name="07050910000020"></a>Clause 184(5) also ensures that any government solicitor who exercises a right of audience or conducts litigation is under a duty to the court to act with independence in the interests of justice. I come back to the point: I have not heard a single shred of evidence to suggest that there is a problem with how government solicitors carry out their duties under the existing regime, or information which supports the case for the public purse to meet the cost of different regulatory arrangements to those already provided.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a><a name="07050910000021"></a>I am sorry to disappoint noble Lords, but I ultimately find it hard to accept that the taxpayer should make this additional sum of money available for no benefit to the public. I therefore invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I will respond in two ways. First, if that principle should apply to government lawyers, should it not apply to at least all lawyers in the Government&#146;s service? It does not, after all, apply to barristers&#151;they must pay their practising fee&#151;or barristers or solicitors in Scotland. If the noble and learned Lord is going to go on to the front foot, and not simply say that this is now the situation because it always has been but adduce some positive reasons for exempting government solicitors in England and Wales, those reasons should surely apply equally to other lawyers in the Government&#146;s service.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a><a name="07050910000023"></a>Secondly, there is one important reason why government lawyers should be regulated: they give advice to Ministers. As I said in my opening, government lawyers must frequently give advice to Ministers on the lawfulness of particular actions in circumstances where the wishes of their Minister may not lawfully be achieved. I make no apology for repeating myself; but it is essential that those advising in those circumstances are not only subject to professional duties but are seen to be so. That is why government lawyers ought to be drawn into the net.</p>

I know of no circumstances in which a government lawyer has appealed to the Law Society for any support where there has been a conflict between themselves and the Minister.</p>

<a name="70508-0020.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a><a name="07050910000026"></a>I do know, however, that the Government have insisted, throughout the Bill, not only on realities but on perceptions. The Government have always said that even if there is no danger, in respect of some danger that we have said does not exist, we have to be crystal clear in the Bill because there may be a perception of danger. Even if the noble and learned Lord is right that the system in practice at the moment is watertight, nevertheless, I suggest, at least on behalf of the Law Society, that there is a perception that that is not so. There is a perception that government lawyers ought to be subject to similar regimes to other lawyers. In these circumstances and despite what I regard as the well intentioned and calmly presented arguments of the Government, I nevertheless wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

The second issue is: what happens to the money that flows from the cost awards? The Government have established a system under the Bill whereby it will be managed by a prescribed charity. The terms of reference of that charity, and the manner in which it is to be established, have yet to be decided&#151;but it will, of course, be a creature of charities legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_460"></a><a name="07050910000037"></a>In Committee, our concern was for those individuals who might have views about how the cost award ought to be distributed which conflicted with the charitable scope of the prescribed charity. At the end of the debate, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, kindly suggested that I might take the time to look into the intended terms of reference of that charity, to satisfy myself that its objectives conformed with those of which, during the debate, I had said I approved. I have done so, and I am entirely satisfied about them.</p>

<a name="70508-0021.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a><a name="07050910000038"></a>However, there might be circumstances in which a pro bono representative has strong views about the destination of the moneys, even within the terms laid down in the charitable objectives of the prescribed charity. Amendment No. 616A is intended to require the prescribed charity to have regard to the wishes of the legal representative of the party with respect to the distribution of the award made to that party.</p>

<a name="70508-0021.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a><a name="07050910000039"></a>I have been much influenced by the discussions that I have had with various lawyers, in particular Mr Robin Knowles, who have spent a great deal of time, entirely at the service of the general public, to ensure that the idea behind the clause gets off the ground. I applaud the work that he has done. Indeed, I would like to say to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, how much I admire everything that he has done for the pro bono movement. Since the early seeds were sown, it has gone from strength to strength. The fact that he is prepared to put his shoulder so firmly behind it is one of the main reasons for its success.</p>

<a name="70508-0021.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a><a name="07050910000040"></a>So in tabling the amendment, I do not want the noble and learned Lord to think that I am in any way trying to undermine his objectives.

I entirely share his view on the work that they have done and I, too, pay tribute to Mr Robin Knowles and others. Secondly, I thank him, as a result, for having withdrawn his previous amendment and tabled one focused on the point that he identified. Thirdly, I thank him for the very generous remarks he made at the end of his speech moving the amendment. I very much appreciate what he said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_465"></a><a name="07050910000043"></a>I also thank my noble friend for allowing me the opportunity to propose what I regard as this important, if small, amendment to the Bill. I am grateful for the overall support that it has been given by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. As he knows and  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1394"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1394</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has explained, the structure of the single charity envisaged under the clause was the subject of study by a working party set up under the auspices of the co-ordinating committee to which I referred. The membership of that working party was drawn from across the profession and the working sector. The report of the working party was fully endorsed by the full co-ordinating committee. I know that the noble Lord has seen that report.</p>

<a name="70508-0021.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a><a name="07050910000044"></a>The report contemplates that among the factors to which the single prescribed charity would have regard&#151;probably through principles rather than as a constitutional fetter&#151;when making decisions about distribution of money received, would be any expression of preference by the legal representatives who have acted pro bono. The report emphasises that such expression of preference could not be determinative, otherwise much of the advantage of strategic perspective that the use of a single prescribed charity offers would be lost. Those who wish to express a preference would be free to do so. I can see that proper regard to such expressions of preference would be helpful in ensuring confidence in the use of the prescribed charity. But, again, as the working party report emphasises, there must be a balance between having regard to preferences expressed and ensuring fair and strategic disbursement.</p>

I hope that the noble Lord will take the view that that is sufficient to meet his concerns, without his amendment being moved. He will not be surprised to hear that I would have some difficulties with the amendment as it stands. For example, it identifies only one factor and does not mention that the charity can have regard to the others. That always creates a difficulty in the statute&#151;there are others, but I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has taken my point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_468"></a><a name="07050910000046"></a>Without, I hope, adding any sour note to what has been a constructive discussion, I do not share the view expressed by some to the noble Lord, that the enthusiasm of those who do pro bono work will be dampened by thinking that money might not go to their favourite or prescribed charity. I have confidence in them, have had the privilege of seeing them at work and know that they do that work because they want to help those people who receive legal advice and assistance. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_469"></a><a name="07050910000047"></a>I note that, since I spoke to the associated amendment in Committee, the Department for Constitutional Affairs has issued a consultation paper on the clause which invites comments on all aspects of the clause&#146;s implementation.

<p><a name="stpa_473"></a><a name="07050910000053"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, the amendment will allow the court to consider making a pro bono costs order in proceedings commenced before the clause comes into force but in relation to costs incurred after the clause comes into force. If passed, the amendment will give the court the discretion to make a costs order in a successful pro bono case, even though the case had started before the clause came into force. That might mean that in long-running cases&#151;perhaps those on their way to the Court of Appeal or even to the Judicial Committee of this House, or those that have reached only their early stages at the commencement of this legislation&#151;the court could still make an order for pro bono costs if it considered it appropriate. That will have the benefit of expanding the proceedings in which this new power can be used. I underline that the court could not make an order in relation to costs incurred, or to work carried out, before the clause comes into force. That would be retrospective, and is not what the Government seek to do. I add that this will mean that ongoing cases are in the same position as those that have started after the clause comes into effect, so far as work done after the commencement of the legislation is concerned. It will, I hope, have the benefit of producing additional funds for the prescribed charity, which in turn may use those funds to assist the further provision of free advice. For those reasons, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_476"></a><a name="07050910000057"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment would ensure that non-solicitors can be appointed members of the Council of the Law Society of Scotland. The governing body of the Law Society of Scotland is its council, which is currently composed exclusively of solicitors, although it has four non-solicitor observers. I have been in touch, and had correspondence, with Michael Clancy, the director of the Law Society of Scotland, who explains that he and his colleagues would very much like this provision to be made. I am also now aware that the Scottish Consumer Council is backing the move by the Law Society of Scotland to appoint non-solicitors to its governing council for the first time in history. I warmly applaud this move, and I very much hope that the Government will support it.</p>

<a name="70508-0021.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a><a name="07050910000058"></a>Schedule 20 is interesting because it deals with a whole range of issues relating to devolved and non-devolved matters. I do not know whether the Minister will explain whether we require a legislative consent Motion, although it would undoubtedly be difficult to require one, given the Scottish Executive&#146;s present situation. On balance, it is probably not necessary, given the other matters that are repealed in this part. As the Minister is showing an interest in this issue, I shall explain that, as I understand it, many of the repeals in Schedule 23 deal with a range of devolved issues surrounding the discharge of functions of the council. The repeals involve Section 3A, on the discharge of the functions of the Council of the Law Society; Section 20, on the council&#146;s duty to supply a list of solicitors holding practising certificates; Section 24C, on the discretion of the council in special cases; Section 34(4), on the rules of professional practice conduct and discipline; and Sections 38, 39, 42A and 42B, which all relate to council powers where dishonesty is alleged. The list of sections is considerable, and I need mention no more, except to say that, in the light of that, it is not necessary for a legislative consent Motion to be passed by the Scottish Parliament. I therefore hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

I must ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment. We will seek to get the Law Society to raise this with the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament first, and then return to it if need be. At this stage there is nothing I can do.</p>

The thinking behind the amendment was that it was essential, in order to reinforce the perceived independence of the regulation of the legal profession, that any ministerial functions rested with the Minister responsible for the judiciary and the court system. During the debate on that amendment, my noble friend Lord Hunt made it clear that if the amendment was successful, it would be important to bring forward a further amendment to entrench the position.</p>

That principle is equally important in respect of the functions in the Legal Services Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_487"></a><a name="07050910000081"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, on the first day in Committee, Members of the Committee argued strongly in support of the need to preserve the independence of the legal professions. In particular, there were concerns that the responsibilities under the Bill should be exercised by the Lord Chancellor as opposed to a Secretary of State. The Committee had in mind the fact that the Lord Chancellor, by reason of his oath of office and the provisions of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, has a range of unique duties and responsibilities not shared by other Ministers. Among those are that he must have regard to,</p>
<ul><a name="07050910000201"></a>&#147;the need for the public interest in regard to matters relating to the judiciary or otherwise to the administration of justice to be properly represented in decisions affecting those matters&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050910000146"></a>The Lord Chancellor must also be qualified by experience in law or Parliament and has a specific duty to respect the rule of law.</p>

<a name="70508-0022.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a><a name="07050910000082"></a>The Government of course recognise not only the need to ensure that the legal professions are properly independent of government, but also that they can be seen to be independent. In recognition of this I agreed that the functions should be exercised by the Lord Chancellor, and the Government have brought forward amendments to give effect to that. Members of the Committee pressed me further to exclude the functions from the permitted scope of orders under the Ministers of the Crown Act 1975, in much the same way as was done in respect of the Lord Chancellor&#146;s judiciary-related functions and functions relating to the Great Seal in the Constitutional Reform Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_495"></a><a name="07050910000092"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 636, 648, 651A, 654A and 654B. The amendments in this group share the common objective of ensuring that the transition to the new regulatory framework is not hindered by undue delay. As noble Lords will know, it will be some time before the board is fully established and the entire regime in place. That should not prevent us making progress in the mean time.</p>

<a name="70508-0022.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a><a name="07050910000093"></a>Amendment No. 648 creates a provision which enables changes to be made to the statutory functions of designated regulators; that is, bodies which will become approved regulators when the provisions come into force. This will cover the period before the board comes into existence and is able to recommend orders under Clause 68 for this purpose. I am introducing this amendment in response to an amendment tabled in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. That amendment was not moved due to lack of time, but as I indicated in letters to your Lordships on 22 March 2007, I was prepared to consider it. Having given this further thought, I am persuaded that the noble Lord&#146;s proposals in this regard are valid. I hope that these government amendments achieve the outcome that the noble Lord was seeking.</p>

<a name="70508-0022.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a><a name="07050910000094"></a>As noble Lords will know, one of the key aims of the Government has been to ensure that any changes needed to enable approved regulators to operate efficiently and effectively under the new regulatory arrangements are not unduly delayed by inflexible arrangements. Against that backdrop, I can well conceive that statutory bodies will need to adapt certain aspects of their regulatory framework at some point before the board comes into being. This power will allow this, placing them as far as possible on an equal footing with non-statutory bodies such as the Bar Council during the transitional period.</p>

<a name="70508-0022.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a><a name="07050910000095"></a>The proposed new clause is modelled in principle on Clause 68. It will enable the Lord Chancellor to make an order to modify the functions of designated regulators during a transitional period, provided that the change in question is for one of the stated purposes, which are effectively the same as those in Clause 68. The Lord Chancellor may act only in accordance with a request from a designated regulator. He must publish the proposed changes and consult the Lord Chief Justice and the Office of Fair Trading. He may also consult the Legal Services Consultative Panel and any other persons as appropriate, and must have regard to advice and representations. As with Clause 68, the final order will be subject to Parliament under the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="70508-0022.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a><a name="07050910000096"></a>The purpose of the second set of amendments in this group is to ensure smooth transition by enabling the LSB to carry out its initial functions without waiting until the chief executive is in place. It is particularly important for the Office of Legal Complaints

Should the LSB have to wait until it has appointed its chief executive before it can proceed to appoint the OLC, it could delay the implementation up to nine months. This would be of real detriment. Similarly, it is important that the LSB is able to issue supervisory directions to the interim chief executive of the OLC at the earliest opportunity. The LSB chairing board should be able to oversee the work of the interim chief executive, be aware and kept informed of the activities taking place, and issue directions accordingly.

As noble Lords will note, these consequential amendments are numerous and technical, so I do not propose to address each one in detail. The current regulatory framework is established under a number of provisions in existing legislation, primarily the Solicitors Act 1974, the Administration of Justice Act 1985, the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 and the Access to Justice Act 1999. Amendments to the Solicitors Act have in the main been dealt with in Schedule 16. Those Acts variously deal with the regulation, education and training applying to the provision of advocacy, litigation, conveyancing and probate services. They also set out the persons who have a role in regulating those services, such as the Master of the Rolls, the Lord Chief Justice, the Secretary of State&#151;the Lord Chancellor&#151;the Legal Services Consultative Panel and the Office of Fair Trading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_505"></a><a name="07050910000105"></a>As noble Lords will know, the Bill simplifies this model by placing the board as the single oversight regulator, sweeping away the maze of existing regulators who have overlapping responsibilities. It also sets out the board&#146;s duties in designating approved regulators in considering regulatory arrangements and ensuring compliance with the regulatory objectives. Further, a large number of existing statutory provisions refer to lawyers of a named description or certain types of legal professions. For example, many statutory provisions refer to services provided by solicitors and barristers. Under the Bill, legal services are services provided by persons authorised in respect of reserved legal activities irrespective of title. It will be possible for persons other than those with titles such as &#147;barrister&#148; or &#147;solicitor&#148; to carry out those reserved activities, so it is important that existing legislation is updated to reflect the position, covering all persons who are or may become so authorised.</p>

<a name="70508-0022.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a><a name="07050910000106"></a>Given the scale of these changes, it is clearly essential to repeal a number of existing provisions to the current regime, or where appropriate to amend them so that they are consistent with the regulatory framework established under the Bill.

I do so because I believe there is a growing consensus across parties and the professions that we really need to get the approach to Part 5 right. One of the problems is that Part 5 fails to deal with the new structures on a risk-based approach, something I know Sir David Clementi was keen to see and to which the Government signed up when they accepted the Hampton principles in March 2005. When we last debated the issue, the Minister summarised the problem as she saw it in the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_634"></a><a name="07050910000191"></a>&#147;A body either has non-lawyers in positions of control or it does not. Consequently, it is either a licensable body or it is not&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/4/07; col. 301.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050910000147"></a>That approach fails to recognise the point of difference between legal disciplinary practices and multidisciplinary practices which Sir David Clementi said was at the heart of his review.</p>

<a name="70508-0022.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a><a name="07050910000112"></a>The most important point here is that legal disciplinary practices are low risk&#151;I refer to LDPs as defined by Sir David Clementi&#151;and the concerns that they should fall outside Part 5 could be addressed quite simply by introducing new clauses to require fitness to own or registration of non-lawyer principals without burdening such practices with the full

This amendment seeks to remove that artificial distinction and allow legal disciplinary practices with non-client-facing managers to develop and grow, which I believe would drive up the efficiency of legal services providers and enable them to attract and retain the best talent.

It is important that we are confident that legal services are properly protected. Exempting certain types of non-lawyer manager is in my view a step too far. We are not confident that the board or for that matter other approved regulators will be able to effectively regulate them under this approach. The noble Lord is right that we need to be careful and in a sense cautious about Part 5. Being a partner or a director in a firm brings with it influence and responsibility. Where legal services are concerned it is right that anyone in such an influential position can be under effective regulation, but applied flexibly. Under Part 5, that is the case in practice. In my view, the provisions for low-risk bodies that we have put in Clause 106 strike the right balance. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

This is a plea by me with support from other Members of the House that we should be told more by Government about Part 5 and about alternative business structures before we allow it to be put into operation or before we allow the Legal Services Board to take steps to implement those provisions. My plea is based on the degree of ignorance we have about the alternative business structures. My primary concern is about access to justice: what is going to happen to the small firms of solicitors; and what will be the consequences on the ground of implementing Part 5 in the real world? Secondly, I have a deep query about who is going to invest in the big partnerships and what their motivation will be. Thirdly, I am concerned about the degree of our ignorance about what is happening in other countries in this area. What about the common law countries and the civil law countries, particularly in the European Union? Are we going to find ourselves in a pariah status as lawyers? At the moment the legal profession is widely admired for its integrity and independence and we need to reflect and have information before we move forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_521"></a><a name="07050910000130"></a>I will keep this discussion as brief as possible; the hour is late, but it is a serious matter. I turn to access to justice. When I spoke on the sixth day in Committee I went through the testimony that had gradually been built up in earlier debates to show how worried senior lawyers were about the state of solicitors, by which I mean the economic stability and their chances of survival in various parts of the country. The starkest warning was from the former Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. I shall not read out again what he said, but it was particularly striking, because he said he was in the position of someone whose duty it was to travel around the United Kingdom and take note of what was happening to legal practices and the state of solicitors. He found that concern was expressed countrywide, as your Lordships will find in <I>Hansard</I> on 23 January this year at col. 1057.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a><a name="07050910000131"></a>On the same day the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, expressed his concern about Wales and the position of solicitors there, from close personal knowledge&#151;his earlier practice in law was there, of course. With regard to Yorkshire and Cumbria, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, spoke of his worry and his knowledge of the anxieties in those areas on 6 February, and on the same day the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, spoke about the West Country, with which she is very familiar. On an earlier occasion&#151;I have not recorded the date here&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, stated that he was particularly concerned about the position in rural areas.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a><a name="07050910000132"></a>There is a feeling of concern about just how strong and stable these medium, small and very small solicitors&#146; firms throughout the country are, and we are interested in finding out what the effect will be of the establishment of these new forms of practice. That needs to be looked at. We want to have some evidence-based conclusions that are up to date. Merely citing what Sir John Vickers may have written in 2001 in the Office of Fair Trading report will not do; in my submission, we have to have a serious study now. In a moment I will mention the literature the Minister sent me, but I have not found that it directly addresses the concerns I have in this field.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a><a name="07050910000133"></a>My second point, which is perhaps smaller, is the astonishing lack of information we have about who will come forward and fund these big partnerships. I should have mentioned that I was on the Joint Committee under the excellent chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral. I think I am right in saying that Co-operative Legal Services said it was enthusiastic about going down this route and supporting law firms by putting a financial stake in, but I believe that is the only bit of evidence we had.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a><a name="07050910000134"></a>I have asked this question before, but I shall repeat it: are we going to have law firms bought and sold like football clubs? Will they end up being quoted on the Stock Exchange? I believe that is just about to be developed in New South Wales. What is happening in other countries? Do we find models for these proposals working in other countries? I stated last time, and no one has contradicted me, that the United  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1407"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1407</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>States of America has been firmly against this sort of financial participation, the ownership of firms by outside interests.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a><a name="07050910000135"></a>The only Commonwealth area about which the Minister has supplied evidence is New South Wales. I shall say a word about that because this is new material that I have not seen before. I base this all on an article written by the Legal Services Commissioner in New South Wales, a Mr Steven Mark, and his co-author, Georgina Cowdroy, the senior legal and policy officer in the commission. It appeared on page 671 of the <I>Penn State International Law Review </I>in volume 22, part 4, in 2004, and I am indebted to the Minister for kindly letting me see the article. The current position is that there are now in New South Wales some 300 incorporated legal practices. I am unable to say how many of those are multi-disciplinary, because we are not told that.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a><a name="07050910000136"></a>The commissioner makes a rather interesting statement:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_643"></a><a name="07050910000200"></a>&#147;The Law Society&#146;s records indicate that at present, there are almost 300 ILPs in NSW. The vast majority of these ILPs were previously sole practitioners or small partnerships, which changed their ownership structures to obtain the perceived benefits of incorporation. However, aside from having to comply with the ILP legislation, such practices have experienced little change in their daily management and operation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050910000149"></a>So they have taken on a corporate structure to derive a benefit for themselves with no thought of what good it will confer on consumers. The commissioner says elsewhere in the article that this may be disadvantageous because the limited liability obtained by the partners means that not so many purses can be pursued by the dissatisfied claimant. As I say, there are 300 of these bodies, none of which has yet become a public listed company. It is open to them to do that. Under the Legal Profession Act the solicitor&#146;s duty is paramount and duties to shareholders come second. However, it is pretty clear that the commissioner, who has had experience of these incorporated partnerships, does not really believe that. He says that despite the assurances that the legal duty to maintain professional standards is paramount,</p>
<ul><a name="07050910000202"></a>&#147;my tentative view is that where an ILP becomes publicly listed, the duty of an ILP solicitor director to the court and to clients will inevitably conflict with the duty of a solicitor director to the ILP and its shareholders. Furthermore, I believe that such conflict is irreconcilable. While the perceived conflict between professional ethics and profit is an ongoing concern in the regulation of at least some present partnerships, in publicly listed ILPs, shareholder pressure for commercial gain will introduce a dynamic for solicitor directors which was non-existent in partnership structures&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050910000150"></a>In other words, the profit motive is likely to become dominant and possibly irresistible, notwithstanding the fine words in the statute.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_528"></a><a name="07050910000138"></a>The other aspect that I mentioned briefly previously is that we are still in the same state of ignorance about the position regarding the civil law in European countries. The only country that we know anything about is Germany. All the members of its association equivalent of a combined Bar Council and Law Society belong to an organisation, the abbreviation of which is BRAK. It is quite obvious from the evidence that it sent to our committee that it  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1408"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1408</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regards our proposals as an abomination because in Germany the independence of the lawyer is enshrined in constitutional provisions of law and the notions that we are considering here would be completely impossible. In the type of structure that is contemplated here you could not have a German partner coming in as a shareholder and owning a firm. A German lawyer can have a stake but he has to be part of the firm and subject to the professional ethic. What about the position in other countries in Europe? We do not have the faintest idea what is happening in France, Sweden or Ireland. As I thought about this today it struck me what an incredibly insular approach we are taking. We are ploughing on with these proposals without making any inquiry about what happens in the rest of the world.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a><a name="07050910000139"></a>My amendment would require the Government to put before us proper targeted information. I do not believe that would cause any delay. Nothing will come into force immediately. A document I was sent by one of the interested parties stated that we are looking at 2010 before the Legal Services Board will really get into action. That leaves plenty of time for a bit of decent research to come back to us within 12 months. I beg to move.</p>
<a name="time_44"></a>
<a name="70508-0023.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="07050910000209"></a>10.15 pm</h5>

<a name="07050910000140"></a><b><a name="70508-0023.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07050910000363"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> My Lords, we are extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, for tabling the amendment. If Part 5 is to succeed, three things will be needed: rigorous procedures to ensure that those who own law firms are fit and proper persons, a guarantee that the same consumer protections will apply to externally owned law firms as well as to other law firms and the assurance that proper attention is given to the impact on access to justice before licensing decisions are taken.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a><a name="07050910000141"></a>Two of those issues are dealt with satisfactorily by the Bill, which provides a comprehensive framework to ensure that external owners will be fit and proper persons. Furthermore, regulators of ABS firms will be able to ensure that the bodies that they license are subject to the same conduct of business rules and other consumer and public protection requirements as apply to existing law firms.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a><a name="07050910000142"></a>However, the Bill does not ensure proper consideration of the impact on access to justice. It is highly likely that the impact of these new providers on access to justice will vary considerably in different parts of the country. In urban areas, it may well be that externally owned law firms would simply provide desirable extra competition without any significant consumer detriment. The position may well be different in rural areas where the existing network of law firms is already thinly spread and under considerable economic pressure. In those areas, it is entirely possible that a new provider, concentrating on easily delivered routine legal services, might flourish, but only at the expense of making existing law firms unviable.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_532"></a><a name="07050910000143"></a>That could be damaging in two separate ways. First, there is a significant risk that large new providers would not be readily accessible to disadvantaged consumers, particularly if they operated from out of town sites, as many supermarkets are. Secondly, many  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1409"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1409</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>essential but less remunerative services may become unavailable. Existing law firms fold because the new providers are highly unlikely to offer the services concerned. Those services might include advice to parents whose children are involved in care proceedings, or help for the elderly having difficulties in relation to a care home; and they might simply become unavailable in large swathes throughout the country. Once services of that sort are lost, it will be exceedingly difficult to replace them.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a><a name="07050910000144"></a>It is imperative therefore that the Government should analyse the likely impact of ABSs before implementing this part of the Bill. Research carried out, as the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, indicated, prior to implementation of the provisions cannot be definitive; it will simply be a prediction based on economic analysis. The fact that it may not be perfect is no reason to proceed without it. Research on these lines could be particularly useful in highlighting especial risks and in suggesting what safeguards could be introduced to mitigate them.</p>

<p><a name="st_293"></a>
<a name="07050910000145"></a><b><a name="70508-0023.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07050910000364"></a>Lord Maclennan of Rogart:</b> My Lords, I, too, express great appreciation and support of the amendment and the speech by the noble Lord, Lord Neill, who has, even at this late stage, brought new and forceful arguments to a debate that we have had before. As we have had it before, I have nothing new to add, so I will be brief. The amendment, to which my name is added, may appeal to the Government more than my earlier attempt to suggest that Part 5 should not be made operative prior to the conduct of a pilot scheme to test whether the fears about access to justice are real.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a><a name="07050914000002"></a>For the reason just given by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, the circumstances will vary from one part to another. The proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Neill&#151;that careful studies should be made available before the implementation of Part 5&#151;is probably the better route. Furthermore, it is clear that it need not hold up the Government&#146;s desire to give effect to Part 5, since the studies could be put in hand virtually immediately and would no doubt greatly enhance our understanding of what is at risk and how best to avoid any adverse consequences for licensing alternative business structures.</p>

<p><a name="st_294"></a>
<a name="07050914000003"></a><b><a name="70508-0023.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07050914000483"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> My Lords, I am grateful. I am only sorry for the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, that the late hour means that his words fall on few ears. I am sure that noble Lords will none the less read our debate with interest. I agree with the sentiments expressed by noble Lords: this is an important debate on Part 5.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a><a name="07050914000004"></a>I agree that we should proceed cautiously with the development of alternative business structures. My principal concern is with doing more research, as the amendment requires, and the value that that would bring to our deliberations. Building on the excellent work of Sir David Clementi and working with stakeholders, we have obviously thought about and carefully reviewed the ABS proposals. That work was of course informed by the work of the Joint Committee on the draft Bill, chaired&#151;&#147;so ably&#148; it  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1410"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1410</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>says in my notes, but I agree&#151;as noble Lords will know, by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral. The debates on this matter have been both informed and occasionally lengthy, but none the less important.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a><a name="07050914000005"></a>The difficulty with further research is that, in a sense, it takes us into a slight Catch-22. I have provided the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, with information about the different approaches overseas. He rightly talks about New South Wales, where they have been looking at alternative business structures. We are interested in developments in other jurisdictions. He talked about the firm floated on the stock exchange there. There was recent publicity about the Australian firm Slater &amp; Gordon, saying that it plans to be one of the world&#146;s first law firms to float on the stock exchange; the first was actually in 2004.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a><a name="07050914000006"></a>Monitoring the effect of this sort of change on the Australian market and consumers is important, but I stress that what happens in one country is unlikely to exactly map across to another. The different safeguards make comparisons difficult, and services offered by firms in one jurisdiction may differ from other jurisdictions and ABS firms here. Although it is important to be aware of developments in other countries, that is not how to drive the development of alternative business structures in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a><a name="07050914000007"></a>That does not mean that the noble Lord&#146;s concern should not be addressed. Indeed, the amendments accepted by your Lordships&#146; House on the second day of Report, 18 April, are important: the requirement for licensing authorities to publish policy statements, setting out how they would satisfy their Clause 24 objectives&#151;including, importantly, access to justice when granting ABS licences. Government amendments introduced a duty for the board&#146;s annual report to deal with how the activities of a licensing authority and licensed bodies have affected the regulatory objectives, again including access to justice. That is the right approach to monitoring. Placing the duty on the Legal Services Board avoids fragmentation and maintains a central oversight of the regime&#146;s impact by the LSB.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a><a name="07050914000008"></a>There is no disagreement between us over the need to recognise and minimise risks. However, I remain concerned that requiring more research at this stage adds little. It seems attractive to look at other jurisdictions where ABS has been allowed but, as I have indicated, the potential for learning from them is limited. Noble Lords talked about the German BRAK. On a recent overseas visit, I heard that the German Parliament is looking to legislate in this direction. The relationship between the reaction of the German BRAK and what is happening in Germany may be relevant to our deliberations, but it looks as if Germany may be heading in the same direction. We will have to find more information because that was new to me, but it appears to be the case.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a><a name="07050914000009"></a>To draw conclusions about the factors covered in the amendment would be difficult because there is not an ABS in operation. Parliament would find it difficult to draw any conclusion or take a decision to commence Part 5, because there would not be any  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1411"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column 1411</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>evidence. It is a Catch-22; unless we work on alternative business structures we cannot ascertain how successful they have been, and without that how can Parliament make a decision on research that cannot possibly exist?</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_541"></a><a name="07050914000010"></a>The difficulty that I have is that we have given the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, all the information that we have. We will proceed with caution; that is absolutely right and proper. We intend to monitor effectively; we have tabled amendments to that effect based on what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said in Committee on the importance of thinking about monitoring.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_542"></a><a name="07050914000011"></a>I accept all the concerns about rural communities. ABS licences can have conditions within them that could make sure that those seeking advice on childcare proceedings or those in rural communities can be well protected. I endorse that approach. That is why I endorse the need for information on how all the regulatory objectives have been met including, importantly, access to justice. The safeguards that we have in the Bill recognise the risks and concerns. We are confident that we can get ABS development at the right pace and in the right direction. I know that the licensing authority will take into account the concerns raised, and will have to have regard to policy statements.</p>

<a name="70508-0023.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_543"></a><a name="07050914000012"></a>As I have already said, your Lordships&#146; House has agreed that the LSB should be under a duty to report annually on how ABS licensing affects regulatory objectives. With respect to the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, that will be more effective than the amendment. It will be based on what is happening on the ground rather than a theoretical set of assumptions on alternative business structures which do not exist. We will achieve what he wants, which is to make sure to do this in a measured and constructive way, but we need to begin the process in order to ascertain that. The safeguards that we have accepted within the Bill will make sure that noble Lords&#146; concerns will be met. On that basis, I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

She has reinforced my argument by citing the proposed German legislation. I knew nothing about that; I am most grateful to her for informing us. It is precisely the sort of information that we ought to have and it makes my point.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0705092000369"></a>&#147;(3A) The Authority shall not by virtue of section 30(1) above incur expenditure in promoting activities or relationships which are primarily the responsibility of Her Majesty&#146;s Foreign and Commonwealth Office or the Department for International Development although this does not prevent the Authority incurring expenditure in co-operating with or facilitating good relations with other major capital cities.&#148;.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000010"></a>The noble Baroness said: This deals with a problem that we believe has occurred with the current Mayor, and although the Committee has not normally discussed the current office-holder, the issue would in principle affect any Mayor. The amendment would restrict the authority&#146;s powers to incur expenditure on foreign affairs. We question how appropriate it is for the Mayor to conduct his own foreign policy, and aim to restrict his ability to do so.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000011"></a>In his seven years in office, the current Mayor has been on more visits to Latin America than to some of the boroughs in the city, which he is supposed to represent in its entirety. He likes to visit Cuba and Venezuela, at great and uninvited expense to the taxpayer. Quite apart from the huge cost, there is little obvious benefit to be gained by Londoners from the Mayor fraternising with Latin American countries. Why should taxpayers have to fork out for the Mayor to travel to Venezuela to visit a president who, we understand, did not particularly want to see him?</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000012"></a>It is hard to see from where the Mayor believes he gets the mandate for these expeditions. They did not form part of the basis on which he was elected; nor is there any satisfactory way to scrutinise decisions to travel. Although he may make deals when he is there, they are not always appropriate for London.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000013"></a>Whatever the difficulties with the incumbent Mayor, there is also a risk that a precedent could be set for future Mayors. It is not part of the Mayor&#146;s role to do this; in fact, it must stand hard on the feet of the Lord Mayor of the City of London. We believe that the Mayor of London&#146;s expenditure should be confined to doing the job for which he was elected. He would be better dealing with London alone rather than dashing around the world. I beg to move.</p>

It is widely recognised that the Lord Mayor&#146;s opportunities to visit countries all over the world and to entertain rulers and others at the Guildhall, in very fine style, do enormous credit to London and to the whole United Kingdom. It is not long since the late Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said at an Easter banquet in the City:</p>
<ul>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000015"></a>The present Lord Mayor, John Stuttard, has been to Germany, Kuwait, Ghana, Qatar, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Russia, Portugal and southern China.

The Lord Mayor&#146;s office has existed for 700 years. There is a great deal of pomp and ceremony, which is enormously appreciated by those who enjoy the Lord Mayor&#146;s hospitality. It is an entirely different role from that of the elected Mayor of London, for whom statutory provisions were carefully spelt out in the 1999 Act that we are amending. I raise the matter as an opportunity to point out that the amendment has nothing to do with the Lord Mayor, whose foreign travels and hosting of foreign visitors here in London do enormous benefit to this country. I hope that that point may be taken on board.</p>

I have sympathy with much of what the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said. It is often said that the current Mayor visits Havana more often than he visits Havering&#151;one might have some sympathy with him for that. However, the essential weakness in the amendment lies in what the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said in her opening sentence. The amendment deals with the office-holder and not with the office. We reminded ourselves at the start of this Committee that it may sometimes be difficult for us to remember that we are dealing with the office and not the office-holder, given that we have so far had only one office-holder, and it is important that we try to do so with this amendment.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000020"></a>London is by any definition&#151;and there are many&#151;a world city. Its population comes from pretty well every country in the world. It is right that the Mayor of London, whoever that may be, should seek to represent the communities in London with the countries from which they have come. That is quite an important role for the Mayor. One of the strong points of our winning bid for the Olympic Games was that we have many communities in London from virtually all the Olympic countries, and they will, to a greater or lesser extent, act as hosts.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000021"></a>London, particularly the Mayor of London, should play a role on the world and European stages. It is right that that person should have some international stature. We may well question&#151;we certainly do so with the current office-holder&#151;how that function is performed; we may well question the office-holder&#146;s priorities in carrying it out. The proper place for that argument is the London Assembly and among the London electors. It is not our role to legislate to restrict the Mayor. If the amendment were to become law, there would be some difficulty in determining the primary responsibility of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as distinct from the role to be played by the Mayor and the GLA. I was concerned by the amendment&#146;s reference to &#147;other major capital cities&#148;. I am sure that it is not the intention of its movers that London should have no relationship with New York, for example, which is not a capital city. Although I understand the purpose of the amendment and have some sympathy with what causes the movers to table it, I doubt its worth.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000022"></a>A final and extremely important point&#151;in a way this bears on what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, was saying&#151;is that London is a major business centre. Quite properly, in association with what the Lord Mayor does&#151;I join in that tribute&#151;London must have, and should have, a relationship with the business community and business links across the world. Recently, we learnt that the largest number of people who come to London now as visitors and on business come from the Indian subcontinent. That is enormously important. Were the amendment passed and interpreted in one of the possible ways, it would restrict enormously a very important role that the Mayor of London should play. The argument and debate about how that role is

I believe it is very restrictive. It is obvious that the present Mayor has aroused a certain amount of ire because of his visits to regimes perceived to be rather left wing. Visits to the United States, the involvement with New York and so on, do not seem to have aroused such opposition, particularly in the popular press. I hope that the amendment is not acceptable to the Government. The wording seems a little contradictory. At the end are the words,</p>

<p><a name="0705092000354"></a>Those two functions conflict with each other. Therefore, I do not believe the amendment is acceptable and I hope that the Government will not feel disposed to accept it.</p>

Perhaps I can add a few points to the very helpful exchange that we have had. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Tope, for his authoritative analysis of why it is important for the Mayor to have the capacity to promote London abroad. There has been a useful debate on the distinctions between the Mayor of London and the Lord Mayor of the City of London.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000025"></a>London is one of the most important financial, commercial and economic centres. It is a truly international city. Across the globe today, there is an enormous emphasis on urbanisation in the growth of cities, but there is also impoverishment and a growth of inequalities in cities. The Mayor of London has a particular interest in and a contribution to make to that. As the issue begins to dominate our international understanding and our global politics, it is extremely important that the Mayor is able to travel abroad, not just to promote London internationally but also to help to contribute to and to learn from the extremely difficult issues of urbanisation, climate change and so on. He needs that capacity. Since 2000, only 3 per cent of his time has been spent on foreign trips, which is not very much. I shall certainly not comment on any particular trip. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, made the point that he is accountable to the London Assembly for his actions and his expenditure. I know that the Assembly scrutinises those. Ultimately, he is accountable to Londoners through the ballot box.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000026"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked from where the Mayor&#146;s mandate comes. The original White Paper on London governance in 1998 clearly  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC119"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>envisaged that the Mayor would promote London at home and overseas, attracting inward investment and major sporting and cultural events. One of the three key principles of the GLA is promoting economic development and wealth creation in the Greater London area. That is a very strong mandate. Indeed, Section 400 of the GLA Act explicitly allows the GLA to provide advice and assistance on local government activities to bodies outside the UK in a similar way as it is allowed in regard to local authorities under the Local Government (Overseas Assistance) Act 1993.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000027"></a>The proposed new clause would not allow the Mayor to take his rightful role on the world stage or to develop closer links with the national leaders of the emerging world economies. The example of India is extremely well taken. The amendment would probably not even allow the Mayor to develop strong links with other world cities, such as New York or Barcelona, that are not capital cities but are major global players.</p>
<h5><a name="0705092000406"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000028"></a>Another point regarding the economy is that one in six jobs in London&#151;some 700,000&#151;either results from foreign direct investment or depends on tourism. The GLA has estimated that some 200,000 jobs in the capital depend on newly emerging market economies, such as those of India, China and Russia. The Olympic Games have been mentioned already this afternoon, but these proposals might suggest that the leader of the world&#146;s premier city&#151;an Olympic city&#151;would be breaking the law if he decided to visit the leader of another country. We would be in trouble internationally and would make ourselves a laughing stock.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000029"></a>The amendment draws attention to the role of the FCO, but if responsibility for promoting London were not given to the Mayor it would not be clear who would have that role. These are strong arguments. I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000043"></a>We oppose the changes to the London Fire  and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) membership proposed in Part 5. The current composition has worked very effectively, almost entirely without complaint. The mix of borough representatives and Assembly Members is an appropriate model that we propose should be extended to include the Transport for London board. I do not intend to rehearse all the arguments from our previous debate on the make-up of Transport for London, but noble Lords will remember that the political diversity and, in particular, geographical range that the LFEPA model provides have clear advantages. Why do the Government believe that there should be mayoral appointments to the London fire board? The arguments in favour of allowing two appointees on the board to replace directly elected representatives seem superficial at best. We remain wholly unconvinced by those put forward by my honourable friends in another place.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000044"></a>Clause 27 will allow the Mayor the power to issue directions to LFEPA. Earlier, through Amendment No. 73, we proposed that the Assembly should be able to scrutinise these directions, but the Government would not accept that. It now appears that the Bill is further weakening the London fire authority&#146;s independence from the Mayor by allowing the Mayor to make his own appointments. Can the Minister give an assurance that the Government have no plans again to extend mayoral patronage over the London fire authority at a later stage?</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000045"></a>Clause 25 proposes a wholly unwelcome change in the composition of the London fire authority. It would damage democratic accountability, and London councils and the London fire authority oppose it. They have voiced understandable concerns about the motivation of the new non-elected

We oppose the Question whether these clauses should stand part of the Bill.</p>

I could sum it up by asking the Minister: if it ain&#146;t broke, why fix it? There is common consent among London borough councils and the London Assembly that, of all the functional bodies, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority has worked best in terms of its governance. The balance between the Assembly and the borough membership works very well on the whole. Indeed, the Commission on London Governance, of which I was a member, suggested that it should be a model for other functional bodies, particularly the Metropolitan Police Authority, which is outside the remit of this clause.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000047"></a>I have not been convinced by any case to weaken by two members the elected representation on the authority and increase it by two unelected appointees, whoever they may be. There may well be a wish to increase the size of the authority, but reducing its elected membership would be very much a step in the wrong direction.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000048"></a>We are also debating whether Clause 26 shall stand part of the Bill. I support that clause. At the moment, we are in a rather strange position. If the chairman and deputy chairman of the fire authority were not Members of the London Assembly&#151;in other words, if they came from the borough council&#151;they would be entitled to an allowance but, as Members of the Assembly, by virtue of the GLA Act, they are not entitled to an allowance. Considerable work is involved, and it is right to correct that anomaly as we seek to do here.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000049"></a>Although I recognise that it is outside the scope of this clause, perhaps I may ask for clarification on a similar situation regarding the Metropolitan Police Authority, where the workload of the chair is even greater. Schedule 2 to the Police and Justice Act provides for allowances to be paid to the chair and deputy chair, subject to regulation by the Home Secretary. However, it does not make clear what would happen should the chair of the MPA be a Member of the Assembly, as has always been and is likely always to be the case. That may be clarified as and when the Home Office makes regulations, but, if not in the reply today&#151;I recognise the difficulty there&#151;it would be helpful, perhaps by letter later, to receive clarification that we are putting the two functional bodies on an equal footing, as I am sure is intended.</p>

I recognise that I cannot be given an answer today but perhaps a letter could be sent to us. As my noble friend said, the question of an allowance for the chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority will be a matter for regulations made by the Home Secretary. It would be particularly invidious if those regulations were not made in time for the two

I recognise that some people take the view that it is invidious to make allowances at all, but that is not the point that we are making.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000051"></a>Perhaps I may make a point on the Question whether Clause 27 shall stand part of the Bill, to which the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, indicates he will not speak separately. During the debate in the Commons on directions to the fire authority, reference was made to directions covering both management and operational matters. Similar to the point about membership in another clause, it would be helpful to understand why there is any need for this provision. Things seem to be working perfectly well. However, if there is to be provision for directions, are they expected to extend to operational matters? There is a considerable distinction between managing the authority and giving directions about how it should operate, which, traditionally and rightly, is a matter for the professionals.</p>

I am not at all certain that that is a very good idea. I have a note from the Mayor to the effect that he supports the Bill. He points out that it will give the Mayor a greater say in the running of the London fire and emergency plan, including a power of direction over its activities and making two appointments to the board. He also points out that he has power of direction over Transport for London and the London Development Agency and that the Bill would bring the LFEPA into the mainstream of GLA companies. I do not think that a case has been made to wipe out Part 5 entirely as these amendments would.</p>

I shall speak in support of the Questions that these clauses shall stand part of the Bill. Clause 25 gives the Mayor wider powers in the appointment of LFEPA members. At present the Mayor is accountable for the budget of LFEPA but, beyond that, has little influence over the work of the authority. This clause helps to redress that situation by enabling him to appoint two members to the 17-strong board through his own nomination. That will strengthen the effectiveness of the board in determining fire and rescue related issues.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000055"></a>I fully recognise the noble Lord&#146;s point that in the past seven years LFEPA has been very effective in running the London Fire Brigade and driving forward the numerous and far-reaching modernisation changes required under the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 and the subsequent national frameworks. Indeed, the 2006-07 performance assessment results for the fire and rescue service, published by the Audit Commission at the beginning of April, assessed LFEPA as improving

It awarded LFEPA an overall service assessment score of level 3, which is defined as,</p>
<ul><a name="0705092000398"></a>&#147;Performing well&#151;consistently above minimum requirements&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0705092000355"></a>I applaud LFEPA&#146;s performance in that respect.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000056"></a>However, a good performance hitherto does not mean that there is not scope for making things even more effective. Allowing the Mayor to nominate two members of the board will not only provide him with a degree of influence that his budgetary responsibilities merit&#151;in tandem with Clause 27, to which I shall refer&#151;but will provide wider stakeholder membership of the authority.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000057"></a>To cover the point made by the noble Baroness, it is envisaged that the Mayor might nominate representatives of interests such as the business community, minority ethnic groups or people with relevant fire and resilience experience. Such appointments should enable even greater effectiveness in operational delivery and ensure a more robust governance structure for the implementation of the integrated risk management plan, known as the London safety plan, which determines the measures to be taken to protect London and its communities.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000058"></a>Clause 26 lifts the prohibition on Assembly Members who are also a chair or vice-chair of LFEPA from receiving allowances for carrying out their roles. We discussed the principle behind this amendment during our debate on Clause 19. We believe that this change is entirely justified given the heavy workloads that chairs and vice-chairs of the authority bear. It implements a recommendation made by the Senior Salaries Review Body in 2005. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, oppose this clause, but that would create inconsistency in the legislation. It would surely be inappropriate to remove the new arrangements for LFEPA while keeping them for the LDA and TfL.</p>

The clause also includes a power for the Secretary of State, in new Section 328B of the 1999 Act, to direct the Mayor to revise or revoke guidance or directions given to LFEPA when he considers that they are inconsistent with the <I>Fire and Rescue National Framework</I> or fire safety enforcement guidance.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000060"></a>I have already referred to the Mayor&#146;s position of responsibility for LFEPA&#146;s budget while having little say in its strategic leadership. The new provisions will give the Mayor more influence over delivery while ensuring the arrangements for LFEPA remain broadly compatible with those for fire and rescue authorities elsewhere. They will enable the Mayor to exercise greater influence over the authority and, where necessary, direct it on operational and non-operational matters for greater efficiency. Such matters might include measures to ensure greater equality and diversity in its workforce or to have regard to the wider GLA environmental agenda, or the relocation of fire-fighting appliances to areas of

The clause provides the opportunity for the beneficial addition of relevant experience and expertise, and I do not accept that, given the injection of this wider representation, the loss of one borough member will have a negative effect on LFEPA&#146;s community role. Furthermore, the London Assembly has the power of scrutiny over LFEPA, thus providing a further democratic safeguard.</p>

Having been involved in fire authorities for some time and strikes in Essex over the years, I would be most concerned if the Mayor had powers to move or suggest the movement of fire appliances around London. Would that be possible against the Chief Fire Officer&#146;s advice, for example? I am more concerned about the operational side than anything else. If there is any service whose professionals should be involved in operational decisions, it is the Fire Service.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000064"></a>I am concerned about other aspects of the clauses but mostly about that provision. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the reference to moving fire appliances around London. It would greatly concern me if the Mayor could do that.</p>

Quite apart from the objection in principle to the Mayor having such a power, I do not understand the logic. Moreover, I know that LFEPA is doing a great deal of work to increase the number of its firefighters from black and minority ethnic communities and the number of women.</p>

He appoints its members, a proportion of whom are members of his own political party. I do not understand how reducing the elected membership by two and appointing two members would increase the Mayor&#146;s influence over the budget and how it is operated. I have attended every budget debate in the London Assembly since the creation of LFEPA and cannot recall any significant problem or difference between the Mayor and the Assembly or the Mayor and LFEPA. What problem are we trying to fix?</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000071"></a>Reference was made to the two appointed members perhaps representing the business community or adding to the ethnic mix of LFEPA. Those are desirable objectives but they are not specified in the Bill. Any future Mayor of London may appoint any two people whom he or she wishes to appoint. The suspicion will inevitably be that the Mayor will appoint members of his or her party to obtain the majority that the electors have not given to the fire authority. That cannot be right either. So I return to the question: what is the problem that we are trying to fix? After seven years&#146; experience, I do not think that there is a problem and I do not think that this clause is right or necessary.</p>

Why do we have to reduce the number of democratically elected people? I am all for increasing the number of democratically elected people on bodies such as health authorities, police authorities, fire authorities or whatever, though in the past few years all Governments have been reducing that number. I strongly oppose removing elected people and introducing others. I agree with having other representatives but, I repeat,

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000075"></a>I am concerned by the operational part of  Clause 27. I have just said that I agree with bodies having elected membership but I do not think that politicians should be involved in firefighting. That would be a big mistake. Again referring to my own experience, at one stage we decided that we would have more women in the fire authority. We set a target percentage but the required number could not be recruited, so we did not have as many firefighters as we wanted. You cannot interfere with that and operational matters such as moving fire engines around London for political reasons, so I very much oppose the Mayor having any operational input to the London fire authority.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>

<p><a name="0705092000080"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of amendments would give more powers to the Mayor. The new clauses they propose relate to the GLA&#146;s role in policing in London. Amendment No. 72 would make the GLA the capital&#146;s police authority, while Amendments Nos. 74 and 75 would give the Mayor and, to a lesser extent, the Assembly a say in the appointment of the commissioner and deputy commissioner of the metropolitan area.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000081"></a>The driving force behind each of these proposals is to increase accountability for policing in London. By  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC127"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>accepting Amendment No. 72, the Government would place as the authority a body that was answerable to Londoners&#151;the very people it is supposed to protect. It is not uncommon around the world to have some form of democratic accountability for police authorities, whether through the election of senior police figures or other means. Although the GLA would clearly be judged at the polls on many things other than its performance in policing, this would certainly provide an opportunity for the public to register any disapproval.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000082"></a>The proposals in Amendments Nos. 74 and 75 may prove more palatable. Amendment No. 74 provides for the appointment of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. It would compel the Secretary of State to have regard to any recommendations made to him by the Mayor, as well as any representations made by the London Assembly. Amendment No. 75 would also ensure a role for the Mayor in the appointment of the deputy commissioner. These powers would not extend beyond recommendations but would represent an improvement on the current system of patronage.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000083"></a>Just as we support the involvement of the boroughs in local matters for which they are largely responsible and where their reputation will be most affected, so we think it is right that the GLA should have some involvement in policing in the capital. I hope that the Government will no longer accuse us of indiscriminately attempting to strip the Mayor of powers at every possible opportunity. Where there is justification for increased involvement, we have always said that we will support it. I beg to move.</p>

Everyone would agree that we would not start from here if we had a blank sheet of paper. As I understand it, the commissioner is accountable to the Home Office, the MPA, the Mayor and the Assembly. On the other hand, he has national roles as well as those for London. I am confused about how those national roles would be dealt with under the amendment.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000085"></a>The existing structure, while certainly imperfect, seems to have allowed for an increase in community policing in London, which I think most Londoners support. Therefore, although imperfect, it may be delivering some of what we would like it to deliver.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000086"></a>What is most odd about the current structure is that there are 12 Assembly Members on the MPA. The roles of proposing, scrutinising and then implementing the budget do not sit well together; I would like to see a much clearer separation between the scrutiny role of the Assembly and the MPA. A solution, although it is probably also imperfect, is to look at the MPA more as an executive management board for the police rather than another tier offering semi-scrutiny, semi-budgetary responsibility and semi-accountability.</p>

Of all the amendments tabled by Conservative Peers, this is the first and possibly the only one that has received the endorsement of the Mayor. For all those reasons, it is probably wrong.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000088"></a>The amendment demonstrates a lack of understanding of some of the principles that underpin policing more generally, not just in London. The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, highlighted how myths about the confused accountability of the Metropolitan Police have been allowed to grow; indeed, it has been quite happy, on occasion, to promote such myths. The reality is much simpler than suggested. There could be simplifications in the existing arrangement, but I question whether an abolition of the police authority is the best route to delivering an effective and efficient police service for London that best meets the needs of Londoners.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000089"></a>The amendment suggests that all executive functions in respect of the Greater London Authority&#146;s role as a police authority shall be carried out by the Mayor of London. In practice, the Mayor of London would personally appoint all commanders, deputy assistant commissioners and assistant commissioners of the Metropolitan Police; he would be responsible for its senior police staff and, apart from responsibilities with regard to the budget, would also take personal responsibility for all its property transactions. I suspect that that is inconsistent with the general thrust of the views expressed by Members of this Committee about the Mayor taking action on his own, but that would be the effect of the amendment.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000090"></a>Amendment No. 72 would give powers of scrutiny to the London Assembly. There is, I accept, some duplication in that the Assembly seems occasionally to carry out functions that have been carried out exhaustively by the police authority. Some simplification might make sense. I have seen senior officers of the Metropolitan Police appearing and answering questions on a topic and then being asked exactly the same questions about exactly the same topic by exactly the same Members of the London Assembly at its budget committee. That seems a wasteful use of everybody&#146;s time. I wonder what is going through the brain processes of London Assembly Members; when the same question is asked and answered on two separate occasions, in two different places, do they remember whether they have received the answers in the first place?</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000091"></a>The question that has to be answered is whether these arrangements will deliver more effectively an efficient police service that meets the needs of Londoners. One consequence of having an authority dedicated to looking at the work of the Metropolitan Police has been a degree of focus that, I submit, would not be possible if it were done on an executive basis by the Mayor and by a scrutiny committee of the London Assembly.</p>

I fail to see how these arrangements would improve it.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000093"></a>There is also the interesting question of how the amendment would work in respect of the recent changes, involving crime and disorder reduction partnerships in London, following the Police and Justice Act 2006. If executive functions reposed with the Mayor of London, he would be required to be a member of all 32 crime and disorder reduction partnerships in London. Although the Mayor of London must have the capacity to walk on water, I rather suspect that that requirement would be very trying. In practice, police authority input to local crime and disorder reduction partnerships would not happen, which would damage the effectiveness of local policing.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000094"></a>The amendment suggests that the Assembly police committee be bolstered by the addition of four magistrates. That is an interesting concept, as the Police and Justice Act has just removed the separate category, rightly or wrongly, of magistrates sitting on police authorities. Although I believe that magistrates have made an enormous contribution to the work of the police authority in London, I am not sure why it is proposed that there be four magistrates and not other independents, as would be the case elsewhere.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000095"></a>On Amendments Nos. 74 and 75, the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said that his proposed approach would be better than the current system of patronage. Again, I suspect that that means the noble Lord has misread the legislation and misunderstood the  process followed. The appointment of the present Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis involved an exhaustive process that could hardly be described as simple patronage. Initially it involved a panel, including the chair of the police authority, the Permanent Secretary of the Home Office and some fully paid-up member of the great and the good to act as an independent assessor, simply to screen the applications received. There was then an extensive panel interview&#151;no doubt following all sorts of bizarre psychometric tests, but I am not sure&#151;by members of the police authority, with Home  Office representatives present, which made recommendations to the Home Secretary. The Mayor of London was also consulted at that stage. Then  the Home Secretary, having considered the recommendations made and representations received, made a recommendation to the Queen. I will not repeat the even more tortuous arrangements for the appointment of the deputy commissioner, but you could hardly say that there was a system of patronage.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000096"></a>The amendment would limit the various possible stages. In its proposals for the deputy commissioner of police, it seems to have made no reference to the London Assembly, even though I had understood the amendment&#146;s purpose as being to involve the London Assembly more in the workings of policing.</p>

This may be one of those almost-as-rare occasions when I am wholly in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Harris.

<p><a name="0705092000100"></a>One of my concerns at the suggestion that the London Assembly scrutinise the exercise of the Mayor&#146;s functions as a police authority is that there are only 25 Members of the Assembly compared to the 23 members of the police authority, nearly half of whom are not Assembly Members, and I simply do not believe that Assembly Members could&#151;in terms of time, priority and workload&#151;carry out that function as effectively as the police authority has done in the past seven years. It has not been perfect; we still have a long way to go and much to learn; but we have waited 170 years for London to have its own police authority, as distinct from the Home Secretary. It could work better but it has worked well, and this proposal would be a retrograde step.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000101"></a>I also have considerable concern about putting all the executive power for policing in London and beyond, as has rightly been said, in the hands of any one person, whoever that office-holder might be.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000102"></a>Primarily for the reasons eloquently expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, Amendment No. 72 fundamentally misunderstands the nature and work of the Metropolitan Police Authority. He explained accurately the extensive process, of which he and I were part, in appointing the current commissioner and deputy commissioner. It was very thorough and lengthy; the only part he did not mention was that we all watched the applicants&#146; professional media interviews, and scrutiny took place. The Mayor had a say in that; he made his views clear to the Home Secretary. Whether it is necessary to enshrine that in statute I am happy to leave others to judge, but it is entirely right and sensible that the Mayor of London should have a say.</p>

The role of the Assembly, as intended, is carried out through its membership of the Metropolitan Police Authority. As it happens, for very good reasons, I think that I am right in saying that in seven years I have been the only Member of the London Assembly to chair a committee of the police authority. The chair of the authority is an Assembly Member and always has been, but I think

There is a very good reason for that; it is not because the other Assembly Members are lazy or do not want to do it&#151;not at all. As the noble Lord, Lord Harris, said, it is because they have other priorities and other things to do. Therefore, were we to move the scrutiny role to the Assembly, we would hugely weaken the accountability of the Metropolitan Police in London for which we waited 170 years and which is now starting to make a significant difference.</p>

It is hard to disagree with him, and we have had testimony to that fact from the noble Lord, Lord Tope.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000106"></a>The amendment raises some important questions, which I shall address briefly because we have had a thorough debate on the implications thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Harris. Essentially, as the noble Lord, Lord Tope, implied, the amendment would bring about a major change in the governance of policing in the metropolitan district. It overlooks the effectiveness of current arrangements and would overturn a settlement that we reaffirmed last autumn. As the noble Lord, Lord Harris, pointed out, it shows up some technical difficulties and pre-empts some of the work that the Government have commissioned in this area.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000107"></a>As noble Lords said in the previous debate on LFEPA, if it ain&#146;t broke, why fix it? Its not being broke is reflected in the remarkable improvement in investment in the police authority, in terms of falling crime. I do not want to weary the Committee, but I shall give a few figures. Since the first year of the Metropolitan Police Authority, it has received an additional &#163;827 million in grants, an increase of 50.6 per cent. The number of police officers as of last September is over 5,600 higher, or 22 per cent more, than in March 2001. Every local government ward in the Metropolitan Police district, in addition to the usual response and specialist squads, has a safer neighbourhood team of one sergeant, two constables and three police community support officers. I could go on but I shall not, because the most important thing to say is that we are seeing the results in that investment in the fall in crime. Overall, crime fell in the Metropolitan Police district by 9 per cent between 2002-03 and 2005-06. The Metropolitan Police&#146;s own figures for the past year include further falls in particular areas, such as gun crime and crime against the person. This is an opportunity to pay tribute to the MPA and the officers involved.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000108"></a>Amendment No. 72 amends the Police Act 1996 by inserting new Section 5AA, which would abolish the MPA and hand the role of police authority to the GLA. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, sought to accommodate the dual nature of the GLA by assigning executive functions to the Mayor and a power of scrutiny to the Assembly. We have heard how that would either become more complex or not be as effective as the present arrangements. New Section 5AB provides that the Mayor shall set the component budget in respect of policing, and new  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC132"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Section 5AC provides that the London Assembly in its role of scrutiny, both of the Mayor&#146;s executive functions and of the Metropolitan Police service, shall establish a committee for that purpose to which four magistrates shall be co-opted.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000109"></a>That overturns what we sought to establish in the Greater London Authority Act 1999, a settlement that we modified only last year. The reason for the 1999 Act was to create a police authority for the Metropolitan Police district that was based on the model of police authorities elsewhere and integrated with the democratic governance of London, which was also being changed. The current model was introduced by the party opposite in the mid-1990s. It has a mix of individuals; the majority are elected and the others are magistrates and members of the public chosen for their skills. This model was a Conservative Government reform. The first members were appointed in 1995 to provide a greater skill base, which has led to greater diversity.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000110"></a>Noble Lords will know that a tripartite relationship governs policing in England and Wales. In practice, that means that the Home Secretary holds a strategic and national role, the chief officer has operational responsibility and the police authority is accountable for performance and setting local priorities. The police authority must have a policing plan that sets out local priorities following consultation. However, there is a distinct difference between the role of a police authority as a single-purpose authority and that of a local authority which is responsible for the delivery of a wide range of public services.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000111"></a>In addition to the arguments of my noble friend Lord Harris and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, there are two further arguments that I shall address briefly. I understand the argument for a greater role for the Greater London Authority, but we have already enhanced the role of the Mayor in respect of the MPA through the Police and Justice Act 2006, which only recently passed through this House. Its provisions include removing the bar on the Mayor being a member of the police authority and specifying that the Mayor of London is to be the chair of the authority, should he choose to be on the authority, or must appoint a chair from among the members of the authority&#151;currently the members of the MPA elect their own chair. In addition, the Mayor may appoint one or more vice-chairs to the authority. These provisions, including those to give greater functions and flexibility in membership of police authorities, were debated as recently as last autumn. They are additional to the existing provisions on the role of the Mayor in choosing the Assembly Members on the police authority, setting the component budget and expressing a view in the appointment of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. We have tried and succeeded in enhancing the role of the Mayor without chucking out a tried-and-tested system, which this amendment would do.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000112"></a>My noble friend Lord Harris asked the critical question whether the amendment will lead to a more effective system. The answer is no because it overturns existing arrangements and has significant flaws. One  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC133"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of them is that it is not clear how the division of responsibility between Mayor and Assembly will work in this scheme. Amendment No. 72 inserts new Section 5AA into the Police Act 1996, assigning executive functions to the former and scrutiny to the latter. The problem is that nowhere in this amendment or existing legislation is there a definition of the executive functions of a police authority as distinct from scrutiny functions. If we are unclear about how they may be separated and have no knowledge or experience of it, how can that deliver greater clarity, transparency, accountability or effectiveness?</p>
<h5><a name="0705092000409"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000113"></a>A key function of a police authority is to secure continuous improvement in policing services and regularly to monitor performance. The MPA undertakes direct oversight of the Metropolitan Police service through a range of committees which deal with matters such as professional standards, finance and performance. The police authority is the corporate budget-holder for policing the Metropolitan Police district. Corporately, it is responsible for the annual policing plan, priorities and consultation. In what sense are these executive or scrutiny functions?</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000114"></a>The executive functions are further complicated because the chain of command exists within the force and not the police authority. The provision in proposed new Section 5AB for the Mayor to present the component budget for policing already rests with the Mayor in Schedule 6 to the Greater London Authority Act 1999. The co-option of magistrates and lay justices to the Assembly to form a police committee in proposed new Section 5AC would restore the precise position that the Police and Justice Act 2006 sought to correct. My noble friend Lord Harris dealt with the replication of the provision requiring four magistrate members as opposed to a reduction to one, for very good reason.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000115"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, spoke about layers of complexity, but we should again note that London is different, which explains much of that complexity. Nowhere else, for example, is the commissioner appointed by Her Majesty the Queen.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000116"></a>I hope that I have addressed the remaining arguments which make it difficult for us to accept the amendment. I shall answer the question whether there is a need for change, which raises important issues. There is cause for debating how we can continue to seek greater effectiveness and improvement. In the Government&#146;s security, crime and justice policy review, <I>Building on Progress</I>, of 27 March, we acknowledged that, following the achievements of the past few years, there remains the challenge of,</p>
<ul><a name="0705092000399"></a>&#147;empowering local people and bringing together the police, local authorities and other agencies more effectively to pursue community safety in a visible and accountable way&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0705092000356"></a>That challenge is one of four key elements in the review of policing in England and Wales that we announced that day. The other three elements were: reducing bureaucracy, mainstreaming neighbourhood policing and making the best use of resources. My  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC134"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>right honourable friend the Home Secretary has appointed Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the former Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Police Service of Northern Ireland and currently Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary, to lead this review of policing.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000117"></a>We have made it clear that that review will look at the experience of directly elected mayors such as we have in London. Obviously, I cannot prejudge the outcome, but it will allow us to reflect further on how we strengthen accountability. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment pre-empts the outcome without, for example, addressing another key point identified by his party&#146;s own interim report on police reform; namely, what it claims is the desire of Londoners for the Metropolitan Police service to be more accountable. A debate on improvements is therefore taking place between the parties.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000118"></a>Amendments Nos. 74 and 75 relate to the appointments process for the commissioner and the deputy commissioner of police. In the light of the forensic demolition job by my noble friend Lord Harris, I shall not pursue them because they are consequential on the proposal. The debate has illuminated important issues, but I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000119"></a><b><a name="70508-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0705092000452"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I thank the Minister for that answer, particularly for the last part, because it goes some way towards addressing our reasons for tabling the amendments. I fully respect the knowledge of the noble Lords, Lord Harris and Lord Tope, of the MPA and their involvement in it. They obviously know more about how it functions than me. I was a member of the Essex Police Authority for some years. Although it was much smaller and rather different, I know the differences that exist between the authority and the way the chief constable operates.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000120"></a>However, we tabled these amendments to dip our toes in the water. Clearly, neither the noble Lords, Lord Harris or Lord Tope, nor the Minister, have looked at how Conservative Party policy is developing in this area. The arguments today strengthen the whole idea of a directly elected MPA&#151;as far as my party is concerned, if the workload proves too much for the GLA and so on, that should happen.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000121"></a>Returning to my comments on the previous amendment, there should be much greater elected elements in all such bodies. That is why we have proposed the amendments. Whatever we think of the GLA and the Mayor, at least they are elected. The amendments need rethinking and rewording and I accept some of the points made about them. We will rethink them before we bring back any similar amendments.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000122"></a>Regarding executive powers for the Mayor, I have a tremendous number of executive powers in Essex; I do not fulfil them all and I delegate them to other people. Whatever powers you give the Mayor on policing, he would obviously delegate many of them. He would not attend some 39 partnership meetings and so on&#151;or is it 40? I shall return to these matters but beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

</ul>
<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000129"></a>The noble Lord said: We now come to the two most contentious areas of the Bill, housing and planning. Parts 6 and 7 have attracted the most controversy; it is not hard to fathom why. Throughout the passage of this legislation we have fought to devolve powers as far as possible. Therefore, it is extremely disappointing that, in a Bill that will affect London physically and permanently, there is the greatest shift of power away from the boroughs. All our amendments in this group affect the London housing strategy. As regards the extent of the remit, it is appropriate not to be unduly prescriptive and not to be too vulnerable to the individual whim or ideology of a solitary figure, however sage that figure might be.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000130"></a>The cohort of amendments led by Amendment No. 77 would delete all the references to &#147;recommendations&#148; or &#147;expectations&#148; and replace them with &#147;guidance&#148;. That would make it entirely clear that the housing strategy is intended only as an advisory document and will not affect the ability of local authorities or the Housing Corporation to deal with social housing grant in the usual established and trusted way.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000131"></a>Amendment No. 78 requires the Secretary of State to consult London Councils about the allocation of housing.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000132"></a>Amendment No. 87 is an important amendment to Clause 28. It would require the Mayor to consult a range of other bodies, the principal housing providers in the capital. We are opposed to the clause in its entirety. If there is to be an overall housing strategy, it is essential that there be an obligation to consult other bodies, not least the London boroughs. The Mayor should certainly have to take into account borough perspectives, both in drafting the London housing strategy and in making spending recommendations.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000133"></a>It may be argued that consultation should take place in any event. It is very important that that should be a statutory requirement. We also favour the change put forward by Amendment No. 89, which would make it clear that an individual London borough housing strategy should simply have regard to the London housing strategy. The obligation to be in general conformity with the overall strategy will allow very little room for manoeuvre for boroughs to adapt to the housing needs or character of their areas. It will also reduce the weight given to a strategy that is prepared by one individual alone. That is not a comment on the incumbent, as we have said several times today, but it would be the case regardless of

We have considerable concern about this area and I hope that others will support the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

I apologise for tabling them late. In general, we support the Government&#146;s proposals in this part of the Bill. Our amendments do not go as far as those of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and are tabled at the request of London Councils, the organisation, on the basis that they provide wording with which they would be more comfortable.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000135"></a>The amendments would ensure that the Mayor consults local housing authorities in London, has regard to the effect of his proposals on their housing functions and takes account of their statutory responsibilities. Many aspects of local housing authorities&#146; strategic roles are not intended to be within the scope of the London housing strategy. At Second Reading, the Minister referred to concerns expressed about how the Mayor's powers would impact on the role of the boroughs. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0705092000387"></a>&#147;I reassure noble Lords that the boroughs will continue to lead on housing in their own areas. The mayor will not take over the boroughs&#146; legitimate lead role in housing, but boroughs&#146; local housing strategies will need to be in general conformity with the mayor&#146;s strategy&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/3/07; col. 1699.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000136"></a>The amendments are intended to make it quite clear how the two roles fit together. Perhaps the Minister will be able to say something further on that, or possibly even accept the amendments&#151;one never knows. Given that the local role deals with matters such as the landlord role, consultation with tenants and residents and wider links with employment, regeneration, health and welfare, where both the Mayor and local authorities have roles, which, although different, should be complementary, the local authorities should not be edged out by the Mayor's housing strategy.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000137"></a>Amendment No. 89A clarifies the requirement that housing strategies must, in general, conform. That is a concept with which we do not differ&#151;it deals with disputes.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000138"></a>The opposition spokesman in the Commons described the amendments being moved again today as being as devolutionary as possible. I want to make it clear that, to the extent that powers are brought down from the Secretary of State, that is devolution that we would accept and support. Although in general we take the view that the boroughs should be left to deal with everything that is appropriate within their areas, on housing, some pan-London aspects need to be considered as well as the borough-level matters. I intend to ensure that that distinction is drawn and that no more local authority functions are taken over than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000139"></a>On Amendment No. 87, how does the consultation that the Mayor should undertake in preparing the housing strategy&#151;forgive me if I missed this in the introduction to the group&#151;fit with Section 42 of the 1999 Act, where some of the players and others, including the functional bodies and the Assembly, would be consulted? That is in Section 42 of the

I entirely support extending consultation as in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Amendment No. 87 but I would not want to see a restriction, if they are minded to override Section 42.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Tope, asked, in the context of another amendment, what question we are trying to address. I suggest the question here is homelessness in London. Two-thirds of all homeless households are in the capital; half of all overcrowded households are in the capital; and there are acute affordability issues for first-time buyers and growing families who need to move on. That is all at a time when, in the past fiscal year, at least four competent London boroughs that are in receipt of planning applications managed social housing units only in single figures. That is a disgrace. </p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000141"></a>I declare an interest as chairman of English Partnerships. Currently, I have a number of planning applications in the system in London&#151;not our own applications. I wish to resist Amendment No. 89 because I am constantly asked to intercede by house builders who tell me that they accept the London plan; they have got used to the idea of 35 per cent social housing and 15 per cent intermediate housing&#151;that no longer causes them a problem&#151;they have got used to the idea that housing in the capital should include high environmental standards; and, compared with four or five years ago, they are fairly relaxed about some of the aspects of the Mayor&#146;s plan. But they are frustrated because, when they put in an application that conforms to the London plan, frequently individual boroughs choose to dumb down the amount of social housing or try to dumb down the density and so on. That leads to many house builders spending four or five years in unarmed combat in the appeals system. Sadly, many house builders simply up sticks and are no longer prepared to do business in the capital.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000142"></a>When the pressure on housing for young people, homeless people and growing families is as acute as we can remember, it is misguided to suggest in Amendment No. 89 that boroughs ought to &#147;have regard to&#148; rather than &#147;be in general conformity with&#148; the London housing strategy. It would make the process of providing good quality, affordable housing and housing across the range of tenures much easier in London. I strongly urge my noble friend to resist the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000145"></a>The Bill will provide the authority for the Mayor to introduce a London-wide strategy. That is terribly important. The Mayor supports the provisions. Under the Bill he is required to consult local authorities and has no right to interfere with the powers that local authorities already have. It is simply a question of producing a London-wide strategy, and the funding will also be provided to go with that strategy. This is an important development, and I hope that it has the effect of providing, eventually, more affordable housing for the working population in London and making it affordable for young people starting out in life to have at least somewhere reasonable to be able to continue to live in London. I support the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000147"></a>My two amendments in this group are Amendments Nos. 86A and 87A. This has been an omission&#151;I was going to going to say a casus omissus, but one must not use Latin phrases. The reference is to special authorities. The amendments would require the Mayor to take account of the particular circumstances of any area within Greater London that is a special authority when preparing his strategy.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000148"></a>It may not be immediately apparent to all noble Lords what that means. &#147;Special authority&#148; is a term used in local government finance legislation to describe a local government area that is principally a business district. For the cognoscenti, the precise definition is to be found in Section 144 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which is referred to in Amendment No. 87A. A special authority is entitled to levy a local rate, reflecting the fact that the area is mainly covered by business. I should mention in parenthesis that the Lyons report recommended that this arrangement should continue.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000149"></a>The only special authority in local government is the City of London. As Members will not need to be told, the City is not like any other part of London; the number of residents is tiny&#151;in fact, in the whole of the City it is less than in the smallest ward of the City of Westminster. There are only just over 9,000 people&#151;although that is based on a fairly old census. The City is wholly atypical in having a business voting system that bears similarities to the voting system applied to the setting-up of business improvement districts, which the Government introduced. I cannot resist adding that in doing so they almost exactly copied a Bill that I introduced a couple of years before&#151;but that is history.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000150"></a>The fact is that the voting system in the City is different. It is governed by a private Act from 2002, which I took through the Chamber. Because the City is mainly an environment for doing business and has a very small population, it follows that the amount of residential housing that can be provided inside the boundary is of necessity limited. I should add that the City Corporation has a long history of providing housing outside the boundaries; it still does so, and there is no issue about provision of housing that way.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000151"></a>Clause 28 inserts a new subsection 7(a) into new Section 333A of the Greater London Authority Act and requires the Mayor to take account of the effect of his strategy on areas adjoining Greater London. However, it does not require him to take account of the effect on areas inside Greater London, even where, as in the case of the City, the circumstances are so different from those of the London boroughs. I referred to the City&#146;s importance as an international financial centre that brings great benefits to London and to the national economy. Therefore Amendment No. 86A is right and should be accepted because it asks the Mayor to take account of any effect on special authorities, which in this case would be the City. In commending this amendment to the Minister, I hope that she will look at it sympathetically.</p>

I support the Bill in the main. It is appropriate and necessary that the Mayor has a strategic role in housing and in planning, which we will come on to later. The population and economic growth challenges facing London make necessary a special response from the Greater London Authority to drive them forward.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000153"></a>I shall make a few specific points. The first is on consistency between housing and planning. The Mayor should decide the broad allocation of housing grant in the capital in line with his policies in the London plan and the housing strategy. It is appropriate that the Secretary of State should have the opportunity to issue a direction if the strategy is inconsistent with national policies or is detrimental to the interests of other areas, as with the London plan. However, proposed new Section 333A(5) in the Greater London Authority Act 1999 is broader than the planning equivalent and gives the Secretary of State powers to neuter the Mayor&#146;s housing strategy, which might happen if he were of a different political persuasion, so it is important that it does not go that far.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000154"></a>I do not support Amendment No. 89, which provides that local authority housing strategies should &#147;have regard to&#148; rather than &#147;be in general conformity&#148;. That is the way the London plan is dealt with and is appropriate.</p>

These amendments would apply to the strategy a lighter touch for the local authorities. However, I rise to speak because the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, briefly touched on the implications  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC140"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for resources, and we have not mentioned them. Under these provisions, the Secretary of State will become responsible for directing the housing grant to London boroughs and will decide how those resources are allocated. It is important that the London boroughs are consulted about how that grant is divided up. That is the purpose of Amendments Nos. 78 and 87, which provide that the boroughs are closely involved not only in how the money is allocated but in how much each of them will get to fulfil its housing role. This is an important part of the Bill, and I wish to make clear that that is what we are concerned about.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000156"></a><b><a name="70508-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0705092000461"></a>Lord Harris of Haringey:</b> I should like to speak to the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, partly because I am not sure that I fully understand its purpose. It would give special consideration to the Corporation of London, which I accept is different&#151;it is essentially a trading estate and therefore behaves differently from the rest of the capital city. As I understand the amendment it would simply require the Mayor, in preparing or revising the housing strategy, to have regard to the effect of his proposals on the City of London. Given that the strategy is about London, that it relates to the distribution of resources to housing authorities and that the Government will presumably not allocate resources to a housing authority that does not have land or the facilities to provide more houses, I am not sure why it is necessary to have this exemption or special treatment of the Corporation of London.</p>

My experience of these matters in Westminster, where I live&#151;I stand here once again as a council tax payer&#151;was to follow very closely developments over the Candy &amp; Candy applications to build the Bowater House development in Knightsbridge. Under the freedom of information legislation, I secured from Westminster City Council all the background documents and reports that flowed between the Mayor&#146;s office and Westminster and between the offices of the local authority and its members. I also gained access to the Section 106 agreement, which I have with me, and which was drawn up with the developer. It is quite clear to me, following that particular application, that there is resistance from some councillors within Westminster&#151;I cannot speak for other boroughs&#151;to social housing development within their wards. That is happening.</p>

I was actually the original objector to the cemeteries campaign, which was essentially about the misuse of power within Westminster. We did all the original work and I made the original submission to the district auditor; I submitted 44 objections, which led to the inquiry. So what happens in Westminster

<p><a name="0705092000162"></a>A young person in Westminster cannot afford to acquire a property unless they rent. If they rent, they get what is little more than a slum for &#163;200 a week&#151;that will be a studio flat. They might get a little more than a slum for &#163;300 a week, with one bedroom. I know young people in London; lots of my son&#146;s friends live here and they tell me about what is going on in the housing market. I have seen some places where living conditions are appalling. The reason rents are high is, first, the sale of housing association property&#151;not helped, perhaps I may say, by our own government rules that force housing associations to sell some of their housing stock&#151;and, secondly, the fact that people simply cannot manage in the present circumstances.</p>
<h5><a name="0705092000411"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000163"></a>In London, local authorities simply do not have the stock and are not in a position to help. Thankfully, following the Prescott initiative that introduced measures to make it more difficult for tenants to buy their properties in London, we have managed to retain a greater number of properties within the public sector. However, until those changes in the discount regime were introduced only a year or two ago, we were still selling properties in London and denuding that part of the market that was available to people for reasonable rents. I desperately want to see more comparatively low-rent property made available within the public sector in London. That simply cannot happen in Westminster, given the way we are going.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000164"></a>It is impossible for young people to buy in London. A one-bedroom former council flat in Westminster will cost you &#163;250,000, which will require a mortgage of around &#163;1,550 to &#163;1,600 a month&#151;nearly &#163;20,000 a year. If you want to buy a property in an owner-occupied estate, you could add 50 per cent to that. It is utterly impossible for people to purchase,

The cost of property in Westminster is reflected right across central London. The only way around that is for someone to grab this issue, run with it and require local authorities to build, and require far more social housing in private housing planning applications.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000165"></a>Section 106 agreements do not work as they should and there should be far more enforcement of them. I have not looked at all the amendments tabled, but the Section 106 document in relation to Bowater House demonstrated a lack of proper enforcement powers to ensure that the developer fulfilled the requirements to provide social housing within the time specified in the agreement. The agreement was sloppily drawn up and we need a completely new regime to deal with this issue in London. I do not, frankly, give a damn who the Mayor is, so long as they take on that responsibility.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000166"></a>I understand that we modified our original proposals. Perhaps I may say to the Government that I would have given the Mayor far more substantial powers to deal with this issue because, to put it bluntly, I do not trust the boroughs that I know.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, invited me to go further in response to some of her questions. I will go further; I have a long speaking note, I am afraid, because this is a long list of amendments raising different issues on this topic. I hope that the Committee will bear with me. I will deal with them in some detail because it is important to be clear about what powers we are talking about, their limits and implications. Some noble Lords&#146; comments indicate a misunderstanding or misreading. I hope that I can provide reassurances on several points.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000168"></a>We have had an interesting encounter with some of the significant problems of London and what sets it apart as regards the scale of the housing challenge, both in terms of homelessness, overcrowding and the number of people in temporary accommodation. As my noble friends Lady Ford and Lord Campbell-Savours said, it is clear that London is in a class of its own in that respect. Whatever strategy we adopt for London will have to be different and very robust. One need only consider that, between 2006 and 2016, the number of households in London will increase by 40,000 a year. Noble Lords have given examples of the impact of house prices. People on the lowest incomes are hit very hard, because lower-quartile house prices were more than 8.5 times lower-quartile incomes across London. The situations that my noble friend Lady Turner described are hardly unique; we could all find similar examples.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000169"></a>The housing challenge in London is significantly different because it cannot be met on a London borough-by-borough basis. It is a cross-borough issue, if for no other reason than that the 2001 census recorded that more than 2 million London workers travel more than 5 kilometres to work. London boroughs already participate in cross-boundary nomination arrangements for the use of social  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>housing. We have touched in this debate on the challenges of providing social and affordable housing, which will run through what I say.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000170"></a>Major developments in London, such as the Thames Gateway, Barking riverside, the Greenwich peninsula, or Barnet and Walthamstow, which connect with the Cambridge-London growth area, are designed to respond to needs across London and not simply within boroughs. Such developments have not only to span and integrate policies across the boroughs but also to integrate with wider policies across the south-east. That is what the Mayor has already developed in successive London plans, which is his job. He is uniquely placed to take a strategic view of housing needs and to make the most of synergies with transport, infrastructure and planning. A clearer and more strategic understanding of housing need and provision is crucial. My colleagues in DCLG have been working to develop a better notion of green planning, taking account of land and housing together, and to look at how we assess the needs of communities and plan for them, be it by age, condition or family size. We are all committed to developing better policies for providing affordable housing.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000171"></a>The Mayor can already provide a London housing strategy. The Bill will make it a statutory strategy. It simply strengthens the influence of the housing strategy and puts it on the same footing as other statutory strategies prepared by the Mayor. It does not create an exceptional power. The proposal that London boroughs&#146; housing strategies should be in general conformity with the Mayor&#146;s strategy reinforces the impact of these provisions. The Mayor can already advise on housing spending priorities. The draft provisions in the Bill strengthen the impact of that advice by setting it out in primary legislation and requiring the Housing Corporation, which is the agency responsible for delivering affordable housing, for the first time to have regard to the Mayor&#146;s recommendations. The Bill therefore achieves the right balance of powers between all the players in the housing field. It is not the whole story, but it is a vital part of what we have to do.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000172"></a>The provision of affordable housing in London is of national importance: it cannot even be contained within London. Planned investment of &#163;1.5 billion in 2006-08 is equal to almost half the whole programme across England. Investment in London has an impact across the wider south-east and beyond. That is why it is right that the Bill contains reserve powers, particularly in new Section 333B, but also in new Sections 333A(6) and 333C, for the Secretary of State to safeguard both national interests and those of regions adjoining London.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000173"></a>I welcome the cross-party support for the Bill today. The noble Baroness spoke about the need for housing strategies, but what arguments have been made against the proposals? Concern has been expressed that the Bill will somehow make it possible for the Mayor to direct spending on housing in individual boroughs and therefore ride roughshod over local housing policies. Let me lay that to rest now. The clause does not provide any powers to direct  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC144"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the money to the boroughs. It enables the Mayor to give advice but the Secretary of State will make the final decisions. Frankly, whether we are talking about recommendations or anything else, it is still an advisory power. In order to make that clear, perhaps I may unpack what we are achieving in the nature of funding.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000174"></a>The funding affected by the proposals in the Bill falls within the regional housing pot. That pot is made up of three elements: first, funding for affordable housing that goes to the Housing Corporation; secondly, funding for decent homes that goes directly to local authorities, because their own stock and activities are affected; and, thirdly, funding primarily for decent homes and regeneration initiatives in the private sector. We have to distinguish between those three funding streams in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000175"></a>In London, funding for both decent homes and private regeneration initiatives is already allocated directly to boroughs by the Secretary of State on advice from the Mayor. The Bill simply codifies the current arrangements. For the affordable housing funding that goes to the Housing Corporation, the proposed clause introduces a more influential role for the Mayor, which we believe is entirely appropriate. I hope that I can reassure noble Lords by explaining how those powers are contained.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000176"></a>The amendments set out two alternative approaches to the housing funding arrangements in London. Both would undermine the key strategy, especially affordable housing, because they would inhibit the Mayor&#146;s ability to drive forward its implementation alongside the wider national priorities. I am sure that noble Lords do not want to do that.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000177"></a>Amendments Nos. 76 and 78 would remove the fundamental structure provided in the current draft clause for the Mayor to make recommendations, through the London housing strategy, about spending on housing in London. In its place, the amendment proposes the direct allocation of all funding to individual London boroughs following negotiations, which also involve London councils.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000178"></a>The problem is that that simply overturns any notion of a strategic housing policy and the need for one. As I said, supply and demand for housing is unequally spread across London. The boroughs with the available sites are not necessarily those with the highest housing need. Therefore, we need a strategic approach. The amendments would also give the Secretary of State direct responsibility. He or she would have to &#147;have regard&#148; to the London housing strategy.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000179"></a>That model falls a long way short of our proposals to give the Mayor a clearly defined role but, by abolishing the regional tier and replacing it with the Secretary of State, the policy would also become entirely regressive. It would contradict the notion on which regional housing policies are being successfully developed; that is, the regions know what they need and what local authorities informing the regions tell us they need. It would put in place arrangements in London which are entirely at odds with those in other regions. We do not think that negotiations led by  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC145"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>central government&#151;however brilliant we are&#151;with individual boroughs are likely to deliver the sort of step-change needed, particularly in providing affordable housing. The Mayor has a key and clearly defined involvement. There is also the risk that boroughs with more resources to devote to negotiations will be able to influence the process unduly. I cannot think of any greater recipe for&#151;perhaps the word is not &#147;chaos&#148;&#151;battling between the boroughs.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000180"></a>For the reasons that I have given, that, in turn, would make it much more difficult for us to deliver against demanding targets for national affordable housing. Funding is currently passed to the Housing Corporation, which comes back within a framework set by Ministers on advice from the regions, including the Mayor. It allows the Housing Corporation the scope easily to move funding from one development to another on an in-year basis in response to delays, and that happens often in individual developments. Allowing for that flexibility maximises outputs. It means that you can move to where the need is; you can put the money there and keep moving.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000181"></a>Under the approach proposed in Amendment No. 78, affordable housing allocations would be owned territorially by London boroughs. It would be next to impossible to move funding between developments and would seriously inhibit what could be achieved.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000182"></a>The alternative approach in Amendments Nos. 77 and 79 to 86 presents another set of problems. They would leave in place the provisions removed by Amendment No. 76 and replaced by Amendment No. 78 but would weaken the impact of the existing provisions. They would require the Mayor to provide guidance rather than recommendations on housing funding in London. We do not think that guidance is right in that context. Let me explain why.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000183"></a>The use of the term &#147;recommendations&#148; codifies existing practice. As I have said, the Mayor can already offer advice and make recommendations to the Secretary of State on housing funding priorities for London. For decent homes and regeneration funding that goes directly to London boroughs, our proposals reinforce the existing position by putting the procedure in the Bill. The Secretary of State will continue to make allocations, on the advice of the Mayor. It will be for the Secretary of State to accept that advice&#151;it can be rejected. She would consider the views of interested parties, which would obviously include individual boroughs.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000184"></a>The change would also apply to policies for affordable housing. In this critical area, the existing ability of the Mayor to make recommendations about the size, type and location of affordable housing in the capital will be strengthened by the requirement, which our proposals introduce, for the Housing Corporation to have regard to those recommendations. I hope that my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours will take some comfort from that important new requirement. It has been welcomed by the Housing Corporation as bringing together its

The plan to increase affordable housing in London, set out in that plan, is now linked more clearly and specifically with the Housing Corporation&#146;s responsibilities. We welcome that; it reflects a very serious intent.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000185"></a>Substituting guidance for recommendations would weaken the link, the role and the delivery system. There is another problem with the notion of guidance: the funding on which the Mayor would be advising is, and remains, government funding. For any outside body or individual to offer guidance is simply not appropriate. It would be particularly problematic in the case of that part of the regional housing pot which is allocated straight to the London boroughs without being ring-fenced. It could be taken to mean that conditions had been set for the use of that funding where that was not intended.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000186"></a>I welcome the explanation given by my noble friend Lady Ford about why that would weaken a situation which is clearly quite progressive regarding where the developers find themselves in terms of policy-making. The amendment weakens the overall strategy by requiring the boroughs not to,</p>
<ul><a name="0705092000400"></a>&#147;be in general conformity with&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0705092000357"></a>the housing strategy but to have regard to it.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000187"></a>The London boroughs are key partners in helping to design and deliver the London housing strategy. It would be absurd if their strategies were to undermine or contradict that. The requirement to be in general conformity with the London housing strategy gives more assurance that the Mayor and the boroughs will work more closely together. That does not mean a slavish adherence to what is in the London plan. The boroughs do not have to mirror the detail of the plan. It is not intended to override the legitimate discretion of each housing authority to take into account its local circumstances. When they are not in general conformity with the strategy, that means that there is an inconsistency or omission in them which would cause significant harm to the implementation of the Mayor&#146;s strategy. It is quite right that local housing strategies reflect the different make-up and needs of the individual borough.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000188"></a>Amendment No. 89A, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, envisages a situation in which the Mayor&#146;s strategy would adversely impact on the ability of London boroughs to carry out housing functions which are their responsibility but fall outside the scope of the London housing strategy. I understand where the noble Baroness is coming from but it is difficult to think of something which would be impacted by the London housing strategy yet would fall outside its scope. Therefore, Amendments Nos. 86B and 87ZA are not necessary. If the noble Baroness would provide me with examples that we could think about, I would be happy to look at them. In any case, the amendments are covered by the existing requirement on the Mayor to consult the London boroughs and the Corporation of London on the London housing strategy and revisions to it. I have a more fundamental difficulty, because that is a very general requirement. Amendment No 89A would encourage the sort of  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC147"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nit-picking that we would hope to discourage. It would have the overall impact of undermining the ability of the Mayor to work constructively with London boroughs.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000189"></a>Amendments Nos. 86A and 87A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, would require the Mayor to &#147;have regard&#148; to the impact of his housing strategy on the Corporation of London. I was interested to hear the figure of 9,000 residents in the City, which I did not know. We entirely agree that it is important that the Mayor consults the corporation, alongside all London boroughs, on his housing strategy before it becomes a statutory document. The fact that that is not in the Bill is not an omission, because it already exists. Subsection (2) of draft Clause 28 already amends the GLA Act 1999 to ensure that the Mayor must consult the Common Council of the Corporation of London on his strategy before it is published. I would be happy to confirm in writing to the noble Lord that the amendments are covered by existing provisions.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000190"></a>Amendments Nos. 76, 88 and 90 take a different direction again. They seek to remove the Secretary of State&#146;s powers of direction which ensure that national priorities are reflected in the housing strategy, that it responds swiftly to changes and that it is produced in a timely manner. Amendment No. 76 would remove her ability to specify what the London housing strategy should contain; Amendment No. 88 would remove the requirement that the London housing strategy should be submitted to the Secretary of State and remove her ability to require changes that she would feel necessary; and Amendment No. 90 would make it impossible to ensure that the strategy was produced in a timely fashion. I have explained the relationship between housing in London and national housing in general, and the fact that half of the Housing Corporation&#146;s funding is invested in the capital. Therefore, a power to intervene, should proposals look likely to undermine national policy or adversely affect regions adjoining Greater London, is important. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendments.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000191"></a>However, I have some good news, which I have left until last. Amendment No. 87 seeks to add specific consultees to the face of the Bill. It already contains provisions requiring the Mayor to consult on the London housing strategy in line with arrangements for other London strategies provided for in the GLA Act 1999. Amendment No. 87 adds specific references to the Housing Corporation and,</p>
<ul><a name="0705092000401"></a>&#147;the body representative of the views of registered social landlords&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0705092000358"></a>We have sympathy with that amendment. It makes sense to consult practitioners on the practicality and delivery of the contents of the London housing strategy. Indeed, it is difficult to see how the Mayor could develop such a strategy without advice of that sort. Without making a commitment to take these proposals on board and without prejudice to similar proposals for other parts of the Bill, we are prepared to consider this amendment.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>

I should add an extenuating factor, which I have discussed with the House authorities: the loop does not work well in this Room and I do not always hear exactly what the Minister has said. We will study her words and it may well be that my amendments are already covered by the statute, in which case I would accept what she has said. Thank you.</p>

A number of the amendments provide what I call &#147;wriggle room&#148; for those authorities which are disinclined to be as full-hearted about their responsibilities as I would wish them to be. The Minister and her colleagues must take it on board that, where it is quite clear, both from the intelligence that they are able to glean from face-to-face meetings and from information gained in other ways, that there is within a borough not just a reluctance but a misordering of priorities in responding to what is required, they should not hesitate to apply strictures of one kind or another.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000195"></a>I mentioned by way of illustration at Second Reading the visit to Enfield of Bob Mellish and Evelyn Dennington in 1965. There was a zealousness about at the time. Circumstances now are, of course, completely different from then, but there is no difference in the problems faced by a young family which is condemned, by virtue of the sale of council houses and the depletion of affordable housing in their borough, to live with impossible financial demands or grotty living accommodation. The family turns to somebody for assistance. In the first instance, it will be the council or the housing association, but ultimately the Government will carry the can, because local authorities will ignore, twist or re-order their priorities in such a way as to wring their hands and say that there is not much that they can do. There may not be much that they can do; in which case, somebody else should have the power to do it.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000196"></a>I therefore say to the Minister &#147;all power to your elbow&#148;, because I and other former constituency MPs in the Room know the utter depression that one feels when one is unable to help people who come to you for assistance as a last resort. While I greatly respect and value London Councils, with which I have an association, the Minister must recognise that there has to be a renaissance in the Government&#146;s determination to tackle the housing problem in London.</p>

The Bill provides for a strategic housing policy for London for the first time. It provides for general conformity with the London plan, with its explicit recognition of the needs of low-income people in London. It provides new powers and responsibilities for the Housing Corporation so that it is locked into the process. It maintains the integrity of the boroughs by allowing them to act responsibly, but keeps a close eye on what they do. As I have said, the balance is right. The Bill enables all the partners to understand, and inform each other of, the scale of housing needs and come nearer to meeting them in the future.</p>

If a borough is omitting or contradicting the London plan, it is our understanding that the judicial review process will be open to the Mayor. However, we do not believe that we will get to that point, because the powers in the Bill and the responsibilities allocated are so much clearer and there will be a shared understanding. If we reached the point of addressing the matter in the context of the Government&#146;s reform of planning through, for example, Planning Policy Statement 3, which relates to providing more family housing, looking at housing needs and providing more assistance for the boroughs to determine their needs, we would have failed.</p>

We accept that the housing strategy is required, but problems about the availability and price of land affect the provision of housing within London. Today, we have got rather lost on the provision of affordable housing. In my experience, councils are largely fulfilling the requirements laid down for them and the percentages that are required. My council certainly is. That is happening and people are taking care about that, but there is a big problem about the amount of land available in central London and its cost.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0705092000388"></a>&#147;It is regretted however that the housing density is beneath the guidelines set out in the London plan as the site is very accessible and highly desirable&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000359"></a>It goes on to the reasons why that is the case. If the Mayor regrets and is concerned about a particular application because it does not meet the density criteria that are laid down in a number of documents, what will he be able to do in these new conditions? As I understand it, he will be able to do very little. He will not be able to direct the local authority to comply with his housing density plan. If I am wrong, I can be corrected. It is critical because when we come to later amendments, I will be dealing with density, which is at the heart of the problem when it comes to affordable housing.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000202"></a><b><a name="70508-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0705092000473"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I cannot comment on individual cases. We are talking about planning rather than housing. We can have a discussion on densities later. My understanding is that the Mayor cannot impose certain densities. I think it would be better if we were to address that when we come to the planning debate, and I can then talk about it in its context.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000204"></a>However, I shall ask her now about Amendment No. 87ZA, which she said was unnecessary because there is a provision in the Bill for consultation. Paragraph (b) of that amendment is most relevant here because it requires that the Mayor has regard to the effect of his proposals on local functions. As I read the Bill, the Mayor has to have regard to the effect on other regions and to the Secretary of State&#146;s guidance. I wonder whether I can ask her to comment on that rather narrow, but possibly important, point now, or later, if that is easier.</p>

I was pleased that she accepted the principle of Amendment No. 87. I shall make a few comments on some of the things that have been said.</p>

<p><a name="07061352000001"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned that it is not just London that was affected, although it was discussed a lot. Members of the Committee know that I represent an area just outside London, in Essex. I must tell the Committee that all the boroughs and counties around London have formed a unit that, at the moment, I am likely to chair, which will deal with the problems of London housing, London itself, the M25 and all the other associated matters. Because of the increased powers of the Mayor and with all the authorities around London, we feel that an all-party group&#151;it may not be quite so all-party after last week; I have not worked that out yet&#151;will be working together to deal with some of the problems.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000207"></a>I was pleased to hear the noble Baroness say that not only London is affected. There is also the Thames

People have talked about London house prices, but a one-bedroom flat in Chelmsford now costs &#163;200,000. An estate has just been built in the village adjacent to mine where four-bedroom houses&#151;admittedly they are on a nice bit of land&#151;cost &#163;1.5 million each. So London prices are applying not just in London but are spreading throughout the whole south-east.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000208"></a>Much of the problem is that too much bureaucracy is being built into the whole system. I would say that, wouldn&#146;t I? The noble Baroness was not the Minister in charge when we dealt with the recent planning Bill, but we gather that there will be another such Bill. Planning permissions have virtually dried up because of local development frameworks and various other things. Generally, not many planning permissions are being given for housing anywhere. We are obviously resisting the number of houses that our area might be expected to take over the next 15 years, but building will dry up because not enough planning permissions are being given. Therefore, whether we are talking about London or the areas around London, in the next few years houses will become more expensive because, if the economy stays fairly strong, not enough will be built to meet demand due to the planning system. This situation desperately needs to be looked at.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000209"></a>I am afraid that I am going to be very critical here in relation to a local problem. We would have built some affordable housing in Basildon but I am afraid to tell the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, that English Partnerships has delayed it by five years because of the bureaucracy attached. I wrote to the Chancellor at the time that he was talking about affordable houses being built. I am all for affordable houses and will build as many as I can in Essex, provided we can reduce the amount of bureaucracy involved. That is what we are trying to do through some of these amendments. We believe that the Mayor must have a strategic plan and that boroughs should provide their share of affordable housing.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000210"></a>We are where we are after 10 years of a Labour Government, and, as a party, we are looking at how we can build more affordable houses in the future. This is an issue that concerns us all, whether we are talking about a London borough, the City of London, Greater London or all the areas around London. I was disappointed by some of the comments today because I think that we are more committed to building affordable housing than virtually anyone else. It is just a case of reducing the amount of bureaucracy, making the system simpler and getting the necessary planning permissions and the money. The road and school infrastructure costs are now around &#163;20,000 per unit, and I am told that the costs of drainage and water and so on are also &#163;20,000 a unit. So it costs &#163;40,000 for one unit before the building starts, and getting the money for the infrastructure will become increasingly difficult.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000211"></a>As with a lot of the Thames Gateway, many of the houses that we are talking about will be built on the flood plain, and that will create difficult problems and

We all want to get on with this, so let us ensure that in the amendments and the legislation we create the framework for the Mayor to have the strategic plan and the boroughs to deliver on it. The boroughs will deliver more because they are the local groups, just as the towns were delivering in the areas around London.</p>

As with most of the planning provisions in the Bill, we are opposed to this measure, which we see as taking power away from local communities.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000220"></a>The strength of local development schemes is the individuals and bodies from a particular area who are the architect of its overall development. Decisions are taken by those with comprehension of the character and history of the surroundings. It puts development largely in the hands of those who live and work locally and have a grasp of particular needs, both residential and commercial. It also takes account of the consultation and involvement of the local communities within them.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000221"></a>There is certainly a fairly widespread belief that the Mayor cannot possibly always be well enough apprised of the particular circumstances to make a valid judgment on a scheme. I hasten to add that while I do not accuse anybody of incompetence, it is an inevitable side effect of the vast number of planning, development and housing decisions the Mayor takes on. It is best that strategies are devised not by the Mayor but by representatives directly elected by the people and those who will be most affected by the development. I am talking specifically about the Mayor&#146;s ability to deal with local development schemes.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000222"></a>There is already a check on this as the Secretary of State is able to direct changes to the plan. Clause 30 would simply be further centralisation of development powers by allowing the Mayor the opportunity to write in changes. If there is sensible justification for allowing the Secretary of State such a power, that is not necessarily the case with the Mayor as it is more likely that he will want to promote his overall planning strategy.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000223"></a>We therefore oppose this provision affecting local development schemes. We believe that it will make the process more complicated by adding a new level of intervention. Local authorities should have the right to ensure that their local development schemes are adopted.</p>

I want to go back to the Candy &amp; Candy development which was, in the end, based on decisions taken by councillors in Westminster. It provides us with a very good example of why the Mayor should have more responsibilities in this area&#151;far more than the Government are giving him. </p>

<a name="70508-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000225"></a>Under the policy of the London plan, I understand that in the central activity zone, the affordable housing component in development, depending on the size of the development, is to be 30 per cent and, outside those areas, 50 per cent. It is quite simple to get round that. The 30 per cent in the Candy &amp; Candy development turned into 11.8 per cent within the CAZ. That was because the flats built in the private part of the development were huge while those built in the affordable housing section of the development were minuscule. Whereas people in London imagine that 30 per cent of the developer&#146;s development is accorded to social housing, it was 11.8 per cent in that development. I understand that that is also the case in other developments within the Westminster area and I presume that it is the same in other London boroughs. Let me explain the figures which lead me to that conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000226"></a>The Bowater House development, where I want the Mayor to have more power&#151;not less, which is the position of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, in this clause stand part debate&#151;consisted of 82 flats in the private part and 70 flats in the social housing section. Of the 70 social housing flats, 41 were less than  600 square feet and the balance of 29 varied between 600 and just more than 1,000 square feet. In the private part of the development, 18 of the 82 flats were 900 square feet, 15 were 1,500 to 2,100 square feet and 52 flats were 3,300 to 16,500 square feet. Someone told me that those larger flats were selling for somewhere between &#163;35 million and &#163;80 million each. I find the figures unbelievable. Maybe the figure is the lower one of &#163;35 million, but I am sure I shall be challenged by the Candy &amp; Candy people when the proceedings of this Committee are drawn to their attention.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000227"></a>My point is that the social housing element is not 30 per cent or 50 per cent, but is based on the number of units. Ken Livingstone, as Mayor&#151;I hope he has people here today&#151;should look at that. That is the way developers get round the system. It means that developers such as Candy &amp; Candy bully the local authority into minimising the amount of social housing and, at the same time, they offer the maximum number of units. In this case, 70 flats were for social housing, but that was only 11.8 per cent of the development. Then they interfere with the social

In this case, the Bowater House development was to take place in Knightsbridge&#151;beautiful, expensive, exquisite Knightsbridge. They did not want to widen the social mix of people living in the Knightsbridge community, or indeed in any part of Belgravia, or any part of that part of Westminster. They conveniently lifted the social housing package and planted it in the middle, where there was already a good balance between social and private housing; it is roughly 50:50, which I think is an ideal balance.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000228"></a>I was always in favour of the sale of council houses outside London&#151;against the policy of my own party&#151;because I wanted to see balanced communities with a mix between private and social housing, but that is not the case here. With the agreement of the council and, on this occasion, with the agreement of the Mayor of London&#146;s office&#151;I understand it did not have the power to stop them doing what they did&#151;they simply dropped the 70 units of social housing provision in a part of Westminster where there was already a balance, and it upset the local community. The Conservative councillors were brought in to argue with them, saying, &#147;Why are you doing this?&#148; Of course, they could not answer because it is unanswerable. The facts are that the policy, as far as Westminster was concerned, was to rarefy the social atmosphere even more within Westminster by concentrating the private part with the vastly expensive flats in Knightsbridge and ensuring that the social housing was simply placed in another area which destabilised the social dynamics of that area. That policy does not work.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000229"></a>The noble Baroness will make the matter worse. By deleting this clause, she wants to reinforce and strengthen the power of the local council&#151;she calls it the local community&#151;as she says it understands more. It does not. The Conservative councillors in the ward where the social housing was put in Westminster were not even aware of what had happened in their local authority. I know because I went to the meeting and I interviewed a chap. He did not know what had happened, and when he answered the questions that he was asked by people at the meeting he did not have enough knowledge to recognise what was happening in terms of the social engineering by the planning authority in Westminster.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000230"></a>I want to make a little recommendation for Ken and his successors, whoever they may be. When they consider big planning applications coming in under the new arrangements, they should ensure that the documentation relating to social and affordable housing is part of the application and not put with Section 106 agreements, such as the one that I have here that talks in general terms about the fact that some sort of social housing provision is going to be made. It does not say when that is going to happen. It sets down certain criteria, but when I tried to find out this morning whether they had actually been enforced, I was unable to do so. It sets out in the most general of terms the circumstances in the Section 106 agreement under Schedule 1, and that is not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000231"></a>The Mayor should see the detail of the affordable housing component running in tandem with the original private development application so that he can make a balanced judgment as to what that social housing component is and whether he can use his powers to influence the process in some way and maximise the number of units. We do not want those calculations based on the 11.8 per cent principle, as happened in this case. If we are talking 30 per cent, let us have 30 per cent of all the footage available in the development going to social housing. We do not even need 50 per cent in those conditions and can do with a lesser figure based on a real footage calculation, not simply on the basis of the number of units.</p>

My personal view is that if boroughs have agreed a proportion of affordable housing, they need the confidence to stick to it, as well as everyone else involved.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000233"></a>Can the Minister explain the problem with Clause 30? I have some difficulty understanding the need for it. Local development documents must be in general conformity with the London plan. The boroughs can ask whether the Mayor thinks that a document is in general conformity and so on. The Mayor can give an opinion and, if he does so, the borough has an examination-in-public procedure to go through and will be able to adopt the documents only in accordance with an EIP report.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000234"></a>Generally, I support giving powers that are currently with the Secretary of State to the Mayor, but what has led to the need for Clause 30? Is it a need for tidying up? Is there some concern about the current process, including the examinations in public, or&#151;which is, of course, what the fear will be&#151;does the Mayor need the mechanism to have greater control? I hope that the Minister can flesh this out by giving the background to it.</p>

If the Minister will allow me to make a brief intervention, I should like to make it clear that I am not briefed by Westminster City Council. Indeed, I did not know that this matter was to be raised until I came back from the Scottish Parliament Statement a moment ago which, for those who did not have the privilege of hearing it, will be  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC156"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>well worth reading in <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow. Therefore, I am speaking independently. I have views about affordable housing that are not dissimilar to those that I have already heard expressed. Mr Matthew Parris once devoted one of his parliamentary sketches to the fact that the Father of the House, Tam Dalyell, and I had both performed like dinosaurs and how very refreshing it was that there were still dinosaurs in the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000239"></a>When the Mayor took office, he invited a distinguished former director of Shelter to carry out just such a survey across the whole of London. I am sure there are people in this Room who will remember that survey. I was still a Member of Parliament and was invited to attend the Westminster City Council session lasting a couple of hours in which the former director of Shelter asked questions and Westminster presented a case. When I saw the overall recommendation of the director of Shelter about what the percentage of affordable housing should be in such planning applications, I could not see how Westminster would be able to achieve it. I knew the district valuer&#146;s views on land values in Westminster and the implications that they would have for how much affordable housing could be afforded and where it would go. There is some danger in this debate, particularly when we take individual cases, of getting bogged down in the same state of unreality as attended the Scottish Parliament Statement a moment or two ago.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000240"></a><b><a name="70508-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0705092000484"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This has been an interesting debate, veering wildly from the general to the very specific. Clause 30 relates to local development schemes prepared by London boroughs. These are their work programmes which guide them when they are preparing their new-style development plans. The clause is needed because it is about improving the process. It is not concerned with the content of plans, which is why we will have difficulty addressing the specific issues raised by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. However, I will come to that later. The clause is essentially about process, which is why I will have to give a brief account of the process and why the clause is relevant to it.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000241"></a>We have a plan-led system of planning in this country, meaning that decisions on planning applications are taken in accordance with the policies in development plans unless there are sensible reasons to do otherwise. Within this system is a hierarchy of plans, with national policies setting the context for regional plan policies, which in London&#146;s case is the Mayor&#146;s London plan, and local development frameworks having to be in general conformity with the regional plan policies. As the plans go through, they are accompanied by rigorous consultation and are independently examined.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000242"></a>However, for the system to work effectively, it is crucial to ensure that borough development plans are up to date and are amended to reflect changes in policies at the regional and national level. Boroughs cannot always respond very quickly&#151;London is generally in a better position than the rest of the country&#151;but some borough-level plans have not been

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000243"></a>The Government first sought to address the problem through the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 by introducing a requirement for local planning authorities to prepare a local development scheme setting out the documents that they will prepare as part of their local development framework&#151;a suite of documents that address different parts of the process&#151;their subject matter and the timetable for preparing the documents. The 2004 Act gave a power for the Secretary of State to direct changes to the scheme.</p>
<h5><a name="0705092000415"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000244"></a>Clause 30 takes this further simply to reflect the unique governance arrangements in London. It makes provision for the Mayor to be able to direct amendments to the boroughs&#146; schemes or to require the boroughs to prepare a revision to their LDS without having to ask the Secretary of State to do so on his behalf. To achieve that, Clause 30 amends the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 to require boroughs to send a copy of their draft LDSs to the Mayor at a time to be prescribed in regulations or when directed to do so by the Mayor. The power must be exercised personally by the Mayor and cannot be delegated to others, but it does not extend to the Mayor being able to direct the content of a borough&#146;s development plan. It is simply about allowing the Mayor to ensure that policies dealing with the key policy areas in his London plan are brought forward by the boroughs in a timely manner. For example, if a borough is slow in developing an affordable housing policy, the Mayor can gee it up by using the power as a way of saying, &#147;We want that plan and we want it as fast as possible&#148;. It is a question of keeping a watch on matters. The power applies to the sort of plans that the Mayor has a legitimate interest in being furthered.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000245"></a>With regard to the circumstances under which the Mayor might make a direction to bring forward a plan that is slow or missing, our intention is that he may do so to ensure that a borough brings forward policies that reflect the London plan&#146;s priorities for, say, regeneration of a particular area. However, the clause also requires the Mayor to have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State when considering whether to issue a direction, and it requires any direction to contain the Mayor&#146;s reasons for making it. He will have to take account of the resource implications for the boroughs and local priorities in carrying out that work. It requires a reality check. We expect directions to be used as a last resort, with discussion resolving differences wherever possible.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000246"></a>The borough concerned must comply with the direction, subject to a power for the Secretary of State to direct the borough to disregard the direction or to give effect to it, subject to modifications. To allow the Secretary of State to decide whether to issue a direction, the clause requires the Mayor to copy his direction to the Secretary of State and it prevents the borough bringing the LDS into effect until a  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC158"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prescribed time. The clause requires any direction from the Secretary of State to contain the reasons for giving it and it must be copied to the Mayor. The Secretary of State&#146;s continued involvement is intended as a safeguard to be used if, for example, national policy priorities are not reflected in borough work programmes or where it is proposed that key policies that should be set out in a development plan document and undergo independent examination are, instead, to be set out in a supplementary planning document.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000247"></a>This clause is more technical and more restrictive than it appears. The issues regarding densities are important, although I cannot comment on the case raised by my noble friend and it is difficult to have any meaningful debate on such issues. There are many ways in which space standards for housing are controlled and enforced; for example, the Housing Corporation has minimum space standards for dwellings, but they are more generous than those in the private sector. Our new Planning Policy Statement 3 sets a minimum housing density standard of  30 dwellings per hectare. The London plan sets different densities for different parts of London. My noble friend said that we should look at floor space rather than units. We can argue that point; indeed, different methods are being discussed. Developments of very low density would in any case be caught by minimum density requirements. I cannot have that debate with my noble friend today in the context of this clause but, given his concerns, I suggest that we have a private conversation with relevant officials in the department and that we pursue the issues that he has raised in that way. I hope that noble Lords will feel able to withdraw their opposition to the clause.</p>

It is another Candy &amp; Candy development, and the rumour in Pimlico is that once again the council is trying to offload in some way its affordable social housing responsibilities.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000249"></a>Whatever we do, the system will be tested by the legislation, depending on when the application comes in&#151;and, if it is not tested by the legislation, it will be tested by the arrangements that are in place. I want to know whether the Mayor of London and his office will use his and its teeth on this occasion to ensure that we get the maximum amount of affordable housing into that development.</p>

I have no intention of commenting on the Westminster situation, except to say that the issues relating to the development of land in London are very special. It is largely to do with the price and lack of availability of land. One aspect of my amendment to Clause 30 related to local development plans.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000251"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for her explanation about the technical nature of the provisions. I shall consider the matter further before bringing anything back, but I am bound to say that the bureaucracy engulfing local development plans is completely counterproductive. I believe I am right in saying that there are still only two local development plans in the country that have been passed and are operating. The rest are still operating on the unitary development plans, because the system is taking so long to wind its way through that it is just not achieving what it set out to achieve. We all saw that coming when we discussed the planning Bill. This simply puts another impediment into the process: the plan has to go to the Mayor and the Secretary of State, the Mayor has to advise the Secretary of State on what he thinks, then it has to come back again to the borough. I do not know how long that will take, but it will probably not be days or weeks&#151;it could be months&#151;and it is another problem in getting these development plans up and running.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000252"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for describing exactly what is going to happen, but it has made me a little more nervous about the process. It is now absolutely engrained in the whole local development plan system that there is far too much bureaucracy and far too many steps. The plans are useless as they stand because they do not advise anyone on anything very much. However, for today&#146;s purposes, I shall not oppose Clause 30.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000256"></a>The planning part of the Bill has exercised us greatly. It is the area in which the Mayor is being given more power than any other part of the Bill and it could potentially leave Londoners open to planning applications being considered away from them. As the Minister knows, we favour more freedom for the boroughs, increased co-operation between them and more flexibility in the market.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000257"></a>However, the extension of powers given by Part 7 is alarming, not least because, as my honourable friend  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC160"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Michael Gove pointed out in the other place, the Mayor has already expressed an opinion about 12,000 planning applications since he took office. His powers are barely restrained by legislation. There may have been persuasive oratory about the approach that the Mayor is likely to take in exercising his powers, but unless his role is clearly defined and controlled, that will matter little. This is part of the motivation for Amendment No. 91.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000258"></a>The principle behind Amendment No. 93 and some of the amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding is important. It is clearly to define and restrict at an appropriate level what constitutes an application of strategic importance. I have read the draft town and country planning order, which purports to define &#147;strategic importance&#148;, and I think we will be in a court of law trying to define what that is. It is not clear, and it is not clear in the regulations either. I hope that by the time we get there somebody will have had a better effort at it. My amendment clearly defines and restricts at an appropriate level what constitutes an application of strategic importance. There is real concern about how often the Mayor can intervene in applications that are not genuinely of strategic or citywide importance. There are nearly 200 targets in the London plan that applications are expected to meet. It is inconceivable that an application could meet all of them. There is consequential concern that the Mayor could use failure to reach certain targets as an excuse to intervene. Amendment No. 95 is included because there is no reason for the Mayor to have to add officers concerned with planning enforcement to his employees.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000259"></a>The Mayor&#146;s proposed planning powers are too wide ranging and poorly defined. The areas in which he can intervene under these provisions will cause great difficulties to local authorities. We have had more correspondence on the subject of these planning provisions than on any other part of the Bill, and it behoves us to ensure that we have them detailed and sorted out before we finish with this Bill. I beg to move.</p>

As I explained earlier, it was partly because I am not sure how much of what is going on I can hear accurately, but I do my best.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000261"></a>I have five amendments in this group and I hope that the Committee will bear with me if I spend a few moments explaining what they are about. They are all of enormous importance to the planning regime in the City of London. I shall start with a quotation from a very interesting article in today&#146;s <I>Financial Times</I> by Sir Stuart Lipton, who has perhaps contributed more to the development of the City&#151;a greatly praised contribution&#151;than almost anyone else. He writes:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0705092000394"></a>&#147;The City of London's planning regime has played a vital role. It is the only local planning authority whose elected members have a direct representative link with the business community.

<a name="70508-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000262"></a>I shall first address Amendment No. 92A to Clause 31(2), which inserts a new Section 2A into the Town and Country Planning Act. Subsection (2) of that new section provides that a direction by the Mayor that he should take over the role of local planning authorities in deciding planning applications must include the reasons why the Mayor is giving the direction. However, the Bill does not say anything about the nature of the reasons and, in particular, about how convincing they need to be.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000263"></a>I acknowledge that some guidance is to be found in Article 3 of the draft Town and Country Planning (Mayor of London) Order and some of the discussion we will have may be more relevant to the order than to the Bill. However, the Bill is the only opportunity we have to say anything about it. The order states that in deciding whether to give a direction, the Mayor is to take account of the extent to which the local planning authority is complying with the targets set out in his spatial development strategy for the capital, the so-called London plan. Although that is welcome, it is only one reason and neither the Bill nor the draft order state that it will be the only one. If the Major is to give a direction that he is going to take over an application falling within any of the categories of application listed in the draft order, it needs to be really clear why he is doing so. Article 8(1) of the draft order states that the Mayor may take over a planning application from a local planning authority, </p>
<ul><a name="0705092000402"></a>&#147;if he considers that any of the issues raised by the development to which the application relates is of such a nature or scale that there would be a significant impact on the implementation of the spatial development strategy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0705092000361"></a>Those are very broad words indeed and they could be stretched to cover a multitude of circumstances. I am not at all clear how that could be translated into reasons for taking over an application in any given case.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000264"></a>To reduce the extent of the elastic and to provide greater definition, Subsection (1) of Amendment No. 92A makes clear that there should be sound planning reasons for taking an application away from the local planning authority and subsection (2) enables those reasons to be clarified through the order. It may be that the Minister is proposing that this sort of issue should be dealt with through planning guidance and that may well be a perfectly acceptable way of doing it. It would be helpful if, in her reply, the Minister could give us some indication of her plans in that regard.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000265"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 92B, which deals with timeliness. This amendment and others in this group arise from the terms of the draft order. It proposes that if the local planning authority has not determined a planning application within 16 weeks, the applicant can ask the Mayor to take the application over. That is under Article 8(5)(a) of the order. My amendment extends that period to 20 weeks. The provision in the draft order appears to want to make sure that planning authorities process  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC162"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>applications efficiently, and we would all support that. However, the time limit for processing applications before the ability of the Mayor to take them over is triggered is not understandable. The order proposes 16 weeks, which is simply too short a period for the kind of complex planning application of strategic importance with which the Mayor would be concerned. It may be perfectly all right for the general run of planning applications, but here, particularly with regard to developments in the City, we are, by definition, dealing with what could be complex and time-consuming processes for the City&#146;s council to deal with.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000266"></a>The Government&#146;s own targets recognise that there has to be some flexibility about this because their performance target for local planning authorities requires only 60 per cent of major planning applications to be determined within the 13 weeks that apply to them. For the remaining 40 per cent, there is clearly some recognition that the time may be extended. It is a reasonable assumption that the Mayor will be dealing, by definition, with the more complex and therefore time-consuming applications. A suspicious mind might wonder whether, as the order is currently written, that is an indirect method of getting the local planning authority bypassed. However, I do not believe that that is the case, because I believe that the Ministers involved in this recognised the importance of the City&#146;s planning regime, both as a planning authority in London and for the country as a whole. Therefore, to impose an unreasonably short time limit in this will lead to greater uncertainty and, therefore, inefficiency in the planning system.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000267"></a>Perhaps I may mention one or two figures. In the City of London over the past 20 years, 4.4 million square metres of office floor space has been constructed. That is three times the amount that has been built at Canary Wharf and, of course, it is in an infinitely more challenging environment. There have been hardly any appeals on planning applications on grounds of non-determination. On the basis of that experience, the City is entitled to be of the view that a more reasonable period would enable the planning authority to process a major application before mayoral involvement. The period that I have suggested in the amendment is 20 weeks, which I hope will be acceptable.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000268"></a>Amendments Nos. 93A and 94A are intended to take up the points that noble Lords will remember I raised in my Second Reading speech&#151;the question of the thresholds that should be met before a planning application is regarded as being of potential strategic importance. The order which governs the Mayor&#146;s current limited power to intervene in planning applications by directing a refusal already differentiates the City from the rest of London in terms of the size and height of the buildings. For the City, the height threshold is 75 metres and the size threshold is 30,000 square metres of floor space. By comparison, for central London outside the City, the threshold is 30 metres and 20,000 square metres. Outside central London, it is 25 metres and 15,000 square metres. Therefore, Parliament already recognises the distinctiveness of the situation in the City.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC163"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000269"></a>Amendment No. 93A increases the thresholds for the City triggering mayoral involvement to a height of 150 metres or 100,000 square metres of additional floor space. Of course, that will not apply right across the City. One amendment in this group seeks to protect the Thames-side environment, which has always been recognised as having to be maintained. It is also right to point out that there are many other restrictions on development in the City and I need mention only one, which I think noble Lords will recognise&#151;the question of being able to maintain the views of St Paul&#146;s. Whatever the size of the building, I remember the cry of horror that went up when those buildings were erected on the north side of Fleet Street many years ago and obscured St Paul&#146;s from a long distance.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000270"></a>I think that the restrictions that now apply within the City of London are much more effective, and they will go. Indeed, I am told that something like 60 per cent of the City is already covered by these other restrictions. Here I am looking for something comparatively limited in relation to that part of the City where there are already very tall buildings. I listed some of those buildings when I spoke at Second Reading. In that sort of area, the existing limits on height and floor space are totally inappropriate. We are seeking to increase the limits to 150 metres and 100,000 square metres, as set out in the amendment. At Second Reading, I listed a number of the buildings. I certainly would not dream of taking time to list them again as they are all on the record. Then, the Minister was kind enough to say that she recognised that the Government were committed to getting the thresholds right and that they were considering whether changes were justified. I hope that she will be able to share with us her latest thinking on that. As I said, this is a matter for the order and not for the Bill, but we can raise the issue only by amending the Bill.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000271"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 93B. When the order was published with the Bill in another place, it had what has come to be called a catch-all provision, and has given rise to a great deal of anxiety. It proposes that a development of more than 2,500 square metres&#151;that is smaller than some of the apartments listed a few moments ago by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours&#151;which does not accord with one or more of the provisions of the development plan for the area, should trigger the mayoral reference process because it is of potential strategic importance. It should not be regarded as of potential strategic importance at that low level and certainly not because it happens to contravene one of the very many planning policies that the City may have.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000272"></a>At Second Reading, the Minister indicated that changes will be made to the draft order. She said that, </p>
<ul><a name="0705092000403"></a>&#147;the new power should not apply to the vast majority of thresholds set out in parts 3 and 4 of the schedule&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/3/07; col. 1701.]</ul>
<p><a name="0705092000362"></a>Although we have yet to see the new draft order, I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that this provision will be within what she called the &#147;vast majority&#148;. That catch-all provision is giving rise to wide anxiety.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC164"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000273"></a>I offer the Committee two more quotes. One is from Ed Balls, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, who said last April at the London Development Agency conference,</p>
<ul><a name="0705092000404"></a>&#147;we ... face the challenge of implementing the GLA Bill, now moving to the Lords, and ensuring that the devolution of powers to the city level works to the benefit of London&#146;s economy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0705092000363"></a>If that catch-all provision were to be operated as drafted, I do not think that Mr Balls&#146;s hopes will be realised. My last quotation is from Sir Stuart Lipton in the <I>Financial Times</I>. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0705092000395"></a>&#147;The priority must be to ensure that the City&#146;s planning system remains quick and certain, with schemes only referred to the mayor in exceptional circumstances because of their strategic importance to the capital. The mayor has indicated that this is the approach he will take, but this is not reflected in the proposed legislation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0705092000364"></a>Therefore, if that is the intention of Ministers and of the Mayor, we must have amendments.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000274"></a><b><a name="70508-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0705092000489"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> My name is down to oppose the question that Clause 31 stand part. It may be convenient to speak fairly broadly, as noble Lords have done within the detail of their amendments. I have approached the matter this way because I find it hard to see how this and subsequent clauses can be amended satisfactorily. To a large extent, the clause hangs on the statutory instrument. I am aware that the Minister wants to hear what is said by Members of the Committee about the draft before publishing an amended order. I am grateful for that because it is hard for Government within the current rules to consult on an order such as this. It points up the difficulty of dealing with secondary legislation which we cannot amend.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000275"></a>I suppose the Government might say that I have seen in some of the lobbying we have received that it is good to deal with these matters in secondary legislation because that is more easily dealt with and amended at a future date than primary legislation. That is not a view that I support.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000276"></a>Perhaps I can ask a similar question to that which I asked on Clause 30. What is the problem and what research and assessment has there been about the current system, which has not been in place for so very long? There is quite a lot of anecdote, but I am not aware of any rigorous assessment having taken place. The Mayor has the policy powers. As I understand it, the Government think that there is a problem in relying on the boroughs for implementation of his policy, but is that any different from the relationship between national planning policies of central government and other local planning authorities? What is the problem that the clause seeks to address?</p>
<h5><a name="0705092000417"></a>7pm</h5>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000277"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, referred to paragraph 8 of the draft order. I shall not spend time talking about confusing size of development and its strategic importance. Mr Raynsford, who is the architect of the original arrangements in London, dealt with that extremely effectively in the Commons&#151;as I listen to myself, I sound patronising. The new policy test is in paragraph 8. It seems that if  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC165"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Mayor considers that any of the issues are of such a nature or scale that there would be a significant impact on the implementation of the spatial development strategy, the test, as it is expressed, opens up the possibility of a subjective judgment on the part of the Mayor. It does not meet the test of clarity&#151;we have heard that said already. If we were to end up with an order in these terms, would the Wednesbury test of reasonableness apply to the Mayor&#146;s judgment under paragraph 8(1)?</p>

<p><a name="0705092000278"></a><b><a name="70508-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0705092000490"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> If you&#146;re lucky, it will be the other way round.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000279"></a><b><a name="70508-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0705092000491"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> Noises from the wings.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000280"></a>I wonder whether, in bringing forward this order and these clauses, the Government are indicating that there is some failure in the London plan process. We have a hierarchy of documents, about which we have heard in the context of the previous clause. Does it reflect some failure in the process or a determination to allow the Mayor to intervene to a far greater extent than Parliament envisaged when it put the primary legislation in place?</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000281"></a>Paragraph 8(1) of the draft order uses the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="0705092000405"></a>&#147;significant impact on implementation of the spatial development strategy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0705092000365"></a>Paragraph 8(3) refers to consideration of the targets in the spatial development strategy. I have considerable doubts whether the referral of planning applications, which is envisaged, should be the mechanism for implementing the London plan. If the hierarchy is working properly, the appropriate method is negotiations with the boroughs on their suite of documents.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000282"></a>I know that the Mayor has provided many of your Lordships with briefing on this and other parts of the Bill. I do not dispute that he has dealt with a number of important matters in that briefing, but I doubt whether the Bill can address them. He refers to the low rate of planning approvals at 75 per cent&#151;and here I say that I doubt whether the Bill should address them. What are we to understand from that comment other than that the Mayor would approve applications that the boroughs would not approve? They are, after all, working to development plans that conform to the spatial development strategy, so there is confusion there.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000283"></a>The Mayor refers to lack of speed. Many noble Lords who have been in local government will be accustomed to the argument about speed versus quality, and it has been said that the proposed new arrangements will add to the procedures and the time that is taken. He refers, too, to affordable housing, and I agree that there is a desperate need. However, he refers to the number of completions, which, if noble Lords will forgive the pun, I do not think is a complete issue. I do not think that the number of completions can be said to show that a borough is failing. The picture is no doubt very complex.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000284"></a>To take a position that I do not much like to admit to, developers could decide not to proceed with a scheme because of the social housing content. These  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC166"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>things are complicated. There is an argument that the Mayor will intervene in a small number of cases, and I dare say that that is so. The process will mean&#151;as I think it already does&#151;that developers know what the Mayor can do; they know what is in his mind and take that into account before an application is ever made. They take steps to preclude their application reaching that stage. In part that is a good thing, but I am not sure that the logic stacks up. The Mayor also says that the system is clear&#151;and I have written an exclamation mark against that.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000285"></a>The vast majority of planning applications will remain with the boroughs, we are told. Well, yes, of course they will&#151;because most applications are really very tiny. He says that the London Assembly has the power to scrutinise his decisions. That is true, but it is after the event&#151;and, in any event, is scrutiny the appropriate tool with which to deal with a quasi-judicial decision? He also says that if the Mayor took over a large number of applications, there would be resource implications that would have to be agreed by the Assembly, suggesting that the Assembly can stop that happening. We have already debated the inadequacy of the Assembly&#146;s powers to limit the Mayor&#146;s budget.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000286"></a>To sum up, along with London Councils the majority of the Assembly&#151;and here I take off my Liberal Democrat hat or at least add to it my Assembly hat&#151;does not support the exemption of planning powers. It says that if they are to be extended, the Bill should be amended to ensure that intervention is limited to genuinely strategic planning matters. That point of view was expressed nem con.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000287"></a><b><a name="70508-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0705092000492"></a>Baroness Valentine:</b> I shall give a tiny bit of context, which we already know. London needs to respond to huge population and economic growth and we need an increased rate of residential and commercial development to respond to that. The planning system is clearly crucial to that. London First was very concerned about the proposal to give the Mayor positive planning powers&#151;indeed, originally it was against those proposals. There was no desire to give the Mayor in spirit strategic direction, but there were deep concerns about how that would work in practice. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, touched on some of the bureaucracy concerns.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000288"></a>London First is deeply concerned about how the measures will work in practice and has spent a great deal of time over the past six months or so discussing with all parties&#151;developers, the national Government, London government and the boroughs&#151;the detail of the draft Mayor of London order and the Bill itself.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000289"></a>In that context, I want to comment on one amendment in particular but also on some of the others. We have been working very hard to create a simple system which leaves as much as possible of the planning process with the boroughs and gives as much clarity as possible to the developers about how the process will work. They have the obvious concerns about the ping-pong effect between London government and the boroughs. As the Bill stands, we feel broadly that the consensus has been reached and that it is extremely dangerous to tweak bits because certain parts of it will break off.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000290"></a>Amendment No. 93, which would add a geographic test, causes me great concern. It would simply add complexity. Various words are recommended&#151;&#147;substantial&#148;, &#147;sound&#148;, and so on&#151; but they simply obfuscate the process. The simpler and fewer the words in the relevant section, the better. I support the provision as it stands.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000291"></a>I believe that what Amendment No. 91 is seeking is sufficiently covered in current legislation, guidance and case law and that it is not necessary. On Amendment No. 95, if the Mayor is to be the planning authority, I should have thought he would need the right to enforce, although I hope that that would in most circumstances be delegated to the borough.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000292"></a>I am deeply concerned about the second half of Amendment No. 93. As I said about proposed subsection (4A), I fear that it will add to the complexity of the matter. I agree with proposed subsection (4B), which covers the change in the thresholds for the City of London. The City is a special case&#151;it is certainly one of the better planning authorities in London&#151;and these proposals seem appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000293"></a><b><a name="70508-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0705092000493"></a>Lord Harris of Haringey:</b> I had been planning to make my remarks on the planning provisions in the Bill on the next group of amendments until the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, addressed her remarks to this group. I will not burden the Committee with the same remarks twice.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000294"></a>I declare an interest in that I managed to serve 24 years on a London borough council without ever sitting on a planning committee, and I approach planning issues with that degree of detail. This section of the Bill and this group of amendments get to the heart of what having a strategic authority in London is all about. The very principle of arguing for the creation of a London-wide elected strategic authority in the run-up to 2000 was to enable some of those big strategic development issues that face the capital city to be addressed, and addressed decisively and effectively.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000295"></a>It follows that the Mayor must have strategic powers which enable whoever the office-holder is to ensure that whatever the vision that that Mayor brings to the capital city, it can be taken forward. It has always seemed anomalous that the Mayor had the power to direct refusal for strategic planning applications but not approval.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000296"></a>I can understand the concerns that planning decisions are effectively taken by one person, although when matters are appealed to the Secretary of State, essentially the same thing happens. I can understand the concerns that this would effectively create a situation in which one person would have the final say on a proposal. But the essential principle is that the Mayor should be able to set a strategic direction for the capital. That is where this part of the Bill is so important.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000297"></a>I recall my time on a London borough council, when there were plenty of instances where the local authority had to make decisions that, in the interests of the borough, meant that some immediate local  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concerns had to be overridden. The analogy is circumstances when a local borough planning committee said that matters could not be determined when the local ward councillors objected. That demonstrates why there should be certain circumstances regarding matters of strategic importance whereby the Mayor of London should have power to direct approval to the London boroughs.</p>
<h5><a name="0705092000418"></a>7.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70508-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000298"></a>This debate about what constitutes &#147;strategic&#148; as regards the amendments is important, and there has been an enormous amount of discussion with London Councils, individual London local authorities, the Mayor&#146;s office and other interested parties as to how that should be achieved. The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, mentioned that. There will be developments to which there is local opposition, but in the greater interest of London as a whole, it will be important that they go ahead. It is essential that the Mayor should have the power to determine those applications.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000301"></a>London is a city that has developed as a series of villages and we have been spared what Baron Hausmann did in terms of Paris, which has perhaps made London a more attractive city. Perhaps I may list the villages in my former constituency. I shall not dwell on the City of London, to which my noble friend Lord Jenkin referred, but there was a moment when it was the fastest-growing area in London. The villages included Belgravia, Millbank, Victoria, Knightsbridge, St James&#146;s and Mayfair. Mayfair was turned into offices in 1941, after being a residential area. An opportunity was provided for it to come back in 1991&#151;and quite a lot of it did, but not all. It is now, despite hedge funds, substantially going back

There is also Bayswater, the Hyde Park estates, St Marylebone and Covent Garden. For reasons to which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, drew attention, I said in the general debate on Kate Barker&#146;s housing review in the Chamber a year or so ago that Soho and Pimlico were the ideal inner-city communities. They were ideal for two reasons: Soho was a marvellous mix of commercial and residential; and, in Pimlico, dukes lived next door to dustmen.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000302"></a>If the Mayor is going to intervene in every decision that he believes to be strategic, without that being defined, the hazard is that we will get a citywide uniformity rather than the individualist flavour that has made London what it is. If we are to preserve that individualism, it is extremely important that the powers should not all be held in one pair of hands.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000303"></a><b><a name="70508-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0705092000495"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I think that I have enough time to answer most of the points that have been raised. I will proceed fairly quickly and deal with the amendments in my own order, if I may, so that I can address them slightly more logically.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000304"></a>Much of what we have been debating is about how we can determine the new powers for the Mayor in relation to the potential strategic importance of applications. We have discussed higher thresholds in the City and whether the Mayor should have any role in the enforcement of planning control. Those issues relate to the powers in Clause 31 for the Mayor to take jurisdiction over certain planning applications.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000305"></a>Let me briefly set the scene, although the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, has more or less done it for me. London is growing and changing at an incredible pace. That brings massive challenges. The need to address those challenges is reflected in the London plan, which sets out our shared vision. We have to meet the future without shrinking from it. That is why, as we have discussed, we are through the new power in Clause 30 enabling the Mayor to ensure that local development plans are taken forward positively.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000306"></a>Let me stress that whether or not the crucial development envisaged in these policies, such as for regeneration, takes place depends on individual decisions on planning applications, which are, rightly, primarily the responsibility of the boroughs as local planning authorities. I very much take the point that the noble Lord has just made about the way in which London has developed. Nothing in this Bill changes that.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000307"></a>The first GLA Bill provided a power for the Mayor to see planning applications of potential strategic importance and, if they were contrary to the London plan or would otherwise prejudice the strategic planning of London, to direct the borough to refuse them. The Mayor has exercised this power with great restraint. In six years, he has carried through 18 directions&#151;an average of three a year. That has not been a heavy-handed use of power at all.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000308"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked why we need these powers now. Have the boroughs failed? This is not about failure. As my noble friend Lord  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC170"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Harris said, it is about enabling the Mayor at this point in the development of London to deliver a positive vision for London as set out in the London plan. His powers so far have been negative ones. We think that this is the right time&#151;indeed, the essential time&#151;to ensure that he can implement his policies in a positive manner.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000309"></a>Clause 31 gives effect to this important change of approach by amending the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to give the Mayor power to direct that certain of those planning applications that are referred to him as being of potential strategic importance should be determined by him in place of the local planning authority. That also applies to the connected applications relating to, for example, listed building approval. There is an additional safeguard. The Mayor will have to have regard to the guidance issued by the Secretary of State and, where a direction is made, to give his reasons for making it.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000310"></a>Clause 31 also provides for secondary legislation to be made enabling the Mayor to exercise enforcement functions. The draft order that we have published to inform the Committee&#146;s consideration sets out the detail of the matters to be considered. I listened to what the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, but let me make our position clear. The detail of how applications of potential strategic importance are defined and how the Mayor should go about this should not be set out in the Bill. Instead of having an unwieldy and inflexible set of arrangements, we believe that that should be placed in secondary legislation. The key elements will be in primary legislation, but practical operation needs to be flexible, which is why the new powers will be set out in secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000311"></a>We need to bear in mind that the process is in two stages. How we define an application as strategically important has been slightly misunderstood. As I said at Second Reading, it is important to recognise that we propose a two-stage process. First, we have set a series of thresholds in the draft Mayor of London order, which will identify applications as being of potential strategic importance by virtue of issues such as size or height. If an application meets a threshold it must be referred to the Mayor by the borough that received it.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000312"></a>These thresholds for referral are based on those already used to trigger referral under the Mayor&#146;s current power. They are well understood by developers and boroughs. On average, the thresholds capture around 300 out of 90,000 applications a year, so we are not talking about a wholesale redistribution of power. Examples of development proposals that would be caught by the thresholds are an application that proposes 500 homes or more or one that proposes a waste management facility with a throughput of more than 50,000 tonnes of waste.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000313"></a>However, it is fair to say that some of the existing thresholds were designed around the Mayor&#146;s power to direct refusal, whereas we want the new power to focus on the developments of most importance for the implementation of the London plan, whether by virtue of the implications of size or because of the  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC171"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>critical need for certain types of development in London, such as affordable housing and waste management.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000314"></a>I announced at Second Reading that we recognised that some of the existing thresholds captured smaller proposals because of the harm they could cause strategic policies such as protection of the green belt rather than on the basis of their contribution to the delivery of the London plan. These are set out in parts 3 and 4 of the order. As such, the Mayor does not need a power to approve such schemes; what is relevant is his power to direct their refusal. Therefore, we announced that the Mayor&#146;s new power will not apply to the majority of the thresholds set out in parts 3 and 4 of the order.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000315"></a>Amendment No. 93A would go further and place an additional limitation on when an application could be judged to be of potential strategic importance by inserting a provision that this could not be the case solely because the application failed to accord with the development plan. I hope that the noble Lord was reassured to some extent by the fact that we will not apply the Mayor&#146;s new power to the majority of parts 3 and 4 of the draft order; the Mayor will not be able to take over any applications just because they depart from the development plan.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000316"></a>However, the fact that an application does not accord with the development plan may itself increase the likelihood of it having damaging impacts at local or regional level. It is legitimate for the Mayor to be able to express a view on some of these applications and, if necessary, direct a borough to refuse it. This has been the situation for the past six years, and there is no evidence, in the City or elsewhere, that it has caused unnecessary problems.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000317"></a>Looking more widely, we have also considered whether new thresholds are needed in certain areas to reflect types of development of particular importance to London, such as on waste. Therefore, we included additional thresholds to allow the Mayor to be consulted on large waste management proposals.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000318"></a>I hope that my comments will reassure the Committee that we have listened very closely to the argument and will continue to listen. Meeting one of the thresholds only identifies an application as being of potential importance; it does not mean that the Mayor will take it over. Whether the application is really of strategic importance will be determined by the second-stage policy test in Article 8 of the draft Mayor of London order, which the Mayor would apply only after the borough has made a draft decision on an application which met the thresholds. Up to this point, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, the policy test we have proposed has been whether the Mayor considers that any of the issues raised by the development to which the application relates is of such a nature and scale that there would be a significant impact on the implementation of the London plan. To be of strategic importance, the application would have to meet the threshold and then satisfy the policy test.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC172"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="0705092000419"></a>7.30 pm</h5>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000319"></a>Amendment No. 93 deals with the content of the policy test and the definition. I do not accept that it is necessary to have the provision in the Bill, but what the amendment proposes is very important.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000320"></a>First, the amendment would introduce a geographic element into the policy test such that an application would need to raise issues that have a substantial effect beyond the borough boundary. As my colleague the Minister for Housing and Planning made clear in the other place, there are strongly held arguments for and against the inclusion of a geographic element&#151;we have heard the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, describe the reaction of London First.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000321"></a>The amendment would have profound implications. The matter therefore needs very careful consideration, and the debate today will form part of that. I cannot say more at this point, but I am sure that we will return to the issue on Report.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000322"></a>Secondly, the amendment would test the impact of the proposal on the London plan. Article 8(1) of the draft Mayor of London order already requires the Mayor clearly to show that a development is of such a nature and scale that there would be a significant impact on the implementation of his London plan. Proposed subsection 4A(b) of the amendment is therefore redundant and is simply an alternative way of expressing what we already propose. Our wording is broader, not least because the amendment would relate to situations only in which the local planning authority intended to grant planning permission. It is equally important for the Mayor to be able to intervene in situations in which refusal of planning permission could have a major impact on the implementation of the London plan.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000323"></a>Thirdly, the amendment, along with Amendment No. 92A, proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, seeks the inclusion of a requirement of sound planning reasons for treating an application as being of potential strategic importance. In another place we agreed to consider whether that could be included in the policy test. I am pleased to confirm to the Committee that we accept the principle behind this change and will include in the policy test in Article 8(1) a requirement that the Mayor should demonstrate that there are sound planning reasons for intervening in an application. That means that the Mayor must take account of the decision that the borough proposes to take in relation to the application and be able to demonstrate why the borough&#146;s draft decision to approve or refuse the planning application is deficient in planning terms such that he would be justified in taking over jurisdiction of the application.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000324"></a>This also means that a Mayor could not intervene in a case for purely political reasons. Planning reasons are those based on the statute-based, plan-led system. To summarise our position, to be of genuine strategic importance an application must first trigger one or more of the thresholds in the Mayor of London order and must demonstrably raise issues that would significantly impact on the implementation of the   


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC173"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>London plan&#151;there must be sound planning reasons for the Mayor to intervene.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000325"></a>The draft order makes clear that, in applying the policy test, the Mayor must take account of the borough&#146;s performance against relevant London plan targets. Currently they relate principally to new housing or affordable housing provision, which should be an important factor in the Mayor&#146;s decision whether to intervene in an application. Given the critical importance of achieving more affordable housing, we are looking at whether there are ways to strengthen this requirement.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000326"></a>Amendments Nos. 93, 93A and 94A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, relate to thresholds for the referral of applications from the City of London. I have previously said we have had helpful meetings on this matter with City leaders and can say that we recognise the unique position of the corporation and the importance of its continued success to the local, regional and national economy and the unique characteristics of the City. I can announce today that we can respond positively to the amendments and will amend the thresholds along the lines sought. This will mean that we are minded to raise the height threshold for buildings in the City to 150 metres, and the floor-space threshold set out in category 1B will be 100,000 square metres.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000327"></a>For the avoidance of doubt, let me be clear: as Amendments Nos. 93 and 93A recognise, it would not be appropriate to apply these new higher thresholds to buildings adjacent to the Thames&#151;I have to disappoint the noble Lord in that respect&#151;given the river&#146;s wider contribution to the character and views of the city. To reflect the unique situation of the Thames, it is not necessary for us to agree to Amendment No. 94A, which introduces an express power for an order under Section 2A to make provision in relation to applications for the erection of buildings adjacent to the Thames, because that power is already encompassed by the wider order-making powers in new Section 2C(1)(a), and the draft Mayor of London Order already sets a specific height threshold of 25 metres for these buildings. That threshold, set out in category 1C of the draft order, will remain for such development proposals.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000328"></a>The only other issue on which I cannot agree with the Opposition is that the new 100,000 square-metre floor space threshold should be in addition to the floor space of any building already on the site. If we were to agree with that and if a 100,000 square-metre building were already on a site, the replacement building would need to be doubled to 200,000 square metres in order to be referable to the Mayor. That would be a step too far.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000329"></a>Amendment No. 93B would have us go further and, in the case of the City, also exclude any applications which depart from the development plan and which propose developments over 2,500 square metres if they are for financial and professional, business or non-residential institutional use. These matters are currently set out in category 3E of the draft order. I cannot accept this change. We believe that we have moved a long way to meet the City&#146;s  


<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC174"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column GC174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concerns. We previously announced that the Mayor&#146;s new power would not apply to the majority of applications in Part 3 of the order, including these, and therefore only the existing power for the Mayor to direct refusal will remain. This provision has operated for the past seven years and we think that we should leave it.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000330"></a>Amendment No. 91 deals with how the Mayor will make decisions. I understand why the noble Baroness has introduced it but I reassure her that it is unnecessary. The position that she wishes to achieve is already a feature of planning legislation. Where any decision-maker, be it a London borough or the Mayor, determines a planning application, they are acting as the local planning authority. As such, they must comply with the requirements of the planning Acts. In relation to the noble Baroness&#146;s concern, Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 requires the decision-maker to determine the application in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000331"></a>Section 38(2) of the 2004 Act made the London plan part of the development plan alongside the borough&#146;s plan. Therefore the decision-maker must take proper account of the policies in both the borough&#146;s development plan and the Mayor&#146;s London plan. Where there is a conflict, there is a clear mechanism in Section 38(5) of the 2004 Act to resolve it in favour of the policy contained in the last document to be adopted. That seems most sensible.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000332"></a>Amendment No. 92B, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, would prevent an order made under Section 2A making provision for an applicant to ask the Mayor to intervene in an application unless the borough had had at least 20 weeks to consider that application. We think it is important that decisions on planning applications are made within a reasonable timescale and we have already set targets in that respect. For major applications of the type referable to the Mayor, the target is that 60 per cent should be determined within 13 weeks. That recognises that some applications will take longer than 13 weeks, and many of the applications that will be subject to the new power will be of this type. Applicants often recognise this and may agree a longer period for the local planning authority to consider an application. However, there are occasions when that does not happen, and there is a case for saying that the applicant should be able to move matters on in these circumstances.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000333"></a>Under existing planning law&#151;Section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990&#151;an applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State if a local planning authority has not made a decision on an application after the requisite period of 13 weeks. Our proposal provides for the applicant to choose after 13 weeks whether to allow the borough more time to consider the application, to appeal to the Secretary of State or to request the Mayor to intervene, if justified. However, I recognise that there may be scope for an applicant to play the borough off against the Mayor. Providing up-front for an additional period may be a possible way out, and I

However, it is important to remember that the Mayor will have to demonstrate that the policy test is satisfied in order to take jurisdiction over the application.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000334"></a>My bout of generosity has come to an end, and I am glad to say that I have almost done so too. However, I am afraid that I am unable to accept Amendment No. 95 because it would open the door to the risk of planning conditions attached to planning permissions granted by the Mayor not being enforced, resulting in development that causes harm to the local environment or the wider planning interests of the capital. That would not be in the interests of the borough, the Mayor or Londoners. It would limit all enforcement powers to the borough and would cause a problem.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000335"></a>The clause does not seek necessarily to substitute the Mayor for the borough in applications decided by the Mayor; rather, it provides for the Mayor to have enforcement functions parallel to the borough. That is a sensible safeguard to ensure development takes place under the terms in which permission was granted.</p>

<a name="70508-gc0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="0705092000336"></a>I know that mayoral involvement in planning applications is not always popular with the boroughs. We want to encourage constructive working arrangements between the Mayor and boroughs. Both have legitimate interests in the planning of London. The powers in Clause 31 provide a balanced approach. I hope that noble Lords who have not been satisfied by my remarks will still feel able not to press their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="0705092000337"></a><b><a name="70508-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0705092000496"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> Given the rate at which the Minister has spoken, it has been very difficult to gather all that has been said.

<p><a name="0705092000338"></a>I am very conscious of the time, as I think was the Minister in her response. These are extremely important clauses.

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_head0"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="0705083000002"></a>Armed Forces: Insurance Scheme</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="0705083000013"></a><b><a name="70508-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0705083000093"></a>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Drayson):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0705083000014"></a>Today, I am announcing that the MoD, in association with Sterling Life, has launched a new voluntary life insurance scheme, Service Life Insurance (SLI). In the run-up to Operation TELIC, life insurance companies reacted to what they saw as the increased risk to service personnel by closing schemes to new applicants, increasing premiums or excluding benefits for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons. The department has been actively pursuing an enduring solution.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0705083000015"></a>The MoD selected Sterling Life through an EU-wide competitive tender process to provide appropriate life insurance for which applications will be accepted from today. SLI guarantees worldwide war and terrorism life cover to all service personnel, by means of a unique partnering agreement between the MoD and Sterling Life. The SLI scheme is designed to be self-funding and the department has accepted a potential liability, which received parliamentary approval in May 2005, for excessive operational deaths.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0705083000016"></a>The SLI scheme complements the excellent death-in-service arrangements already available to service personnel and offers an attractive addition for long-term life insurance requirements for members of our Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0705083000017"></a>SLI premiums are extremely competitive, particularly for those individuals whose military trade usually results in an additional premium being applied. SLI has no extra premiums for any military trade, even such as being a member of a bomb disposal or Special Forces unit. It will accept all regulars and reservists&#151;even if they are on operations or under orders to deploy. Applicants will be accepted without any medical underwriting and SLI will cover all service-recognised hazardous sports. Premium rates are guaranteed not to increase for the life of the policy. These are significant new SLI benefits from Sterling Life.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0705083000018"></a>I am delighted to announce the launch today of this Service Life Insurance scheme, which provides a ground-breaking new choice for all regulars and reservists. I am confident that through our agreement with Sterling Life we have today provided a world-class solution to a worldwide problem. I will arrange for copies of the SLI brochure, which gives further details of the scheme, to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="0705083000035"></a>Malcolm Wicks represented the UK at Part I of the council. The council was chaired by Annette Schavan, German Federal Minister for Education and Research.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="0705083000036"></a>Under the first item, Research Ministers debated the recent Commission Green Paper on the European Research Area. Along with other Ministers, Malcolm Wicks emphasised the importance of this debate on fostering the free movement of knowledge and overcoming fragmentation in Europe, and stressed the need to include consideration of subsidiarity and European added value.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="0705083000037"></a>Under the second item there was a discussion of the proposed European Institute of Technology, where Malcolm Wicks and other Ministers welcomed progress made in negotiations under the German presidency while noting outstanding financial and governance issues to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="0705083000038"></a>In the final item, the German presidency presented a proposal for an IPR charter following a recent Commission communication on knowledge transfer.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="0705083000040"></a>I represented the UK at Part II of the council. The council was chaired by Michael Glos, German Federal Minister for Economics and Technology.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="0705083000041"></a>Under the first item, Ministers discussed Europe's single market and global competition. In particular they focused on factors affecting the attractiveness of the EU as an investment location, noting that the Ernst and Young European attractiveness survey confirms that the EU remains the most attractive region in the world for more than 50 per cent of the companies surveyed. In my intervention I emphasised the economic factors which had made the UK a highly attractive investment location.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="0705083000042"></a>As a second item, Ministers discussed the role of EU state aid in influencing foreign direct investment in the EU. Ministers noted that the Ernst and Young survey recorded that only a relatively small proportion of companies considered state aid was a significant factor in their investment decisions. Commissioner Kroes, myself and a majority of other Ministers who spoke intervened to oppose a presidency suggestion that consideration be given to relaxing EU state aid rules in order to match aid offered by third countries, arguing that this would distort competition and risk WTO litigation.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="0705083000045"></a>The main discussion focused on approaches to optimising public finances to enable member states to meet the challenges posed by globalisation and demographic change, including building social bridges and human capital to improve employability and strengthen social inclusion, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure, and securing stable public revenues. Ministers shared national experiences and ideas for addressing these issues.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="0705083000046"></a>The informal council also discussed measures for combating VAT fraud, the spring meetings of the Bretton Woods institutions, hedge funds and the current state of financial markets. Following up on the previous informal council meeting in Helsinki, the informal council was informed about ongoing work on precautionary arrangements to secure the stability of financial markets.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="0705083000049"></a>On 13 February 2006, the Department of Trade and Industry issued a Written Answer to House of Commons Parliamentary Question No. 2005/3120 from Austin Mitchell MP (<I>Hansard</I><I>, </I>vol. 442, col. 1635W), which sought information regarding the (a) prosecutions and (b) successful prosecutions for insider trading since 1997. Richard Steele was named as a person who had been convicted of such an offence. The record should show that while criminal proceedings were brought against Richard Steele for insider trading, namely an offence contrary to Section 52 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993, he was not convicted of that (or any other) offence. The record should also therefore show that from 1997 to 13 February 2006 proceedings were brought against 15 individuals, of which eight were successful.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="0705083000051"></a>In April, the Government issued the Local Authorities (Model Code of Conduct) Order 2007, promulgating a simpler, clearer and more proportionate model code of conduct for local councillors. The order came into effect on 3 May.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS51"></a><b>8 May 2007 : Column WS51</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="0705083000052"></a>The revised code delivers the promise we gave in the local government White Paper, <I>Strong and Prosperous Communities</I>, last October, that the Government would provide a simpler, clearer and more proportionate code of conduct for local authority members and amend the rules on personal and prejudicial interest to support members&#146; advocacy role.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="0705083000053"></a>These changes to the code remove the barriers, which have prevented councillors speaking up for their constituents. In particular, for example, members of a council&#146;s planning or licensing committee will have more opportunities to represent their constituents on planning and licensing issues that affect their wards. The changes also ensure that the remit of the code in respect of conduct in a member&#146;s private capacity is restricted to conduct for which a criminal conviction has been received.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="0705083000054"></a>We have also, in particular, had regard to the over 900 responses we received to our recent consultation on the proposed changes to the code, and amended the text of the code to improve its accessibility and user-friendliness. We believe that overall the new revised code will help to maintain public confidence and trust in local government, which is necessary if councils are to fulfil their leadership role.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="0705083000055"></a>Copies of the order have been placed in the Libraries of the House, and circulated to local authorities and other stakeholders.</p>

&#163;35 billion based on existing spending for 2007-08 together with uprating by at least inflation over the next three years; an &#163;18 billion long-term investment strategy from 2005 to 2017; retention of value-for-money savings to be made over the period 2008-09 to 2010-11 expected to be at least &#163;0.8 billion;retention of asset sales to fund capital investment expected to be over &#163;1 billion, with &#163;500 million over the next four years; additional spending over the next two years under the end-year flexibility scheme of &#163;140 million resource DEL (&#163;75 million in 2007-08 and &#163;65 million in 2008-09) and &#163;180 million capital DEL (&#163;100 million in 2007-08 and &#163;80 million in 2008-09);additional spending financed by EU receipts expected to be in excess of &#163;0.5 billion;the provision of &#163;400 million, additional to the &#163;35 billion above, including an up-front &#163;100 million in 2007-08 from the Treasury's reserve to enable an incoming Administration to delay the introduction of water charges without affecting existing spending plans in Northern Ireland and introduce an innovation fund; andconfirmation of &#163;200 million borrowing under the reinvestment and reform initiative from 2007-08. Borrowing under the reinvestment and reform initiative will no longer be linked with the requirement to close the gap with GB council tax rates. This is in addition to the cap on rates and enhanced relief for pensioners already announced by the Secretary of State.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="0705083000063"></a>In addition there will be a major package of integrated investment in infrastructure, including for a substantial new roads programme. In addition to the &#163;18 billion allocated to the revised investment strategy for Northern Ireland, the Irish Government have made &#163;400 million available for the investment in infrastructure projects.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="0705083000064"></a>Within this package, I recognise the need to provide resource this financial year and therefore there will be &#163;700 million available in 2007-08 above existing departmental expenditure limit plans.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="0705083000066"></a>Following representations from all the political parties on differential tax rates, I announced on 22 March a review led by Sir David Varney to report on how current and future tax policy, and including the tax changes announced in the Budget, can support sustainable growth of businesses and long-term investment in Northern Ireland. The review will consider this in the context of the tax environment across the EU, including the Republic of Ireland. Sir David will report in the autumn.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="0705083000069"></a>I also agreed on 22 March to further discussions between an incoming Executive and officials of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) with regard to excise duties and measures to tackle fraud in Northern Ireland.</p>

To build further on this progress, I also announced a new local employment partnership that will help create 5,000 jobs for the unemployed in Northern Ireland. It will be established between five leading employers in the retail sector&#151;Asda, B&amp;Q, Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury&#146;s and Tesco&#151;along with the British Retail Consortium and the Employment Service in Northern Ireland to support long-term benefit claimants into work, building on the successful approaches these retailers have already established.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="0705083000073"></a>Work will also take place in discussion with the construction industry on the development of a similar partnership, and extending this to the hospitality and hotel sector.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="0705083000078"></a>The initial move has been successfully completed on time in April 2006 and around 90 communications personnel from RAF High Wycombe are on schedule to move this year. However, there will now be a phased relocation of communications personnel from RAF Brize Norton to RAF Leeming beginning in summer 2008 as technical and domestic accommodation becomes available. The delay in provision of new-build accommodation has been occasioned by the routine adjustment of funds to ensure that our resources are allocated in line with defence priorities.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="0705083000080"></a>The Department for Transport has today published the south-west regional planning assessment for the railway (RPA), the latest in the series of 11 RPAs covering England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="0705083000081"></a>Copies of the document have been placed in the Libraries of the House today and can be downloaded from the department&#146;s website at www.dft.gov.uk.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="0705083000083"></a>RPAs provide the link between regional spatial planning (including preparation of regional transport strategies) and planning for the railway by both the Government and the rail industry, and are designed to inform the development of the Government's strategy for the railway. They look at the challenges and options for development of the railway over the next 20 years, in the wider context of forecast change in population, the economy and travel behaviour.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="0705083000084"></a>An RPA does not commit the Government to specific proposals. Instead it sets out the Government's current thinking on how the railway might best be developed to allow wider planning objectives for a region to be met, and identifies the priorities for further development work.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="0705083000087"></a>The project has reviewed the needs of YAOs, the appropriate age range, the use of the prison estate, the regimes and interventions required in prison and in the community, and considered the implications of abolishing detention in a young offender institution (DYOI).</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="0705083000088"></a>There has been full consultation with internal and external stakeholders. Significant representatives of voluntary and community groups have been consulted&#151;in particular, Barrow Cadbury, the Prison Reform Trust, NACRO and Rainer. Consideration has been given to HM inspectorate's recent thematic report on young adult offenders. Future implementation will include consideration of Baroness Corston's recommendations regarding women offenders in the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="70508-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="0705083000089"></a>We have concluded that, taking account of both the constraints posed by current prison capacity and the need to undertake further work to test out an approach to young adult offenders, the time is not yet right to abolish detention in a young offender institution (DYOI).</p>

We understand that, once pre-deployment preparations are complete, deployment should take three to four months. The timing will depend on how rapidly the UN can generate forces from contributing nations for the HSP and build the infrastructure for the deploying force. Deployment will not be easy given Darfur's environment and the oncoming rainy season.</p>
