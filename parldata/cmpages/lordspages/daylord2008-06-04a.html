Does he agree that it is unacceptable that&#151;this is a snapshot of the many serious issues raised by board members&#151;women  and children should not have access to separate accommodation from unrelated men in each of the terminals, that where people are held for long periods there are no proper sleeping facilities and the Border and Immigration Agency says that it does not intend to provide them and that there are no proper washing facilities for the detainees to use in any of the terminals?

It is G4S. It is easy to get these acronyms wrong. I say in answer to the noble Baroness that we do not want to detain people for lengthy periods in the short-term holding facility, which is what it is and what it is there for. The maximum period for people to be held is generally around eight hours. About two-thirds of people are moved on from that point into the more secure part of the detention and removal estate.</p>

The House needs to appreciate that the facilities are not in the gift of the UK Border Agency; they are owned and provided by the British Airports Authority, with which we have to work and negotiate to secure improvements. That is why I cannot give more specific answers. Separate facilities are being developed so that women and children can be separated from others who are temporarily detained. Some of these problems are not easy to secure improvements to in the short term. However, I shall ensure that there is more information about this and I shall try to provide a timeline for some of these improvements. I shall happily provide more precise answers in writing.</p>

That is what this Government&#146;s policies have delivered, with a record period of growth and with inflation that in the past 10 years on average has been half what it was in the previous two decades. This is in stark contrast with the record of the previous Administration, when there were two deep recessions and unemployment reached 3 million.</p>

The Government continually monitor the monetary policy framework to ensure that it remains at the forefront of international best practice. Changes to the framework are implemented only when clear advantages can be established for doing so.</p>

Would he care to join me in asking the Chancellor to send a letter to the governor congratulating him on his recent inflation report, which indicated that inflation will stay at about the level of his target over the medium term? In the short term, it might reach 3.7 per cent, but that is by no means catastrophic. Would he therefore remind the Chancellor to tell the governor that his second remit is now to ensure that the Government&#146;s economic policy for growth should be continued? If he agrees with me, I will draft the letter if he likes.</p>

The governor will indeed be obliged under the legislation to write to the Chancellor if the inflation rate exceeds 3 per cent, and forecasts indicate that it will do so in the fairly near future. As my noble friend has indicated, 3.1 per cent is scarcely catastrophic when, in the 1980s and 1990s, we were consistently used to seeing inflation rates that were double that and, at one stage, as high as 15 per cent. We ought not, then, to think that because world economic circumstances are unfavourable, Britain is in any way, shape or form remotely near economic crisis.</p>

It is an internationally registered measure of inflation, against a background where the economic resources of countries are directed towards housing and where families within those countries vary so enormously. Britain is atypical in that respect. We would not be adding to the general perspective on the successful conduct of the economy if we change from the CPI as a measure of inflation rate.</p>

If it is necessary to write to the Chancellor, because for a short period inflation edges above 3 per cent, the governor will of course write accordingly. That would be proof of the fact that the governor knows his obligations and that we know the worth of the strategy which has been pursued over the past decade for the control of inflation.</p>

There is no doubt that, at a time of high increases in energy and food prices, family budgets are suffering. That does not alter the fact that, when it comes to the economic strategy that the Government should pursue for the benefit of the nation&#151;particularly in keeping inflation under control in order that the high levels of employment we presently enjoy should continue&#151;we need an index that is an international comparator and against which, I repeat, the United Kingdom economy does very well.</p>

Of course, if noble Lords are aware of any British citizens who have been unlawfully held on a naval vessel by the United States, they should provide this information to the Government as a matter of urgency so that it can be investigated. The House will know that my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, following the declarations of 15 February and the Statement made in both Houses on 21 February, has written to the Secretary of State in the United States with a number of questions about these matters.</p>

May I therefore ask, first, whether we have any evidence that the United States ships used as prisons were either maintained or refuelled in Diego Garcia or its immediate territorial waters?

We now return to these at the Report stage, and may open up some new areas that were illuminated in Committee. The amendment is tabled in my name and that of noble friend Lord Hunt of Wirral, and deals with aspects of our foreign policy and the common foreign and security policy. On the face of the Bill for all to see is the Government&#146;s attempt to exclude the common foreign and security policy from both the treaty provisions and the extension of the Community&#146;s powers; in effect, to ring-fence foreign policy. That is the clear aim and intention of the Bill following the negotiations on the treaty itself. Perhaps I may use the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, this is to keep foreign policy &#147;intergovernmental and non-legislative&#148;.</p>

During Committee we were treated to a superb speech by the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, who is in his place. With his vast experience, he described what can and has been achieved by such co-operation. But we do not welcome the intrusion of majority voting and the removal of vetoes into various aspects of the conduct of our foreign policy: nor did the Government welcome them either; they strongly resisted them.</p>

I will not detain your Lordships with them again, aside from the self-amending provision in the treaty, which we will debate later, and the role of the European Court of Justice, under its new name the CJEU. I want to refer in particular to the European External Action Service, which is specified in paragraph 3 of 13A of the treaty and mentioned in our amendment, because in this area there seem to be many loose ends and uncertainty and we need to clear up matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08060470000082"></a>When the idea was first put forward, the UK Government Minister responsible said firmly:</p>
<ul><a name="08060470000239"></a>&#147;We believe that it remains for EU member states to organise their respective bilateral Diplomatic Services at the national level&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 21/1/03; col. 226W.]</ul>
<p><a name="08060470000210"></a>Now it seems that all that has gone and in the design of the new diplomatic service, the European External Action Service, which appears to be going ahead apace, although the treaty has not yet been fully ratified, the majority of votes will be shaping a number of aspects.</p>

<a name="80604-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08060470000083"></a>I must confess that although we have all tried to carry out research into a treaty that is known to be&#151;it is labelled as&#151;deliberately unintelligible, it is still a little mysterious. On 26 February my right honourable friend William Hague asked the Foreign Secretary what recent discussions he had had with his EU counterparts on the European External Action Service and whether any meetings on the organisation and  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_160"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>funding of the EEAS had taken place. The Foreign Secretary in reply said that there had been no discussions at ministerial or working level on the detailed organisation funding and functioning of the EEAS. If that was true then&#151;I am talking about late February&#151;it is not true now. The noble Baroness spoke about the matter at col. 494 in Committee. She did not say&#151;I am convinced that this is because she was not aware of it, otherwise she would have told us fully in her usual manner&#151;that COREPER was about to hold two sessions at working level to decide the structure and modus operandi of the EEAS, including such matters as the setting up of embassies worldwide.</p>

<a name="80604-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08060470000084"></a>It seems that whatever was happening in February or a few weeks ago we are now in advanced discussions about the detailed organisation and functioning of the Europe-wide diplomatic service. That is the position now, and it requires our urgent attention. It is no surprise that the Foreign Affairs Committee in another place called for regular reports to be laid before Parliament on these discussions during the current year and that Parliament should be kept fully informed, which it does not seem to have been. This is all part of what has been called the hidden wiring of the treaty, which requires us to sign up in relation to issues that remain completely undecided or even unidentified. We therefore need as a start to see those COREPER discussion outcomes and for them to be published and laid in the Libraries of both Houses. I hope that the noble Baroness will tell us that that is possible.</p>

<a name="80604-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08060470000085"></a>Why are we focusing on this particularly? Because, in the words of the Government and of all those who follow these things, this is all absolutely central to the way in which our foreign policy will be handled and shaped by the new diplomatic corps. How will it work? We do not know. We have not been told and we have had no opportunity to contribute to the shaping so far of what is a key instrument in the determination of our foreign and international policies.</p>

<a name="80604-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08060470000086"></a>I suppose that one would worry a bit less if EU foreign policy had all along been an unalloyed success. That would be a little reassuring, and in some areas it has worked extremely well. However, that would still leave many questions about how the new diplomatic corps works, especially if it develops a life of its own as an unanchored and independent institution. But the objective reality is that EU foreign policy has not always been a success; in fact in some areas it has run into the gravest difficulties or never really got off the ground at all. As the <I>Financial Times</I> argued only a few days ago, during your Lordships' recess period:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08060470000224"></a>&#147;The paucity of European strategic thinking is stunning&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060470000087"></a>It went on to argue that that was especially so when it comes to the rising power of Asia, which of course is where the centre of gravity of the whole world system is now moving. I suppose that that is not surprising when there are such numerous and different member state views of what foreign policy priorities should be. But that is the position. Therefore we need to proceed with great caution and great clarity before committing ourselves to these types of projects.</p>

<a name="80604-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08060470000088"></a>I do not want to go into the EU aid record in detail now, but there are people on all sides of your Lordships' House who recognise that it has certainly not been

I am far from convinced&#151;I know that this is more controversial&#151;that EU foreign policy will assist our national energy security. We need co-operation but I am not persuaded by those who make the facile jump between co-operation on interconnecters, nuclear power and so on&#151;that is all technically correct&#151;and saying that we therefore need a common energy policy underpinned by new regulations and legal provisions. It is a jump from hope to fantasy.</p>

<a name="80604-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08060470000089"></a>Behind these doubts lies a still bigger question: is the European Union today, in modern circumstances, still the best vehicle for carrying forward the central goals of our foreign policy? What are these goals? The Foreign Office occasionally issues magnificently glossy books, or annual reports, and this year it has abandoned the previous 10 goals and has four new ones. Mr Miliband has identified them as: counterterrorism and checking WMD proliferation&#151;obviously, we are all in favour of that; preventing and resolving conflict worldwide&#151;well, who could argue with that?; promoting a high-growth, low-carbon global economy&#151;trickier I should have thought, but it sounds broadly right; and to develop as effective institutions the UN and  the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08060470000090"></a>Those are very interesting but they are stratospherically vague ambitions. Of course the UN needs reform; there are Members of your Lordships' House who know that very well. When I heard a UN official say the other day that Robert Mugabe was in good standing at the United Nations I began to worry that something really needs attention there. As for the European Union, its foreign policy is useful to us. But it is not the only network. That is where we draw a line&#151;with those who say that it is the only game in town and the only destiny. We have to ask: what about the Commonwealth network? What about India? What about our links with Japan? What about the new centres of power? How will we develop our foreign policy with those?</p>

<a name="80604-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08060470000091"></a>We need much more than EU partners and a common foreign and security policy to fulfil and promote our contribution and our interests worldwide. We need maximum flexibility in our EU alliances and coalitions. Frankly, the Lisbon treaty gives us neither. Our foreign policy defines us as a nation and Parliament deserves and requires a proper say in that part of our international role, which is to be shaped by the EU and its agencies. This amendment makes a very modest request. That is why I beg to move.</p>

I suspect that whatever those provisions were, he would come to that same conclusion. He has said that there are alternative clusters or instruments of power available to us other than the European Union, and of course this is correct. But it is clear that the weight which we as a country have as a partner nation of the European Union gives us far greater clout in areas where we would be relatively weak on our own. I hope that he would follow me, for example, in respect of Iran, where a purely UK voice would be pretty ineffective and where the Commonwealth, which appears to be one of his preferred alternatives, would have no voice at all; also in the Balkans, where, apart from the faults

<a name="80604-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08060470000093"></a>The amendment asks for an annual report to Parliament and I would join the noble Lord in saying that it is vital, if his aim is parliamentary accountability, that we seek in all ways to further that. Nobody can doubt that the Lisbon treaty increases parliamentary accountability. I had the privilege to follow the noble Lord in chairing the Foreign Affairs Committee in the other place. Part of the duties of the person who chaired that committee was to go every six months to the country which chaired the Union at that time and to discuss with those colleagues who chaired the sister committees in the Union. What struck me very forcefully was how jealous those other countries were of the powers which our Parliament enjoyed in respect of foreign policy. I saw that over a large number of issues. Whatever may have been the formal powers, we had far greater instruments of control in our Parliament, well beyond the ingenuity of individual Members, be it the particular Select Committees, both in this House and in the other place, or the means of questioning Ministers. Therefore, I wonder whether the report which the noble Lord is suggesting will serve any useful purpose; in short, whether it is otiose, given the large number of other means of &#147;control&#148; in the parliamentary sense which we now enjoy.</p>

<a name="80604-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08060470000094"></a>I am also struck by the fact that, when the common foreign and security policy was established in Maastricht, the noble Lord, who was then in Government&#151;or certainly his party was in Government&#151;did not take the opportunity to insert a similar clause. It is crystal clear that the powers of the Union are largely unaffected. Certainly if the noble Lord and other colleagues look through the very useful report produced by the European Union Committee of this House, they will see that the conduct and nature of foreign policy remain intergovernmental. That was the position in Maastricht and it remains the position. Given the fact that there are so many other instruments of control, my own judgment is that this amendment is unnecessary. Had it been necessary, the noble Lord and his friends would certainly have inserted a similar provision at the time when the Maastricht treaty was passing through this House and Parliament generally.</p>

I will have no difficulty in recommending that we on the Liberal Democrat Benches oppose the amendment. The noble Lord quoted the <I>Times</I> on the paucity of EU strategic thinking. I must say that, from what we heard in the introductory speech, the paucity of Conservative strategic thinking is also rather mind-boggling. Not even Senator McCain, in his proposals for an alliance of democracies, suggested China as a more appropriate partner for Britain and the United States than France and Germany. However, if I understood the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that is exactly what he was proposing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08060470000096"></a>The notion of the Commonwealth as a stronger institution for British foreign policy than the European Union requires, again, a good deal of careful examination. The noble Lord said that EU foreign policy has not always been successful. Actually, British foreign policy has not always been successful. American foreign policy under President Bush has not always been entirely successful. By what criterion are we judging success?</p>

<a name="80604-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08060470000097"></a>I say to our Conservative colleagues that one must be careful about one&#146;s position on the European Union and foreign policy. I was interested to see William Hague&#146;s letter yesterday to the leader of my party suggesting that we have some confusion, but the Conservatives are doing their best to straddle their dog-whistle movements towards the Europhobes and those within the Conservative Party who want to make the best of British membership of the European Union.</p>

<a name="80604-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08060470000098"></a>The noble Lord said in his opening statement that he is not entirely convinced of the need for a common energy policy. The<I> Daily Mail</I> this morning tells us that high gas prices in Britain are entirely the fault of the French and the Germans and nothing to do with anything else. I trust that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, does not entirely agree that the problems of British gas prices are the fault of wicked French and German energy companies. There may be a case for closer European energy co-operation. I recall William Hague saying that we needed a stronger European position in our relations with Russia. That seems to be a good case for closer European co-operation in foreign policy.</p>

<a name="80604-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08060470000099"></a>The noble Lord also said:</p>
<ul><a name="08060470000240"></a>&#147;we do not welcome the intrusion of majority voting ... into various aspects ... of our foreign policy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060470000211"></a>In the 27-member EU&#151;and, for that matter, the 26-member NATO&#151;one occasionally stubs one&#146;s toes, in terms of effective action, against one difficult member; Greece and Macedonia currently, and Cyprus is holding up the whole question of closer co-operation between the European Union and NATO. The European Union External Action Service has also been mentioned; we talked about it in Committee. Some of us pointed out that Britain currently has no resident representation in 50 member states of the United Nations and that there is a great deal to be said for shared representation in those 50 states.</p>

<a name="80604-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08060470000100"></a>We must be careful in listening to what William Hague is saying about Conservative policy. This is the man who said, on the Nice treaty, that we had 10 days to save the pound and that British democracy was under threat. I have received several letters in the past few days that said that the Lisbon treaty threatens the future of British democracy; indeed, that it would be the death of British democracy. I cite some of these letters&#151;they must have come from some Europhobic newsletter, they are so similar&#151;which say that it would be comparable to the Nazi takeover of Germany in 1933.</p>

<a name="80604-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08060470000101"></a>I say to our Conservative friends that we must have a constructive debate about British foreign policy. We on these Benches are entirely clear&#151;</p>

It is difficult to understand whether they believe that the treaty provisions are significant. I happen to think that the treaty provisions on the development of an ever more integrated foreign policy are there because the intention is to develop an ever more integrated European foreign policy, and that we should take those provisions for what they are written as being. That may be a good thing or a bad thing but we should not ignore them. Therefore, I very much support the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Howell that proposes the reporting arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08060470000105"></a>However, I wish to ask a question that I do not think was dealt with adequately in Committee; namely, what happens if the UK signs up to a common foreign policy in the European Union and decides at a later stage that it has a different view of foreign policy because there is a change of Government or a change of heart or perhaps because of a debate in Parliament which results in a different view being adopted? I do not understand what provision there is in the treaty to allow the UK to change its mind once it has agreed to a common EU foreign policy and subsequently to get that policy changed. I should be grateful if the Minister could explain what allows us to get a change enacted in the European Union once the Government have signed up to a foreign policy because that is a very significant consequence of this measure and another reason why it is important to have reports made to Parliament.</p>

The existing EU delegations are already very generously staffed. How long will it be before the Treasury decides that we cannot afford, and do not need, our own missions?

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08060470000107"></a>The other thing that concerns me is intelligence and security relationships. They are vital to our interests. Will those EU missions which, for all sorts of reasons, we may see taking over more and more, hold not only British passports but our intelligence and security reports and records? What will that do to our essential special relationship with the Americans and, indeed, bilaterally with a number of other intelligence agencies with which we need to work on a bilateral basis and where they can trust the fact that what they tell us will be protected? We have to consider the dangers of getting rid of our own missions so that we no longer have young diplomats making relationships which become extremely valuable, and we shall also lose the confidence of the relevant countries. If they consider that we do not think it is worth having our independent representation, that will not improve our chances in trade, diplomacy, defence and culture. Incidentally, our own value to the EU will thereby be diminished.</p>

<a name="80604-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08060470000108"></a>I want to see very careful safeguards to ensure that there is no question of closing any more British missions in favour of the splendid new organisation which, incidentally, will cost us a lot of money and which already has plans for common defence relationships to be paid for from that new fund. I am concerned on the intelligence side and I cannot see the practicality of expecting an EU mission, which may be made up of any group of countries, holding, for instance, our passports, our visas and, basically, our intelligence.</p>

For the first time, the European Parliament will have a role in foreign policy. That is why it is discussing what that role will be and how it will be reported to. I will not cut down my quotation from this interesting report. I thought that Members would be interested to hear about the report, bearing in mind that, as well as ourselves, the European Parliament is discussing its role in foreign policy on this very day. I am sorry if certain people are bored by what the European Parliament says; frankly I am always very interested, because it is always seeking to get greater powers.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08060470000231"></a>&#147;The report also calls for parliament to be given greater democratic oversight over the area, which to date has remained firmly the domain of member states&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060470000217"></a>I think that many people in this place want it to remain the domain of member states. It goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08060470000232"></a>&#147;It suggests that the foreign minister &#145;regularly&#146; appear before MEPs and that the parliament be &#145;fully consulted&#146; on who the foreign minister should be, as well as what the diplomatic service should look like&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060470000218"></a>There we are. Finally, it says on the EU army:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="08060470000233"></a>&#147;Mr Saryusz-Wolski, who believes the union will gradually develop its own army, says it is no longer enough that the bloc exercises its traditional role as a soft power&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08060470000117"></a>If the European Parliament is demanding that it should be reported to, why on earth is it wrong that an amendment should be moved in this Parliament to ensure that the House of Commons and this House should have a report on events for the past year? After all, we are partly paying for the foreign policy. This is not only a good amendment but an essential amendment to ensure that this Parliament and not the European Parliament&#151;or perhaps as well as the European Parliament&#151;should be fully informed of matters and developments in European foreign policy.</p>

I believe that the provisions of the Lisbon treaty on the common foreign and security policy stand a good chance of making a difference; they could make the European Union&#146;s common foreign and security policy more coherent and effective by bringing together the policies and the levers to execute those policies through, for example, bringing together development policy and foreign policy.</p>

<a name="80604-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08060470000119"></a>I shall comment on a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Howell. The proposed European External Action Service is an important component of ensuring a more coherent common foreign and security policy, not in any way as a substitute for but as a complement to our own missions and Diplomatic Service. I do not know whether discussions have been taking place, in COREPER or elsewhere, on the European External Action Service. If they have been, I hope very much that the British Government and our representatives have been closely involved in them, to ensure that the European External Action Service is shaped in such a way as to complement and not to substitute for our own Diplomatic Service and that the expertise that we have is being brought fully to bear on the formation of the External Action Service at the earliest possible stage. For those reasons, I do not support the amendment.</p>

Why should not this Parliament have the opportunity to discuss what the high representative is up to, on the basis of a report from the Secretary of State? What harm could possibly be done by placing an obligation on the Secretary of State to make such a report? I simply do not understand any of the speeches that have been made objecting to the amendment, which seems to me very moderate. It certainly does not cut across the scheme of the Bill as a whole.</p>

I shall try my best to deal with the points that noble Lords have rightly raised but not to go on at length by repeating what I hope I made clear in Committee was the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<a name="80604-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08060470000122"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that this is an important area. We dealt with it extremely well in the many amendments in Committee, although I accept that it is an important issue to be returned to at Report. I will deal first with what the amendment would do in relation to a report and then come on to the nub of many of the contributions: the External Action Service. That will serve your Lordships best. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, said, as did other noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, in the last speech before I stood up, that the amendment is simple: could there be an annual report on the

I considered this carefully. On the face of it, it is a simple and straightforward amendment. However, I am not one for adding on to procedures that I believe work effectively and well in scrutiny. Some of the conversations that I have had with noble Lords over the last few days have sought the best and most effective forms of scrutiny without adding on new glossy brochures or any other kind of unnecessary report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08060470000123"></a>Currently, we deposit information in Parliament. We provide an explanatory memorandum on any European Union document that is published on the development of the common foreign and security policy, as we do for the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the policy. Ministers and senior European Union officials appear regularly before the parliamentary committees of both your Lordships&#146; House and another place, at the invitation of the relevant committees. As noble Lords will be aware, the Foreign Secretary, my right honourable friend David Miliband, appears before the Foreign Affairs Committee before every European Council. His next appearance is on 11 June. The Minister for Europe gives evidence to the Lords European Union Select Committee and Sub-Committee C after the European Council. Just for completeness, I should add that since November 2007 there have been two Foreign Affairs Committee evidence sessions on Europe, eight House of Lords European Union Committee sessions, including the sub-committee, and one Commons European Scrutiny Committee evidence session.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08060470000124"></a>Our scrutiny arrangements work extremely well. As I indicated, they include other figures appearing before the committees. High Representative Javier Solana is keen to work with the national parliaments and makes great efforts to accommodate parliamentary calendars. My argument against another report is that I believe that the current procedures already work effectively and should remain. The scrutiny position is clear and I do not believe that there is anything to be added by providing yet another report in this context.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08060470000125"></a>The heart of much of the discussion was the role of the External Action Service. I should like to reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Park, who I know could not be with us for much of our Committee debate. She raised an important issue, which is in a sense at the core of her concerns. I quote Article 4.2 of the treaty of the European Union, which will come into force as the Lisbon treaty:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08060470000234"></a>&#147;The Union shall respect the equality of Member States before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional, inclusive of regional and local self-government. It shall respect their essential State functions, including ensuring the territorial integrity of the State, maintaining law and order and safeguarding national security. In particular, national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060470000219"></a>In other words, it does not become part of any External Action Service. I hope that the noble Baroness will look carefully at that reference and come back to me if she has any further queries. She need have no fear of anything within the External Action Service.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08060470000126"></a>When we discussed this in Committee, we talked at great length about what the role and function of the service would be. I made it clear that its purpose is to  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_169"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>assist the high representative in carrying out the mandate that he is set by the member states. It is not about creating a new bureaucracy. People coming into the External Action Service will be drawn from the  Council secretariat and the Commission services that already work on external issues with member states&#146; representatives, structured through secondments. These are opportunities for diplomats from individual states, but it is not about creating a consular system or a diplomatic service to rival that of individual member states. That is important.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08060470000127"></a>The purpose, as I indicated in Committee, is to try to improve the coherence of the delivery on the ground so that, for example, we can bring together the support of the European Union to help areas around the world that are emerging from conflict with peacekeeping and policing missions and so on and try to deal with longer-term issues such as development. If we are to help in some of the most difficult areas of the world, we need coherence and it makes sense to try to bring this together.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08060470000128"></a>Noble Lords need not fear that this takes anything away from the Diplomatic Service of this country. I know from questions that have been raised by noble Lords in the House that they are concerned about the role of embassies, but in 2007 we had more embassies open than we did in 1997. It is important to see the External Action Service not as a rival but as helping to support coherence in European Union activity in parts of the world where the European Union has a genuine and proper role to play.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08060470000129"></a>There has been much speculation about what discussions have taken place and when. Of course, there was the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> article on that point. Nothing alleged in that article or in what has been said contradicts anything that the Foreign Secretary has already said. Noble Lords who have been involved in Europe or in any organisation of any kind will know that, when proposals are on the ground, it is common to have preliminary conversations about what the outcome might look like. Those conversations are not binding and do not have any force or weight; they are simply discussions that we would expect officials to have in all circumstances, every time one considers any form of legislation of any kind in any parliament anywhere. We ensure that discussions take place about how, if we were to do this, it would be implemented. That is completely normal, rational and to be expected. That would be the basis of any discussions that took place.</p>

He said in February that no discussions at ministerial or working level on the detailed organisational funding and functioning of the External Action Service had taken place. I do not doubt his integrity and good faith in saying that. Surely the noble Baroness must confirm to us that since then such discussions have taken place. Given the vital and central role that she describes for this service in the shaping of our foreign policy, it would be interesting for Parliament to be kept fully informed about these discussions.</p>

<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_170"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>discussions have taken place and when. I totally accept that he was not trying to say anything about the integrity of the Foreign Secretary, but he just got in before I had a chance to say that. I shall now allay his fears by putting on the record exactly what has been discussed.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08060470000132"></a>The first discussion took place on 10 April&#151;I can give him the exact date, although I cannot give him the time, but I would if I could. That was a COREPER meeting. For noble Lords who are not familiar with that term, let me explain that COREPER is when ambassadors of all the 27 European Union countries come together for discussions. It is often a way of having preliminary conversations, particularly before Ministers come together, so that the positions of different nations can be set in place. It is quite common for COREPER to have informal discussions about issues that it sees coming and it is right to do that. They are not discussions at official level on which we would deposit information before Parliament. However, we are committed to keeping Parliament up to speed with what happens on the External Action Service. For example, if a matter were debated or discussed at any of the Council meetings, it would be included in a report given by the Foreign Secretary or by whomever or in a Prime Ministerial Statement. We intend to keep Parliament fully informed of any discussions that take place on that.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08060470000133"></a>As I indicated, those discussions are clearly designed to ensure that people have a feel for what is being thought about and the views of the different nations. I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Jay, said about the importance of our role in that. As I said in Committee, when I was in Brussels for a few days I talked to Robert Cooper, the director-general for external and politico-military affairs at the General Secretariat of the Council, about the External Action Service. He would endorse everything that the noble Lord said about the value and importance of the role of the UK. He would say that we have a tremendously important role to play. He was also very clear with me&#151;I have tried to make this clear to your Lordships&#146; House&#151;about the value of coherence in bringing the service together and ensuring that in some parts of the world we are able to provide the necessary support.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08060470000134"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that the only way in which the External Action Service can be set up is through unanimity. It is true that, if the Council asks the high representative to bring forward proposals, they could be determined by QMV, but they are only proposals on a decision that has already been taken by unanimity, so if the External Action Service were determined to be brought into being, it would be because 27 nation states decided that that was what they wanted. They would then perhaps invite the high representative to go away and work up proposals within tight and clear guidelines and those proposals would come back and be determined through QMV. I hope that that allays the fears of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, on that.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08060470000135"></a>Finally, I shall address the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell. I thought that I had answered it, so I got the officials to look up what I said. It relates to whether, if we sign up to something, we can get out  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_171"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of it again&#151;if I can put it in a nutshell like that. I tried to answer that when we had our discussions in Committee on 6 May, recorded in <I>Hansard</I> at col. 496, but let me try again. If we agree with unanimity to take part in a measure, then we are bound in the same way as we would be in any other international agreement. Should there be a change of Government, policy or view, we would renegotiate it in the usual way that we would renegotiate in the European Union or under any other treaty. We had a long debate in Committee on that. That is the position. That is the certainty that one gives when signing up to something. It is a long tradition that Governments will renegotiate but will not walk away.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08060470000136"></a>I think that I have said enough without going back into all the detail on the External Action Service and the reasons why we do not accept the amendment. I hope that the present way in which the Government keep Parliament up to date and up to speed with what is happening and our commitments to do so on the External Action Service will mean that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I think that we have learnt one or two things from this short debate. We have learnt that discussions have been going on about the shaping of this new diplomatic service. I am not sure even now that we are clear about its precise location and structure and about how the lines of authority will work, but the Minister has given her views. Some of us have perhaps learnt that, if you intervene in other people&#146;s speeches, it tends to lengthen rather than shorten them. That is an old lesson that those of us who are long in the tooth and spent some time in the other place learnt long ago. We have learnt that the Lib-Dem Front Bench is turning its fire on the Conservative Party. That is very flattering; thank you very much.

That is one sensible discussion that this Chamber ought to be ideally suited to have. There is also the rather dottier exchange of a pendulum debate in which everybody who doubts the perfection of this treaty or the actions of Brussels is accused of being an anti-European and so on and so forth. That is a waste of time for us all and I beg that we try to concentrate on the real issue of how we fit together our foreign policy in the new world conditions. Europe has a part in that, but not the whole part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08060470000140"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, reminded us of old days with the Foreign Affairs Committee in another place. He did sterling work during his time. In an earlier period, I struggled to travel around the world with the committee. I remember going to some  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_172"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>parliaments, such as the one in Copenhagen, where the parliamentarians appeared to be much more involved in the hands-on administration of policy. Indeed, they went as far as mandating Ministers before they could agree anything in the European Council or any of the other councils of Ministers. Our Parliament is wonderful, but let us not get into the mood where we think that we have nothing to learn from any other parliaments; we certainly have. All the national parliaments of the European Union have qualities and aspirations that we should learn from.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08060470000141"></a>The Minister had a good deal to say on scrutiny procedures. What she said is very interesting and the scrutiny system rolls ahead. She sent round a letter showing that the Government have disregarded scrutiny reserves fewer times than in the past. That is all to the good, but having participated in this process myself in the past I know that none of us can be blind to the fact that there is enormous difficulty in scrutinising the steady flow of instruments, regulations, directives and so on. The first difficulty lies in matching the sheer volume&#151;a lot of these things simply do not get examined because there are too many of them. Secondly, it is difficult to have the time in committees&#151;in addition to the profound studies that the European Union Committee undertakes with excellent results&#151;to go into the full implications, consequences, aspects and side effects of all those instruments. In fact, I would say that to cover all instruments thoroughly and completely is very nearly impossible.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08060470000142"></a>That is all very interesting, but it is not quite what we are talking about. We are talking about issues where there is a transfer of powers, where previous veto provisions will not exist and where arrangements will come forward where it was not clear under the treaty that we had surrendered power but it turns out that we have. That is why Parliament as a whole, despite the excellence of its committee system, some of which has been in existence only for the past 30 years or so, needs to be apprised of changes that involve a potential or real transfer of powers.</p>

<a name="80604-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08060470000143"></a>I am not sure that I succeeded in getting that point over to the noble Baroness, because she comes back to scrutiny and arrangements with our excellent committees under their excellent Lord Chairmen and the very good committees in the Commons. That is all very valuable, but it is not the point. The point is about the powers of Parliament. There is a struggle going on today to regain for Parliament powers from the Executive that have somehow drifted away during the past 200 to 300 years. The Prime Minister articulates the feeling that Parliament should have more say; even government legislation reflects that feeling. We, too, reflect that feeling.

We had interesting debates on the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy in Committee. I make no apology for returning to these matters on Report. The common agricultural policy remains by far the largest single area of expenditure within the EU budget, and I see it as right, therefore, to seek to include this importance within the Bill, and in the new constitutional settlements which the treaty represents and for which the Bill provides.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08060470000150"></a>This amendment would ensure that our Parliament receives an annual report on the state and development of both these policies and, through the affirmative resolution procedure, ensure that there is opportunity for both Houses of Parliament to discuss and debate on an annual basis progress and reform of these policies. It will require the Secretary of State to present his objectives for reform and to seek the support of Parliament to this end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08060470000151"></a>I know that my noble friend the Duke of Montrose will speak in detail on the common fisheries policy. But, as I pointed out in Committee, the common agricultural policy has almost iconic status in the history of the European Union. Other than the coal and steel community, it is the longest living relic of those early days and the idealism which lay behind the creation of the European Community.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08060470000152"></a>Since that time, we have seen enormous structural and technical change. Whatever one&#146;s views, the common agricultural policy has provided the countryside, as well as farmers and growers, with some economic security during this period. It has also ensured that the consumer receives good quality food at reasonable prices. All that has changed since the last harvest and, in the eyes of most commentators, changed for good. A year ago, how much mileage would there have been in seeking to develop interest in a discussion on food security? Which pundit would have predicted the violent change in food commodity prices? Things are changing fast, and the challenge to politicians and parliamentarians is to ensure that they operate within a structure that is able to change and adapt rapidly to meet these changing times.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08060470000153"></a>Nothing shows the problem more than the Commission&#146;s draft health check on the common agricultural policy, which was produced two weeks ago. We need to remember that it still needs to be approved. This will not happen until the autumn, and it may not survive unamended. This programme represents the sort of policy changes that almost all noble Lords would agree with. It reflects well the views of our own European Committee report on the future of CAP reform, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, and which we are to debate tomorrow afternoon. However, we know that Europe&#146;s common agricultural policy is too inflexible and too hidebound by national self-interest to change fast enough. It is not unreasonable to ask what the Government are doing to force the pace of change. I remind noble Lords that the Government gave up our rebate on the promised reform of the common agricultural policy. This was against a background where the House would find noble Lords in almost complete agreement over the CAP.</p>

It will be possible to discuss the common agricultural policy at various points throughout any parliamentary year, subject to the permission of the usual channels.

The noble Lord gave a generalised response to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, giving the impression that the entire rebate was given up, whereas it was in fact only a minor part of it. The rebate was unique and a special privilege for the agricultural community of the United Kingdom, and it has been of great benefit. However, it was never envisaged that it would last indefinitely. It was always supposed to be of limited duration.</p>

I do not want to be confrontational. If I  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_178"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>am not achieving a consensus, perhaps it is because of my inability to advocate sufficiently well the point of view I am trying to express. That point of view hinges on the idea that if the Government were persuaded to surrender all or part&#151;we will accept the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, that it was only part of the rebate&#151;they did so on the understanding that there would be reform of the common agricultural policy. This amendment seeks to monitor the status of that reform. It is a reasonable point and one on which noble Lords around the House, I believe, will agree. I suspect that there is not much division on this issue and that most noble Lords accept the premise on which we are seeking to reform the CAP, as indeed the report of the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, makes very clear.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08060470000164"></a>I doubt whether there is anything other than complete agreement in this House that the common agricultural policy is over-centralised, over-bureaucratic and, above all, over-regulated. It is almost universally recognised that it is inflexible and wasteful of resources. Indeed, I doubt whether we will hear a single voice saying that the CAP is spending too little or is underregulated. Against that background, Members of the House and the Government have to acknowledge that the enemies of reform do not lie in this place, they lie in the users of the weapon of national self-interest who have become entrenched by the years of horse-trading and compromise that have characterised the way in which the policy has developed. Hence the reason for this amendment. All the great reforms in our history have been brought about by the power of Parliament. It is the people speaking through Parliament who give Government the authority to implement change. All through the Climate Change Bill Members on every Bench, Government and Opposition, recognised that. The Government acknowledged throughout the Bill both the need for regular reporting to Parliament and for harnessing Parliament&#146;s authority to maintain the momentum for change.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08060470000165"></a>If the Government are serious about CAP reform; if they wish to ensure that both the CAP and the common fisheries policy function to harness the energy of farmers, growers and fishermen to satisfy the needs of the people of Europe for good quality food at reasonable prices; and if they see that the changing conditions being reflected in commodity prices in the global economy require policies that can adapt to them, they will recognise that the power of Parliament is an ally in this matter. That is why I present this amendment in the belief that whatever our views on Europe or on the detail of reform, we can all unite to ensure our role as parliamentarians and the future role of this House. I beg to move.</p>

As my noble friend emphasised, politicians from all parties in this country have been arguing for reform for some time.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08060470000167"></a>I must also declare my interest as a livestock farmer in one of the designated &#147;less favoured areas&#148; of the European Union and as someone has watched all the stages through which the CAP has evolved since the United Kingdom first signed up. The reforms that we are facing now appear to require consideration of reform of the CAP in a different context; that which the Government were inclined to use in the past few years. My noble friend Lord Taylor emphasised that point. It is surely still worth reminding ourselves of the aims with which the common agricultural policy was set out. There were two prime objectives: first, to secure a stable food supply for the population of Europe and, secondly, to bring the income levels of those working in the agricultural community up to the same level as industrial wages.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08060470000168"></a>In many ways it exceeded its aim in both fields, although it is worth bearing in mind that at the beginning a largely peasant agriculture meant that a country like France had nearly 50 per cent of the working population engaged in food production and now has less than 10 per cent. If anything, that represents a gigantic social revolution. Even today it is affected in that country by a level of unemployment two or three times that which we have in this country.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08060470000169"></a>The challenge that any review of the CAP faces in this area is to provide a sustainable and stable food supply in world terms where agriculture in this part of the world has embraced diversification into leisure, fuel production and many other fields. There is surely no doubt that Parliament should have a chance to comment on the direction in which it is felt that we should go. A different picture emerges when we come to the fishing policy, which has caused a rapid decline, particularly in our own fishing industry, but at the same time a huge decline in the resources on which the fishing industry depends. It is surely all very well to say that a requirement of a common market is that all participants should be able to exploit the resource freely or at least do so outside the six nautical mile limit, but it sounds like the proposition that we should all have a common currency but we do not consider it necessary to have a central bank to control those who wish to take more money out of the system than they should, because it suits them to do so.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08060470000170"></a>Even a central bank has a little trouble in imposing discipline on the European Union at present. When it comes to fishing, the European Union is big on producing scientific papers and computer models on what it thinks the fishing industry needs, but less effective in having the resources or inclination to provide any meaningful control on the activity that occurs out at sea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08060470000171"></a>It was in that light that in Committee I moved an amendment to ask the Government to consider excluding the European Union from sole competence on the conservation of marine and biological resources, that being the most fundamental element of any common

There are such glaring ways in which the current fisheries policy is not working that radical changes will be required, all of which will have major consequences for our own fishing communities and on which the representatives in Parliament will be able to throw a much more realistic light.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08060470000172"></a>Technology for the first time offers us the surety of knowing where our national boundaries are at sea and where fishing activities are going on in relation to those boundaries. Whatever route Europe decides to go down on the policy for fisheries management, surely the only practical way of exerting management on these activities is to allow member states to police their own waters.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08060470000173"></a>That is incredibly important between the six and 12 nautical mile limits. The 12 nautical mile limit represents a source of 90 per cent of our shellfish catch, let alone anything else, but proper control could also have benefits in a wider area. I support the amendment.</p>

I have always thought, and increasingly thought, that that is a disaster. It is not common at all. I have never understood why everyone has said that in order for the European Community to co-operate and work together there must be a common agricultural policy. I do not see any connection between the working of the Community and having a common agricultural policy any more than a common steel or coal policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08060470000175"></a>When one sees, as we saw some years ago, milk in the United Kingdom at 13p a litre and milk in Holland at 27p a litre, one can only say: what is common about that? There is nothing common about it. We have seen our own agriculture decimated by the common agricultural policy. We have seen our own fisheries decimated by the common agricultural policy. People have been allowed to come and fish grounds that were always ours. They have taken the fish out, but because they are not allowed to land more than so many, they have put them back into the sea, dead and useless. The argument ought to be that you should not gather out of the sea more fish than you should, not that you should not land those fish and then throw back into the sea a whole lot of fish that would have been perfectly good but are now dead.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08060470000176"></a>The common agricultural policy is, as my noble friend Lord Taylor said, over-centralised, over-bureaucratised and overregulated. Anyone who has had anything to do with agriculture&#151;I have been involved with it all my life&#151;is horrified by what has happened over the past 15 to 20 years. Farmers do not farm their land any more as they used to. They used to farm and had the support of the Government. The only farmer now is the Government and the Government pay people to do their work: &#147;If you plant so many metres of hedge then we will pay you so much. If you do such and such, we will pay you so much&#148;. In other words the Government are dictating what the role of agriculture should be and it is a disaster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08060470000177"></a>Let us return to thinking about the wine lakes, butter mountains and wheat mountains, and then look at one simple statistic. I am not good on statistics

In 1960, there were 3,000 million people in the world, but it was estimated that by 2000 that would double to 6,000 million and by 2020 double again to 12,000 million. Over the lifetime of those of us who are now on this earth the population of the world will have multiplied fourfold. Think back to the time of the Greeks and the pharaohs, to the Middle Ages, the First World War and the Second World War. It has taken all that time to get to 3,000 million people, but that number will be increased fourfold in 60 years&#146; time. It is alarming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08060470000178"></a>Where will all the food come from? We have had set-aside policies to keep the food production down but that has gone now. But in a short while there will be a great shortage of food. We will turn round and say, &#147;What have we done? We have not provided for the future&#148;. It is a great pity.</p>

<a name="80604-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08060470000179"></a>I used to like the common agricultural policy when I used to go&#151;as I was sometimes allowed to do when my noble friend Lord Walker was Minister of Agriculture&#151;to the Council of Ministers. I would see the members from all the other countries sitting round&#151;the Italians, the French, the Germans and the British. Thirty years before they were bombing people to pieces but now they were arguing about the price of a pat of butter. It all seemed to me to be good stuff. But that has gone out of the window. Now the European Community is trying to control us. I think that it is wrong and I just wish that the common agricultural policy did not exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08060470000181"></a>In the discussions that took place at the European Council the United Kingdom Government clearly surrendered part of their rebate. It was not done exclusively as a trade-off&#151;which was the rather crude description&#151;for agricultural reform; it was also partly done within the confines of our own arguments and wishes for having a cap on the total overall budget to get the necessary resources available in the budget to allow the proper provision of cohesion funds for the new accession countries that we were so keen to see join the European Union. You cannot be in favour, as most people in this House are, of seeing the enlargement of the Union to the east and the bringing in many of those poor re-emerging democracies and then say, &#147;But we are not prepared to pay part of the bill for the cohesion benefits that we enjoyed and we are going to deny you&#148;. It was partly the process of this country paying the price for enlargement that every political party in this country said that they were in favour of that: perhaps not every party&#151;I see the noble Lord, Lord Pearson&#151;but every party of significance. The rebate was there. It was not just a crude trade-off; it had other purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08060470000182"></a>In saying that, we would be gravely mistaken if we allowed the assertion to be made in this House that part of the deal was for reform; where is the reform?

Agricultural reform&#151;although not enough, not fast enough, not wide enough and not deep enough&#151;has nevertheless been significant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08060470000183"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, referred quite properly to the report by the sub-committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Sewel, who I hope will speak in this debate on agriculture. I hope when it comes to the debate tomorrow afternoon on the sub-committee&#146;s report that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, will acknowledge many of the reforms in that report as going in the right direction&#151;not there, not achieved, not fully or as far as we want, but nevertheless going in the right direction. In relation to environmental goals, cross-compliance, decoupling of payments, set-aside, market intervention, export subsidies and import tariffs, not to mention modulation and preparation for problems of climate change, this report is a good catalogue of both what is being done and what still needs to be done in order to achieve the task that we set out to achieve in the deal that was struck at the European Council.</p>

I was seeking to agree totally with what the noble Lord said about the report, acknowledging that these were just the sort of reforms on which noble Lords could agree. I said that this programme represents the sort of changes in policy with which noble Lords would almost all agree and reflects well on the policy of our own European Union Committee report. I was intending to show that already, because circumstances have changed, the need for further reform had become even greater than had been acknowledged by this report.

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08060470000188"></a>I am at a loss to understand why we are debating this issue on this occasion. As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has acknowledged and my noble friend Lord Tomlinson has pronounced, we have a debate on the common agricultural policy tomorrow led by my noble friend Lord Sewel, which will give noble Lords ample opportunity to express views. The consensual way in which the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, presented his amendment suggests that common ground could well arise from the debate on the report of the European Union Select Committee: a proper enterprise.</p>

Further, when from time to time I hear voices saying, as did the noble Lord, Lord Howell, in moving Amendment No. 1, that we give too little time to some of the most important issues coming before us today, for us to use up time on debates on issues that might otherwise find a place on the agenda, tomorrow afternoon in this case, curtails time in which we should be applying our minds, thoughts, voices and questions to the proper scrutiny of what is before us.

As the price of food goes up and food becomes in short supply, the policy of the European Union will be very important to everybody in this country. What they want is not just reports that circulate within Parliament and which get very little publicity, but rather they want their Parliament to discuss what our Government are achieving in Europe by way of reforming a policy which needs a lot of reform, as everybody in the House accepts. Therefore, it is absolutely right that we should discuss this and I am very surprised that the noble Lord, whom I greatly admire, does not understand that.

My noble friend Lady Carnegy is absolutely right to say that this is a perfectly proper amendment to discuss now. Of course, we debate Select Committee reports and I have done so on many occasions. However, without being negative about those debates, they do not have the same force as debates on this Bill, which will pass into law. Our debates on reports on the common agricultural policy are just that, debates, and have had very little effect on reforming that policy.</p>

The aim of the health check was simply to see whether we are still paying as much money as we were previously. We are, so that health check is fine. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said that the common agricultural policy has given consumers reasonably priced food. I am afraid I have to take issue with him on that as it is simply not the case. The common agricultural policy, even reformed, still consumes some 45 per cent of the total EU budget, so it is worth discussing that. That means that UK taxpayers are paying more than they need to for their food because they are paying for the common agricultural policy through higher taxes and they are paying higher prices in the shops because of the common agricultural policy&#146;s protectionist policy against imports from third world or developing countries, which is an outrage.</p>

However, let us have a reality check. What has actually happened? What did the big players say about that? The German agriculture minister, Herr Seehofer, said that what the Chancellor was suggesting was absolute, complete rubbish. The French agriculture minister, Michel Barnier, far from agreeing with those sensible proposals from our Government, said no, the CAP is a good model. He went further and said that it should be exported worldwide. I wonder whether the Minister agrees with that. It really is odd that we say that we are leading reform. I have not yet read the report of the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, but I am sure that it makes all the right noises, as EU Select Committees always do. However, it does not seem to be getting the attention that it deserves in the corridors of power in Brussels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08060470000199"></a>I want to raise one further matter before I close in order to inform the House and perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, who is chairman of the sub-committee on agriculture. I hope that he has seized on the recent proposal from the Commission for new pesticide regulation, which is supported by the Parliament and currently in progress in Brussels. The Pesticides Safety Directorate, which regulates the use of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides in this country, has reported that the proposal is extremely damaging for agriculture, not just in this country, but throughout the European Union. The directorate says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08060470000236"></a>&#147;If the full potential impact of the current Parliament proposals were realised, conventional commercial agriculture in the UK and much of the EC, as it is currently practised, would not be achievable, with major impacts on crop yield and food quality&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060470000220"></a>This is a serious matter. The proposal could damage UK and European agriculture. It is losing touch with reality to consider this type of proposal at a time when the EU itself recognises that there is a world food shortage and may be reconsidering its biofuel targets. These crazed proposals are coming out of the Commission and Parliament and, if they are approved by qualified majority voting, we will not be able to do anything about it. We will be hamstringing agriculture in this country, our capacity to feed ourselves, and the capacity for Europe to feed itself and other countries. I will

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08060470000200"></a>I finish with two questions. The first is simple. Does the Minister agree that British agriculture, British taxpayers and British consumers would be better off if we were out of the common agricultural policy? That is a question he can say &#147;yes&#148; to very quietly and no one need notice it. Secondly, when are we going to do something about it?</p>

I am gratified by the degree of interest, particularly on the Benches opposite, in the reform of the common agricultural policy. It is not so far reflected in the names signed up to speak tomorrow, but I am sure that will be corrected in the very near future, and I look forward to a large attendance at tomorrow&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08060470000202"></a>The debate and the amendment are not on the reform of the common agricultural policy. This should be a debate on how the treaty impacts on the future of the common agricultural policy. In all fairness&#151;many Members of your Lordships&#146; House know where I stand on the common agricultural policy&#151;no one would say that either the common agricultural policy or the common fisheries policy are models of perfection. The gods did not come down and create these two wonderful policies for us; they were put together by fallible human beings, I am afraid. The fallibility has perhaps become more obvious over time. Let us recognise in passing that the common agricultural policy of today is very different from that of five, 10 or 15 years ago; it is very different indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08060470000203"></a>The idea that we are talking about some sort of health check is a distortion. Significant reforms are already in place, and I shall just mention two of them. First, there has been the decoupling of payments so, largely, across most agricultural regimes, you no longer have production-related payments, so you do not get the incentive to overproduce and produce in a way that the market is incapable of properly responding to. Secondly&#151;</p>

Decoupling is one, and the second is the scaling back of export subsidies and the distortion that export subsidies cause. The health check is about looking forward. If the noble Lord turns up tomorrow, he will be able to hear the extent to which we think that the proposals of the Commission and the views of Her Majesty&#146;s Government are adequate in terms of addressing the future direction of the common agricultural policy. That is a debate for tomorrow, not for today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08060470000206"></a>That is why, in all honesty, this is a phoney amendment. It is quite right that the House should debate how the treaty impacts on agriculture and agricultural policy, and if Members of your Lordships&#146; House wish to do that, they should focus on the two areas that significantly change as a result of the treaty. They are the move to qualified majority voting on agricultural policy and the move to co-decision on agricultural policy. My belief, and the belief of the EU Committee as a whole, is that both of those developments are entirely favourable to the pursuit of greater reform of the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. In the extent that the Lisbon treaty impacts on those two policy areas, the impact is wholly beneficial.</p>

I declare an interest as I have for many years been a peasant farmer in France with a num&#233;ro SIREN/SIRET. I work in conjunction with other properties in the production of wine and right across the board.</p>

<a name="80604-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08060475000002"></a>One of our heroes is my noble friend Lady Thatcher. She stood up for something when the Common Market agriculture policy was effectively an indirect subsidy of unrelated activities. Now we must accept that the whole objective of agriculture in France is to produce good quality food at reasonable prices. The expansion of the EU immediately brings in Bulgarian tomatoes. When I was advising the Bulgarian Government on tomatoes and quotas many years ago, I could not believe that Bulgarian tomatoes were among the best in Europe. I did not realise until I spent time in Eastern Europe the remarkable agricultural production that will come from there.</p>

<a name="80604-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08060475000003"></a>I must acknowledge that I have received subsidies from the Common Market agriculture policy&#151;although trading at a loss. One of those has been for an electric fence to keep the wild boars out. Yet there were too few wild boars, so the peasants decided they would mix them with ordinary boars. Of course, a wild boar produces only three marcassins a year and a domestic one can produce 23. So now we have a surplus of wild boar which are playing havoc with vines and others, destroying large chunks of agriculture&#151;though hunting is important in France and Spain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08060475000007"></a>The report of your Lordships&#146; House that dealt with wine said that grapes should not be used to produce alcohol for cars. It was well received. Already, after President Sarkozy&#146;s comments in London, moves are taking place to reduce the subsidy for the production of grapes that do not go into wine. As that report points out, more wine is now imported by the EU than exported. That is from far distant countries where they receive support for production and are allowed not to follow any rules. Even appellation contr&#244;l&#233;e is changing now.</p>

<a name="80604-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08060475000008"></a>Where I come from, our first wine was shipped to the United Kingdom in the second century BC. Your Lordships will know that that was a quality time. Olive trees and olive oil fetch a high premium but even within those markets changes are being made that have nothing to do with the Common Market agriculture policy. They come from a move towards quality and away from mass production. The knowledge and understanding is that other countries that may have greater rainfall and better production will produce better products.</p>

<a name="80604-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08060475000009"></a>The world is not looking at what the debate is tomorrow but at what we are going to say about this treaty before us today. The agricultural costs and expenditure are among the most important of all. As your Lordships will know, in France and Italy&#151;I can speak only for France, Italy and Spain and to a certain extent for Portugal&#151;the rural economies are a vital part of life. Some 35 per cent of people live in rural areas there and only 8 per cent in the United Kingdom. They say to me, &#147;You benefited extraordinarily well out of the Common Market policy because all the money that came to you went straight on to the farmers&#146; bottom line as profit and all your agricultural land has soared in value: why?&#148; As my noble friend Lord Ferrers pointed out, farming is no longer farming.</p>

<a name="80604-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08060475000010"></a>We have to look at where the production goes, to refer to my noble friend the Duke of Montrose. Where do shellfish harvested within the 12-mile limit go? They practically all leave the United Kingdom. The coquilles Saint-Jacques from the west coast of Scotland are the best in the world and command a premium price. They are biked or flown down, end up in Boulogne and overnight are transported even into the midst of Switzerland. We also have to look at fishing and at the high price of fish at the moment. The market for lobsters from Cornwall is the continent of Europe and there is now an international market in agricultural produce. We have to look at the subsidy for mass production, which I believe is going. Another very simple example is that the Spanish want to pull up their olive trees and grow more fruit trees in order to supply fruit to the United Kingdom. Vast Spanish lorries are loaded with oranges and they come here to sell us a product that we do not produce. On the other hand, the French want to buy the olive trees from Spain so that they can sell them to the rich British who buy houses in France. So a deal is being done and olive trees are moving like a commodity as gardening is becoming important.</p>

<a name="08060475000012"></a><a name="80604-0006.htm_spnew28"></a><b><a name="80604-0006.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="08060475000027"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> My Lords, it is clear that all sides of the House do not think that the common agricultural policy is very good. However, there have been major changes, as the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, said. I remember the Agenda 2000 debates in the late 1990s, which came through with major changes over the past five years, but they do not go far enough. The noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, said that we should never have had a common agricultural policy. Let us get real about this. In Europe&#151;before we joined the European Community&#151;as in the United Kingdom, all states subsidised agriculture at different levels. So in a single market, in a common market, those who subsidised their farming industries more, such as France, would have completely taken over and destroyed the industries of those who subsidised less, particularly the United Kingdom. That is why there had to be a common agricultural policy rather than just a single market that affects most other production and goods. I guess that many of us would hope that, at the end of the day, we could move to a point where that single market takes over from a separate common agricultural policy. Reform certainly needs to happen apace and needs to go further.</p>

<a name="80604-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08060475000013"></a>On the common fisheries policy, where there are no subsidies outside international fishing agreements, from which the UK does not benefit, we have a very bad regime which clearly has not worked well for all fishing stocks, not just our own. The question is how do we change that and is that a part of this Bill today? It could be a part of the Bill. Is the answer to have more reports, more talking, and to ask for debates that we can have any way? I do not believe that to be the case. That is a completely inadequate response to what we want. I know the fishing industry in the south-west quite well. If we said that because of the Lisbon treaty we would have more reports to Parliament from the Government, I think the fishing industry would be pretty disappointed and unimpressed by that outcome.</p>

<a name="80604-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08060475000014"></a>The strength of the Lisbon treaty has already been mentioned. As regards budgets, we have discretionary expenditure taking the role of the whole of the budget, with compulsory expenditure disappearing completely. We also have co-decision. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, mentioned in his speech that power should revert to Parliament. I believe that that is true at European level too. We should have more power in the European Parliament regarding agriculture and fisheries. Why do we discriminate in areas that the European Parliament should be able to make budgetary and legislative decisions on? That clearly does not make sense. That move in this treaty is an extremely good one.</p>

<a name="80604-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08060475000015"></a>The other good move in both these policies in terms of the Lisbon treaty is that the legislative process of the Council of Ministers is also opened up so we have

Those are the big moves forward and are the areas where the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy will in practice change. Will they change by having more reports than we already have to this House and the other place? I am all for parliamentary accountability, but I believe that this House is strong enough to ensure that already. If we have a problem in that, what we need is to rebalance the power of the legislature and the Executive in this country, and that may be a stronger way forward for European accountability and our own Ministers. What are not needed are this amendment, more discussion and more paperwork.</p>

In doing so, I shall probe the Minister on our exchange in Committee on 12 May, reported at col. 883 of <I>Hansard</I>. In that debate, I asked the Government whether they had made any calculation about the suffering in the developing world that has been caused by the common agricultural policy over the years. I think I pointed out that if we are to believe the Trade Justice Movement, CAFOD and Oxfam, we are looking at large numbers of people, mostly children, who have died because they cannot sell their products in their local markets, which are flooded with cheap European produce. Have the Government made any estimate of the extent of the environmental and human disaster that the common agricultural policy causes in the developing world?</p>

<a name="80604-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08060475000017"></a>Secondly, in Committee, I estimated&#151;and I do not think the Government disagreed&#151;that the additional cost of food to the British people is something like &#163;1,000 a year. May we have the latest estimate of that in view of the increase in prices, particularly of milk, sugar and bread, which hit the poorest in our country hardest? Are the Government still comfortable with their estimate of &#163;1,000 a year per family? I am taking this line because I believe that if we could reveal the true environmental catastrophe caused by these two policies, pressure for reform would grow and might become irresistible.</p>

<a name="80604-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08060475000018"></a>Turning to the common fisheries policy&#151;this is a new question that I did not put in Committee, but we have plenty of time as there is Third Reading to come&#151;what proportion of the fish that swam in European community waters when we joined in 1972 belonged to the United Kingdom? The Eurosceptic movement in this country uses the figure of 70 per cent, I believe with good reason, but what percentage did we have before we joined in 1972 and what percentage of the permitted catch are we now allowed to land? As an obvious corollary to those questions, how many UK fishermen were employed in 1972 before we joined the CFP and how many are employed today? To rub in the scale of the waste of the common fisheries policy, do the Government agree with the figure put forward by the Fisheries Commissioner Mr Borg, who estimates that 880,000 tonnes of dead fish are thrown back into the sea every year? If they agree that figure, they must agree that that amounts to 20,000 40-tonne lorries,  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_191"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which are full of dead fish that are thrown back into the sea every year. Or will the Government move towards the WWF figure of 2 million tonnes of dead fish that are thrown back every year and that make a nice, round figure of 50,000 articulated lorries? Can the Government confirm the scale of this disaster? Have they estimated the damage that this may be doing to the seabed? Has anyone looked at that?</p>

<a name="80604-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08060475000019"></a>In conclusion, I take up the words of the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, the chairman of your Lordships&#146; esteemed European Union Select Committee, and also to some extent the words of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, suggests that if we want to know the Government&#146;s position, we should come along tomorrow and listen. The Government will spell out their position and no doubt will want more reform. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked how we change this. I take the Minister back to our debate on 12 May, at col. 889 of <I>Hansard</I>, when I pressed him&#151;somewhat persistently, but we were in Committee&#151;on who exactly is responsible in Brussels for the continuation of this disaster.</p>

<a name="80604-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08060475000020"></a>Which countries will not change these policies? I now seek clarification from the Minister, because he would not tell me then which countries were guilty&#151;other noble Lords implied that they were led by France&#151;but he did tell us which countries we have vaguely on side in the reform of either the CAP or the CAP and the CFP. They are Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Estonia, Latvia, the Czech Republic and Malta. One does not have to be a great mathematician to see that that comes to eight countries. If you add us, that makes nine. That means that only one-third of the countries of the European Union are in favour of the reform of the CAP, or is it the CAP and the CFP? In Committee, did the Minister say that those countries were on our side for reform of both these policies, or is it just one of them?</p>

<a name="80604-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08060475000021"></a>My conclusion is obvious. My reply to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, is: what is the point of coming along tomorrow and listening to the Government&#146;s position on the common agricultural policy or the reform of both policies? If we are only one of nine out of 27, it does not matter what the Government&#146;s position is. As usual, all this is decided in Brussels. The only solution is and will remain&#151;at least until 2013, when the French have blocked the policies as they are and beyond&#151;that we get out of the European Union. The only way in which we will reform these policies is via the door. I support the amendment.</p>

I am certainly not going to take sides as to whether this debate should have taken place today or should take place tomorrow.

We welcome&#151;I hope that I am not giving too much away&#151;the report on the future of the common agricultural policy by a sub-committee of the European Union Committee, about which we have heard so much in this debate and  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_192"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which is chaired by my noble friend Lord Sewel. As the Government have already indicated, we share the key planks of the committee&#146;s conclusions on the direction of future policy, because frankly it resonates very closely with the Government&#146;s own vision for the CAP, which was published in 2005. I do not intend to go on at length about our vision for the CAP, because that is something best covered tomorrow, but the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, who moved the amendment, is entitled to an answer to some of the points he made during this debate. I hope that noble Lords will bear with me.</p>

<a name="80604-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="080604106000003"></a>The vision for EU agriculture envisages an industry that is fundamentally sustainable and integral to the European economy. It has to be internationally competitive, without reliance on subsidy or protection. It should be rewarded by the markets for its outputs&#151;not least, for safe and good quality food&#151;and by the taxpayer only for producing benefits for society that the market itself cannot deliver. It needs, obviously, to be both environmentally sensitive, maintaining and enhancing the landscape and wildlife while tackling pollution, and socially responsive to the needs of rural communities&#151;we heard about those from the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon&#151;while producing high levels of animal health and welfare. Yet it must not, lastly, distort international trade and the world economy.</p>

<a name="80604-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="080604106000004"></a>We are looking, then, at a farming industry which, by 2020, is: profitable in the marketplace, while it continues to produce the majority of the food we consume; making a positive net environmental contribution, particularly regarding climate change, yet wider than that; and managing the landscape and the natural assets underlying it. Further reform of the CAP is a key element in achieving both what we want in this country and our European vision for agriculture. Despite recent improvements, it is our view that the policy still distorts global markets, weighs farmers down with regulation and acts as a disincentive for them to improve their competitiveness.</p>

<a name="80604-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="080604106000005"></a>As a result, we call for an end to market support and direct payment elements of the common agricultural policy by 2015-2020 because they damage developing countries&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, just asked me a question about that. Those elements are also expensive and wasteful, delivering poor value for money, and restrict the ability of EU farmers to respond to market signals and become truly competitive. We believe that farmers can do just that, certainly in this country. That would represent a further evolution of the common agricultural policy that we now have. Price support would gradually diminish, as would other direct support to farmers, while agricultural markets would progressively open up. There would also be a central role&#151;rather than some peripheral one&#151;for rural development measures, including those targeted on protection and enhancement of the rural environment.</p>

That promises worthwhile adjustments to certain CAP mechanisms but will not, in itself, reduce overall CAP spending. The health check, however, has the potential to deliver beneficial changes which signal the ongoing nature of reform in that direction of market liberalisation and, at the same

A review is scheduled of the major CAP reforms of 2003, about which I will have something slightly more controversial, perhaps, to say in a moment or two. The legislative proposals published by the European Commission on 20 May, since our Committee debates, launches six months of negotiations with the intention of concluding the deal by the end of this calendar year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="080604106000007"></a>Our ambitions for this health check&#151;a process, remember, which is starting and not yet finished&#151;are first, to remove the production-linked farm payments that remained after those important 2003 reforms and to avoid the reintroduction of new distortions; secondly, to further shift the balance away from farm subsidies toward measures that protect and enhance our environment; thirdly, to simplify the bureaucracy associated with the CAP, including particularly the single payment scheme; fourthly, to simplify the system of cross-compliance and, lastly, setting a clear timetable for phasing out price support and market controls.</p>

<a name="80604-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="080604106000008"></a>We also want to phase out the milk quota system, which provides a smooth transition for dairy farmers and gives them the certainty that they need to plan their business and we want to put measures in place to capture the key environmental benefits provided by set aside. Many noble Lords will have read the comments of the agricultural commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel who was clear that the health check proposals,</p>
<ul><a name="080604106000268"></a>&#147;will move us further along the road of competitive and sustainable farming that can respond to demand and be part of the solution to the broader challenges that the world faces&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80604-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="080604106000009"></a>The Government will launch a full 12-week public consultation on the health check within the next couple of weeks. The health check proposals will be subject to the usual domestic parliamentary scrutiny procedures. An Explanatory Memorandum and impact assessment are being prepared. I am advised that they will be laid before both Houses within two weeks. Perhaps I may remind noble Lords&#151;if they need reminding, because it has been advertised enough&#151;about tomorrow&#146;s debate, which needs more speakers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="080604106000010"></a>In the longer-term, the EU budget will look at all EU spending post-2013 and is likely to result in a high-level Commission White Paper in 2009 before the Commission change-over, which will inform the negotiations for the next financial perspective which should begin in 2010-11. Due to its size the CAP will rightly be perhaps the key focus for the budget review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="080604106000011"></a>Perhaps I may gently chide the noble Lord, Lord Taylor. He is such a charming speaker and so popular in the House that one can occasionally excuse him for indulging in a bit of party politics. The fact that he mentioned the word &#147;consensus&#148; on a number of occasions does not mean that he was not making what I thought were some rather unwarranted attacks on the Government and their reform agenda. He asked whether the Government are serious about CAP reform and about our forcing the pace of change. I gently remind him that when his party was in power the CAP was rampant; precious little reform took place. The enthusiasm that there appeared to be from the then Government for CAP reform was rather like their lack of enthusiasm for the national minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="080604106000012"></a>Politically, one can understand precisely why that was the position, but it was not in the national interest. If the Conservatives are now absolutely on board for CAP reform and they mean it, they should welcome, as I hope that they do, the very major reform that this Government largely negotiated in 2003, which is the basis of any further reform that may occur. Those 2003 reforms moved this issue on, which is an achievement of this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="080604106000023"></a>The common fisheries policy was debated at length in Committee and I am grateful to noble Lords who have raised it today. We want to see the principles governing the future management of EU fisheries, a more stable regulatory framework and a more regional approach to decision-making. In Committee, the noble Duke praised the work and the setting up of those regional area committees, and better stakeholder involvement. No one would say that the common fisheries policy is working as we want it to. There were reforms in 2002. We strongly believe that if it were to be scrapped it would need to be replaced by something similar. But a lot of work needs to go on and a lot of reform needs to take place. We are grateful for the contribution made by the noble Earl in this debate. He referred particularly to discards, which we debated last time and no doubt we will debate many times. We are determined to make sure that the discard numbers come down, although it will be a difficult and complicated thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="080604106000024"></a>Reform is the order of the day for the common fisheries policy. It is being pursued in that field and in the common agricultural policy. The Government are keeping Parliament updated principally through the provision of Explanatory Memoranda on legislative proposals, but also via regular debates in the House on fisheries issues and ministerial Statements on the prospects for and outcome of agriculture and fisheries councils. Ministers have given evidence before parliamentary committees on some of the more detailed aspects of the reform programme. My noble friend Lord Sewel&#146;s European Committee is conducting an inquiry into common fisheries policy reform and, as I understand it, intends to produce a report before the summer. That will be an important report, which will offer a further opportunity for a debate on the Floor of this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="080604106000025"></a>On the basis of these existing opportunities that apply in both Houses of Parliament, there is no need for a further report.

I know that we are in a hurry, so I will note that seven of my questions were not answered; but there is one that he should answer.

That has been the driver behind many of the contributions to this debate. Frankly, there have been moments when I have felt like a hapless shepherd in &#147;One Man and his Dog&#148;, watching the sheep scampering all over the place and trying to get them into the shedding ring, or whatever it was called in those days.

That is what this amendment is about. In many ways, all the precursors to tomorrow&#146;s activity were relevant only in so far as they provided the evidence of a need for change and the reason why we need, within Parliament, a mechanism for change. That is the purpose of this amendment. From what people have said during this debate, I believe that there is consensus that the role of Parliament in these matters can and should be important. That is why, I am afraid, I cannot accept that Parliament has no formal role. I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="080604106000253"></a> Clause 2, page 1, line 12, after &#147;excluding&#148; insert&#151;</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="080604106000035"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said of a previous appearance of mine on another Bill that I was making my cameo appearance. I just want to say that this is my cameo appearance on this Bill. Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 tabled in my name are based on those that were tabled in Committee but were withdrawn because of lack of time. Amendment No. 3 is a probing amendment to discuss the issues of borders, asylum and immigration. There is not a huge amount in the Bill on these matters; indeed, there are only two small clauses, but they cover an extremely important area. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 focus more specifically on the two areas where we feel that the Government have failed to provide clarity or sufficient reassurances on the future development of European Union policy in these areas.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="080604106000036"></a>Regardless of the differing opinions that noble Lords will have on the benefit of the changes, I am sure that no one will disagree with me when I say that the changes that the treaty of Lisbon will make to the implementation of the UK&#146;s asylum and immigration policy are both fundamental and wide-ranging. The UK will no longer have a veto over the new treaty objectives to develop a common European asylum system and a common European immigration policy. Moreover, the European Court of Justice has extended its remit extensively, especially over asylum cases. These changes will have a very real effect not only on the procedures that will govern proposals at the EU level but also on how our national asylum and immigration policy will have to be implemented from day to day. Many of these changes relate to issues that, as with so many of the concerns that noble Lords have raised today and in Committee, the Government themselves raised while the constitution was being drawn up. I do not have much hope of receiving a meaningful response as to why the Government have changed their tune in these areas, but I feel that a few questions should be raised anyway.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_200"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80604-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="080604106000037"></a>One of the concerns was around the status of third-country nationals seeking asylum. The Government sought to resist the new uniform status that will  be valid throughout the Union. It was considered  by Peter Hain to be a &#147;fundamentally important amendment&#148;, as the provision would go against the United Kingdom&#146;s previous understanding about how the European asylum system would operate. Therefore, it was at government level that the concern was raised.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="080604106000038"></a>There were other concerns, too&#151;on asylum burden sharing, on the end of the veto on legal migration and on the possibility of EU interference in asylum seekers&#146; access to labour markets and social security. On all these, the Government failed to have their own amendments accepted, yet they now refuse to acknowledge that our continuing concerns have any foundation. The Government claim that the red lines will hold by means of the opt-out possibility. However, as my noble friends have made clear, what safeguards remain are not easy or often even desirable to implement. There are already clear indications that in the future the United Kingdom will be forced to make some unpalatable decisions as a result of the loss of our national veto.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="080604106000039"></a>For example, the Government wish to remain part of the Dublin II agreement, which brings with it benefits such as the ability to deport 100 asylum claimants a month back to the country from which they first entered the European Union. However, last November, Commissioner Franco Frattini made clear his intention to update the agreement to include burden sharing, which we understand the Government do not wish to participate in. Can the Minister give us any indication of whether the Government will opt out of this agreement entirely, or will they reluctantly submit to the EU deciding the UK&#146;s involvement in interstate transfers of immigrants and financial support? Similarly, will the Government opt out of the reception conditions directive, which sets minimum standards on the treatment of asylum seekers, or will they accept the Commission&#146;s plans to insist that asylum seekers have the right to work?</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="080604106000040"></a>Finally, I would like to probe the extended remit of the European Court of Justice. Geoffrey Hoon identified that weakening the safeguards around a claimant&#146;s right to appeal, in his words,</p>
<ul><a name="080604106000269"></a>&#147;might be an opportunity of further complicating our existing asylum and immigration process&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080604106000241"></a>What steps do the Government plan to take to prevent this from happening? I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="080604106000043"></a>Amendment No. 3, which is a blanket amendment to exclude the area, is completely unwise. Surely it is useful and valuable to have provision to strengthen the common EU borders through integrated border management and a common visa policy. I am in the odd position as a British MEP of negotiating Schengen biometric visa arrangements, which we are not opting in to. That is a peculiarity of the European Parliament.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="080604106000044"></a>It is sensible to have a common asylum policy where we avoid both forum shopping by asylum seekers and pass the parcel where people are shipped around because we have provisions about where the asylum application should be made. The noble Baroness referred to this point in relation to the so-called Dublin regulation, through which, if someone makes an asylum application in a country that is not the first EU country that they visited, they can be returned to that first country. A common asylum policy is sensible in order to have rational management of asylum flows.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="080604106000045"></a>The UK has opted in to all asylum legislation and measures, as well as those on combating illegal immigration. It has not opted in to anything on legal migration. It would be sensible for the EU to move towards including the UK, but that raises the question of borders, Schengen and so on. I am not prejudging that question, but at least it is sensible for the Schengen zone to have a coherent policy on both legal and illegal migration in the round.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="080604106000046"></a>If we are to have an area of free movement within the Schengen zone, of course we have to have common external borders. That is surely even in our interests. There are some measures that the UK has opted in to and will opt in to in the future; for instance, we opt in to part of the Schengen information system. It is entirely in our interests that the countries that are getting on with this as a normal part of their business should do so in an efficient and sensible way. When and if we decide that it is sensible for the UK to opt in, we will hope to opt in to rational arrangements. For example, I am sure that there will have to be some kind of arrangement for an exchange of visa data between the UK and the Schengen zone, which has set up the so-called visa information system. I declare an interest as the rapporteur on that. It will be in both parties&#146; interest to have some kind of pipeline between UKvisas and the Schengen VIS to exchange information, not least on undesirable people.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="080604106000047"></a>When and if we decide that we want to opt in to some of the measures, it makes sense that those measures should be good. Of course, the UK wanted to opt in to FRONTEX, the external borders agency, but we were not allowed to. The UK could not opt in because, under the existing protocols, there is a sort of lockout rule where we can be excluded if we have not taken part in the underlying Schengen-building arrangements. There is a downside; on a similar basis last December the European Court of Justice said that we could not opt in to the regulation on common standards for biometric features in passports. As I have said before in this House, when the Government says that the EU requires us to have biometric features in passports,  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_202"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that is not true. We are not legally bound because we were not allowed to opt in to the regulations. This has been an autonomous UK decision. I make no value judgment on that; it is the situation.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="080604106000048"></a>Under the Lisbon treaty, the UK position has become more flexible as regards our wide freedom to opt in or to stay out of EU proposals on justice and home affairs, including borders, immigration and asylum, although there are of course repercussions. If the UK declines to participate in an amending measure, we could be ejected from the original measure if that becomes inoperable. There are swings and roundabouts in the set-up. I speculate that an example could be an amended Schengen information system. If the Schengen information system is taken to a different technical level, we could find that we cannot operate one system when the rest are operating a more advanced system. Therefore, the system could become inoperable and there would be difficulties. In its impact report, the EU Committee also mentioned an amended European arrest warrant, but that is not borders and immigration.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="080604106000049"></a>I might have my personal views about the extent of the opt-out. I am not entirely sure that the wide extent of the opt-out is completely in the UK&#146;s interests; it might lead to our being isolated in some areas. However, it exists; that is a fact. We have complete freedom to opt out. It is also a difficulty that the Lisbon treaty does not make it any easier for the UK to opt in to measures that the UK does want, such as FRONTEX and the biometric passports, if we have not opted in to the measures that have built up to that point. The Council of Ministers&#151;the other member states&#151;can refuse our request to participate, just as now. However, that is where we are.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="080604106000050"></a>Therefore, whatever develops in borders, immigration and asylum, we will have a considerable interest in opting in to a lot of it. The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but I would certainly expect the UK to continue to opt in to the asylum legislation. It does not make sense to have 27 different asylum systems. It does not make sense for the UK to be excluded from this, not least because we benefit from it. As the noble Baroness said, we benefit from the Dublin regulation. It is operating and starting to work. We can politely direct people to the country of first visit, where they should make their asylum claim.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="080604106000051"></a>I hope that we do not see a trend develop, of which there have been some signs in the area of civil law, whereby the UK opts in after the negotiations are concluded. Tactically that might be regarded as a clever idea, because it means that the UK is not committed sooner than the point at which it wants to opt in, but I think that it weakens our influence. The Minister and I have seen each other in the corridors of Brussels, although I do not really do civil law.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="080604106000052"></a>I believe that it is in the UK&#146;s interests that common policies are developed in the EU, specifically in the Schengen zone, on good border management, integrated border management and common asylum and immigration policies. Regardless of whether we opt in to a large number of these policies, we want to live next door to a Schengen zone that is well managed in terms of immigration and combating illegal immigration, with a well managed asylum policy that is fair and

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="080604106000053"></a>I hope that we will be able to opt in to a considerable amount in this area. I hope that we might be able to opt in to FRONTEX in some way in order to contribute to the EU as a whole, ensuring that it has well managed external borders and free movement inside. Although we maintain our border controls, British citizens largely benefit from those arrangements when they travel round the EU or go to live in another EU member state. There are all kinds of ways in which we benefit from common, rational EU/Schengen borders, visas and asylum policies. We have the freedom to decide to opt in or out.</p>

<a name="80604-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="080604106000054"></a>I do not think that these amendments are useful and I do not see why they are necessary, because we have this freedom of the opt-out. With respect, those are my reasons for opposing the amendments.</p>

She explained very well and thoroughly her objections to Amendment No. 3 and I accept what she says; I do not necessarily agree with her but she explained logically her reasons for opposing Amendment No. 3. However, I do not think that she explained why she objects to Amendments Nos. 4 and 5. Amendment No. 4 would simply provide for extra safeguards against a move that might constitute a threat to the security of the United Kingdom and its citizens, while Amendment No. 5 would simply require the Secretary of State to explain why the Government have capitulated over a policy to which they formally objected quite strongly.</p>

I think that I explained why I thought that it was a good idea to have a common EU asylum policy and the fact that the UK has opted in to all the measures. The Government have taken a hard-headed look at it and seen that it is a good idea. I think that it is Article 63 and not 63a. Article 63 is asylum policy, not immigration. I do not know whether there is a misunderstanding but I think that I have explained my view on a common asylum policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="080604106000057"></a>On Amendment No. 4, I think that the best thing that the UK Government could do is to take an active role. Even if we do not opt in, there are many ways in which the UK Government can contribute to the development of rational and firm external borders in the EU. It is a bit regrettable that the European Court of Justice ruled against our membership of FRONTEX and I hope that the other member states will acknowledge that the UK has a contribution to make in this area. I do not think that this approach will be terribly helpful, as it is rather passive. I want to see us contribute actively even if we ultimately do not opt in.</p>

I think that this rather static approach is not as good as a dynamic one in which the UK Government take a full, strong role in policy discussions in Brussels, as they largely already do, even if they do not opt in to legal measures. That is a much better approach than the one in Amendment No. 4.</p>

I am pleased to be discussing this with her again as we have had the privilege of working together many times. I was rude in making a slight joke to her about opt-ins and civil justice. I do not disagree with what she was saying about the principle of not opting in at the end. As I said in Committee, it is a dangerous strategy not to opt in, but as I was the Minister who did not opt in, I felt I should make myself known. There were particular reasons for that, which I will not bore the House with now, but I completely endorse the principle of opting in on time or deciding not to opt in at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="080604106000061"></a>I begin with what the Lisbon treaty seeks to do. The first and most important thing is that nothing in this treaty affects the retention of our frontier controls. I would argue that FRONTEX, with the control across the European Union, adds an extra degree of security for our borders, but we are very clear that the control of our borders rests with this country. The opt-in which we currently have for asylum and immigration is retained and extended to cover the whole of justice and home affairs. That means that we have the right to choose across the board whether or not we participate in the measures around justice and home affairs. We do not opt in to measures that are inconsistent with our policies, particularly on border control, or against our national interests. That remains the same under the new treaty. But as the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, said&#151;and I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, agrees with her from her speech and from the work that she does&#151;there is an important aspect of co-operation across the European Union that is in our interest and to the benefit of the United Kingdom. Most of the transit routes to the UK for illegal migration and people traffic lie through the territory of EU  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_205"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>member states. Having stronger external borders and higher standards on issuing visas reduces the risk of illegal immigration into EU territory. As well as strengthening its external border, the European Union works with the source and transit countries to try and tackle the root causes of migration and stem the flow of illegal migration into the European Union territory. On that there is no disagreement. These are important ways of co-operating.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="080604106000062"></a>Specifically on Amendment No. 3, co-operation across the European Union is not new. It has been around since Maastricht and it has helped the UK to tackle illegal immigration more effectively. We share a common interest and work with our EU partners on immigration and asylum policy. We retain the right to opt in to measures within three months of publication, including amending measures, and we can ask to opt in at the end of the negotiations on those measures should they change sufficiently to become part of the UK&#146;s interests. I have already indicated the dangers of going down that road, but it does exist for us and we should recognise it.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="080604106000063"></a>In relation to Article 77 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union, which is about the border controls aspect, stronger external borders and higher standards will enable us to tackle more effectively illegal immigration into the territory. In Article 78 of the same treaty on asylum, we have been active participants in the work towards a common European asylum system, which benefits the UK by setting minimum European Union standards in relation to the treatment of those who seek asylum. That has the effect of helping to reduce the pull factor to the United Kingdom and it also helps to ensure that the European Union is a safe haven for those who are genuinely fleeing torture and persecution.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="080604106000064"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, referred to the issues around Dublin and the benefits that we have had of the regulations on Eurodac. Those are cornerstones of that common European asylum system. They allow us better to identify and return failed asylum seekers&#151;asylum shoppers, as they are known&#151;or those who have been proved to have transited through other member states and moved around the European Union making multiple asylum claims. Once identified, they are transferred back to the member state where they first sought asylum. That has brought massive benefits to the UK. As the noble Baroness said, a number have been returned. Since 2004, more than 6,000 failed asylum seekers have been returned to other member states&#151;100 a month. It is a funny terminology, but that makes us a net beneficiary of this system. We do not have to consider the claims because they are dealt with elsewhere, so there are huge financial savings. We reckon that this saves the UK about &#163;8 million a year, mainly because we are not detaining people. So financially and in many other ways, participation is in our national interest and therefore to be welcomed.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="080604106000065"></a>We have not opted in to directives on legal migration, as the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, said, because they are not consistent with our immigration control policies and could put pressure on our border controls. European Union measures on legal migration concern the conditions of entry and residence of third-country  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_206"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nationals and the definition of their rights of movement and residence. They do not concern the number of third-country nationals to be admitted. For the sake of clarity, Article 79(5) of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="080604106000254"></a>&#147;This Article shall not affect the right of Member States to determine volumes of admission of third-country nationals coming from third countries to their territory in order to seek work, whether employed or self-employed&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080604106000066"></a>Article 80 of the new treaty is about the fair sharing of responsibility between member states and policies that relate to border checks, asylum and immigration. It relates to the existing articles of the EC treaty and is about measures to promote a balanced effort between member states in receiving and bearing the consequences of receiving refugees and displaced persons.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="080604106000067"></a>Amendment No. 4 is about the effectiveness of the external border controls of other member states and we would argue that there are rigorous procedures in place in the form of the Schengen evaluation process that assesses the security of the external borders of EU member states. I am one of the few people I know who have been to Schengen. I have even heard the Schengen anthem which was played in my presence. Schengen is a very small village that happens to border three countries and the original process took its name because of that. Sadly I even remember when I went to Schengen. It was 2 June 2005. Noble Lords should not read anything into that about joining Schengen. I just happened to be there. We attend meetings of the Schengen evaluation working group and we get its report. Those reports are important because they underpin the efforts we are making to strengthen our external borders. The Schengen states do a thorough evaluation of the countries which apply to join the system, such as Bulgaria and Romania, before deciding whether to lift border controls. We cannot prevent the rest of the European Union lifting their internal border controls.</p>

I recall visiting NCIS some years ago and meeting a number of British police officers who had taken part in inspecting external border controls in other states. Do the British participate in these external border inspections?</p>

<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="080604106000069"></a><a name="80604-0009.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80604-0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080604106000649"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> My Lords, indeed they do. That is an important aspect of the way in which the UK Government make sure that we are involved appropriately, without giving up our own border control, which is of enormous importance. We are not seeking to do anything, nor would we, that would in any way impact on our right to maintain our own frontier controls and security. We recognise the enormous benefits in participating as we do and supporting colleagues in the European Union who have, through their border controls, made it more difficult for people to enter illegally, and easier for us to collaborate and co-operate to try to deal with concerns that the Government have and that noble Lords quite rightly raise.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="080604106000070"></a>On Amendment No. 5, we do not oppose any of the measures in the new Article 78. During the convention on the new constitution, we proposed alternative language. We did not oppose the article we see reflected in this  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_207"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>treaty but wanted to propose a simplified article on asylum, focusing more strongly on the purpose of asylum co-operation. However, we accepted the outcome of the negotiations as part of the overall package; there was nothing of substance within that. This is about emphasis or, indeed, language. That package includes the opt-in, of course, which has operated for nearly nine years in this area. As I have already said, for all JHA measures, we will have the right to decide whether we wish to participate.</p>
<a name="time_16"></a>
<a name="80604-0009.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="080604106000279"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="080604106000071"></a>That sets out the essence of where we are. To recap, there is a long history of collaboration, co-operation and, appropriately, clear retention and control of our own borders and security. There is also collaboration on asylum that works effectively, particularly because of Dublin and Eurodac, and has enabled us to return people. In so doing, we have the common standards that prevent the pull to the UK and ensure that people are treated appropriately.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="080604106000072"></a>On the comments of my right honourable friend Geoff Hoon on the European Court of Justice, and the long negotiations to which I was party on whether there could be references from courts lower than the House of Lords in identifying what the ECJ could interpret for us, two things have changed to make us comfortable with it. First, there is an expedited procedure. Our concern was that cases would be sent off to the European Court of Justice and could take a considerable amount of time, which was not appropriate for those seeking to sort out their status as quickly as possible. The expedited process will enable us to do that quickly, and that major concern has therefore disappeared. Secondly, we have had discussions with the senior judiciary to ensure that cases of merit go to the European Court of Justice, and any that are not do not do so. The process will not therefore become a way of slowing down cases by sending them off to Europe. I do not suggest that that could have happened, but that was our concern. We are now comfortable that that will not happen, and therefore have no concerns about it.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="080604106000073"></a>Finally, noble Lords have expressed concerns about social security issues for those who come here. Of course, we have a separate break on social security issues. That means that any member state worried about the impact on social security can take that decision to the European Council, where it is made by unanimity. I hope that I have answered in as much detail as I can all the points raised in the three amendments, and that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

Listening to the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, I can see that we would be in the usual position where she would not support anything I have proposed. That has been pretty well the position throughout discussions on this legislation.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="080604106000075"></a>As I said, this is by and large a probing amendment. Perhaps one of the most important aspects of borders and asylum is security. We discussed this at length   


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_208"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>during the passage of the UK Borders Bill when our own border agency was set up. It was clear then that the security of our borders was extremely important. We want to be absolutely sure that we are not blown off that course in any way.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="080604106000076"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, referred to FRONTEX. My understanding was that one of the problems of being excluded from it was that it now does not have access to our intelligence, and vice versa. There are problems of a lack of co-operation. We do not disagree about co-operation, but we still have anxieties about the amount of co-operation and force that will come about.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="080604106000077"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for her typically clear reply. She probably did not answer whether the Government had any intention of opting out of the reception conditions directive, but perhaps she could let me have that in writing; that would be helpful. With all the other aspects we have discussed, we will remain sceptical as to whether, if push comes to shove, the lines will hold. That is the great danger that we see which the Minister is trying to be reassuring about, saying that we have everything stacked up to ensure that we can manage our own affairs. Our concern is that we have not, and that there would be occasions when the Government would now find it difficult, under the circumstances brought about through this legislation, to hold the line. If that was the case, we would probably have to come back to it again. For tonight, however, I beg leave to withdrawn the amendment.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="080604106000081"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, of course we need to make progress, but we now come to an amendment about which I feel very strongly. Both I and my noble friend Lord Kingsland have raised this point before in various discussions on the Bill. I am afraid the matter is just too important for us to let it lie.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="080604106000082"></a>I am certain that most fair-minded people will share our first-level concern about the possibility that financial penalties may be imposed on the UK for future breaches of European correctness. More significantly, however, this real and present financial concern is also inextricably linked with deeper and wider doubts about how effective our notional opt-outs are really going to be in future.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="080604106000083"></a>I recall a number of unedifying tussles when I was a Secretary of State, most notably over proposed limits to the working week. Our European partners tried a  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_209"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 209</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>series of different means to achieve the same ends, repeatedly finding one avenue blocked and immediately seeking out another. It was therefore with great sympathy that I read the proceedings of the European Scrutiny Committee in another place. It has played devil's advocate repeatedly by highlighting the uncertain nature of our supposed right to opt in or out and subsequent doubts about our ability to safeguard our national interests post-Lisbon.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="080604106000084"></a>This provision effectively guarantees that financial penalties will in future be levied on the UK if our refusal to opt in to an amended measure makes the existing measure inoperable, as a consequence of which the whole package has to be discarded. Ministers will no doubt cling, as the Minister clung last time, to the assertion that the provisions allow only for necessary and unavoidable financial consequences to be charged to the UK, in what they apparently consider to be the most unlikely event of the provisions being implemented. I ask again: how can the Government be confident about this? They are making what I suppose has come to be regarded as the classic ministerial error.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="080604106000085"></a>Around the year 375 AD, Flavius Renatus first coined the immortal phrase, &#147;Si vis pacem, para bellum&#148;. The Minister will not, of course, need me to explain that this means if you want peace, prepare for war. Although the contemporary parallel under the amended treaty of Rome is happily less bellicose, the principle is the same.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="080604106000086"></a>As a Minister, I learnt that the best approach to European and all other international treaties and agreements is to hope for the best but prepare for the worst. Ministers cling to the optimistic hope but neglect the second half of that formulation&#151;the preparation for unwelcome eventualities&#151;at their and our peril. Where is this infallible crystal ball that gives the Minister such certainty and privileged knowledge about what will happen in the future? For the rest of us, alas, the intentions of our European partners are shrouded in mystery and we therefore seek to reserve our position. Of course, much of this will be contingent on the decision on whether an existing measure is operable or inoperable, and on what the necessary and unavoidable financial consequences may be, but both these decisions will be made by qualified majority voting so we will have no veto whatever over what our European partners decide to do, or over what they might decide we should do.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="080604106000087"></a>On the previous occasion I was unable to persuade the Minister, even when I quoted the very emphatic words of the chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee in another place, Michael Connarty. Noble Lords may recall that I quoted his phrase:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="080604106000256"></a>&#147;These are bullying clauses and I am shocked that you try to defend them&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/5/08; col. 1053.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080604106000242"></a>I have reread the full transcript, which contained an interesting exchange between the chairman and the Foreign Secretary. That gives me great confidence in the ability of the Select Committee system to test Ministers. After he said, &#147;These are bullying clauses&#148;, Michael Connarty went on to say,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="080604106000257"></a>&#147;I say that in the spirit of comradeship ... I know what is happening out there, we have just been through it&#151;a lot of nations are unhappy with the UK, they say, contaminating the process because we have opt-outs and Protocols, and these appear

</ul>
<p><a name="080604106000243"></a>At this point the Foreign Secretary could contain himself no longer and interjected:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="080604106000244"></a>The chairman of the Select Committee, may he ever more be praised, said, &#147;Let me finish&#148;. He went on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="080604106000259"></a>&#147;Or on the other hand to cajole us or pressurise us to opting in. On those terms I do not think anyone with a bit of principle would sign up to them&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080604106000245"></a>I dare say that the Minister will not be persuaded by me and her colleague, the Foreign Secretary, was not persuaded by a Labour Member in another place. However, I would like to hear her at least attempt to explain in clearer terms exactly why these provisions were allowed to remain in.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="080604106000088"></a>On the previous occasion we debated this in Committee, I asked the Minister to give examples of situations where these provisions could come into effect. I was minded to take the amendment to a vote but she got up, looked me straight in the eye and said, with regard to examples, that,</p>
<ul><a name="080604106000270"></a>&#147;if I find any then I will certainly send them to the noble Lord. He would expect me to say that, and I would do so&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080604106000246"></a>At that point I said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="080604106000260"></a>&#147;That is all I needed to hear and ... I beg leave to withdraw the amendment&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/5/08; col. 1055.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080604106000247"></a>A week went by after that and nothing came in the post. Indeed, my birthday was a week later but nothing arrived. My wedding anniversary was a week later still and there was not even a card, not even a billet-doux. Since then I have heard nothing at all so I await with anticipation what the Minister will say tonight. I beg to move.</p>

Very few people understand it and I am not at all sure that I am one of them. Clearly, it was deliberately designed to be a very obscure area. That is one of the reasons my party is sceptical about the extent of opting-in and opting-out. Indeed, as my question in the middle of the Minister&#146;s previous speech suggested, there are areas where we appear to have opted out but where we are nevertheless taking an active part. I have sometimes wondered very unworthily in the past few years whether this is designed to obscure from the <I>Daily Mail</I>, the <I>Telegraph</I> or the British public how deeply involved we are in all this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="080604106000090"></a>This is a worst-case amendment, as I think the noble Lord recognises. It is a belt-and-braces measure to address the difficulty of dealing with those foreigners across the channel and the possibility that they might somehow outwit the British on occasions, or perhaps that the present Government or any future Government might fall over their feet so badly in trying to do the delicate dance they do between opt-ins and opt-outs and when they are half opting in and when half opting out that they might end up facing this penalty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="080604106000091"></a>My position and that of my party group is that we are participating in an ongoing system. We hope that we are negotiating in good faith. We do not expect our partners in the European Union to double cross us

I still have the image before me of the unedifying tussles that he mentioned, which must have been a sight to see. I seek to defend myself a little against the accusation that he made as regards not providing examples. I gave two examples on the previous occasion and said that I would come back to him if I could find any more. I have not found any more. The examples that I gave were the best available. I hope that reassures him as it means there are not loads of examples of how the UK might find itself in that position.</p>

<a name="80604-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="080604106000093"></a>I reiterate what I said in the previous debate. The phrase &#147;financial penalty&#148; does not appear anywhere in the treaty. It is not a concept at all. The treaty says that if the UK were to come out of something and that rendered it inoperable&#151;&#147;inoperable&#148; is the first of three words which should reassure the noble Lord because they are clear and precise&#151;it is reasonable that the UK should bear the costs of such action, should there be any. The qualified majority vote would be the process by which a decision on whether a measure was inoperable would be reached. For obvious reasons of collaboration across the European Union it is important that if we have created a situation in which a measure is inoperable, that decision should be reached in an appropriate manner. I believe that is the appropriate way to reach it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="080604106000094"></a>Then a second decision would have to be reached to say that the measure had become inoperable and whether any financial consequences arose from that. However, they would have to be direct financial consequences necessarily and unavoidably incurred as a result of our withdrawal from the measure. The two examples I gave concerned where a software program could no longer be used because the UK&#146;s withdrawal from it meant that it had to be completely rewritten, or if we withdrew from an agency where we had staff we should bear the costs of repatriating them, make any redundancy payments and so on because it was because of us that they were having to be removed from the agency.</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="080604106000095"></a>They are the only two examples that I can think of and the only two examples that make sense to me. There may be other circumstances, but I hope that the noble Lord will be reassured by the fact that there were not lots of circumstances where I could see inoperability applying and financial consequences unavoidably occurring as a direct result of what the UK had done. Those words reassure me. I am not an optimist or a pessimist, but a realist. If you look at what has been agreed and test those words against our understanding of what it would mean; if you look long and hard at what the consequences could be and

Our Committee in your Lordships&#146; House recognised that this was a strict threshold. I do not know what else I can add; nor should I take your Lordships&#146; time in seeking to flower this any further. The wording is clear. It sets out the conditions that would have to be met and that could be tested in court if need be. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

As I said in opening, my worry is that, because we refuse to opt in to an amended measure, it might become inoperable and, as a consequence, the whole package would have to be discarded. In those circumstances, my fear is that there would be an argument that the costs of all the other participants should be billed to the United Kingdom, because it was our action that caused the whole package to be discarded. The Minister has not dealt with that. She referred merely to the cost of bringing home our own staff. I wonder about the costs of all the other nations that are then unable to take forward the package because we have caused the whole operation to be discontinued.</p>

However, I cannot think of anything that operates across the European Union, either in an agency or in a programme, where our removal from it would result in all the other 26 nations failing to function at all. I can see that we might have to rewrite a software program or bring our people back because we have left an agency in which the other 26 countries were operating. However, with the best will in the world, I cannot think of an example in which, because the UK is not there, all the other 26 nations find themselves incapable of continuing with it. I hesitate to say this to the noble Lord, but I do not think that his proposition bears much scrutiny.</p>

I do not want to share too much private information, but when I was in government, I found that it was my own side that caused me the greatest concern.

I am not talking about &#147;double cross&#148; or &#147;foreigners across the channel&#148;. I am talking about people who might have a claim against us, because we had originally thought we might participate and then decided for various reasons not to. I recall that the biggest problem that I had was often with the Treasury, which, after I agreed to take forward a reform, would suddenly remove the funding. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that we go quite a long way in a particular direction, only to find that we do not have the funding or the support of some of our colleagues.</p>

I say to the Minister that I would love her&#151;here I must not be quoted out of context&#151;to go away and think through the sort of consequence that I am talking about, where the software system, as a result of our refusal to participate, is thrown into jeopardy.

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="080604106000110"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this draft order is the first in a planned series of affirmative resolution orders that will be brought before this House as part of the implementation of the White Paper <I>Trust, </I><I>A</I><I>ssurance and </I><I>S</I><I>afety</I>. The aim of the reforms is to enhance public confidence in the ability of the healthcare regulatory bodies such as the Nursing and Midwifery Council to protect the public interest and deal with poor professional standards.</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="080604106000111"></a>Public concern has been highlighted by a number of high-profile cases, such as those involving Dr Shipman and the nurse Beverly Allitt. Those cases led to a number of detailed inquiries&#151;including the Shipman inquiry led by Dame Janet Smith&#151;that have made a number of far-reaching recommendations. The order is part of the process of implementing those recommendations. It makes various amendments to the framework legislation for the regulation of nurses and midwives&#151;the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001.</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="080604106000112"></a>The main changes relate to the governance arrangements of the NMC. They include moving the NMC from a partially elected to a fully appointed council, in response to the recommendation from Dame Janet Smith that professional interests should not unduly influence council members. Members are to be appointed by the independent Appointments Commission against specified skills and competencies. There will be provision for a separate constitution order to specify  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_215"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the numbers of lay and professional members and their terms of office, and there will be provisions with respect to the suspension and removal of members. We expect that the NMC will have seven registrant and seven lay members, making it smaller, more board-like and more strategy-focused.</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="080604106000113"></a>There will be changes to the provisions relating to the NMC&#146;s committee structure to make them less prescriptive. The changes were originally included in the Health Care and Associated Professions (Miscellaneous Amendments) Order, which was published for consultation on 22 November last year. In its response to that consultation, the NMC raised concerns about the timescale for making the changes, in particular about the difficulties for it if it needed to hold elections to its council in 2008. Each year, a quarter of the elected representatives on the council come up for re-election. The NMC asked if its provisions in the draft order could be brought forward in a separate order in time to avoid this summer&#146;s elections, hence this order standing separately from the other orders, which are still to come.</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="080604106000114"></a>The Government have similarly responded to requests to avoid elections made last year by the General Medical Council and the General Dental Council. We recognise that the cost and disruption of holding an election for council members who will serve at most one year of a four-year term would not be sensible. The order therefore includes provisions to cancel the elections that were due this year, which were for the elected representatives on the council in the English national constituency.</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="080604106000115"></a>The order also makes a number of other miscellaneous amendments. Those worth noting in particular include the following. For the first time, the council&#146;s annual report will have to include a description of the arrangements that the council has put in place to ensure that it adheres to good practice in relation to equality and diversity. The NMC will be able to give enhanced prescribing rights to more of its registrants in an emergency such as pandemic flu. The NMC will be able to strike off registrants who are barred from working with children or vulnerable adults when the new independent barring board is established. All those measures are supported by the NMC. I commend the order to the House. I beg to move.</p>

The impact of what is being proposed is far-reaching, and perhaps more far-reaching than one would think at first sight. To restructure the supervising body of any profession is not to be undertaken lightly. One might start by  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_216"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>asking the Minister about the reconstitution of the Royal College of Midwives into a body of appointed members rather than elected members. I do not know whether this is in any way unique, but it seems to me that it is unusual for the Appointments Commission to be in a position of appointing professional people. My first question is, in terms of those who will be appointed, will the Appointments Commission use senior royal college members to act as adjudicators or judges of who is going to go forward? Who will it get to help with those appointments? Lay members are easier to appoint, because they have a completely different role to play, but professional members have a specific role. They will need to be people of the utmost quality. That needs to be carefully guarded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="080604106000119"></a>The other thing that struck me was the constitution. I understand that will be covered by yet another order, and I presume that it will be drawn up only after the new body has been formed; or is it to be formed now in conjunction with the current Nursing and Midwifery Council, before it is abolished? Which comes first; the chicken or the egg, in terms of the constitution?</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="080604106000120"></a>I know that the Royal College of Midwives has had concerns about the cancellation of the elections this year for England. I am now less concerned. I understand that it has an issue with that, but it seems to me that if you are going to make a change as major as this, you will want to put new people in place as soon as you can.</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="080604106000121"></a>I know that this is tied up with civil contingencies and all the problems associated with emergencies, but I found it rather odd to be picking out not-quite-registered members of the profession to be identified as being able to order drugs, or whatever was required. If we have an emergency such as a pandemic, it will require more than a few unregistered midwives to help with that. I suppose that other people will be used. Otherwise, this will be a strange and rather small addition to what has been proposed. My concerns are mostly about the appointment of the professional members and who will be appointing them. I would like to know a little bit more about those who will be involved if the emergency contingency was to happen&#151;I hope that it never will.</p>

The present situation is clearly unsatisfactory. I think that everyone agrees that 12 elected nurses and 11 lay members have proved to be a very cumbersome NMC. I think that there is general agreement that it should be reformed, and the Royal College of Nursing is very supportive of that. I have a few comments and questions.</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="080604106000123"></a>First, a general comment: why does the new council have to be entirely appointed? I am seriously worried that everything in this country is run by quangos that have members appointed by the Appointments Commission overseen by the Privy Council, which is presumably overseen by the Government. I think I said a few weeks ago that the health service is a rather Stalinist organisation. It feels like that when everything is appointed and there is no element of election or the professions being able to choose their own representatives.  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_217"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I share the reservations of the noble Baroness on the Conservative Benches but urge the Government to take heed of this warning. We must not have an all-appointed country. They are keen on talking about devolving responsibility and power downwards yet they devolve that responsibility to bodies that have been appointed by themselves, directly or indirectly. That concerns me.</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="080604106000124"></a>Secondly, there will be seven professional members on the new NMC. Will the Government ensure that there are general nurses, midwives and perhaps community nurses represented on the NMC? Community and district nurses in particular are going to be extremely valuable in the health service in the years to come because patients are admitted to hospital for a much shorter period. They should get representation on the NMC.</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="080604106000125"></a>I have some concern about stopping the elections. It may be two or three years before the new council comes into being. Again, my democratic soul rankles at the fact that elections will be stopped. If we decided to change the way we elected our MPs, would you really tell all the MPs that they could stay on for a couple of years or so until the new system came in? I think not. It is better to have people elected even if only for a short time before the new arrangements come into play.</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="080604106000126"></a>There is a valid concern from the midwives, too&#151;that they may lose the Midwifery Committee, one of the four statutory committees that exist at the moment. How will the council consult midwives if the committee goes? The midwives are hugely important. Let us face it: they are the branch of nursing that brings the next generation into the world. There could not be a more important group. They really must be consulted by the NMC. I hope the Minister will tell us that there will still be a Midwifery Committee.</p>

<a name="80604-0010.htm_para20"></a>

Nurses are extremely well qualified and talented people, capable of all sorts of duties that at the moment they are not allowed to perform. I do not have many reservations about that; it is an excellent thing. Should a national emergency occur, there should be this immediate upgrading to do jobs that are needed in the community.</p>

It is always very boring to throw Explanatory Memorandums at Ministers because they probably have not had a chance to open them, but I think the Minister said that the nurses and midwives would be given powers to prescribe in advance of an emergency. That is not what the Explanatory Memorandum says. Paragraph 7.2 refers to the need,</p>
<ul><a name="080604106000271"></a>&#147;to make temporary annotations to its register during the sort of civil emergency where other civil contingency arrangements will be in place&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080604106000248"></a>It will be quite cumbersome, because it could not be done in advance. You would have to see a pandemic coming and then register nurses and midwives. What the Minister says makes sense. Such people would not be fully qualified because they are not registered. They are registrants&#151;people coming on to the register. She might like to clarify that.</p>

The noble Baroness is completely correct. These measures are essentially reserved powers which have been legislated for to provide options in the event of emergencies. The provisions are drafted in such a way as to provide maximum flexibility. The NMC wishes to ensure that anyone whose register is annotated in this way can operate safely and effectively&#151;so it refers to people who are on the register. It is currently developing a protocol for the use of those powers, which we will see in due course.</p>

That debate became rather wider than some of us would have wished and turned into a general debate on different views about how Europe should progress.

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="080604106000148"></a>This amendment would provide for an annual reporting process on the powers, duties and role of the president of the EU Council. I gather that some of these things have not been decided and perhaps cannot be decided yet, but it would be helpful to me, and perhaps to some other noble Lords, if we could have a little more thoughts and updates from the Minister on where discussions on the powers, duties and role of the president have got to. In the previous debate, a noble Lord reminded us that creating new positions and ensconcing individuals in them always has consequences and raises new questions about their continuation, power and so on. We are still not totally clear about what role this president will play and how he or she will interrelate with the rotating president, who will continue to be a national head of state. How will these two activities dovetail? When will the final decisions be taken on that and on other logistical matters that were raised in the previous debate but could not be answered at the time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="080604106000149"></a>The Minister of State helpfully wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, about what he called implementation issues. They involve matters that the Slovenian presidency is urging should be addressed while the process of ratification unfolds. They include a list of discussions on the Council presidency. I shall not detain noble Lords by reading them out because I think that the Minister will be familiar with them. With those few words, I ask that we now carry forward some of these issues and possibly tie up a few of the loose ends on this important role that is to be created should the Bill pass and the treaty be ratified. I beg to move.</p>

In earlier debates on the Bill, concerns were expressed about the possibility of a single leader emerging to speak for the Union as a whole. That is no part of the provision of the treaty of Lisbon, which quite clearly strengthens the role of the President of the Council but also creates the much more influential double-hatted high representative, whose influence will therefore be considerably elevated in the conduct of foreign policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="080604106000153"></a>These things are all devised to enhance the effectiveness of the European Union, and whatever view one takes of the European Union&#151;members of the Conservative Opposition have all protested their strong European credentials, which must indicate that they want the European Union to be effective and to speak with one voice when it participates in world organisations or seeks to advance the collective views of the whole&#151;it is necessary to have leadership. Anything that underpins that in the treaty is welcome. I do not want the Government at this stage to go into great detail about how they anticipate that these roles might be discharged in the circumstances that lie ahead. The purpose of this constitution in broad terms is to provide room for manoeuvre. That is an important aspect of working constitutions.</p>

Any attempt to define the precise role of the Prime Minister has to be linked to the period about which you are talking. The Prime Minister&#146;s role has been exercised very differently even during the time of this Government: his role, relative to the committees of the Cabinet, has shifted depending on the Prime Minister. Similar arrangements and flexibility are highly desirable in this instance and I very much hope that the Leader of the House will not feel tempted to draw too tight a prescriptive role in this debate or, indeed, to crystal-ball-gaze on how it may all develop in the months ahead.</p>

I would like to hear the Government&#146;s point of view on how this new post will develop. It is essential that we should know exactly what the Government think about it. We have had various declarations from the previous Prime Minister&#151;but not, I think, from the present one&#151;who thought that the post of president of Europe was important and that it should be taken by somebody who spoke for Europe on the world stage. I do not know whether that is actually printed in the treaty; nevertheless, the view of our then Prime Minister was that the job would, in fact, be very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="080604106000158"></a>At present, there is no question about how the role of President of the Council works. Because it rotates every six months, there are, I believe, checks and balances built in and everybody is given a turn. That means that power is not concentrated on one person for a significant period. What worries me about the proposed presidency&#151;whether we need a president at all is, of course, a different argument&#151;is that this is how individuals and organisations get a power creep. The longer they go on, the more they like the job and the more power they wish to exercise. That power can be exercised only at the expense of the nation states, which has always been a worry to me. I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to tell me exactly how the Government see it&#151;differently from me, probably, but I would like to hear it.</p>

It is difficult to say now exactly how it will be in two, three, four or five years&#146; time.

I think that I previously have described the relationship, for example, of a key country, in the shape of Russia and President Putin. From 2000 to 2007, he had 16 meetings with the European Union  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_224"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 224</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with 16 heads of state. In Committee, I said that I was very concerned about continuity at the time of the development of those relationships. My argument would be that there is something quite fundamental about moving to a position where one is able to be in that position for longer.</p>

<a name="80604-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="080604106000166"></a>Noble Lords will know that we move from the Slovenian presidency to the French presidency shortly, but President Sarkozy still will have to continue dealing with all the issues in France, as well as with the European Union presidency. I believe that we would get a better deal from having someone whose focus is on the European Union, particularly with 27 member states and with the issues that we described in Committee that are facing the European Union as well as those individual states. The principle of a President who can focus on the European Union is very important.</p>

<a name="80604-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="080604106000167"></a>The specifics, which the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, in particular, was concerned about, are contained within the consolidated treaties in Article 15. But let me put them on the record very briefly. First and foremost, the role of the President would be to chair and drive forward the work of the European Council. He or she would focus on those meetings, make sure that they are effective and responsive to member states, and take the agenda forward. He would ensure the preparation and continuity of the work of the European Council to take forward its agenda to make sure that its work is detailed, considered and is able to take decisions. He would endeavour to facilitate cohesion and consensus within the European Council; that is, the work behind the scenes.</p>

<a name="80604-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="080604106000168"></a>Noble Lords know how important it is, before the set-piece debates, to ensure that the contributions and discussions of member states enable the meeting to have the greatest value. I never underestimate that. It will be the President&#146;s role to present a report to the European Parliament after each meeting of the European Council, and to be the spokesperson, going into the European Parliament to explain what has happened. This is an important role&#151;which the presidency would fulfil in any event&#151;for somebody who can take that on and is able to deal with the European Parliament appropriately. The President would ensure the external representation of the European Union in a way that is complementary to the work of the High Representative, but none the less recognises the important role of the President in common foreign and security policy issues.</p>

<a name="80604-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="080604106000169"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, spoke extremely articulately about the issue of flexibility; I agree with him completely. Designing a job, and a job description for any role, is, in part, about the person who will fulfil that role. Therefore, we are trying to make sure, in an evolutionary way, that we recognise that the person who fulfils this job will bring to it talent, expertise, knowledge and experience. This will ensure that they do the job efficiently, but will, in a sense, also determine the focus that they may have, working closely with the High Representative, who will bring different skills to that role. Therefore, we would be wrong to try to detail exactly what the role should be in a way that prevents somebody coming into that role making it their own. I give way.</p>

Does she envisage the role of this new President of the European Union&#151;because that is, I think we can all agree, what he will become known as&#151;having the power to sign treaties, and does she see him receiving ambassadors? Has the noble Baroness got as far as that?</p>

I make a distinction with the President of the Council. The noble Lord seeks to position this role in a different way for all sorts of reasons that I can imagine. It is a function that is performed on a six-monthly basis by the state that carries the presidency. It has become clear, over the years, that the rotating presidency has strengths and weaknesses. It is important to acknowledge where having somebody in position for longer can bring coherence and continuity to the European Union&#146;s work. That is exactly what this is, and no more. The role is not meant to move us into a position that the noble Lord fears might arise. I can assure him of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="080604106000172"></a>There will be, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said, rotating team presidencies. There has been greater collaboration between the presidency in position, the previous presidency and the next presidency, so that there is a kind of triumvirate working more closely together to greater effect, in my experience, so that you get continuity running through decisions. That has been extremely effective for the presidency. They will chair the sectoral councils. The noble Lord will be familiar with ECOFIN and the Justice and Home Affairs Council. They will not chair the Foreign Affairs Council because, under the proposals, that will be chaired by the High Representative. That will continue. There will be greater coherence and consistency because of the team presidencies that operate over 18 months. The experience of that has been that the agenda, although set within the presidency, is also linked to the presidency before and the presidency after. You have the three presidencies moving together. That has been a more effective way of moving forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="080604106000173"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jay, asked about scrutiny, and how this would be brought to your Lordships&#146; attention. The Minister for Europe wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, chair of the Scrutiny Committee, on 22 April. A copy of that letter has been laid in the Library, as noble Lords will have seen. It describes how the Government intend to keep Parliament involved. In that letter, the Government commit to ministerial contact with the Scrutiny Committee ahead of any decisions that might be taken to implement any of the issues concerned with this amendment. There will of course be an update before the June European Council, as noble Lords would expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="080604106000174"></a>I hesitate over the word &#147;analysis&#148; because I am not sure how to interpret it. The noble Lord, Lord Jay, will forgive me, but I want to think about it a little more. Underpinning what he said is the need to ensure that Parliament is kept informed of the development of this role. I am sure that within the context of regular reports to the committees, that will happen. Perhaps I may say in the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, that it is not least because the committees are

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="080604106000175"></a>I complete my response by saying that I do not believe the amendment is necessary because we already have the process in place. It will enhance the opportunities for the European Union to operate effectively, not least when talking to countries outside the Union. I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

As I made clear in moving it, I have brought it forward more in the spirit of seeking clarification. I confess that I remain uneasy and puzzled by some of the propositions before us. Of course presidencies evolve. The presidency of the United States has evolved in ways that make it vastly different from when the original constitution was drawn up. On the whole, however&#151;I am not sure whether it is the case for the Philadelphia Constitution&#151;constitutions tend to define the actual powers in relation to the legislature and other institutions of authority within a state and they tend to define the powers of the president. I do not want to get into an argument at this stage, although we will certainly get into an argument later, on whether this is a constitution because it has the same wording as what was called a constitution, although many people argue that that should not have been called a constitution either. Thereby springs many of our troubles. Nevertheless, this is an attempt to bring more coherence by one means or another, in this case by amending various treaties rather than putting around them the wrapping of a completely new treaty, and introducing various new positions and roles.</p>

<a name="80604-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="080604106000177"></a>The noble Baroness says that the President will work in a way that is &#147;complementary&#148; to the High Representative. Should we not be asking a little more clearly who is going to be in charge on the foreign policy side? Foreign policy issues will come up in the Foreign Affairs Council; the president will be sitting in the general Council; the issue of the rotating president will have to be sorted out in ways that I am not clear about even now&#151;but as the noble Baroness has said, it will have to be sorted out&#151;and there will be, in her words, a &#147;triumvirate&#148; who will somehow clarify all these things. Perhaps we should just relax, as the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, advises, and abandon any prescription so that the whole thing can evolve in various ways. However, we are a parliamentary democracy and we need to know where power lies and how it will be used. It would be an exception to the rule of the evolution of presidential roles, the transfer of powers and the creation of legal systems, which is what we are involved in, to leave the matter hanging in the air.</p>

<a name="80604-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="080604106000182"></a>Noble Lords may recall that I have introduced three Bills over recent years with the same aim, which we debated on 8 June last year, 27 June 2003 and 17 March 2000. This amendment is drawn somewhat more narrowly than those Bills in that it applies only to the economic costs and benefits of our EU membership, whereas they cover the cost to our sovereignty and powers of self-government as well.</p>

<a name="80604-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="080604106000183"></a>The Government have always refused an official cost-benefit analysis on the wholly unjustified grounds that the benefits of our EU membership are so wondrous and obvious that it would be a waste of time. I expect that they will say the same thing tonight. However, the true and obvious reason why they refuse it is that they fear it would reveal the unacceptably high cost we bear from being in the European Union and the result would be so disastrous as to make their precious policy of staying in the EU untenable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="080604106000184"></a>In the absence of such an official analysis there have been several respectable private academic studies over the past five years, which put the cost of our EU membership at anything between 5 and 10 per cent of GDP, or roughly some &#163;50 billion to &#163;100 billion per annum. All the studies agree that the main elements of cost are the higher price we pay for food as a result of the common agricultural policy, the hard cash we hand over annually to Brussels and the effect of EU overregulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="080604106000185"></a>If we accept the EU&#146;s own figure for the latter&#151;that is, overregulation alone&#151;we come to some 6.5 per cent of GDP, which has been estimated by the Competition Commissioner G1/4nter Verheugen. If we accept that, we are at the top end of the studies that I have mentioned. It probably is the dead hand of Brussels bureaucracy that causes most of the harm, especially when compared with the new free economies of the East. One thinks of such tragedies as the decimation of our fishing industry, the flight of our art market to New York and Geneva and the impending damage to the City of London caused by the EU&#146;s financial services action plan.</p>

I assure him that British financial services organisations and those international companies based in London are full participants in the work of creating the legislation under the financial services action plan. I see heads nodding, but there are some people who try to dissent. The overwhelming view of the City of London and the Corporation of London is that the EU single market has been a great advantage to British financial services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="080604106000189"></a>If noble Lords are in any doubt about this, they should take the trouble to read the publication by Open Europe, a mildly Eurosceptic organisation, entitled <I>Selling the City Short? A Review of the EU&#146;s Financial Services Action Plan</I>. That document details that the mere cost of transposing these directives into British law will be some &#163;23 billion over the next four years. It does not attempt to quantify the damage that will be done to the City of London when practitioners, particularly in the wholesale markets, vacate the City of London for New York, Singapore, Dubai and elsewhere. So I must answer the noble Baroness: yes, I do mean that. I mean that the financial services action plan looks to me, as far as I can see at the moment, as though it will destroy the City of London and the benefit which that confers on this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="080604106000192"></a>I had started saying that it is not just us British Eurosceptics who suggest that EU membership is hugely expensive. I mentioned Mr McCreevy, who last week, in Dublin I think, admitted that 80 per cent of all legislation affecting our commerce and industry comes from Brussels. We know what that means in terms of overregulation. I would quote to your Lordships the Swiss Government, who last year calculated officially that EU membership for Switzerland would be nine times more expensive than their present bilateral arrangements. There is really no reason to believe that a different calculation would apply to the British economy. We are in many ways similar to the Swiss economy, although we are of course bigger.</p>

<a name="80604-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="080604106000193"></a>I think that I have mentioned to your Lordships the study carried out by the top French think tank, the Conseil d&#146;Analyse Economique, which reports directly to the French Prime Minister and has recently estimated that neither the single market nor the euro have done anything for the French economy. One has to ask: why should that be so different here?</p>

<a name="80604-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="080604106000194"></a>I could go on, but I trust that that is enough at the moment to suggest that our membership of the European Union is extremely expensive economically. And to all this the Government now give two answers, both of which are clearly wrong. First, they say that millions of jobs are created by our EU membership, thus implying that were we to leave the EU millions of jobs would be lost. This is clearly nonsense because the jobs are created by our trade with our clients all over Europe, not by our political subservience to Brussels. If we left the political construct of the EU, that trade would continue, especially as we are the EU's largest client. It sells us much more than we sell it. I trust the experiences of the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, in the City, will lead her to agree with that point.</p>

<a name="80604-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="080604106000195"></a>It is probably true that about 10 per cent of our jobs, some 3 million, do support our trade with the European Union, but none of them would be lost if we left the EU and continued in free trade with our friends across the channel. That is also part of the answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford. What advantages have we had by our political subservience to Brussels that we could not have had by open and simple free trade with our friends in Europe?</p>

<a name="80604-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="080604106000196"></a>We must not forget that EU regulation stifles 100 per cent of our economy, including the 90 per cent which does not trade with Europe. No serious calculation has been made of the number of jobs which might be created if that 90 per cent were set free from EU red tape to trade on more level terms in the vibrant new economies of the east. That calculation should be done and it should be part of the analysis which this amendment proposes. Whichever way you look at it, it is reasonable to claim that jobs would be created, not

<a name="80604-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="080604106000197"></a>The other stock answer given by the Government to justify our continued membership of the European Union avoids its cost altogether. The Prime Minister has recently started to say that our membership is not necessarily an economic matter. Perhaps this was inspired by his time at the Treasury, which in October 2005 issued a report chiding Brussels for its overregulation and putting the cost of our membership as perhaps as high as 28 per cent of GDP. That Treasury report included 12 per cent for increasing competition within the euro area to US levels, and 7 per cent for the cost of EU food under the CAP. Both those percentages are considerably higher than in the independent studies to which I have referred. So the Government&#146;s second stock answer appears to have become that however much the EU may cost our economy, it is worth it because as members we construct the world stage as part of a large bloc and therefore have more influence than if we had retained our independence. This line has been strongly supported by noble Lords who can only be described as leading members of the &#147;international conference-ariat&#148;, to coin a new phrase. From Second Reading and Committee I would mention the noble Lords, Lord Ashdown and Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, in that context, and other noble Lords come to mind, mostly our several noble former employees of the European Union.</p>

Contributors to <I>e</I><I>urofacts</I> love to repeat that because it recalls echoes of the past. It is all complete rubbish.

<a name="80604-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="080604106000221"></a>Since we are talking about facts and figures, I remind your Lordships that in 2006 the gross UK contribution to the EU budget totalled &#163;12.4 billion overall. We should deduct the UK abatement that we get from our unique and special privilege of the rebate. No other member state gets this. All the other member states thought that it would last for a certain number of years. They did not realise that it would carry on many years after its inception. If we take away the UK abatement of &#163;3.6 billion and the public sector receipts of &#163;4.9 billion that we get directly as a result of our adhesion to the European Union, the net UK contribution to the EU budget is &#163;3.9 billion. I think that I am right in saying that the figure for Germany is probably approaching &#163;8 billion as a direct comparison. I am happy to be corrected on that by other noble Lords, as I have not had time to look up the latest figure. In fact, in Committee the noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, referred to these comparisons and said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="080604106000267"></a>&#147;The UK operating budgetary balance on this basis&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080604106000251"></a>the basis of his calculation with the budget rebate&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080604106000274"></a>&#147;is &#8364;2.143 million. We are 10th in the list of countries expressed as a percentage of gross national income. France, for example, contributes &#8364;3,017.8 million, which is 0.17 per cent of gross national income&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/5/08; col. 1444.]</ul>
<p><a name="080604106000252"></a>You can bandy these figures about to make any point, but they show that our membership of the European Union has been obtained on the basis of a very reasonable price given all the things that we get back&#151;for example, the huge power that each member state gets from its collective membership of the Union of 27 members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="080604106000222"></a>I object to the endless repetition of certain statements on the part of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. He referred to his three Bills. I am happy to be corrected if I am wrong but, speaking from memory, I think that he initiated a Second Reading debate on the Bill that he introduced in 2007 but did not take it into Committee, as is his habit. Why not send it down to the other place to see what Members there think about it? Mr William Cash, David Heathcoat-Amory and the new UKIP Member of Parliament could have a field day discussing it. But no, the Bills are always taken just to Second Reading, so the effect is always the drip, drip of this tedious and inaccurate propaganda about the wicked disutility of our membership of the European Union. I think that I am right that on two previous occasions he took his Bill just to Second Reading, whereas most Members who have a Bill in this House seek to get it

It is true that the other two Bills did not. There was no point in continuing with the Bills, because as soon as they got to the House of Commons it would have taken only one unfortunate Member of the noble Lord&#146;s party to block them. None of these Bills would have made any progress in the House of Commons. The object of the exercise here was to have a debate on this subject.

I detect that the Government feel that the Lisbon treaty is in the interests of Britain and of the European Union, in every way that has been explained at previous stages of this Bill, including Second Reading. It provides acceptable, rational adjustments to the operating procedures inside the Union that allow the EU to function more effectively with a much larger number of states. That is the common-sense aspect of what we are talking about. It again goes beyond costs and benefits.</p>

<a name="80604-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="080604106000226"></a>The benefits are also strong emotionally and psychologically in terms of the public&#146;s increasing acceptance of the natural state&#151;the common-sense, routine, even mundane basis&#151;of our membership of the European Union. On an everyday basis, the public are ahead of the politicians. They may not have detailed knowledge of every aspect of what is a very complicated scenario. None the less, in natural ways&#151;with people moving with their families and children, or retiring to other European countries as part of a general diaspora&#151;the mobility of populations within the Union is much higher than mobility in the United States, which was always given as an example of a high-mobility country in comparison with the sluggish population movements of European countries. That era has now passed. This is the modern European Union of the future, where younger members of the population in particular are extremely keen, in a natural, practical sense, about what they can do and the opportunities that they have of being members and citizens of the whole Union and not just loyal and patriotic members of their own sovereign member states.</p>

He told the House that this was the only country where this sort of debate takes place. Well, he is wrong. In Denmark, there are frequent debates, and indeed referendums, on the important issues in treaties. In Sweden, there is an argument going on, with a threat from the trade unions that, unless the Swedish Government can deal with a wages problem that has been caused by a ruling of the European Court, they will be against the Lisbon treaty. When I was in Estonia some while ago, I did not get the impression that there was no dispute about membership of the European Union in that country.</p>

<a name="80604-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="080604106000229"></a>We are not alone in querying our membership of the European Union and its cost and benefits; that is the sensible thing to do. In any event, if we were the only ones doing so, why not? Let us not make any mistake about the fact that we are different in many respects, probably most of all because we are an island that has been successful over a long, long time&#151;much longer than any other European state, except perhaps France. It is perfectly in order for us to have such a debate. Indeed, it is a recommendation of our democracy that we have such debates.</p>

<a name="80604-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="080604106000230"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, and to the Liberal party that I can respect their position. There is no doubt that their position is that we should have in Europe a fully federal state. That is a perfectly respectable view to hold and I do not criticise them for it, but they must allow other people to have a different point of view. I have a different point of view, which I have held for a very long time.</p>

<a name="80604-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="080604106000231"></a>On the cost-benefit analysis, other parties, unlike the Liberal party, say that it is about trading. They say that it is not about a country called Europe, although I believe that eventually it will be, and the Lisbon treaty takes us another big step towards that. If it is about trading, and if it is about the benefits to the British people, it is sensible for the country to have regular cost-benefit analyses. If the Government do not do that, they are not properly serving their people and indeed they are cheating their people. Therefore, the suggestion that is being put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, is sensible and should be accepted by the Government. The noble Lord pointed out that the Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, produced a paper that showed that our membership of the European Union, in economic terms, cost us &#163;28 billion a year. That being so, I would have thought that the Government would want to look at it to see whether that figure could be reduced and whether the books could be better balanced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="080604106000232"></a>On the question of our net contribution, I am not at all sure that the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, got his figures right. The last figure that I saw was that the present net contribution was &#163;4.5 billion but would rise by 2010 to &#163;6.2 billion. If you add the &#163;3.5 billion rebate that we get at present and which we would perhaps lose if the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, had his way, the net contribution would be &#163;9.7 billion a year. That would exceed that of Germany and make us the highest contributor in net terms to the budget of the European Union.</p>

Last year the deficit in trade was &#163;40 billion, rising from &#163;32 billion in 2006. That is an enormous gap in trade and loses the country jobs. With a proper cost-benefit analysis to try to correct that situation, far from losing jobs we might gain them. Then there is the cost to the consumer, estimated by the Treasury to be &#163;20 per week per family. That cost ought to be taken into account for the sake of the families in this country, whom the Government ought to be protecting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="080604106000234"></a>Finally, if this is really about trade, there are many good places to trade with other than Europe and without having the trappings of a full-blown state&#151;a president, foreign minister, Parliament, currency and goodness knows what. I recommend the House sometimes to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, and indeed with me that this is too important a matter just to be left to the economic superstition that it is good for us. We ought to have a cost-benefit analysis. It would be beneficial to the country and make a contribution to the good debates that we have in this House about our membership of the EU.</p>

I do not understand why the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, is so against it. If our membership is so self-evidently beneficial, surely he should welcome a cost-benefit analysis that would demonstrate that conclusively and once and for all to the British public, so lancing the boil. There would be nothing to worry about. I do not know why our Europhile colleagues are so nervous or so against having a cost-benefit analysis. This would help them if they are sure of their facts. If our contributions, which the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, has analysed so carefully, are so minor, our Europhile colleagues should welcome a cost-benefit analysis. I cannot see the problem at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="080604106000236"></a>Let me pick up on one or two things. The noble Lord, Lord Dykes, quoted from <I>e</I><I>urofacts</I>. I claim some credit for his assiduous reading of <I>e</I><I>urofacts</I> because I think that I sent it to him as a Christmas present last year. I have yet to receive a thank-you letter; I am a little disappointed by that. Of course it is essential reading. If Europhile noble Lords have time, when they are not busy excoriating the Murdochite press, they will find that <I>e</I><I>urofacts</I> is correct&#151;it is Eurofactual. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, will recognise that. He took great pleasure in Committee in rubbishing an allegedly fictitious story that the European Commission was going to regulate fortune-tellers and spiritualists. He had terrific fun with that. Actually, as noble Lords will know, because we have circulated the report, the

The noble Lord should be a little more careful about what he says when he affects to rubbish the stories in <I>e</I><I>urofacts</I>.</p>

<a name="80604-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="080604106000237"></a>I am quite sure that at some point the Commission or European Parliament will come forward with a proposal to make it more difficult for parties such as UKIP or any other Eurosceptic party to have a say. Indeed, that is already happening. They are going to be cut out from funding unless they have a certain number of representatives. So I advise noble Lords to be a little bit careful and to concentrate on the Murdoch press rather than on <I>e</I><I>urofacts</I>.</p>

<a name="80604-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="080604106000238"></a>My noble friend Lord Pearson has made the arguments conclusively and the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, has backed them up. I prefer to look at our gross contribution to the EU, which I think is now &#163;12 billion or &#163;14 billion. It moves all the time and it is increasing. We should look at the gross figure. If one pays tax, one does not say, &#147;I am actually paying 20 per cent, but I only pay 8 per cent because I have roads and policing&#148;; one says, &#147;I am paying 20 per cent tax&#148;. Apart from our rebate, the returns that we get, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, have Euro Commission labels telling us on what we should spend the money. Our money goes to Europe and comes back with a label on it telling us how to spend it. I hope that we look at our gross contribution in the future. The noble Baroness may tell us that it is about &#163;14 billion and likely to increase.</p>

<a name="80604-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="080604106000239"></a>Finally, we are often told by our Europhile friends that this is a club and that if you become a member of a club you have to pay your dues for your membership. Of course, that is absolutely right. However, if you are a member of a club, you look at your membership dues annually&#151;at least I certainly do&#151;and you review them; you see what the advantages are of your membership of the club; you look at who your fellow members are; you look at what advantage you get from membership and what services you get; and you look at whether your subscription gives you value for money. That is all that my noble friend Lord Pearson, the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, and I want; we want to see whether our subscription to the Euro club is worth it. The people of this country also want to know whether it is worth it.</p>

<a name="80604-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="080604106000240"></a>At one point, the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, said that there is a groundswell towards Europe and the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, said that there is a swing towards Europe. I do not know what world they inhabit, as any poll will show that people are increasingly sceptical about our membership of the European Union. I let that pass, as it is a matter for debate and polls can swing one way or the other. Certainly no poll that I have seen over the past five to 10 years has said that we want more Europe, which is what this treaty gives us. I believe that my noble friend&#146;s amendment is valuable and will be useful to the general debate outside the Westminster bubble. I strongly support the amendment.</p>

If I were to do a cost-benefit analysis, I would, for example, want to look at how much the buttressing of democracies in Spain and Portugal during the 1970s and 1980s saved us on the NATO budget in strengthening the southern flank of NATO. I would want to look at how the investment that was made in Greece, following the colonels, buttressed that country's democracy and saved us massive expenditure which otherwise would have been put into our defence budget. Similarly, you can look at what is happening in the Balkans at the moment and at what has been happening in eastern Europe and the process leading to accession there. That sort of cost-benefit analysis is the analysis of people who pretend that they know the cost of everything but know the value of nothing.</p>

<a name="80604-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="080604109000002"></a>My brief point of fact is in relation to something that the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said when he referred to this movement in Sweden that was leading to a rebellion against the ratification of the treaty. I happened to be in Sweden the week before last visiting the Swedish Parliament. I spent some time in the Rikstad listening to some of the discussion. I heard the debate on the Alpha Laval case, which has been referred to the European Court of Justice. Although there is serious concern about the case, I did not hear one speaker from any party&#151;the government coalition, the social democrats, the greens or the communists&#151;in any way link this discussion to the ratification of the treaty of Lisbon, which they will be dealing with in the Swedish Parliament this autumn. It is assumed by everyone there that the Swedish Parliament will overwhelmingly ratify the treaty of Lisbon.</p>

The noble Lord referred to the cost in terms of the contribution to the European Union budget. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, that it is indeed &#163;12.4 billion. We get a &#163;3.6 billion abatement and public sector receipts of &#163;4.9 billion, so the net contribution to the EU budget is &#163;3.9 billion. I hope those figures will alleviate any concerns the noble Lord might have about understanding precisely what the budget does.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="080604109000007"></a>I hesitate to reiterate much of what has been said about the benefits of membership of the European Union. As far as this Government are concerned, EU membership is central to the pursuit of stability, growth and employment. It is clearly in our national interest, both economically and in a wider political and strategic context. It has brought benefits in jobs, peace and security. Through it, we belong to the world&#146;s largest trading block with a single market of over 490 million people. Half our trade is now within the EU, and we estimate that about 3.5 million British jobs are linked to it, directly and indirectly. Fifty-seven per cent of total British trade in goods is with the EU, 62 per cent of our total exports go to the EU and British investments in the EU totalled &#163;17 billion in 2005, the last year for which I have detailed figures.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="080604109000008"></a>As noble Lords will know, I feel very strongly that membership is not only about the rights of British companies to buy and sell across the single market, but that it also allows our citizens to work, study, live and travel in the European Union and to receive free medical care if they fall sick. Improved maternity pay, the right to paid holidays and the reduction in the cost of mobile phone calls when abroad are just some of the practical benefits we have by being part of the European Union.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="080604109000009"></a>We benefit as consumers from being part of the Union. The EUoutlaws price fixing and stops companies agreeing with each other to restrict competition. Cartels in industries as diverse as vitamins, banking, airlines and energy have been targeted by the European Union in recent years to ensure that the benefits are passed on to consumers. British firms benefit significantly from the enlargement of the EU: exports to the 10 countries that joined in 2004 rose from &#163;4.66 billion in 2004 to almost &#163;8 billion in 2006.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="080604109000010"></a>Our view is that these benefits would be unlikely to be available to the UK on the same, or even more favourable terms, if we left the European Union. If we left, we would be subject to customs controls and we would need export certificates. The abolition of customs duties already saves British businesses about &#163;135 million a year. Our agricultural exports would be subject to tariffs that would be payable on some of our goods. There is a host of reasons why this would not work.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="080604109000011"></a>Just for completeness, there have been suggestions that perhaps what we should do is negotiate some access to the single market from the outside in the way that Norway and Switzerland have done. I begin from the premise that we are not Norway or Switzerland. We are one of the largest economies in the world. We  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_240"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have a bigger, more diverse economy, and we should be clear that if we tried to negotiate on that basis, we would have to accept many of the laws that already govern the operation of the single market, which is what Norway and Switzerland do. Norway accepts 85 per cent of single-market legislation. We would not, however, be part of the negotiations that determined what those laws would be. Moreover, we might have to contribute to the EU budget. Norway is a net contributor to the EU budget. The difference, as I have already indicated from the figures, is that we get a lot of money back from the European Union. As an EEA member outside it, we would not.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="080604109000012"></a>In essence, for all the reasons that I have given and for all the reasons that noble Lords know about&#151;the benefits for citizens, and the co-operation, which we talked about earlier, on asylum, on counterterrorism, on illegal migration, on serious organised crime and so on; I could go on at length&#151;we believe that being part of the European Union is extremely important. We hope, on that basis, that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

It is strange, is it not, that the Conservative Party does not have a view on it? It would have been interesting to hear that. Does it think that a cost-benefit analysis of our EU membership would be helpful, a good thing? Does it agree with the Leader of the House, or does it simply not know? I imagine that our rules of procedure do not allow the Conservative Front Bench to intervene now, so I suppose we will just have to continue in ignorance of its position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="080604109000014"></a>As to the contributions that have been made, I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, who was somewhat overcritical of e<I>urofacts</I> magazine, which is one of the shining lights of truth and reason in the whole debate about our membership of the European Union. The noble Lord suggested that I had written most of it. I stand to be corrected. I may have written one article some time in the past 10 years, but I am ashamed to say that I have not written more, because I would like to be more associated with this truly significant publication.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="080604109000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dykes, and others who objected to the amendment trotted out&#151;I am afraid I have to use that expression&#151;the usual Europhile line, as I said they would in my introductory remarks, that membership is hugely beneficial. He even dropped a clanger when he suggested that 3 million jobs depend on our membership of the European Union as opposed to our trade with it, which is a very different thing. He wisely said that a number of figures are being bandied about, although he put the net cost of our membership in 2006 at &#163;3.9 billion, which was not all that far from the figure of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, of &#163;4.5 billion. If these figures are being bandied about, why do we not earth them? I assure the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, and the Leader of the House, who suggested otherwise that my friends and I would of course accept an unbiased cost-benefit analysis of our membership of the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="080604109000016"></a>I am afraid that the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, also produced the old canard that the European Union has brought us jobs, peace and security. He is presumably not prepared to consider the suggestion that that is an emperor with no clothes. I have dealt with the jobs. We owe peace and security to NATO and our friends, the United States of America, since the end of the last war. He thinks that youth is swinging towards the European Union, but opinion polls show that youth is actually swinging away from it. The most Eurosceptic sector of British society is the 18 to 25 year-old group, according to many present polls. Whether noble and Europhile Lords like it or not, there is no European Demos. There cannot, therefore, be any European democracy&#151;not for a very long time, or long after this project has failed, as it surely will.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="080604109000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, produced the line that the value of Spain, Portugal, Greece and others joining the European Union and getting rid of their dictatorships is unquantifiable because of the money we have thus saved by not having to support NATO, and so on. That is a difficult debate, but there is of course no reason why any cost-benefit analysis should not look at and pay due credit to it. It is likewise for the new countries of eastern Europe, who owe their membership of the European Union more to the interest of their political classes&#151;many of whom went to work in Brussels, and all on the Brussels pay scale at 10 times their former salaries&#151;than to the real, informed opinion of their peoples.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="080604109000018"></a>I come to the noble Baroness the Leader of the House, who I am afraid produced again the only line that she can&#151;that the benefits are overwhelming. We had jobs, again: peace and security, we got all of that. We had an estimate of the net &#163;3.9 billion but, as my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke said, that is not the point. The gross is the point: we pay &#163;12.4 billion gross a year, according to her, to this absurd arrangement that is then filtered through Brussels. Some of that is given back to us, not on projects that we would necessarily choose, but always on projects designed to enhance the reputation of the project.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="080604109000019"></a>I am afraid that I do not have time to take detailed issue with the noble Baroness on some of the statistics she produced. She says that half our trade is with the European Union; that is what the Europhilic establishment tends to say, but it is of course not true. She means that it is, I am afraid, somewhat less than half of our exports of manufactured goods. If we take the whole of the economy&#151;the export of manufactured goods, our services and transfers, and the return on our investments worldwide&#151;it is acknowledged that around 10 per cent of the British economy trades with its clients in the European Union, some other 10 per cent trades with the rest of the world, and 80 per cent stays right here in the domestic economy. It really is not fair, then, to produce these bland, unchecked and unquantified statements. This amendment tries to quantify them; it would be really reasonable to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="080604109000020"></a>When I mention Switzerland, the noble Baroness replies that it is not reasonable to suggest that the benefits that Switzerland gets from staying out of the European Union&#151;it is not in the European economic area, unlike Norway, or part of the fax economy&#151;would

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="080604109000021"></a>Finally, I must ask the Minister: what benefits have we had in any matter she has mentioned, from our membership of the European Union, which we could not have had from simple free trade and friendly collaboration with our neighbours across the Channel?

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="080604109000027"></a>The issue is how our Parliament is to deal with and to address matters of treaty changes that come through the passerelle arrangements. We know that there are passerelle arrangements in past treaties and that in this treaty there are some that require the approval of Parliament. But there are also the new provisions which do not require the approval of Parliament, so treaty changes can be made without that. The Government have met that by suggesting there should be debates in and the approval of both Houses before such treaty changes are validated. We have said that that is not enough.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="080604109000028"></a>This amendment was moved in the other place, not I think by a Member of our Front Bench, but by a Back-Bencher, and it was heavily supported by other parties, including the Liberal Democrats, whose leader, deputy leader and Chief Whip voted for it, and many others as well. So I live in hope&#151;I shall probably be frustrated&#151;that we might get a little support for the amendment, although it is a late hour.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="080604109000029"></a>It is important to emphasise that we are dealing with matters which can&#151;they do not necessarily always&#151;

During our debate, a number of strange, slightly mysterious aspects arose. The noble Baroness spoke at considerable length and in great detail about how these kinds of changes should be handled. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="080604109000049"></a>&#147;I argue that what matters is that Parliament has appropriate and proper debate, but I do not believe that that is always possible within an Act of Parliament&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/5/08; col. 1341.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080604109000046"></a>That was her view, which&#151;obviously&#151;is not ours.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="080604109000030"></a>Then we got on to a discussion of which, frankly, I do not understand every word. I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to explain it more fully. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="080604109000050"></a>&#147;More importantly, the conventions that would normally apply to secondary legislation, statutory instruments, and the votes and debates with which noble Lords concern themselves in relation to primary legislation&#151;traditions and conventions that we might not vote against something&#151;do not apply in this context. In the words of the parliamentary counsel whom I consulted this morning, this is a new power. It is different&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/5/08; col. 1342.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080604109000047"></a>We have to ask what that new power is. When we talk about powers, we usually talk about Acts of Parliament to validate and give credence to them. Can we please be more clear about this new power to be given to your Lordships&#146; House?</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="080604109000031"></a>The difficulty here is that our amendment is not specifically about your Lordships' House. It is about Parliament and the role of both Houses, including the other place, in addressing these possible changes in the treaty. Although it is very interesting to hear the noble Baroness&#146;s views about how things might change in your Lordships' House, that is not the main issue. It is how Parliament handles these matters. There seems to be some confusion in all this.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="080604109000032"></a>The former Home Secretary, now the Minister of Justice, said in very graphic terms&#151;admittedly a few years ago&#151;that he was nervous of all these possible passerelle changes because,</p>
<ul><a name="080604109000051"></a>&#147;late at night at an ordinary European Council, a decision on one other country&#146;s milk quotas is traded for a concession on moving from unanimity to QMV ... that is not acceptable&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080604109000033"></a>He spotted that there was deep concern here and that that kind of arrangement was simply not acceptable.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="080604109000034"></a>When I reread what the noble Baroness had said, there seemed to be some confusion. On the one hand are the normal rules, regulations, directives and other instruments flowing from, or originating in, the EU institutions. We seek, on the whole, to handle these through filtering in the committees of the other place and the distinguished committees of your Lordships&#146; House. That process has maybe been improved, and overlaps with scrutiny, and so on. That is one story. On the other hand are the changes in the treaty. These are changes to the powers of our Parliament. These are important matters, which could arise through the passerelle provisions. I do not think anyone denies that. This is what the passerelle provisions could do. Admittedly, in the earlier treaties, they could only do so with the approval of Parliament, but in this treaty and the constitutional treaty&#151;and the provisions here are identical with those in the constitutional treaty&#151;they could do so without the approval of Parliament.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="080604109000035"></a>The noble Baroness spoke about her plans for filtering through the committees of this Parliament and giving them &#147;new powers&#148;. I am not sure how these ideas would apply in the other place. None of these new powers can possibly substitute for the basic requirement, which is a proper Act of Parliament before the treaty is altered in ways which transfer or reduce the powers of Parliament. I hope we can focus on that, and possibly hear more about the new powers&#151;which the noble Baroness has discussed, or is discussing, or plans to develop&#151;for filtering various matters through the committees of this House and improving scrutiny procedures. That is very interesting, but not the main point.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="080604109000036"></a>We have never faced this situation before. Now that we do so, we must build in the proper safeguards, which are powers in Acts of Parliament to ensure that future changes are also by Act of Parliament. There is no short cut or bypass to obviate this fundamental need. Those who want to see effective parliamentary scrutiny and, more than that, want to see treaty changes go through proper parliamentary procedure, ought really to be sympathetic to this amendment, as were the Liberal Democrats and my own party in the other place. That is the requirement that we now face. This debate may flow over into further debates in the handling of this Bill, but here, tonight, this is about the need for Acts of Parliament. Mere approval of both Houses and affirmative votes in both Houses may not be enough. We have heard from the former Home Secretary Mr Jack Straw that these things can happen &#147;late at night&#148;. That is what he said. He is right and I support his apprehension about what could have happened under the previous constitution treaty, and which could also happen under this identical treaty before us. I beg to move.</p>

It is interesting to take note of the process that we are going through. In both Houses we go through a Committee and a Report stage. A Bill changes as it goes through, sometimes by amendment, sometimes by government assurances. Sometimes things come back again and again, totally unchanged. That is only because the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, has not read the <I>Companion</I>. The approach taken by my party was best expressed by my honourable friend Jo Swinson, who asked how many and which decisions should be addressed by Parliament. At the same time, we should not impose a huge bureaucratic burden that stalls any kind of process both in this House and the EU. That has been the theme of a number of our debates on the amendments.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="080604109000038"></a>We have had a number of amendments from the Conservative Front Bench that look perfectly reasonable in isolation. They seek a report to Parliament here and primary legislation there, but collectively it is not so much belt and braces as bondage. As Jo Swinson warned, if we took all these bits of advice from the Conservative Front Bench we would have a process that would cripple not only Europe but Parliament. Earlier the noble Lord, Lord Howell, asked for a more rational and practical approach. The Liberal Democrats bow to nobody in either House in our commitment to parliamentary accountability so far as Europe is

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="080604109000039"></a>I have to say that whatever positions we took at an earlier stage, we have welcomed the willingness of the Government to address and clarify issues about parliamentary accountability. On the one hand, these amendments would make a draconian demand for primary legislation but, on the other hand, Amendment No. 24 would take away some of the best parts of the Bill in terms of parliamentary accountability. I do not think we are going to fall for that kind of sleight of hand.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="080604109000040"></a>The Lord President of the Council knows very well that we still have concerns about parliamentary accountability, and it would be interesting to know the detail in these cases. When the passerelle orders come before us, will they always be taken on the Floor of the House? Will we be told that like statutory instruments, it is not really done for this place to try to turn them down, or will being passed by both Houses be a genuine process? If we can get those assurances, plus the kind of negotiations that I know are going on with the European Union Committee and the Constitution Committee, we will approach the practicalities of the Bill much more effectively than by adopting the rather inflexible, blunderbuss approach reflected in these amendments. Certainly at this stage we will not be supporting them.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="080604109000042"></a>These are not trivial provisions. We are talking about the possibility of changing the conditions of the treaty in ways that are very substantive and which, under normal circumstances, would require a new treaty with all that goes with it. Let me point out just a few of the provisions we are talking about. Under Article 31(3) is the ability to move the common foreign and security policy on to QMV. The Government have made great play of the fact that that is to be by unanimity, but here is a provision that allows it to be agreed that it should be moved to QMV. A provision under Article 81(3) states that family law should be decided by QMV, while a decision under Article 31(2) would allow provisions on EU finance&#151;the budget&#151;to be decided not by unanimity but by QMV.</p>

<a name="80604-0014.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="080604109000043"></a>The provision under Article 33(2) allows enhanced co-operation to be carried forward; borne not just by the cost of those members who participate but by all members including those who are not participating in the enhanced co-operation. Provision 48(6) allows revisions of procedures in the treaty to be taken by simplified revision procedures; that is, qualified majority voting. We may ask why the provisions are in the treaty; is it conceivable that anyone would ever want to do that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="080604109000044"></a>One can only assume that those provisions are in the treaty because someone believes that at some stage the European Union might want to decide that it moves these matters from unanimity to QMV; otherwise, why are they in the treaty? We could have struck them  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_246"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 246</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out. To suggest that such measures should be left to the Executive is a complete denial of parliamentary democracy. It may be that we trust that the Executive would say no and use their veto to stop those matters, but we are not an Executive Government in this county unfettered by Parliament. We are a parliamentary democracy, and our tradition has been that changes of this magnitude should be approved by Parliament. For the noble Lord, Lord McNally, to suggest that it is a huge bureaucratic burden to suggest that Parliament should be asked to approve changes that previously would have required a treaty change would have former liberal parliamentarians turning in their graves.</p>

<a name="80604-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="080604109000045"></a>We must accept that those are significant provisions, which are of the nature of treaty changes. It may be that they are not used in the future, but if they were used and the Government were to agree that those things should be done by QMV in the future and the treaty should be changed in that way, they must be subject to parliamentary control.</p>

<a name="0806051000002"></a><a name="80604-0015.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80604-0015.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0806051000094"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> My Lords, the issue that we are debating is not whether Parliament should have control but the nature of that control. I agree wholeheartedly with the noble Lord that it is important that Parliament should have control, which is why the provision is in the Bill. The issue is the kind of control that is most appropriate in this case. The difficulty that I have with the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, is that effectively Parliament&#146;s control could be more unwieldy and less effective than what we have set out, which is the requirement for a vote in each House before a Minister is enabled to do anything.</p>

<a name="80604-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="0806051000003"></a>We are clear in the Bill that a Minister of the Crown may not vote in favour of or otherwise support. That closes off the issues that noble Lords would reasonably be concerned about; that by saying nothing or abstaining, somehow a provision could go through on the nod because we have not intervened. Under our provisions, no Minister would be able to do that; they would have to say, &#147;I am sorry, I would have to vote against that proposal because I do not have clarity from Parliament as to its views&#148;. We have a large degree of agreement that Parliament must have a significant voice and a vote. The question is how best to achieve it.</p>

<a name="80604-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="0806051000004"></a>I appreciate the noble Lord, Lord Howell, bringing back the matter, because on the last occasion I said that it was a new power and the noble Lord rightly asked me to explain in greater detail how it would work. I am grateful to him for giving me that opportunity. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, in his remarks and in conversations that I have had with him, has said that he is keen to ensure that we have been clear about Government thinking in order to address the concerns that Liberal Democrats have in other places, as the noble Lord would have in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="80604-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="0806051000005"></a>Let me try to set that out. Significantly, this is a new power is because until now Parliament had no control over the passarelles. This point is new; it is something that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister was keen to ensure that we had. It recognises the importance of the Lisbon treaty and of Parliament.</p>

At the time of the constitutional treaty, only the House of Commons had a right to have a view about these matters, but now we have a provision whereby both Chambers will have a view.</p>

<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="0806051000007"></a><a name="80604-0015.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80604-0015.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0806051000096"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b><b><a name="80604-0015.htm_spnew6"></a></b>the noble Lord is correct. As he would expect, I feel quite strongly about the role of your Lordships&#146; House and the importance of ensuring that your Lordships have the opportunity to contribute where that is appropriate, as I believe it is here.</p>

<a name="80604-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="0806051000008"></a>As I said, this is a new power. It is a new power because this is a new provision; it is the first time that we have had it. Noble Lords rightly want to challenge and test how it will work bearing in mind the way in which the conventions in your Lordships' House have traditionally operated. By recognising that this is a new power, I am saying that this is a new power where the conventions do not apply. As the noble Lord, Lord Howell, rightly said, this applies to both Houses of Parliament. As I said, this has to involve both Houses of Parliament and not&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Roper, said&#151;just one. I want to be absolutely clear that if either House of Parliament says no to a Motion, then it will fall. Each House therefore has an effective veto over the use any passerelle set out in Clause 6. Let me set out the thinking on how we believe it will work.</p>

<a name="80604-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="0806051000009"></a>In practice, a Minister would ask Parliament to agree a Motion to use one of the listed passerelles. We envisage that this would probably be a straightforward yes or no question on whether to use a specific passerelle; for example, whether to move a specific policy area from unanimity to QMV or co-decision. After debate in both Houses, there will, if necessary, be a vote. Of course, it is for your Lordships to decide whether to vote, but we assume that there will be one. In another place, just for completeness, the Motion will be debated under Standing Order 21 which provides for a debate of up to 90 minutes. In your Lordships' House, it is for your Lordships to decide how much time you wish to spend on such a debate. We would expect that debate to be on the Floor of the House. The Government would discuss timing through the usual channels, as noble Lords would expect. At the conclusion of the debate, there will be a vote if a vote is needed. That is in the hands of your Lordships. We would ensure the capacity for there to be such a vote.</p>

<a name="80604-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="0806051000010"></a>Again, for clarity, the usual conventions on statutory instruments will not apply. There is no constraint on your Lordships' House in deciding to give or withhold its approval. I think that that is the most fundamental point raised by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, regarding clarity and why this is different. He is right to say that an evolutionary process has happened here, and I am able to set it out very clearly. I believe that it is a significant difference.</p>

<a name="80604-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="0806051000011"></a>The Bill makes it clear that the Motion has to be agreed without amendment so that we do not have any confusion about what happened, about whether or not it has been unequivocally agreed.</p>

<a name="80604-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="0806051000012"></a>We move on to the subject of Amendment No. 24: the flexibility in the Bill. We have tried in the Bill to provide a little flexibility if Parliament agrees. As  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_248"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column 248</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Lords are well aware, there may occasionally be negotiation on the final wording, perhaps on the date from which it is meant to take effect or in relation to the simplified procedure and the precise language of a provision. We have made it clear in the Bill that it is a matter for Parliament to grant flexibility and to decide whether it wishes to allow Ministers flexibility to take advantage of the negotiating process in order to promote the UK's interests. There is no question but that if Parliament wishes to remove any flexibility, it can do so. It may wish to grant flexibility elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80604-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="0806051000013"></a>If the Government seek approval of a Motion with some negotiating flexibility then either House can amend that part of the Motion. Parliament can say yes to the passerelle but no to the flexibility. In answer to the point raised by the noble Lords, Lord Blackwell and Lord Howell, we think that this is a simple, efficient and effective way of requiring and giving Parliament the opportunity to control the passerelles, rather than an Act of Parliament with all that that would entail. If we had the position where we had an Act of Parliament, we might have to keep coming back to Parliament if there were a change, however minor, rather than this procedure which gives effective control to Parliament through a vote of the kind that I have outlined. I understand why a position that says that the conventions of the House would apply would make noble Lords nervous if they felt they were being hamstrung into having to vote. As I have made clear, the Government do not take that view. Quite the opposite; it is for your Lordships to decide.</p>

<a name="80604-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="0806051000014"></a>I have given as clear an explanation as I can of how this would work in practice. We will obviously continue our discussions with the House authorities through the usual channels but that is the Government&#146;s position. On that basis, I hope the noble Lord is able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

It comes down to a straight division of view as to whether primary legislation is a better curb on changes in the powers of Parliament and changes in treaties, as my noble friend Lord Blackwell said, of potentially a massive kind, or whether this can be done under the kind of procedure the Minister is now describing, which involves some powers but these powers apparently are to be achieved through changes in the Standing Orders of both places. The Minister speaks about SO 21. Probably I am out of date, but I can recall SO 20 and various emergency debates which could be moved under that. Is it now the position that in the other place SO 21 would allow the recommendations of the appropriate Select Committee&#151;I am not sure which it would be&#151;to be treated as matters of urgency and therefore an SO 21 debate would be granted by the Speaker? Is it the Speaker of the other place who has the power to see this process goes forward?</p>

I do not believe I have misquoted the Standing Order but I will make sure. This refers to another place and not to your Lordships&#146; House. The issue I was seeking to address was that there will be a 90-minute debate in another place which will be the basis on which the decision will be taken. Noble Lords do not need to worry about Standing Order 21, which is an order under an Act. The relevant issue for your Lordships&#146; House is that there would be a debate with a vote. The noble Lord need not exercise himself too much. I was merely saying that there would be a 90-minute debate so that the noble Lord would have a point of comparison. It would be for your Lordships&#146; House to determine the length of the debate it would wish to have on the same issue. The critical point is that there would be a vote in both Houses and both Houses have a veto.</p>

As for your Lordships&#146; House, which it is absolutely right for the Leader of the House to be concerned with, the procedure she outlines where we have a certain flexibility outside the powers of the Executive would give rise to the opportunity for debates, Motions and maybe even votes amending those Motions in accordance with the Bill. Our concern tonight is with the broader issue of the position of Parliament as a whole and that means the position of both Houses in relation to the Executive agreeing, through the process described in the treaty, to changes in the treaty and the removal of vetoes on certain areas of activity. Those might be significant or insignificant; they might be announced in the middle of the night for trade-off or in the middle of the day. I have no idea which. But now the noble Baroness says that this is all to be under SO 21. Well, I have SO 21 under my finger, and it is all to do with notice of Questions:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="0806051000037"></a>&#147;(1) Questions shall be taken on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, after private business and motions for unopposed returns have been disposed of.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="0806051000038"></a>(2) No question shall be taken more than one hour after the House sits, except questions which have not appeared on the order paper but which are in the Speaker's opinion of an urgent character and relate either to matters of public importance or to the arrangement of business&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806051000036"></a>I repeat: are we talking about the Executive allowing government time? That still leaves the whole process basically in the hands of the Executive in the other place. We are all realists about what that really means: the Executive are still calling the shots. Are we talking about Back-Benchers, chairmen or members of Select Committees, who are Back-Benchers in the other place, seeking the support of the Speaker in getting the equivalent of what used to be an SO 20 order, now, apparently, an SO 21 order? I do not understand which of those is proposed, and whether the Executive really are relinquishing power or just seeking, through this arrangement with committees to&#151;</p>

Let me be absolutely clear: Standing Order 21 is for any vote under any Act and allows a 90-minute debate. It will be for the Government to table the Motion, as the Bill states. However, under the Act of Parliament that we are about to pass, the Government are not allowed to do anything. Remember what I said: no Minister can do anything&#151;nod their head, shake their head or do anything&#151;until Parliament has approved. The standing order that we are referring to is about the process that another place will undertake. I am absolutely clear that this means a 90-minute debate in government time, with a vote. For this House, the debate would be given time as normal, with a vote. The critical difference is that there is no convention governing this House on that vote. Any vote to oppose the Government&#146;s proposal is a veto on the Government.</p>

However, Standing Order 21 of the House of Commons is on an area controlled by the Speaker, not by the Executive. That is what it says; the thing is written in front of me. There seems to be considerable confusion, but behind it lies a basic fact.</p>

<a name="80604-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="0806051000021"></a>The noble Baroness is second to none in upholding and elucidating&#151;indeed, improving&#151;the role of your Lordships&#146; House as an amending and cooling Chamber. That is very good and she does it excellently. However, this debate is about something larger than that. It is about the powers of Parliament in relation to changes in treaties that would reduce the powers of our Parliament, in the elected lower House and this House, which is currently appointed. That is what we are concerned with and it is not at all clear from our discussion. SO 21 does not clarify the issue; it seems to confuse it further. The Executive appear to be still in control of the scene, as the noble Baroness has described it. Government time will be allocated. The request of a Select Committee will come bubbling up and it will be in the power of the Executive, if it is in their interests&#151;</p>

Ex ante, the Government&#146;s executive role is controlled not by the decision that may be taken in a debate, however that debate is initiated, but by the very statute that we are debating tonight. That seems to me to be a profound inhibition on the Government. Although I wholly accept the necessity to put beyond doubt how the debate will be tabled, the fact is that the Government will be prevented from changing the law from what it will be under the Bill that we are debating.</p>

Let me be clear about this. I apologise if there is any misunderstanding as regards Standing Order 21. If we are wrong about the number, I will, of course, correct it. That is the number I have been given. However, I appreciate that because I am not a Member of another place I am not familiar with the numbers in the way that, sadly, I have become familiar with the <I>Companion</I>. The Government guarantee to make time because they have to. They cannot do anything unless they do. They do not have any power to go to Europe and negotiate anything on these passerelles without parliamentary approval in both your Lordships&#146; House and another place. The Government cannot do anything, therefore they have to make time. Of course, it is government time because noble Lords would no doubt complain if it was not. That is right and proper. Where this has relevance and significance in terms of other instruments is that the Government will find time, in collaboration with the usual channels, for this to be debated. Noble Lords will know that even when there are conventions that, for example, statutory instruments are not voted against, on occasion they have been. We are saying that there are no conventions here; this is new. Therefore, noble Lords can vote on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="0806051000025"></a>There is absolute clarity on this. I am worried that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, is trying almost to confuse the issue in order to bring it back. I do not accept that. It is crystal clear that in both Houses of Parliament there will be a vote and a veto by either House. It will be done under the appropriate Standing Order of another place and it will be done in your Lordships' House under the procedure I have outlined. That could not be clearer. That is the decision before your Lordships&#146; House: whether that is sufficient to give what I believe is effective control or whether noble Lords believe, for reasons I do not understand, that an Act of Parliament is required as well.</p>

<p><a name="08060473000008"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment concerns allotment provision and leads on from some of the discussion yesterday, which was quite historic in its perspective. We talked about the effect of the Enclosure Act. My starting point was 1649 and the Diggers, who unsuccessfully tried to permit gardening for food on common land at St George&#146;s Hill. I do not intend to dwell on that, but it took from Gerard Winstanley&#146;s original appeal in 1649 until 1908, when the first allotment legislation was put into effect. Of course, it is 100 years since that legislation was put into effect, so this is a landmark year. It would be encouraging if the Government marked that 100 years with some legislation that did something about the dire situation that I shall now describe.</p>

<p><a name="08060473000009"></a>The Committee has already discussed the issue of quality of housing and housing standards but, for a lot of people, the garden that comes with the house has become incredibly small or non-existent. Of course, some basic things are more important than a garden, such as a place to sleep, cook and wash, but for many people the ability to grow their own food is

At a time when the value of allotments has been very much recognised over the past few years, the lack of allotments and the situation with the waiting list has become particularly crucial.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000010"></a>I have just picked out a few of the things that have happened recently. ITV is asking for volunteers about people and their families enjoying allotments together, because it wants to make a TV series on that. There have been several books on allotments over the past year. There are TV programmes on allotments and there was a movie on allotments, &#147;Grow Your Own&#148;, that showed what a force for social cohesion they are. The Minister&#146;s own website asks:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060473000090"></a>&#147;What is our policy for allotments?&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060473000072"></a>and goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060473000091"></a>&#147;Allotments and community gardens are valuable green spaces and community assets that can help improve people's quality of life by promoting healthy food, exercise and community interaction&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060473000073"></a>All those things are absolutely true, but what have the Government actually done to enable more provision of allotments? I suggest that the Government&#146;s role is to produce legislative and policy frameworks that encourage that provision.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000011"></a>There are fantastic examples throughout the country of where allotments have been providing those forms of social cohesion, as I am sure that the Minister is aware. In fact, they are laid out in the very good updated guide that the LGA published. I am glad that it published its second edition of <I>Growing in the Community</I>, which recommends many of the benefits of allotments. However, I shall provide the Minister with a few examples of where things have gone drastically wrong, and where the Government&#146;s idea that allotments are protected is not true.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000012"></a>I start with an example from Leeds, where the city council intends to build on part of its allotments this year. In fact, the report from its executive calls it not building on the allotments but,</p>
<ul><a name="08060473000100"></a>&#147;reconfiguration of Ingram Road allotments to create a potential development site&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060473000074"></a>One of the allotment holders got in touch with me. I gather that the Minister&#146;s department has given approval. Reconfiguration of allotments might mean not getting rid of the whole site, but taking just a part of it&#151;but part of the provision for Leeds has gone. It is another place with a considerable waiting list.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000013"></a>I have lots of examples from my own area, and shall give only a few of them because of time; they hold good up and down the country. In Honiton in east Devon, the town council tried to provide some more allotments; 104 people&#151;remember that it is a small town&#151;are already on the waiting list. However, East Devon District Council had allocated the land for housing that the town council had hoped to use. In South Molton, another small market town, on 24 April, 22 people were on the waiting list. Perhaps that does not sound very many, but for a town of that size it is a considerable number of people. In Plymouth, the city council claims that it will develop a leisure centre with 14 facilities on its one large park, so green space will be lost. The leisure centre is admirable, but it will

Another town just up the road from me is Barnstaple, which has a 90-strong waiting list&#151;a list that has been forced to close because there is no chance at the moment of fulfilling it, despite vigorous community activity. Being on the waiting list just depresses those on it. It holds out the possibility that you will get an allotment, whereas the Minister knows from the questions that she answered in the Chamber on the subject that in some cases people in their 30s and 40s will be dead before they have any chance of getting one.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000014"></a>The situation is dire. I had an interesting letter from a lady employed as the Transition Wirral allotment facilitator. She sent me some examples of how her council interprets allotment legislation, saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060473000092"></a>&#147;Briefly, in Wirral there are 1600 allotments and about 400 people on waiting lists. In my local area anyone going on the waiting list is now told of a wait of about 10 years. We recently petitioned the council asking it to fulfil its statutory duty to provide allotments&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060473000075"></a>I will not read out the report because that will take more time, but in essence the director confirms that the local authorities have a duty to provide sufficient allotments and, in section 2.3.5, goes on to explain to councillors that,</p>
<ul><a name="08060473000101"></a>&#147;allotment authorities have room to exercise discretion about the level of provision&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000015"></a>My first question to the Minister is: could the Government do a little more to define a sufficient number of allotments? That has not been discussed by a Government since the Thorpe report in 1969, I think, which suggested that there should be more definition of sufficiency. To illustrate why that is important, I should say that the rate at which demand outstrips supply is the issue when it comes to whether a council is fulfilling its requirements to provide allotments. I am not being party political about this: Sheffield has 1,400 people on its list; Manchester, 850; Edinburgh, 1,150; Plymouth, 1,000; and Blyth Valley in Northumberland, 1,200. The Minister will know that the situation in London is different because inner-city London boroughs were excluded from the provision requirement.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000016"></a>The situation in Wales has become so dire that it has provoked the National Society of Allotments and Leisure Gardeners to consider taking legal action because of the position in which those on waiting lists find themselves. In an interview with the BBC the society said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060473000093"></a>&#147;At some stage our members are going to want us to take on an authority for not carrying out their duties and responsibilities within the legislation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060473000076"></a>The society does not want to do that. Although it has the finance to do so, it wishes to resolve the issue in a different way.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000017"></a>Councillor Paul Bettison chairs the environment board of the Local Government Association, which has just revised its guidance to councils on how to meet their legal responsibilities to provide allotments. However, on looking at his response, I do not feel he is addressing the situation with sufficient urgency. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060473000094"></a>&#147;There are undoubtedly areas where if the council could find land and allocate it for allotments, that would be very popular.  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC64"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>But most councils would refrain from taking land on that they might later find they were unable to move on as allotments because of a trend passing by and leaving people no longer queuing up to take allotments on. Many councils don&#146;t want to get caught out with stocking up now and then finding perhaps in ten years&#146; time, if they cease to be fashionable, they would have allotments that again would be causing an unnecessary drain on the public purse to maintain them and keep them safe&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060473000077"></a>If that is Councillor Bettison&#146;s reaction to the situation&#151;and it is guidance from the top of the LGA&#151;I despair of councils addressing their waiting lists. He is saying, &#147;Don&#146;t worry about addressing the situation&#148;. He dismisses almost out of hand the fact that people have finally got the health message, can see food prices rising, understand that growing their own food is a sensible way of meeting their fresh food requirements and all the other reasons of which the Committee is aware.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000018"></a>Contrast that with the comment made by Lord Bledisloe in 1925 in regard to the Allotments Act, when he said,</p>
<ul><a name="08060473000102"></a>&#147;where you have got a developing city with land appreciating in value as time goes on, it is obviously in the best interests of the ratepayers themselves, as well as of the allotment holders, that the local authorities should anticipate future allotment requirements, and, before land appreciates too much in value, obtain it at a reasonable figure&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 29/7/25; col. 550.]</ul>
<p><a name="08060473000078"></a>What a different and more positive response.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000019"></a>Originally, of course, the local authorities&#146; housing authorities and councils&#146; planning authorities had the duty to provide allotments&#151;they still do&#151;but under the Bill the HCA is the housing and planning authority in many clauses. Should it not inherit some proper duty about the provision? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08060473000021"></a>The noble Lord said: Following yesterday&#146;s discussions, I am not sure whether the Minister will think this discussion of allotments is a digression. If it is, it is an important one and my noble friend is to be congratulated on raising it in such a forthright and comprehensive way.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000022"></a>I am tempted to digress further about the meeting I am going to attend tomorrow evening in Colne where, among other things, we will be discussing proposals to provide new and replacement allotments&#151;so at least some of us at local level are taking this appropriately seriously.

If the Homes and Communities Agency owns allotments&#151;I am not sure why it should&#151;or provides allotments as part of its wider involvement, it is absolutely clear to me that such allotments should be managed as of right by the local allotments authority, which might be the borough council, the district council or the parish council. They are doing it already, they have the expertise, and there is no point in duplicating things. It is a simple point which I will be making on a number of occasions in other contexts in our debates today and later on. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08060473000024"></a><a name="80604-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08060473000111"></a>Lord Howarth of Newport:</b> I underscore briefly one point made almost in passing by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. She alluded to the recent very steep rise in food prices and the anticipation that for the foreseeable future we are going to have to live with higher food prices. That adds force to the case she has eloquently made for the better provision of allotments.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000025"></a>I pose a couple of questions which the noble Baroness may be able to answer in due course. She refers in proposed new subsection (1) in her amendment to a duty on the HCA to,</p>
<ul><a name="08060473000103"></a>&#147;provide a sufficient number of allotments&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060473000079"></a>I wonder how she defines &#147;sufficiency&#148;. In proposed new subsection (4) she would require the HCA to,</p>
<ul><a name="08060473000104"></a>&#147;maintain a waiting list and manage the allotments under the same provisions as if it were a local authority&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060473000080"></a>It would be helpful if she could clarify what she believes the principles should be for prioritisation in allocation of allotments to people on waiting lists.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000026"></a>Finally, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that these matters would be best left to local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="08060473000027"></a><a name="80604-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08060473000112"></a>Baroness Ford:</b> I support the spirit of the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, but urge my noble friend to resist the idea that the Homes and Communities Agency would have this responsibility, for two reasons. I think that the noble Baroness has absolutely nailed the problem, which is that local authorities are not satisfactorily carrying out their duties in terms of making allotments available.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000028"></a>I echo everything the noble Baroness said about the value and benefits of allotments. However, I really do not think that it is reasonable that the Homes and Communities Agency should be put on a hook and local authorities left off the hook, as provision is their responsibility. It is reasonable and entirely right that the Homes and Communities Agency, as is good practice in good planning for urban regeneration, ordinarily thinks about allotments as part of new urban developments. I expect that organisation to carry on doing that, but it should not have this duty put in the Bill. I am sorry not to be able to support the provision, but we are letting local authorities completely off the hook if we do.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000030"></a>There is no doubt that if we are going from a period of surplus food when anyone could have anything they liked for a song to a period when food is generally in short supply, the demand for allotments will increase, particularly in the major urban areas. There may be less demand in more rural areas, where more houses tend to have gardens anyway. However, I do not expect to see a plea for Hyde Park to return to being allotments, as was once the case; I hope things are not going to get that bad.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000031"></a>It would not be unreasonable for the Homes and Communities Agency to have to consider whether land should be provided for allotments as part of its responsibility, although I accept that it should not be any part of its responsibility to have to manage it.</p>

It is reasonable for them to look to their own house first of all before they look to the national agency.</p>

I am grateful that the noble Baroness has created an opportunity for this. As she knows, I have a great deal of sympathy for what she said, for reasons that will become clear. I am sorry that I missed the debate that started in 1649; I would have enjoyed that. This is a landmark year, being the centenary of the 1908 Act, and we are right to mark it. She is also right&#151;this has been echoed around the Committee&#151;that the benefits of allotments to the community and to the individual are legion. There is nothing but support for the provision of allotments in my department on my behalf.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000035"></a>I shall start by taking the amendment to Amendment No 58, and I echo what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said. Essentially, we are dealing, and have been since the first protections were created in law, with the fact that allotments are the responsibility of the local authority, and rightly so. For the reasons that have been given, they must remain so. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment about management therefore underscores the point, as he explained it, about the importance of retaining that status.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000036"></a>Allotments are different in so many ways. They are the only bits of green space in the community that are given unique special protection by legislation, reinforced  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC67"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by planning guidance. They are not treated as previously developed land, which is crucial. It is difficult for them to be disposed of or built on. When you look at where we have come from, with the loss of allotments since the war, it is a dramatic and rather sad picture. It remains the case, though, that a council can dispose of an allotment in exceptional circumstances only if it can fully justify to the Secretary of State for Communities that there is a need for a change of use against robust criteria. The fact that those criteria are robust does not conceal that we have had to take action in recent years to slow up the loss of allotments. Following a DETR Select Committee inquiry in 1998, we strengthened and reinforced in 2002 the criteria for the disposal of statutory allotments by planning policy guidance 17, which ensured that communities&#146; need for allotments would be taken into account and that the local authority would have to show that an allotment was surplus to need.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000037"></a>We come back to the point regarding the key to ensuring that allotments are there for those who want them. It was useful to have the examples about the size of waiting lists, because there is no doubt that in some parts of the country we are seeing a renaissance of the allotment and a different profile of the allotmenteer, as it were. I have visited the Dig for Victory allotments in St James&#146;s Park, which I recommend to noble Lords; they are magnificent and involve a lot of schoolchildren. I also recommend the allotments that I visited in south London, which showed beyond doubt that they were a resource for a very mixed community. All sorts of fruit and vegetables are grown by different ethnic communities, and there are even beehives. It is a place where the communities meet and people mentor each other in the growing of fruit and vegetables. My noble friend Lord Howarth was absolutely right&#151;allotments are wonderful places.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000038"></a>The key to improvement and the key to achieving the sort of changes that the noble Baroness and I want is not a change in the law, but better and more systematic implementation of it. Therefore, in the past year we have tried to engage positively with, and to promote good practice by, allotment organisations and those who mentor in allotment offices, for example. That has given us a better understanding of the issues. In June last year we published revised guidance for plot holders and in the past year we have worked closely with the LGA, which has been sympathetic and proactive to the needs of allotment officers, which are the key to this. They look after allotments&#151;whether by protecting them from vandalism, making sure that the waiting list is not growing out of control or ensuring that allotment holders are informed about prospects and possibilities. They are the people who make a difference.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000039"></a>We updated and published a second edition of <I>Growing in the Community</I> in March, to which the noble Baroness referred. That reflected the significant developments in the allotments movement since 2001 and highlighted their importance. It provided an up-to-date account of policy and a guide to the legislation by making it absolutely clear that no local authority should be in any doubt about what the law says has to be done if there is any question of  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC68"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>allotments being under challenge for whatever reason, and that nor should there be any doubt as to the rights of the allotment holders. What gave me confidence that that was the right way to proceed was when I hosted a round-table meeting with all the key allotment organisations in November last year. Together we agreed that the legislation was robust, but that there were considerations of clarity in the application of the legislation. Going forward with those organisations and working with local authorities to follow up how they are managing their allotments is very important.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000040"></a>In brief, Section 23 of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act 1908 places a duty on local authorities, except inner London boroughs, to provide sufficient allotments where they consider there is a demand for them in their area. The planning system, through PPG17 on planning for open space, sport and recreation and planning policy statement 3, provides the framework for protection and provision that I have been talking about. In particular, PPG17 advises local authorities to make provision for all types of public open space and expects local authorities to undertake robust assessments of local needs and audits. That suggests to me that a local authority, under PPG17, is in a position to make some very positive choices about the potential of its brownfield land or anything that may be available that is convertible to allotments. Robust assessment might create an opportunity for assessing what a local authority means by sufficiency. I cannot answer the question here, because it is a local diagnosis. PPS3 is a positive response to and recognition of the fact that we need more open space. In those definitions, there is room for allotments as well.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000041"></a>Furthermore, we should recognise that allotments are by no means always lost to housing. A significant proportion goes to other forms of green space&#151;the noble Baroness mentioned one&#151;and sometimes to upgraded green spaces. Frankly, one cannot afford to be too sentimental about allotments. Some of them are in a pretty awful condition and have reached the point of being an eyesore rather than of being of use to a community. That is not to say that I advocate their being used for anything else, but they should be used for what they are intended. Sometimes, upgraded green space gives children and hard-pressed families more access to space. One has to make proper judgments about them.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000042"></a>The noble Baroness was right that we are looking at greatly increased demand and, therefore, not at a central solution. The HCA is for the reasons given by my noble friend Lady Ford not the right agency to undertake provision, although I would be very surprised if in some of the regeneration packages put together by English Partnerships allotment space had not been allocated. In some of the growth areas&#151;where we look at provision, for example, of community forests&#151;space for allotments will certainly be designed into the master plans. I hope that the noble Baroness is reassured that we are serious in our intent, that we are using more appropriate levers and that we will keep the situation under close scrutiny.</p>

I do not disagree with any noble Lord that allotments should be managed locally. The comments of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, were helpful, because provision and management are separate. For that reason, I was interested also in the experience of the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, who spoke about the thought that goes into planning. That reflects the Allotments Act 1925, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060473000096"></a>&#147;Every local authority ... preparing a town-planning scheme in pursuance of the Town Planning Act, 1925, shall, in preparing such scheme, consider what provision ought to be included therein for the reservation of land for allotments&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060473000081"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s experience is useful in instructing us to make sure that in every scheme, especially if the HCA is to be the planning authority, that Act is followed.</p>

<p><a name="08060473000044"></a>I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, asked me what I considered a sufficient number, because there is a gap in the legislation. It would be usual for the Government to come up with guidance about that. I have cited many numbers today, but that is the only one to which I may want to return on Report. The noble Lord mentioned waiting lists. I am not aware of any local authority prioritising people with young children or people who have just retired; I think that it is Buggins&#146;s turn. When you put your name down, you wait. If you are not dead by the time you rise to the top of the list, you get an allotment.</p>

This is a probing amendment to check how the HCA will relate to specially designated landscapes, which obviously have different planning requirements. I should declare that I am a vice-president of the Council for National Parks and I also have the interesting designation of &#147;AONB champion&#148; for our North Devon AONB. The amendment raises questions

I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08060473000054"></a><a name="80604-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08060473000121"></a>Lord Howarth of Newport:</b> I endorse the spirit of the amendment. The noble Baroness is to be congratulated on hitting on an extremely important issue. It has become almost a commonplace to observe that the design of the spaces between buildings is as important as the buildings themselves. That is a principle of broader application than the application in this amendment, which relates to areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks, but we should be grateful to the noble Baroness for reminding the Committee of the importance of design and conservation in natural spaces and in spaces between buildings. That is very much in the spirit of what the Committee has already endorsed in considering other aspects of design. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will be able to reflect carefully on the very important issue raised in the amendment.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060473000099"></a>&#147;The HCA shall ensure that its plans and activities fully respect the purposes and objectives of Green Belt designation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060473000082"></a>In a sense, this deals with a special case as regards planning issues and the relationship between the HCA and local development plans and so on, which we shall come on to when we talk about designated areas. However, it goes wider than that because it refers to the HCA in all its activities and not just as a planning authority in some places.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000056"></a>The green belt has been one of our most successful planning tools since the inception of the modern-day planning system. It helps to safeguard the countryside and precious open spaces near large urban populations; it protects an area&#146;s character and identity by preventing settlements from coalescing; and it curtails urban sprawl and encourages regeneration. Although there has recently been much more debate about how efficient green belts are and about how permanent they should be, all those things remain fundamentally true. It is vital that the HCA fully recognises those benefits and that it has a high regard for green-belt objectives and purposes.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000057"></a>As we know, the green belt is threatened in many parts of the country. Over 1,100 hectares of green belt have been lost each year since 1997 and at least 45,240 homes, equivalent to a city the size of Bath&#151;I am not sure why Bath is given as the example&#151;have been built on green-belt land since 1997. London&#146;s green belt has been subject to review in 18 locations. Until fairly recently, when people talked about the green belt, they were referring to London, but green belts have appeared in the rest of the country over the past 25 years.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000058"></a>To protect the green belt, it is necessary to put in place measures to avoid abuse of powers and address potential conflicts of interest&#151;for example, between the HCA&#146;s roles as developer, landowner and planning authority, and in its role as a provider and facilitator of social housing. Of course, these conflicts are not new. Local authorities manage, and in most cases have good systems for dealing with, these kinds of  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC71"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>conflict. The point about local authorities is that they are elected, local and democratic and, in most cases nowadays, they take their decisions in a fairly, and sometimes very, open way, exposed to local debate. The way in which a big national quango works is different. It may be less different than some of us fear; nevertheless, it is different. The purpose of the amendment is to put on the face of the Bill a clear requirement to take note of the importance of the green belt.</p>

<p><a name="08060473000059"></a><a name="80604-gc0002.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0002.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08060473000123"></a>Baroness Whitaker:</b> I support both amendments on similar arguments to those of my noble friend Lord Howarth, that these green spaces are an essential part of the well-being which homes need to produce. Just as it should be the responsibility of the Homes and Communities Agency to ensure good design in order that homes should induce well-being, so it should have a complementary responsibility to maintain green spaces for the same purpose.</p>

<p><a name="08060473000060"></a><a name="80604-gc0002.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0002.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08060473000124"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Two important debates have also been raised on these amendments. I am very happy to reply and to give assurances in both cases.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000061"></a>On AONBs, an issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, there is nothing in the Bill that lessens the current levels of protection that these special kinds of land enjoy. I am grateful to my noble friends for pointing out the ways in which they are special and precious to us. Any development in which the HCA is involved will be subject to the planning system. It is highly unlikely that it would want to develop land in an AONB, national park or even on open spaces, village greens, common land or allotment. In the very unlikely event that it did, it would have to secure planning permission in the normal way. It has to fully respect the protection afforded to those types of land.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000062"></a>As the noble Baroness knows, there are very strong protections around our national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. Our planning statement PPS7 states that they have the highest status of protection in relation to landscape and scenic beauty. The conservation of the natural beauty of the landscape and countryside should therefore be given great weight in planning priorities and development control decisions in these areas. The conservation of wildlife and the cultural heritage are important considerations. They are a specific purpose for national parks, where they should be given a great weight in planning policies and development control decisions. That is completely unchanged and uncompromised by the Bill. Indeed, as well as reflecting these priorities, local development documents and regional spatial strategies should also support suitably located and designed development. The HCA could be involved in helping to deliver that. The Bill does not give it any right to override those existing protections. As I have said, major developments should not take place unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000063"></a>PPS7 also states that because of the serious nature of the effect that major developments may have on these areas of natural beauty, and taking account of  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC72"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the recreational opportunities they provide, applications for all such developments should be subject to the most rigorous examination. They should be demonstrated to be in the public interest before being allowed to proceed. These are very specific and robust protections.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000064"></a>However, the noble Baroness raised an issue that I would like to take away. As constructed, the amendment relates to the Commons Act, which provides for better protection of common land and village greens by streamlining the consensus system for works and fencing on commons. It ensures that existing statutory protections are applied consistently, including reinforcing existing protections against abuse, encroachment and/or unauthorised development. That would apply equally to any development involving the HCA.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000065"></a>The noble Baroness has prompted me to consider whether we may need to look again at the provisions in this proposed legislation where the HCA seeks to develop special land in relation to the provisions of the Commons Act 2006. We obviously need to be absolutely certain that we have got this right and I am going to look again at those provisions to make sure that the protections are maintained.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000066"></a>Turning to the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, again there is no question that the creation of the HCA and its powers somehow threatens the green belt. I am absolutely delighted to be able to make clear, once again, that the green belt gives important protection to the countryside. The housing Green Paper and the planning White Paper reinforced the Government&#146;s commitment to the key principles of the green belt, and we have no plans to change our policy on it. As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said, it has helped to check the sprawl of large built-up areas and helps to protect the countryside. I remember seeing a map showing the implications for the south-east had the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 not been in force to create such protections. There has been an overall increase in green-belt land since 1997 by 64,000 acres. Progress was monitored in the period 2003-07. Excluding the 47,300 hectares designated as national park in 2005, the total green belt increased across England by 11,400 hectares.</p>
<h5><a name="08060473000107"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08060473000067"></a>The point is about whether the HCA is involved. There is a general presumption against inappropriate development except in very special circumstances. The involvement of the HCA would certainly not constitute a very special circumstance. It will have no role in reviewing green-belt boundaries. I must make clear too that such boundaries are a matter for local planning authorities and regional planning authorities. They can be changed only in exceptional circumstances and after public consultation through the development plan process. Nothing in the Bill will alter that. I hope on that basis that the noble Baroness will feel that she can safely withdraw her amendment.</p>

As she said, it is important that its fit with the Bill is exactly right. However, the spirit of my amendment is very much that the HCA must have regard to all the special landscapes that we value so much. That does not mean that there would never be any building in them. Listening to the debate yesterday, having had the pleasure of serving with the noble Lord, Lord Best, on his Joseph Rowntree rural housing commission, and having spent many years in a county where there are many special designations, I know that we would not want nothing to happen. Rural housing is still important, but it must be built in the right way in the special areas. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. </p>

</ul>
<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000002"></a>The noble Baroness said: This short probing amendment seeks to examine whether the Minister thinks that the Government have got it right. As I read the Bill, they can do what they like with rights of way. When the government agency decides that a right of way should be extinguished, diverted or whatever, it would have a special privilege of dealing with that as it wants, rather than following the more public and democratic path that everybody else has to follow. Obviously developments sometimes require that rights of way are diverted or even extinguished, but that very often is a cheap and easy way in which to deal with the situation, and not always the most constructive&#151;certainly not for the people who live on the far side of a development and want to access places through the development when the inclusion, although more difficult in design terms, could have been achieved. Rights of way very often suffer. On looking back, cities and towns were designed with small rights of way included as a means of access. Now that we are beginning to appreciate that the car will not, and should not, rule access issues, footpaths will again come into their own.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000003"></a>The amendment seeks to probe the Government on why the Secretary of State should have this special power, rather than going through the normal process, as everyone else does, which has been devised over years and is inclusive. Does the Minister feel that footpaths have sufficient recognition in what should be a low-carbon approach to ways of connecting people with places that they need to access? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08060487000004"></a><a name="80604-gc0002.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0002.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="08060487000057"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My Amendments Nos. 63 and 64 are in the group. I shall speak first to Amendment No. 64, which is more straightforward and is about the power set out in paragraph 9 to curtail the decision-making process. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060487000050"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may make a final decision without further investigation ... if ... the Secretary of State&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060487000046"></a>thinks the grounds of the objection are fully understood&#151;I am paraphrasing&#151;and that he is satisfied that there is sufficient information available.  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That is slightly different from the normal position whereby the highways authority would extinguish a public right of way, rather than, in this case, the Secretary of State on behalf of the HCA. We have a position whereby the appeal is to the Secretary of State against the Secretary of State&#146;s decision. Normally an appeal on a right of way is to the Secretary of State against a decision of the local highway authority.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000005"></a>So already we have a situation that is not quite as transparent or fair, perhaps, as it normally is. Equally, I understand that at the moment an objection to a proposal to extinguish a right of way invariably goes to a public inquiry. The provision says that under these circumstances it will not invariably go to a public inquiry, but the Secretary of State may decide that a public inquiry is not required and it will just be done anyhow. That is a lessening of the rights of objectors compared with the normal circumstances. I would like to understand why, if I have understood it correctly, the Government think that that is necessary or desirable.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000006"></a>Amendment No. 63 is substantially more complicated in that it seeks to remove most of Part 2 of Schedule 3 and replace it with a provision that the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 should apply. I think that we are talking about two things here. My noble friend Lady Miller talked about footpaths and that kind of low-level right of way, which are very important, but if we are talking about major comprehensive developments that substantially change the character of existing localities&#151;for example, building a new town&#151;clearly the whole pattern of all kinds of highways, from roads to footpaths and everything in between, will be substantially changed. As I understand it, the existing legislation is similar to what is set out in Part 2 of Schedule 3, but is it the same?</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000007"></a>Legislation to allow this has existed since the New Towns Act 1946. There can be no argument that if major developments which completely remove the existing road and footpath pattern and create a new one are going to take place, substantial legal changes have to take place as well. The question whether the development is desirable is a different, planning issue, but if it is decided to proceed, new road patterns will often need to replace former highway networks. Nevertheless, new legislation should not be allowed to follow existing precedents blindly without it being considered whether they are fittest for the intended purpose. Just because something has existed for the past 50 or 60 years does not mean that it is the right way to proceed now, particularly as local authority structures have changed.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000008"></a>In all cases, the primary Acts which operate at the moment and allow radical revision of highway networks are supplemented by regulations that set out the detailed procedures for extinguishing or diverting existing roads, footpaths and bridleways. They all provide for named national and regional voluntary bodies to be notified of applications for orders&#151;in the case of footpaths and bridleways, for example&#151;as well as requiring advertisement. Will the Government confirm that, if Schedule 3 were to be passed, detailed regulations would set out the procedures, and that the

Does Part 2 of the schedule repeat exactly the powers in the existing legislation or is it different? Are there minor differences? Are there major differences? If there are differences, will the Government tell us what they are so that we can understand why the changes are being made?</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000009"></a>My amendment would simply adopt one of the well established procedures in Schedule 14 to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The Government may not wish to do that, but if they do not wish merely to re-enact existing legislation, they have to tell us what the changes are and why they are being made. If they are re-enacting existing legislation, why is it not being changed in response to changed circumstances? They are two sides of the same coin. It is a probing amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08060487000010"></a><a name="80604-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08060487000058"></a>Baroness Whitaker:</b> I share the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, about the preservation of the footpaths. I suppose that I ought to declare an interest as somebody who often is active and occasionally battles to keep local footpaths clear&#151;indeed, probably some of the same ones that my noble friend the Minister also walks on. I have to say that on these occasions it is a great comfort to be able to refer to existing procedures, which people, once reminded of them, do fall in with. I think that our footpaths are a very important feature of British rural life. They are enjoyed by many people. The rights to open them were dearly won, as those with long memories will recall, and we should cherish them.</p>

<p><a name="08060487000011"></a><a name="80604-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08060487000059"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Whitaker for identifying an interest that I should declare: hacking my way through quite a lot of footpaths in parishes that shall remain nameless. The quality of footpaths varies enormously within counties, and in another life I would be much more militant about that than I am at the moment. I take these amendments seriously.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000012"></a>I hope I can bring comfort to both noble Lords. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment asks the blunt question, &#147;Have we got it right?&#148;&#151;that is, has what we have done in the Bill established the right balance? First of all&#151;and this reflects what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said&#151;the powers in this part of the Bill are not new. They are closely modelled on the powers contained in paragraph 9 of Schedule 20 to the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 for the Urban Regeneration Agency. I say &#147;closely modelled&#148; because&#151;again, I hope I can address the question of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves&#151;we have strengthened the power in favour of the many people who use public rights of way. In response to debates in the other place, we laid an amendment that made it a requirement that if the HCA wanted a public right of way extinguished, it would have to offer a replacement right of way or show that such an alternative was not required. Part 2 of Schedule 3 and Clause 3 make that clear. That alternative right of way has to be offered, whether or not it has gone to public inquiry. That demonstrates how much we value the protection that we can offer public rights of way.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC76"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000013"></a>I stress also that it is for the Secretary of State to extinguish the right of way, not for the HCA. If the Secretary of State were asked to exercise such a power I know she would do so with a great deal of consideration and diligence, not least because the decision would be subject to judicial review.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000014"></a>The import of the amendment&#151;which is essentially an opportunity to have this sort of debate, but I have to address the implications&#151;would effectively mean that the HCA was hampered in regenerating or developing any land that was crossed by a public right of way. It would also mean that there was no statutory way for the HCA to deal with, for example, any electronic communications equipment that may be on land of this type. Part 2 of Schedule 3 allows for that to happen, but only after the Secretary of State has exercised the power to make an order under paragraph 3. I hope that will deal with the thrust of the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000015"></a>I turn to the issues raised by the noble Lord. Regarding Amendment No. 63, it is important that I point out that there is a distinction between the Town and Country Planning Act and the Bill. The questions he raised about the role of local authorities are reflected in that difference. As I read the amendment, it appeared intended to ensure that the same procedure was followed for the extinguishment of public rights of way over land owned by the HCA as for land held by local authorities for planning purposes under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. My assumption was that the noble Lord considered that the TCP Act 1990 contains an established procedure for extinguishing public rights of way and that that procedure should apply in the case of public rights of way over land owned by the HCA. I shall explain the difference between the two and then answer his question about what has been updated.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000016"></a>The procedures are in many ways extremely similar. In particular, Schedule 14 to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the Bill provide for notice of the order to be published and served and for a public local inquiry to be held in certain circumstances. The procedures are not identical but they are similar. In both cases the local authority or the Secretary of State must be satisfied that an alternative right of way has been or will be provided, or that the provision of an alternative right of way is not required. That is the important safeguard. Essentially, the key difference is the question of who has the power to make the order extinguishing the public right of way. Section 258 of the Town and Country Planning Act gives a local authority the power to make the order to extinguish a public right of way over land which is held by that local authority for &#147;planning purposes&#148;. The local authority may make the order itself if the order is unopposed but it must be confirmed by the Secretary of State if it is opposed.</p>

<p><a name="08060487000017"></a>Under the provisions at Part 2 of Schedule 3, only the Secretary of State has the power to extinguish a public right of way over land which is owned by the HCA. That is a very important and necessary difference.  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC77"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The intention of the amendment seems to be to give the HCA a greater role in the process. In fact, the Bill removes the HCA&#146;s involvement and strengthens the process by giving the responsibility for publishing the notice, considering objections and, importantly, making a final decision to the Secretary of State. That is right and proper because these are very serious issues and we think that that responsibility should reside with the Secretary of State. It is the same procedure that applied to the Urban Regeneration Agency in the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 and for urban development corporations, so we have not invented a new procedure; we are taking over the powers that previously existed in that respect.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000018"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s final amendment, Amendment No. 64, worries me slightly because it seems to remove some of the discretion that the Secretary of State had when making a decision to extinguish a public right of way. As I understood it, the noble Lord said that there should always be a public inquiry and that the Secretary of State should not have the discretion not to hold a public inquiry. I argue that that is a necessary discretion to have when there are no objections, because going through the burden of a public inquiry is a major challenge for everyone, not just for a local authority. It involves cost, as well as a time cost. Therefore, I do not think that that is a good way forward.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000019"></a>The problem is that the amendment would mean that the Secretary of State could make a decision to remove a right of way without further investigation only if further information had been requested from an objector but it had not been provided within the required period. Slightly perversely, it would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to consider evidence already provided and make a decision if it was considered that all the necessary information had been provided on which to make an informed and reasonable decision. That takes me back to the bigger point that the Secretary of State must be allowed to act on the information that is available and to make an appropriate decision. Clearly, the ability to extinguish public rights of way will be important for the agency. If it were unable to do so, that could prevent it developing as we would all wish. The provision to require the HCA to provide an alternative right of way or demonstrate that it was not required should result in an overall neutral effect, but that is for the Secretary of State to consider when she is reaching her decision.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000020"></a>These decisions are often not easy to make; indeed, they are often quite complex. In the information that is provided, there is a lot of history about public rights of way and ownership and so on. Therefore, it is necessary that the Secretary of State should have that information and, certainly when there is no challenge, be able to move to a decision without going via a public inquiry.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000021"></a>Finally, the provision as drafted is very similar to that to which the URA is now subject. Therefore, essentially it is something that we are carrying forward rather than amending or diluting. The interrelationship between the Bill and the procedures is slightly complex, but I hope that my explanation has been sufficiently clear to enable the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I am not sure that I understood all of it straightaway, but I shall certainly read it carefully and add to my homework on the train tomorrow. If my drafting of the amendment was inadequate, I am duly admonished by the Minister; it performed its purpose of raising the issue and of establishing the basis of the argument. It is not my intention at all to suggest that unopposed orders should require a public inquiry; that would clearly be nonsense. It is my intention to suggest that orders which have objections to them should require a public inquiry in exactly the same way that is required for highways authority proposals. That is the difference and we will want to look at this matter further and perhaps have some correspondence about it. I will take further advice from people who are far more expert than I am in these areas.</p>

<p><a name="08060487000027"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment, as noble Lords might imagine. It refers to Part 3 of Schedule 3, entitled &#147;Powers in relation to burial grounds and consecrated land etc.&#148;. Part 3 provides the HCA with powers to use any &#147;land of the HCA&#148;&#151;which I presume means land that it owns, although I would like some clarification, because it would be important in relation to later amendments&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08060487000053"></a>&#147;which consists in, or forms part of, a burial ground&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060487000047"></a>The schedule proposes that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060487000052"></a>&#147;The HCA may use the land in any way which accords with planning permission despite ... anything in any enactment relating to burial grounds ... any obligation or restriction imposed under ecclesiastical law or otherwise in respect of burial grounds&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060487000048"></a>and so on. It seems draconian that the HCA can take over burial grounds and ignore all the other rules, regulations, laws of the land and ecclesiastical laws which everyone else who owns a burial ground has to comply with. I would be grateful if the Minister would explain why these powers are required and under what circumstances she envisages them being operated outside existing powers to use burial grounds for other purposes, whereby one has to go through a long and complicated procedure. Why should the HCA be exempt from that? I beg to move. </p>

Of course, the Minister may be able to explain why the Homes and Communities Agency must purchase burial grounds, although, for the life of me, I cannot think of a reason. The same argument could be reasonably applied to consecrated ground. I accept that there is a possible issue regarding town and community design when one is dealing with very large developments, but I would have thought that that would be exceedingly rare, and the actual &#147;need&#148; to purchase this land would have to be proved before such a situation arose.</p>

Certainly, over the past five or six years very strange pieces of land came into the possession of English Partnerships. I cannot recall a burial ground ever coming in but I recall a phone call one day when we inherited land near Chester Zoo, when one of my officials was very perplexed to find that he had dug up a giraffe with anthrax. That was without a doubt the most exotic thing that ever happened to us. But I can foresee circumstances in which the HCA might inherit a burial ground or part of one that might have been annexed to an old hospital or some other institution that came into its possession.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000031"></a>I start by saying to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that &#147;land of the HCA&#148;&#151;it is a wonderfully ringing title, is it not?&#151;means land that the HCA owns. He is quite right about that.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000032"></a>I know that the issue of burial grounds and consecrated land is very emotive and we are all agreed around the Committee that we must be very careful that we treat such land in a sensitive and considerate manner. I am sure that the deceased giraffe was treated with great respect when English Partnerships uncovered its haul. This amendment would hinder our ability to do that.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000033"></a>It goes without saying that it has never been the intention of English Partnerships to target land of this nature for regeneration or development. It would certainly not be the intention of the HCA, to reinforce the point that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, made. As the noble Baroness said, it might well have come down through transfer of surplus land, and the example that she gave of the hospital was a useful one, because that would be very possible.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000034"></a>If land were ever to come into this category as part of a critical element of a larger regeneration scheme, and strategic to it, any such land would almost certainly be disused and historic. We might be talking about, for example, a medieval plague pit or an Iron Age burial site, which have great historical significance, must be treated with great care and would come under a lot of other protections.</p>

<p><a name="08060487000035"></a>We will make regulations that will contain comprehensive procedures to deal with the issues raised when human remains are encountered or consecrated land is involved. We are taking the opportunity in the Bill to do that. The procedures in the regulations must be no less stringent than any provisions disapplied and, of course, the use of the land must be in accordance with planning permission. That goes without saying. We are in discussions with the Ministry of Justice over the content and nature of the prescribed requirements and will consult on them in due course. The paragraphs as drafted are modelled on those in the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 and the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.</p>

She tells us that the provisions here are modelled on previous Acts, the TCPA 1990 and the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. She may not be able to tell us now, but how many times have those provisions been used during the past 18 or 15 years? I do not know whether anybody knows that but it is an important question. We have been told by the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, that the only thing that she can remember in that regard is a giraffe with anthrax. I do not think that that applies to burial grounds, in this sense. It would be interesting to know the answer. It is easy to churn over existing legislation that was made for a previous era and previous circumstances, under a very different planning regime, and to re-enact it on the off-chance that it may be required.</p>

<p><a name="08060487000038"></a><a name="80604-gc0003.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0003.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08060487000067"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I can answer the noble Lord&#146;s question; that is very surprising, I know. The prescribed requirements that would have enabled the URA to make full use of the powers which it was granted by the 1993 Act were never made. This means that, had the URA wished to move any human remains, it would have had to rely on the provisions in the Burial Act 1857, which would have required it to obtain a faculty or licence from a bishop or a licence from the Secretary of State. We do not centrally hold records regarding these, so are unable to say whether any has ever been sought or received. That has not taken us a long way forward, but perhaps it gives us a bit of colourful background to why we cannot answer the question.</p>

The Government keep telling us that it is not the Government but whatever it is described as&#151;an agency that is at arm&#146;s length, at least, from the Government. The basic point that I was making was to ask why the powers that the HCA has in issues such as these should be different from the powers that other public bodies have under other existing legislation. Why is it necessary to create special legislation just for the HCA? The answer is that it is what some previous agencies had under previous Acts, but now we have been told that those regulations were never made&#151;so why are we being provided with pages 162 and 163 and two-thirds of page 164 in this legislation, which could just be scrubbed out as not needed?</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000042"></a>If the HCA requires this, why should it not have to go through exactly the same procedures that a county council, a borough council or any other body has to go through? That is the fundamental question that I ask. Okay, so that comes from a slight scepticism on my part about large national agencies and, if they are necessary, the need to keep them constrained in what they can do so that they do not have powers that lots of other bodies do not have. It is all to do with the rights of people to object, and so on.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000043"></a>The fundamental point was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. If these regulations have not been required for the past 15 years, why are they required now? The Minister tells us that they are required because something might happen&#151;but the truth is that if these provisions had not happened in some historic legislation, the Government would not now put them in this Bill. It is just because they can recycle them and roll them forward that they are being put in here. That comes back to the point that I made about rights of way. When this recycling of historic legislation goes forward, we should really ask whether it is still needed in this day and age. If I were on a jury listening to this discussion, I might say that it was not required now. I might say that because that is what my amendment is saying, but my amendment was probing and I am strengthened in my view.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08060487000044"></a>We will ponder further about these things, but I hope that the Government will do so, too. There is no point in putting legislation on the statute book just for the point of it. There is already far too much legislation and, if we could get rid of some of it, that would be wonderful.

How often has this power been used in the most recent period that the Government have figures for? No doubt they will tell us that this is just re-enacting legislation from 1993, 1990 or before then&#151;perhaps going back to the New Towns Act 1946. Is such power needed now? In particular, on a lot of these matters we have to understand that the planning regime has changed enormously in the past 50 years. The Town and Country Planning Act 1947 very much filled a vacuum. In the past 60 years the planning system has developed and is now very comprehensive&#151;some would say it was all embracing&#151;and all sorts of plans exist at national, regional and local levels, and at county level in two-tier areas. Then there is all the planning guidance and planning statements and so on. The planning system was not so comprehensive in those days, yet all this old legislation is being re-enacted although it was designed for different circumstances in different times.</p>

The schedule seeks to cater for situations arising from that need. For example, Part 2 applies where apparatus of a statutory undertaker is situated on, under or over land of the Homes and Communities Agency and the statutory undertaker needs to remove or re-site that apparatus because of a development.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08060493000013"></a>In a similar vein, Part 3 of Schedule 2 gives statutory undertakers a right to make representations to the Secretary of State and the appropriate Minister to enable them to continue providing services on land which has been acquired by the HCA that would otherwise not be provided or satisfactorily provided. The statutory undertaker can make representations to the Secretary of State and the relevant Minister to have its functions modified to secure the provision of its services, so that, for example, it may enter that land to continue to carry out those functions.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08060493000014"></a>Equally, Part 3 of Schedule 2 gives a right to the Homes and Communities Agency to make representations to modify the functions of a statutory undertaker so as to secure the provision of new services, or perhaps the extension of existing services, in relation to such land.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08060493000015"></a>The other paragraphs that the noble Lord wishes to strike out set the notification and objection-making procedures that must be followed before an order of this nature can be made. It is perhaps worth adding that the power to make an order under paragraphs 16 and 17 of the schedule are subject to special parliamentary procedure, so the degree of analysis of the issues should not be underestimated before an order can be made.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08060493000016"></a>These powers are not about giving statutory undertakers greater or wider powers; rather, they should be seen as ensuring that this class of body continues to provide the functions that it is meant to provide&#151;for example, railways, water and access to other services.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08060493000017"></a>The provisions are modelled on those contained in the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, which governed the relationship between the Urban Regeneration Agency&#151;now English Partnerships&#151;and statutory undertakers, as well as on the Town and Country Planning Act 1997. I say in response to the noble Lord that the powers are rarely used. Their function is to provide an incentive for developers and statutory undertakers to reach agreement where the activities of one come into contact with the other. There is interdependency in many instances. Removal of the powers would remove the incentive to

If we were to take away the powers, I suspect that one might see lengthy and costly delays in resolving important development issues.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08060493000018"></a>I therefore caution against removing these parts of the legislation because they have a value, even though I admit that the powers will not need to be used with great regularity. They ensure a degree of certainty that statutory undertakers will be required to continue to provide their functions and that there is no loss of service. I am sure the noble Lord will appreciate that that is important to all concerned if developments are to work.</p>

What would be the present situation if the HCA and the statutory undertaker did not come to an agreement? How would they now resolve the matter? Can they go for a court order? What would they do now? Is the Secretary of State needed to intervene in this? The worry that I have is that as you pile responsibilities on the HCA&#151;of course, always leaving the door open for the Secretary of State to intervene directly&#151;the top-down nature of the Bill is becoming clearer and clearer.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08060493000020"></a>We shall come to some later amendments but perhaps I may go back a step to footpaths. I remember very well that when the right-to-roam Act was passed we were promised a strengthening of the footpath system. This Bill does not go to the aspect of what has been promised in the past in any way at all. Time after time, as we discuss these amendments, we are setting up local disputes of a serious nature, and any time the people involved in a local dispute get the feeling that it will be settled by the Secretary of State, that dispute will get worse and continue for longer.</p>

I have been trying to work out whether this part of the Bill puts the Homes and Communities Agency either in a privileged or disadvantaged position. For the life of me, I cannot decide which way round my judgment goes. In one sense, one should perhaps say the same thing about the statutory undertaker. If a statutory undertaker has a difficulty with the Homes and Communities Agency over a particular scheme, then, unlike the rest of the world where they would have to come to an accommodation, the statutory undertaker can come to the Secretary of State and say, &#147;Please, Minister, will you redraft our remit so that we can get over this difficulty?&#148;. That would put the statutory undertaker in a privileged position but it would put the Homes and Communities Agency at a disadvantage. The other side of that, of course, is that if there is a problem the Homes and Communities Agency can go to the statutory undertaker and say, &#147;Look, if you rewrite their powers then we can get over this difficulty&#148;. It is quite difficult. That is why I think this planning legislation has no business in here at all.</p>

<p><a name="08060493000022"></a><a name="80604-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08060493000038"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I beg to differ. The noble Lord&#146;s own party put this in place when it passed the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. I am sure regeneration issues were in the minds of the legislators at the time because it governed the relationship between the Urban Regeneration Agency&#151;English Partnerships&#151;and statutory undertakers. So I think the legislation is in the right place.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08060493000023"></a>I made the point that this was about ensuring that a solution is found where there are difficulties and a situation is not able to be resolved as one would expect. As we all know, during planning arrangements at a local level you expect the developer and the owner of the land to sensibly sit round a table and resolve these matters. But sometimes that is not possible, and this part of the Bill provides an element of certainty that the parties can make representations to the Secretary of State to modify the functions of a statutory undertaker so as to secure the provision of services, or to extend existing services, in relation to land. That is what the legislation is designed to do. The fact that it is not much used does not necessarily detract from its value because, as I said, it puts the onus on the statutory undertaker and developer to come to an agreement or a reasonable arrangement so that these essential services can be put in place.</p>

<p><a name="08060493000024"></a><a name="80604-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08060493000039"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> I do not know what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is going to say but I think that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, has just said that this creates a &#147;situation of privilege&#148;. If the statutory undertaker and the Homes and Communities Agency do not agree, there is a legal way out, but presumably that would not be possible for anyone else in the country. Would a change in the regulations which apply to a statutory undertaker dealing with the Homes and Communities Agency subsequently be available for the statutory undertaker to use elsewhere? That would be a fairly covert way of extending the remit. I go back to what I said: I think that it is inappropriate here.</p>

<p><a name="08060493000025"></a><a name="80604-gc0004.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08060493000040"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I think that the noble Lord needs to look at the matter in this way. Clearly, development issues are sensibly resolved through negotiation, and, in essence, that is all that this provision attempts to achieve. We are not seeking to put any additional draconian or excessive powers in place any more than was the case back in 1993. The arrangements appear to have worked very satisfactorily for English Partnerships and in the wider public interest, and that is what we are trying to achieve through this legislation. We are not seeking to do anything new; we are not seeking to achieve anything that has not already been put in place and achieved in terms of regeneration. This is probably a sensible provision which enables a lot of difficult situations to be sensibly resolved over time.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08060493000026"></a>It may be worth emphasising that these provisions apply only to land that the Homes and Communities Agency owns. I do not think that one can say that it privileges the agency in any respect; it is only in relation to its own land that these provisions work.</p>

This issue will not be resolved today; we shall have to go away and think about it. I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, has appeared, because yesterday he entertained us with stories of <I>Alice in Wonderland</I> and Lewis Carroll in relation to Otmoor. The more I think about it, the more I think that this is Alice in Wonderland territory. I had a vision of the Secretary of State as the Red Queen, but I thought that perhaps that was not fair and so would not pursue it.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08060493000028"></a>The Minister has just stated that this provision applies only to land owned by the Homes and Communities Agency. If the HCA wants to transfer land to a statutory undertaker, it can do so voluntarily, but if a compulsory purchase by the statutory undertaker can be done only if the HCA asks for it, then it is not required to be done in relation to its own land. However, unless I have totally misunderstood it, paragraph 18 gives powers to statutory undertakers to acquire land compulsorily. That seems extraordinary. I wonder whether this legislation is not rather old fashioned and outdated. Although Ministers keep telling us that it is based on the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, I suggest that the provisions in that Act have probably been rolled forward from earlier Acts and may go back as far as 1946.</p>

<p><a name="08060496000001"></a><a name="80604-gc0004.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0004.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08060496000060"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> Can I ask the noble Lord a question and make a point? I can see that he has become quite exercised by this. I have tried to explain to him in clear terms how minor issues that come up during development can sometimes be resolved through this process. It is not used greatly. I suggest that we write to the Committee, saying explicitly what the legislation does, how it replicates previous legislation and how that has worked, and giving some examples&#151;a worked example, if we can find one&#151;of how it will beneficially enable development to continue in an orderly process without treading on anyone&#146;s toes and causing general upset and mayhem. There is nothing sinister here. This is a benign piece of legislation, put there simply to ensure that development can move forward in an orderly way.</p>

In other words, it is not required. The Minister kept saying &#147;rarely used&#148;. I wonder if that is a euphemism for &#147;never used&#148;. I do not know. If that is the case, we do not need it. This is the point I was making previously about burial grounds: putting legislation on the statute book that is not required is bad practice and bad law, and we should not be doing it.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000003"></a>I suspect that when this legislation was first put on the statute book, the statutory undertakers were all nationalised industries or government bodies.</p>

That is my guess. Now the statutory undertakers are almost all private companies. Why should a private company that happens to supply water, electricity or gas&#151;and there might be several of them in an area competing with each other&#151;be in a privileged position, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, compared with other private companies? For example&#151;and I am sorry to talk about where I live&#151;Tesco is trying to get planning permission for a new supermarket in Colne, where I live. Without discussing that application, which we will have to resolve and determine tomorrow night, one of the things Tesco has problems with is that it does not own the land. The land is in several different parcels, and Tesco has requested the local authority to compulsorily purchase that land. That is the way a private company goes about trying to assemble land that it cannot assemble; it tries to persuade the local authority that it is a good idea and that authority will then compulsorily purchase it.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000006"></a>Why is it necessary to give compulsory purchase powers to private companies just because they happen to be providing people with electricity or with a tramway? Why can the compulsory purchase not be done in the normal way by a public authority, at whatever level? That is the fundamental question that lies beneath this.

There are some dangers. One is that you can cherry-pick between the various different predecessor Acts to find the bit that suits you best in the circumstances. The other danger is that modelling is modelling, not repeating. So far I have spotted at least two occasions, possibly three, where what is in this Bill is not the same. You could loosely describe it as modelled, but only with a stretch of the imagination. Such exchanges should be analytical, in the sense that they direct us. One such provision we had yesterday was Section 160 in the 1993 Act. It is completely different from what is in the Bill. Yes, it may be called modelled, but it is not the same.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000016"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 67, for the record I will say that I am speaking also to a number of my amendments, and that in the group are two government amendments and one from the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. They are Amendments Nos. 68, 68C, 69 and 70, government Amendment No. 71, my Amendment No. 71A, government Amendment No. 72, my Amendments Nos. 73 and 73A, Clause 13 stand part, Amendments Nos. 73B to 73F, Clause 14 stand part, and Amendments Nos. 116B and 117A. The provisions we have just been discussing may or may not be benign. I regard Clauses 13 and 14 as malign. That might be a little harsh, but not very.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000017"></a>I start by making clear that in our opposition to the provisions in these clauses these Benches are not anti-development. I do not want what we have to say to be read that way. Nor do I want what I have to say to be regarded as being particularly against eco-towns&#151;not that I intend to mention eco-towns, but they do seem to arise in this context. I am very concerned indeed about the proposed planning powers going to the Homes and Communities Agency.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000018"></a>I am surprised that the Conservatives&#146; amendment is relatively benign&#151;very benign, actually&#151;but we will no doubt hear from the noble Lord on that. At a meeting organised by a number of those concerned, which the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, attended, he commented on there being guidance about how these powers are to be exercised. I have to say that we are seeking a change in the &#147;what&#148;, not just assurances about the &#147;how&#148;.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000019"></a>I read these clauses as being anti-devolutionary, anti-democratic and something of a paradox. When they were debated in the Commons a lot of assurances were given about consulting local authorities before an order is made. Clause 13(5)(a) refers to consulting a local authority whose area is intended to be included in a proposed designated area, but if as much regard is to be paid to the local authority as we have been led to believe by the debate in the Commons, then, by definition, there should be no need for the clauses. If the consultation is going to take on board what a local authority has to say, why do we need provisions which allow an overriding of the local authority&#146;s position?</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000020"></a>In the debate in Committee in the Commons, the Minister, Iain Wright, referred to ensuring that local authorities are,</p>
<ul><a name="08060496000052"></a>&#147;stepping up to the plate&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC89"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08060496000042"></a>&#147;Doing what we say&#148; is the only thing that that can mean. He then referred to some local authorities needing &#147;help and support&#148; in facing the regeneration challenge. He also referred to,</p>
<ul><a name="08060496000053"></a>&#147;the skills agenda&#151;in ensuring that people have the required skills to step up to the plate and make sure that homes and regeneration development is carried out in their area&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Housing and Regeneration Bill Committee, 15/1/08; cols. 249-50.]</ul>
<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000021"></a>I find that curious language. The provisions are about taking away the powers that democratically elected local authorities have in the planning arena. If this is to be a mechanism to enable cross-boundary working, the clause is not necessary. I have heard it suggested that this would help local authorities to get together to deal with issues about land which crosses local authority boundaries, but in London the so-called Olympic boroughs got together and agreed how to take forward some very complicated applications without it. By all accounts, they have done so in an efficient and effective manner. Noble Lords have been declaring all kinds of interests and I shall declare that the mother of the wonderful young woman who was my PA at the London Assembly&#151;I miss her greatly&#151;led that process. The rather avuncular term is that it would allow us to help the authorities to work together, but it can be done without this provision.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000022"></a>Most of my amendments are in fundamental opposition to these provisions. However, within the group I have some which may be regarded as a tweaking. I would not be content with that but I include them in order to probe some particular points. The cross-boundary issue is dealt with in Amendments Nos. 67, 68 and 73. Amendment No. 68C deals with the terminology in condition 1 of the conditions that have to be met before the Secretary of State will make a designation order. Condition 1 is that it is &#147;appropriate&#148; for the HCA to be the local planning authority. What does &#147;appropriate&#148; mean in this context? It is a term which relates to a matter of judgment and some people will consider that something is &#147;appropriate&#148; depending on where they start from in their assessment of a situation. It is a difficult term.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000023"></a>Amendment No. 71A would take the plan-making function out of the &#147;permitted purposes&#148;. I came rather late to the realisation that it is intended that the HCA will have not just development control powers but plan-making powers, and that worries me greatly. As I said, local authorities are elected democratically; we are all familiar with how they operate.</p>

<p><a name="08060496000024"></a>On 15 January, the Minister talked about the HCA not riding roughshod over planning legislation but,</p>
<ul><a name="08060496000054"></a>&#147;operating within the local development framework&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Housing and Regeneration Bill Committee, 15/1/08; col. 252.]</ul>
<p><a name="08060496000043"></a>Whose framework would it be in this situation? If the HCA has the plan-making powers, it is the HCA&#146;s local development framework, not the relevant local authority&#146;s local development framework. I do not want to detain the Committee with an exposition of my views about how plan-making is central to the local government function, but it is. The Minister agrees and there are a lot of nods around the table.  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC90"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC90</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Therefore, I repeat: whose framework is this? I do not understand how it would operate if competing frameworks were developed by different organisations.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000025"></a>Amendment No. 73E talks about the HCA and the local authority acting concurrently. How that can happen is another puzzle for me. Amendment No. 73A provides that the Secretary of State can make an order only if no development plan is in force for the area. Amendment No. 73C, which relates to Clause 14, would require the HCA to comply with the development plan. Amendment No. 73B would leave out Clause 14(3)(b), which reads,</p>
<ul><a name="08060496000055"></a>&#147;subject to any specified modifications&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060496000044"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to probe what that means. It seems to mean that the Secretary of State, by order, can modify, and I assume that &#147;modify&#148; means &#147;extend&#148;. It would certainly change the functions which come from primary legislation with what I would regard as only the very flimsy protection of the parliamentary scrutiny of an order. I say &#147;flimsy&#148; because we all know that it is not possible to amend an order. Order-making procedures only allow for views to be stated, and it is very rare for there to be any change.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000026"></a>Amendment No. 73D is a matter of semantics but under Clause 14(4) an order can,</p>
<ul><a name="08060496000056"></a>&#147;make provision about the application of enactments&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060496000045"></a>I do not understand why we cannot just say &#147;apply&#148; them. If one makes provision about them, then that is something wider than simple, straight application. Therefore, I seek some clarification.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000027"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 73F is to say that if&#151;and I hope that this is never the case&#151;the HCA exercises functions as a local planning authority, the committee which exercises the functions must have a majority of members, not staff. I have taken that from the discussion that we had at an earlier sitting when the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, confirmed that English Partnerships has occasionally operated committees of which the majority, or even all, of the members have been staff.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000028"></a>Finally, Amendments Nos. 116B and 117A, although the procedure is flimsy, would turn the order from being subject to the negative procedure to one requiring an affirmative resolution. I have covered quite a lot of ground as quickly as I can. There are big matters of principle here, as well as a lot of detail. I hope that I have dealt with them adequately for this stage. I hope the Minister can satisfy me, but I would be very surprised if she did. We may well have to debate this issue at the next stage because it is fundamental. I beg to move.</p>

When I left university I started my working life in the planning department of a local authority, so I have huge respect and great affection for local authority planners. I enjoyed working there and I hope that, in relation to my tenure at English Partnerships, people would always say that our organisation treated with democratic and professional

I shall try to address some of the fundamental points that have been raised, because they are important points of principle.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000030"></a>I begin with skills. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said earlier that the planning system has been well developed since 1947, and of course it has, but it is a fact that we have a tremendous shortage of experienced and competent planners right across England and an acute shortage in certain parts of the country. I was flabbergasted some five or six years ago when I visited two or three boroughs not far from here, where I found that the whole development control function comprised of one or two postgraduates from Australia or New Zealand who were on a gap year. That was it; that was the whole professional cadre in two or three large boroughs. To say that we were short of experienced planners would be to somewhat understate the case. When Iain Wright in another place said that he was trying to do something about capacity he was not overstating the position. It is terribly important when we talk about very complex planning applications, or even straightforward development control, that the agency can help them if local authorities want that. I do not regard what the Minister in another place said as being glib or ill thought through. He very much reflected the seriousness of the current situation.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000031"></a>Equally, I do not believe that the solution suggested by the noble Baroness in terms of cross-boundary working is necessarily as straightforward as it might appear. Certainly in many parts of the country where the need is great for cross-boundary subregional, social and fixed infrastructure it is very important that we achieve close working. Sometimes that was simply not possible because of the different political complexions and views of authorities, or sometimes turf politics. That was difficult and in some situations we held up meaningful good-quality development for a long time. I do not necessarily accept that local authorities just all get together. I hope that I am correct in saying that for the five Olympic boroughs the planning authority is the Olympic Delivery Authority and not the individual boroughs. The Olympic Delivery Authority is a statutory body.</p>

<p><a name="08060496000032"></a><a name="80604-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08060496000071"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> Initially, it was a matter of the five boroughs working together. It is now, certainly, the ODA. Originally, there was a combination of the boroughs.</p>

I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, is not in his place, because he might have confirmed that the ODA&#146;s holding the ring has facilitated quick and sensible decisions around the Olympic park. However, those of us who are interested in the regeneration legacy of the Olympics are in despair at the way in which no one holding the ring for regeneration around the Olympic park seems to have held up progress and caused huge confusion. A statutory entity working closely with local authorities makes an enormous difference. If the ODA had not had that ability in legislation, it would not have been able to do that.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000034"></a>Only once in the past six years has English Partnerships used or relied on its own designation powers. That was in partnership with the excellent Liberal council in Milton Keynes&#151;I am not making a cheap point; that council has shown fabulous leadership on very difficult issues. For the area designated for new growth&#151;certainly not for the whole of Milton Keynes&#151;the powers were transferred from Milton Keynes council, with its full support, to a sub-committee of English Partnerships comprising three members of our board, one of whom was the accounting officer, three members from the local authority, four members from the local business community and one independent chair. It now sits as the planning authority for that growth area in Milton Keynes. We would not have been able to achieve the high-quality progress that has been made there, particularly in bringing in investment and putting in place the infrastructure that allows growth in Milton Keynes to be properly planned and of high quality, with all the facilities and services that characterise high growth, had we not been able to rely on those new-town planning powers for that area of designation.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000035"></a>It was never the intention of any Minister or Secretary of State with whom I was involved to rely on those powers, although siren voices would sometimes encourage them to do so. No Secretary of State with whom I was involved would countenance using planning powers in any other circumstance. The former Deputy Prime Minister was clear that only in Milton Keynes would that be done with the explicit consent and encouragement of the local authority. To have this provision in the Bill creates the conditions where, in a benign way, the agency can engage and create a different kind of planning capacity where it is needed for the reasons that I have suggested.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000036"></a>On the narrower but important point of the local development framework, the noble Baroness asked an important question about what happens when there are competing regimes. From my own experience, I anticipate the local development framework always taking precedence. Within that designated area, individual projects would have to be developed in absolute conformity with the local development framework, as is right and proper.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000037"></a>I rather suspect that I have not convinced the noble Baroness, but I wanted to give a few examples of where, in a benign way, the power has worked extremely well.</p>

<p><a name="08060496000038"></a><a name="80604-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08060496000073"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> My Amendment No. 70 is in this group. I shall come to it when I have risen to the fly so deftly flicked over my nose by the noble Baroness, who wondered why we were being fairly gentle with this part of the Bill. I should not have to remind the Committee that we spent an hour on the subject by way of an amendment right at the beginning of the Bill, where we tried to persuade the Government to insert at the beginning of Clause 2:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060496000050"></a>&#147;Working through the planning system and in partnership with local government and the other agencies already involved&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08060496000046"></a>If that were included, much of the concern about this section would diminish, and I still think that that is an appropriate way to deal with the matter.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000039"></a>I turn to my Amendment No. 70, which, as the noble Baroness said, is quite gentle. If the Bill were in  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC93"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the form that I would like it to be in, this issue would not cause so much concern. This is a probing amendment, so what I say will go slightly wider than the subject of the amendment. It deals with Clause 13(5), which states that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060496000051"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State must, before making a designation order, consult ... every local authority any part of whose area is intended to be included in the proposed designated area&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060496000047"></a>That is absolutely straightforward, but then, in what I consider to be peculiar wording, it goes on to say,</p>
<ul><a name="08060496000057"></a>&#147;any person, other than a local authority, who is the local planning authority for the proposed designated area or any part of&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060496000048"></a>For the life of me, I cannot make sense of that bit of English. I am not aware that any person can be a planning authority but that seems to be implied by the way in which that paragraph is written. That little bit of flawed English language is quite important. I think that the paragraph should say, &#147;any person other than the local authority who has an objection to the proposal&#148;. The real purpose of my amendment is to ensure that, having consulted these people, the Secretary of State is obliged to publish the conclusions that he or she has come to as a result of the consultation. That may be intended but it is not written in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08060496000040"></a>I agree with what the noble Baroness said about the powers that are there, but my experience&#151;although experience may not be the right word&#151;goes back to the London Docklands Development Corporation, which I have already mentioned. There were five separate local authorities and wonderful people were involved but they were not prepared to co-operate and work together. Something had to be done because nothing was happening, and therefore the right conclusion was made. With the greatest deference to the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, I think that Milton Keynes is a slightly different example. Once the principle of a new town was accepted, there was a large degree of agreement, and the co-operative working which went on there achieved a very successful&#151;&#147;miraculous&#148; may be going too far&#151;operation.</p>

She was talking about the appalling problem of planner availability. From my admittedly limited knowledge, anyone who is any good as a planner almost invariably switches to the private sector very quickly because the pay is better.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080604107000002"></a>Perhaps the tragedy of the situation is that, when dealing with very big applications, local authorities have not become accustomed to using planning consultancies but have relied on their own resources. I accept that this is always difficult for local authorities, which, particularly in the planning field, prefer to have matters under their own control. However, if they are dealing with a complex negotiation over a major development for a large number of houses and the Section 106 situation is very complex, then perhaps getting outside advice, although it may be distasteful, is better than having inadequate advice. I merely make the point.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080604107000003"></a>I hope that the Minister agrees that what we are saying about subsection (5) is worth while. It would not alter the substance of the Bill but it would give people a lot of assurance if the provision were included in that part. They would know what was going on in her mind, despite the warning that was given last night by my noble friend Lord Brooke.</p>

<p><a name="080604107000004"></a><a name="80604-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="080604107000023"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> If your market share is falling, you are likely to move to the area where the market share is increasing. Over the past 10 years&#151;I am not taking into account the increase in the number of dwellings from about 20.5 million to 22 million&#151;the private sector market share has risen from 78.7 to 82.5 per cent. That is slightly out of date, but it starts in 1997 and the latest figures include 2006. The local government and social sectors have fallen from 21.3 to 17.5 per cent of the total. That is a clear inducement for people who are involved in a related profession to make a move. To have a completely different set of planning authority powers within the two sectors is quite risky.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080604107000005"></a>I remind the Committee of the Teesside Development Corporation&#151;not quite Milton Keynes. The development corporation was made a planning department, although not by this Administration. It was successful in the sense that it was accepted, broadly speaking, by Stockton-on-Tees and Thornaby-on-Tees. I am sure the Minister knows the story of the Teesside Development Corporation. It was never accepted by Middlesbrough. I do not want to go into the rights and wrongs of whether it should have been accepted or whether Middlesbrough was right not to accept it. All I can say is that the local bad feeling, disruption and confusion that followed from the failed relationship between the corporation and Middlesbrough were something that you did not want to watch. Immediately after the present Administration came in, not only was the corporation coming to the end of its life because there was a sunset clause in the original legislation, but there was a serious row, an investigation and goodness knows what.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080604107000006"></a>The more that we put back into the hands of the Secretary of State, the more likely it is that we will get disputes at local level and people will simply block each other. If everything could be benign, which I think was what the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, said, and if agreement could always be reached, that would be wonderful. I am afraid, however, that the history of some of these matters shows that when people locally understand the powers that the Bill confers upon the Secretary of State, they will find it difficult to remain benign.</p>

<p><a name="080604107000012"></a>I thought to myself, &#147;Development of what?&#148;. The presumption is that it is housing and related matters, but it raises the question of whether there are any other circumstances that the Minister can foresee under which the power could be exercised other than

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080604107000008"></a>The second point is that the clause links back to yesterday&#146;s debate on Amendment No. 51. When the Minister responded to the bit about eco-towns, she gave us some comfort. She said,</p>
<ul><a name="080604107000020"></a>&#147;there is no way in which the Homes and Communities Agency will achieve its very ambitious, necessary targets if it does not work in partnership with local authorities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080604107000013"></a>She then went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080604107000016"></a>&#147;The words of the amendment that: the HCA will, &#145;consult with, and have regard to the views of, the local authorities&#146;, go without saying&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080604107000014"></a>That was all excellent. Then the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, intervened and, at the end of his intervention, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080604107000017"></a>&#147;Two local authorities have stated their position, reflecting the wishes of the people in their community. Does that count for anything in the Minister&#146;s thinking?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080604107000015"></a>Of course, he was referring to the site at Long Marston and the two district councils, Stratford-on-Avon and Wychavon, which voted unanimously against the planning approval for the eco-plan. His question was, &#147;Does that count for anything?&#148;. The Minister replied:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080604107000018"></a>&#147;On the other point, of course local involvement counts. All the responses that we get from local authorities will be taken seriously. They are an important part of the debate, an important signifier, and will be taken into account. On the question of whether there will be eco-towns, we have said that there will be five by 2016 and up to 10 by 2010. That is where the policy sits&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/6/08; cols.

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080604107000009"></a>I pricked up my ears when I heard that. I wondered whether under this clause&#151;once we have gone through the democratic process, with the two authorities saying that they did not think it appropriate to have an eco-town on that particular site&#151;that is where the matter would end. Presumably the developer can go to appeal&#151;that would be one process&#151;or, secondly, presumably the Secretary of State can designate that as an area for development. Is that not the case? I wanted clarification on that. I have picked up the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, when she said that the decision of local authorities could be overridden by Clause 13.</p>

<p><a name="080604107000010"></a><a name="80604-gc0005.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0005.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="080604107000025"></a>Baroness Ford:</b> I shall just make a few comments to follow on from the interesting point raised by the noble Viscount. He is absolutely right in the example that he gives, but I should like to suggest a couple of things. I explained that there was one example when the powers were used in Milton Keynes, but there were at least three other examples when Secretaries of State were encouraged by other people to oblige English Partnerships. There were three other new towns in England in which the record on affordable and social housing was absolutely abysmal. These authorities had failed signally to meet the targets that were agreed and various policy planning guidance.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080604107000011"></a>It seems rather peculiar that, in almost every aspect of public service, if a local authority signally fails to meet its obligations, central government invariably

I am not suggesting that we should be that aggressive about it but I find it quite puzzling that the Government have to account for their performance in providing housing for young families and people who cannot ordinarily afford market housing and yet local authorities do not seem to have to account for that. I would not want noble Lords to think that I was being nave or starry-eyed in suggesting that this power might be used benignly; I was simply relating my own experience. In other circumstances in which Secretaries of State might have been entitled to take a more aggressive view, they simply declined out of respect for the local democratic process in cases in which that process was massively failing local communities.</p>

<p><a name="080604110000003"></a>Yesterday I tabled an amendment&#151;from memory, I think it was Amendment No. 51D&#151;but it was in the wrong place and so I ignored it. Essentially it was the same as my noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 73C, which seeks that the actions of the HCA should be within the development plan. I said the local development framework but, in practice, it is the whole development plan. This is a crucial issue which ties in with the suggestion that in areas where there have been designation orders the HCA should be not only the development control authority but also the plan-making authority. This is bound to lead to fears that the existing development plan will simply be swept aside and a new one put in place. This will clearly take some time but, nevertheless, it will be done by riding roughshod over all possible local democratic views. Most places will have different views anyway but, nevertheless, it will be riding roughshod over them.</p>

<p><a name="080604110000004"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, referred to eco-towns. These are lurking as an ongoing issue while we are debating the Bill but they do not appear in it. However, it is not clear&#151;perhaps the Minister will provide some elucidation&#151;how far the Homes and Communities Agency is expected to take part in producing the five eco-towns and then the 10 eco-towns&#151;or however many are produced&#151;by 2020. Will the eco-towns be a central function and a central policy objective of the Homes and Communities Agency; or will it be involved in some of them and not in others; or will it not be involved in any of them? If the HCA is going to be the main driving organisation behind the eco-towns in all cases, it will result in a great increase in that area of activity on a par with the first and second waves of new towns. That is something that we have not seen recently.</p>

<p><a name="080604110000005"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Ford, made some interesting comments. She mentioned Milton Keynes and praised the Liberal council there. She can praise Liberal councils as much as she likes&#151;I do not mind&#151;but the point about Milton Keynes is that the development there was carried out by agreement; it was not imposed. This is fundamental to the eco-towns argument. It is not clear how much of the new legislation in the Bill will be used for eco-towns,  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC97"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>how much will be done through the forthcoming Planning Bill and the new Infrastructure Planning Commission, or whether it will be a combination of both. It would be interesting if, either now or at some point, the Minister could tell us exactly how the eco-towns are going to work. I have read the debates in the House of Commons and elsewhere about eco-towns: there is a great deal of discussion about whether they are a good or a bad thing but there is less discussion about how they will come about.</p>

<p><a name="080604110000006"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Ford, made the interesting and basic comment that there is a shortage of experienced planners, which there is. I sit on an authority which constantly trains development control officers. They then move on to bigger authorities which pay more money or to the private sector and we have to train up more. That is the only way that we can possibly keep an establishment of development control officers in the authority. This is a basic issue. Saying that the really good planners should go and work for the HCA and concentrate on the parts of the country that the Government think are important is not an answer to the problem of not enough planners. The answer to that problem is to train more planners and perhaps pay them more.</p>

<p><a name="080604110000007"></a><a name="80604-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080604110000097"></a>Baroness Ford:</b> The point that I was trying to make, although I may have failed, was not just about the quantum of planners, it was the fact that, having started life as a planner, I know that sometimes very complicated schemes come your way once every 10 or 15 years. For those more complex and special schemes it is sensible to concentrate scarce skills in a single agency that is able to help local authorities. We both agree on the overall quantum of planners, but my point about specialist schemes may be more compelling.</p>

<p><a name="080604110000008"></a><a name="80604-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080604110000098"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I understand that perfectly fair point. It is equally fair to say that if a local authority is to get an eco-town or another new development of that scale, it is not a one-off that comes and goes, it will be there for a considerable number of years and the answer is to staff that local authority properly with the skilled people required in those circumstances. There is no dispute about that.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000009"></a>Some of the rest of what the noble Baroness said related simply to the conflict between local democracy and involvement and how far national objectives should be imposed on local communities. That debate will go on and on, but there is something of a clash if the answer is imposition of national decisions, when we have a Government who constantly tell us how they are in favour of devolution of policy-making and everything else to local government and strengthening local government and local democracy. The Government have to decide which side of this argument they are on. It is clearly not an absolute matter and it never can be, but many of us would say that the balance has shifted to the centre so much in the past 35 years that if the Government are serious about shifting power back to the local level, they cannot keep saying &#147;Yes, but it does not apply here and there&#148;. We will continue to have that argument on Bill after Bill and in debate after debate.</p>

<p><a name="080604110000010"></a>Finally, this feels a bit like old-fashioned legislation. When the original generation of new towns was planned in the 1940s and the 1950s, the planning system by modern standards was rudimentary. There was very little planning structure in place and development control tended to be a fairly simple, hit-and-miss affair. Slowly, over the years, development control has become much more complex. For example, in the 1950s many planning decisions were made with no conditions at all. They were simply passed. Now even decisions on quite straightforward applications for kitchen extensions and so on will have a page of conditions attached, while decisions on complicated applications will have page after page of conditions.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000011"></a>Linked to that is the development of plans. Town maps developed in the 1960s and plans for the use of land within towns became common, but outside towns there was little other than the national parks, the AONBs and the green belt around London. That should be compared with the detailed plans we have now and the complex planning policy statements. We have PPGs issued at national level; regional spatial strategies are being put together and agreed; we have county structure plans which refer to parts which have been saved and included in the RSSs and so on; we have local plans which are of themselves detailed and complex; and we have the process of local development frameworks, which perhaps is using up all the planners who the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, talked about, who are not available for development control. It is a complex and intricate system. The question that has to be asked is: how does an old-fashioned, top-down approach to taking over an area and developing it fit in to the modern system? If the modern system cannot cope with these sorts of developments, is there not something fundamentally wrong with it? I return to what I said on another amendment: some of this seems like old-fashioned legislation.</p>

Could the noble Baroness be clear about what weight will be given to local authorities&#146; views on this? After all, this is not a nimby issue. This is not a few people with nice houses who do not want a development near them; this is the result of extensive consultation. It has been the main story on the front page of all local newspapers for two or three months. Local authorities have debated the matter at length.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000013"></a>On local elections, I have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that Stratford-on-Avon was one of the few councils that threw out some Conservatives and elected some Liberal Democrat members. This goes across parties&#151;Conservative, Liberal Democrats, Labour&#151;and I think there is even a Green on the Stratford-on-Avon District Council. So the decision is consensual and agreed unanimously, as I said yesterday, by the local council. I know Stratford; I do not know what the complexion of the Wychavon District Council is, but it too has come out unanimously against proposals, as have both Members of Parliament who are involved in this.</p>

<p><a name="080604110000014"></a>What will the process be? Will those expressions of public opinion and the responsibilities of local authorities to their electors be ignored, in the sense of, &#147;Yes, we listen to what you say; we hear what you say, but actually you are going to get the medicine anyway, whether or not you like it&#148;? Is that what is going to happen with eco-towns?</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000015"></a>Currently 15 sites are shortlisted. I take it from the response we received yesterday that in the end 10 will be chosen&#151;five and then probably another five&#151;which means that the chances are two to one of getting one. I cannot speak for all of them, but two or three local authorities have come out very strongly against the proposal to have an eco-town. How will the Government deal with this very strong democratic feeling that local authorities do not want eco-towns? Will they be imposed on them? That is the question my noble friend asked. It will be an important answer for people involved in this argument. The consultation period ends on 30 June, so there is not much time for further debate. Therefore, a strongly indicative answer now would be of great help before the next stage of the debate.</p>

I shall try my very best to feel my way through and make as clear as I possibly can some of the principles, the nature of the evidence that we are dealing with and the historic powers that we are taking forward, and to try to reassure noble Lords, especially the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, who seems to very concerned about the nature of the powers we are taking. I am very anxious that she understands not only how proportionate and important they are, but also how well they are grounded in evidence, participation, consultation and negotiation of partnership.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000017"></a>Before I get on to that, I will deal with eco-towns. I completely understand the seriousness with which the issues are raised. We had a major debate on this yesterday. I cannot make myself much clearer than I did then, except to say to the noble Lord that the discussions on eco-towns have reached a preliminary stage. All views will be taken into consideration&#151;certainly the views of local authorities, which are very important. Alongside the consultation which is going on at the moment into the eco-town choices and the 15 sites, we are consulting separately on a sustainability appraisal and a planning policy statement.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000018"></a>I am conscious of the concerns that have been raised by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, and I offer noble Lords a meeting with officials to take them through the process which will surround and contain the planning of eco-towns. Yesterday I said that it would not run alongside or be a separate part of any other process&#151;that it is a planning process. The final decision will rest in the context of a planning application which will be open to every form of democratic representation, should the site about which the noble Earl is concerned get that far. It is a planning process that we are talking about.</p>

However, there is an issue to be addressed here and I will organise a meeting for noble Lords to be taken through the process by the relevant officials quite separately from any other considerations they may have about the local situation. I hope that they will take advantage of that offer.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000020"></a>Let me deal with the specific issues raised by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart. When we talk about development in this context we are not simply talking about housing but about the ordinary meaning of development, which includes infrastructure and everything else contained in community development. </p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000021"></a>On the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, the term &#147;person&#148; in its legal definition means, for example, the things we cannot encompass simply by talking about local authorities. It involves the Broads Authority or the National Park Authority, for example. I hope that clarifies those specific points.</p>

<p><a name="080604110000022"></a><a name="80604-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80604-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="080604110000101"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> I take it then that ordinary people are not involved in the consultations at all. Under that definition, if any &#147;person&#148; is not a person but some other body, that avoids individuals.</p>

I think it means the collective person. I shall write to the noble Lord in case there is a bit of a loophole.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000024"></a>I turn now not only to the substance of Clause 13 but to the range of amendments which have been tabled, particularly by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. I shall do this in the following way. Buried in the range of amendments is an indication that noble Lords are going to oppose Clause 13 standing part of the Bill, so perhaps I may continue as if this were a clause stand part debate, relate to the amendments as briefly as I can&#151;although they raise important issues&#151;and give my responses in that way. I hope I can do it justice.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000025"></a>It is extremely important that we are as proportionate and collective as we can be. I am grateful for the way in which my noble friend Lady Ford described how this power, which we have inherited from previous legislation, has been used exceptionally in the past. When she was referring to the Milton Keynes partnership, she was talking not about the construction of Milton Keynes as a new town but about the partnership that we have put in place to take further the next stages of growth in the south-east in the context of Milton Keynes. It is a very specific partnership.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000026"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, raised a series of issues about the politics of partnerships and the inability sometimes of local authorities to address serious issues because they are incapable of doing so. Again, the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, drew on her experience.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000027"></a>When we look at the very rare occasions on which we might use the powers of designation, this is an option that will already have been rejected by the Government, for the reasons my noble friend gave, because there are other vehicles and other opportunities.  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC101"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>As we look across the growth areas in the greater south-east where we hope to achieve our ambitions for many more houses, because that is where we need them and where the affordability gap is greatest, we are looking at partnerships between local authorities&#151;for example, in Corby in Northamptonshire&#151;at partnerships that are UDCs and are appropriate for what is necessary; and at cross-border bilateral partnerships. Those are all perfectly sufficient for what they have to do. None of them raises issues of designation. That underlines the exceptional nature of what it is we are allowing for.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000028"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said that he wanted to frame his response in the context of the issues he raised around Amendment No. 51D, which we addressed yesterday, and he is right to do so. At the heart of these many different amendments is the respect that we pay to local authorities. That issue is extremely important, and we have had an interesting and positive debate about it.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, is not in his place, but everything I want to say is about the essential nature of partnership in what we are delivering, and the designation power is not an exception to that. That itself constitutes a partnership; it is not an imposition. When it was agreed in Milton Keynes that this was the right and necessary way forward, it was done in partnership, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has pointed out. It was not an imposition. That is how it would be conducted. How could we possibly go forward with some of these major challenges if all we had at our disposal were a power to impose? It would not work. That is the most important thing I want to say.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000030"></a>We need to retain the option of using this power in case we are faced with circumstances in the future that mean this is the only way forward. I shall come on to the amendment that talks about &#147;necessary&#148; and &#147;appropriate&#148; in that context. Why would it be such a case? As I say, it is certainly not a question of taking powers away. If you look at where we are working in the growth areas, over 70 local authorities have volunteered to work with us on growth in the first round of the new growth points bidding. We are working now in partnership in different ways with 200 local authorities, half of all the local authorities in the country. Nearly all the major towns and cities are working with us on the growth agenda. They know that we cultivate partnership, and that is how we are going forward. They have the experience, but often they do not have capacity. That is where the point about skills comes in. Of course it is a question of growing more skills. Our planning departments and universities are doing their best. We are putting bursaries in and trying to create a cross-disciplinary flow of people to come into the profession. It is opening up in different ways.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000031"></a>We are faced with local authorities that do not have the capacity and yet need it. We had a graphic example of that. They come to our department and say, &#147;Give us more help with this&#148;. This is the ultimate way in which we would say, &#147;Okay, if this is the only way forward. We have a big challenge here. We need 5,000 or 10,000 houses, or whatever it is, and we need to build that community&#148;. That is the sort of discourse we have.</p>

I do not think there are any circumstances in which that could, or would, happen. However, with our collective experience, with my experience as a Planning Minister for three years and that of my noble friend Lady Ford for much longer than that, we know that it is in these circumstances that we have to think, &#147;How can we best help this local authority, or perhaps this group of local authorities and other agencies, deliver what is necessary?&#148;. That is the option.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000034"></a>It is true that the Bill talks about designation in terms of development control, but it talks also, in Clause 14, about taking on some planning powers and maintaining the local development framework. I stress that taking on the plan-making function would occur in circumstances that would be even more exceptional, because the HCA is not set up to do that&#151;it has neither the resources nor the will. It would be a major distraction from its main responsibilities. The plan-making function would be conferred only when it was considered to be absolutely vital to delivery and where the development plan was so out of date that it could not deliver what was needed. It would be imperative because the plan-making function was not in place and the authority could not fulfil its responsibilities. That is all I shall say in relation to Clause 14.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000035"></a>In each case, the type of planning powers that would be needed would have to be determined case by case. In some cases, all the powers would be required; in others, it would be only part of them. The decision about what powers were needed would rest always with the Secretary of State. That decision would be negotiated with the local authority, which would give its view on what was necessary to take forward the development. Designation and planning powers will not simply be imposed whenever there are decisions to be made, even in the case of large-scale developments. It will be about bringing many more skills and assets to the challenge.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000036"></a>Perhaps I may address the amendments in that context. I do not think that I need address Amendments Nos. 67, 68 and 69 in great detail, because everything that I have said about working with the local authority has made it clear that it would be contradictory to substitute the local authority for the Secretary of State. We are looking at exceptional circumstances that could be dealt with only by the Secretary of State. As I have explained, that would be on the basis of consultation. Not least of the consequences of removing the Secretary of State from the frame would be the removal also of parliamentary control. The noble Baroness may think that parliamentary control is not very strong&#151;we will discuss that in the context of the

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000037"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s Amendment No. 68C goes to the heart of the question when the Secretary of State might get involved and the choices that would need to be made. It looks like an arcane legal point, but it is not. The noble Baroness argued that if we were to replace &#147;appropriate&#148; with &#147;necessary&#148;, it would have little practical effect but give tremendous comfort to local authorities. However, it would not give comfort to anyone. It would be unlikely to make any difference to the number of occasions when the Secretary of State designated an area, but it has the potential to introduce much delay, uncertainty and unnecessary expense into the designation order-making procedure.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000038"></a>The general dictionary definition of &#147;appropriate&#148; is &#147;suitable&#148; or &#147;fitting&#148; for a particular purpose. &#147;Necessary&#148; is defined as &#147;essential&#148;, &#147;indispensable&#148; or &#147;requisite&#148;. There is therefore a major difference. Our learned judges would need to be convinced that the HCA was following the only route available in fulfilling its responsibility. I see the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, nodding. As a lawyer, she will know that that high test would give great comfort to her profession, but not to anybody else. We need to maintain the term &#147;appropriate&#148; for all those reasons.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000039"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 70 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. I appreciate the context in which he raised this matter but, because any designation order would have to be made on the basis of consultation, there is absolutely no way that the Secretary of State would fail to give reasons. The consultation procedures set out in the Cabinet Office&#146;s code of practice would apply and with those would come a requirement to give initial feedback regarding any responses received. That feedback would have to show how the consultation process had influenced the policy. There would be a series of questions to which summaries would have to be provided, and therefore, for the noble Lord&#146;s purposes, the process would be extremely transparent. The reasons would be given on a case-by-case basis and would have to be specific and local to the situation. I hope that the noble Lord will be satisfied with that.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000040"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 73. The Secretary of State may make an order only with the consent of the local planning authority responsible. This is part of the larger debate that we have had about how effective this consultation would be. The Secretary of State would need to have this residual power to make a decision on designation in exceptional circumstances, but it would follow consultation. However, if we were to accept the amendment, we would again have a contradiction in terms. Effectively, the local authorities would have a veto, and that would not make sense in terms of what we need to be able to provide and do.</p>

<p><a name="080604110000041"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 73A in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and Amendment No. 73E in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, concerning the development plan in force. The noble Baroness has been arguing that it is only in areas that do not have a development plan that conferring

The problem is that there would be rare cases where, having considered the issue and consulted, we would feel that regeneration was such an important issue and such a challenge that we would have to confer certain planning powers on the HCA. In those rare cases, local authorities might lose some of their planning functions. However, the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would prevent the Secretary of State ever designating any area, because there is no part of the country without a development plan in place, even though it may be an old or saved plan.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000042"></a>I would be the first to agree that local development frameworks have been slow in coming on stream. They were probably a greater challenge than we anticipated at the time because of the notion of spatial planning and so on. They have been a big cultural change for local authorities. Nevertheless, plans are in place and the amendment would mean that we could never designate anything.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000043"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 73C, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred to an earlier amendment in his name that we did not debate. The development plan is certainly the starting point but, as the noble Lord knows only too well, it is also possible for proposals which are not in accordance with an area&#146;s plan to be granted planning permission. This amendment does not make allowance for the assessment of any other material considerations. I know that he raised the amendment to provide an opportunity to debate the issue, but it would have a rather catastrophic effect. I am going as fast and, I hope, as coherently as I can through this long list.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000044"></a>Amendment No. 71A covers the plan-making function, and I shall address the point that this is an extension of the powers that could be conferred on the predecessor bodies. The plain fact of the matter is that the inclusion of the plan-making role reflects the legislation in force today. The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act, which established the LDFs, put greater emphasis on development needs. We have said that this power will be used very rarely.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000045"></a>In a case where, for example, local development plans are out of date or inadequate and the agency wishes to take them forward, we need to have this power to confer this on the agency. UDCs only have development control functions. The problem that has been diagnosed is that they have encountered difficulties in working with a local plan which, for some reason, is not up to the task of delivering regeneration. We will overcome that with these powers because they will be able to have these additional plans as and when needed.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000046"></a>The clause gives the Secretary of State a necessary degree of flexibility when deciding which planning functions should be conferred on the new agency. The noble Baroness was arguing about modifications in this context. The amendment would restrict the range of planning powers that could be made available. The point is that whenever these were to be considered, they would be open to full consultation with the local authority about what was necessary. That clearly would be a very important point.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC105"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column GC105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000047"></a>Amendment No. 73B raises a specific issue. It removes the ability of the Secretary of State to make modifications to the functions or specified functions conferred via a designation order. There may be a misapprehension at the heart of this. We do not want the agency&#146;s resources to be used on every minor household application that might come forward. I say to the noble Lord who raised the issue of the volume of household applications that we are looking at streamlining the households&#146; consent system. I suspect that we will have some fun with that on the Planning Bill. We want the agency to be focused on the complex project at the heart of the designation decision, so we need to be able to modify the role the HCA undertakes. It does not mean that the HCA is somehow exempted from requirements. I hope that will satisfy the noble Baroness on that point.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000048"></a>Amendment No. 73E would prevent the HCA having local planning authority functions concurrently with another body. We need that because it is based on real experience where UDCs have been given powers over development control. They have adopted practical arrangements with existing local planning authorities so that they can consider the minor planning functions. UDCs can then concentrate on the larger scale regeneration projects while the planning authorities continue to deal with the more routine planning problems. That is simply a question of good practice and common sense.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000049"></a>In Amendment No. 73F the noble Baroness asks us to insert:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080604110000089"></a>&#147;The HCA&#146;s functions as a local planning authority shall not be exercisable by a committee or sub-committee of whom the majority present at the meeting at which the relevant function is exercised are staff of the HCA&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080604110000088"></a>That reflects some of her concerns on an earlier part of the Bill. The intent is that the HCA staff are not judge and jury in respect of development proposals. There is an issue of democratic accountability because they are not elected members.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000050"></a>I should say that the planning regime is a regime based on openness and transparency and that the HCA will be bound by it. There are clear statutory procedures for development control, for the preparation and maintenance of documents and involving community. We expect the HCA board to establish suitable arrangements for committees to accommodate instances where, for example, there might be conflicts of interest. As I replied previously on HCA issues, we think that it is perfectly manageable.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000051"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s final amendments were on the substitution of an affirmative order for a negative order. We expect these powers to be used so exceptionally that we think the negative procedure is sufficient, and we will have very rare opportunity to use it.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000052"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 71 and 72 are related. Amendment No. 71 is consequential on Amendment No. 72. Amendment No. 72 would remove the reference to the Planning Act 2008. This requires the insertion of the word &#147;and&#148; at the end of line 14 to ensure that there is no ambiguity over the definition of permitted purposes. The two amendments achieve that. That must be, surely, the simplest amendment in this long

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000053"></a>I am grateful for the opportunity to have the debate and for the patience of the Committee as I have responded at speed to those various amendments. I reiterate what I said at the beginning: these are very exceptional powers that will be part of a process involving local authorities, respecting their situation and attempting to work with them in every regard to provide them with the powers that they need, as well to achieve what for so many is a major challenge, up and down the country, putting in place a sort of community development, which we so badly need, to close the gap on affordability and provide homes for families and individuals.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000055"></a>I am very grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken. They have given me a great deal of material to take away and think about. I cannot find the fishing metaphor to respond to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. He cited Docklands, as he has done on previous occasions, in support of the need for a mechanism to bring local authorities together. That had an ad hoc UDC specifically for it; that is different from the provisions here, which are more far-reaching.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000056"></a>I am especially grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Ford. I am so pleased that she is playing such a big part in this Bill, because everything she says is so thoughtful. That sounds so patronising, but I do not mean it that way. It certainly makes me much more confident in the integrity of the processes as they have been put into effect, which is not going to stop me questioning whether the powers are right, but it has been hugely helpful.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000057"></a>On the skills matter and the shortage of planners, as my noble friend said, we all accept that. However, that does not lead me to the conclusion that powers should be transferred. It should be about making expertise available. I had not read Iain Wright&#146;s comments in that light, perhaps because I had not picked up something that had gone before. It is not just numbers; it is expertise in dealing with difficult situations. I do not think that the way to deal with it is by making a constitutional change, if I can put it that way, because we are talking about democratic decisions. In the same way, that is the answer to a point that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, made or intended to make about local planning authorities having a shortage and having to go to consultants. The problem is not one which for us leads to this solution.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000058"></a>On the cross-boundary issues and the whole issue of how one brings powers such as this into implementation, the point is that Milton Keynes was under a voluntary arrangement. The fact that the then Deputy Prime Minister vetoed other possible similar uses of the powers of English Partnerships leads me to the conclusion that we should continue

In a similar way, almost the last point made by the Minister about the negative resolution being sufficient, because the situation is rare, is an even greater argument for an affirmative resolution.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000059"></a>She talked a lot about designation being an aspect of partnership. It is clear to me that we will have to come back to quite a lot of this on Report to talk about how that partnership comes about. One aspect of partnership is the concurrent functions mentioned in Clause 14(5)(a). Can the noble Baroness write to me to explain the detail of those? I am not sure whether she was saying that they refer to different subsets and aspects of a planning application&#151;for instance, materials and reserved matters&#151;as opposed to those that follow the main application. Would those be handed back to the local planning authority? The noble Baroness, Lady Ford, had a similar problem with that notion and it would be helpful to understand in more detail just how that would operate.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000060"></a>Finally, the Minister was absolutely right in her analysis of the words &#147;necessary&#148; and &#147;appropriate&#148;&#151;that was precisely what I aimed for in the amendment. This has been an immensely interesting debate and I apologise to the Committee that it has been long-winded. No, it was not long-winded; it has just been long. I have already started to draft amendments for Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080604110000064"></a>The noble Lord said: As it stands, Clause 13 on designation orders covers two areas&#151;planning functions, which we have been discussing for the past hour and a half, and highways functions. My purpose is to take out all reference to highways functions and to remove Clauses 15, 16 and 17.</p>

<a name="80604-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080604110000065"></a>These highways functions are the adoption of private streets and appeals against them, and traffic regulation orders on private streets. It is not clear at all why the HCA should have such powers, even in a designated area. Highways authorities have expertise in these matters. They employ staff who know about them and can happily deal with them, even if the HCA has some or all of the planning functions for the designated areas. Putting these functions in the hands of the HCA would result in it taking on extra staff to duplicate what the highways authorities do already. That seems to be very inefficient. If all this is to take place in the spirit of partnership and co-operation, it is not clear at all why the highways authority cannot do in designated areas what it would do in any other areas. The purpose of my amendment is to find out why the Government feel it is necessary to give these extra powers to the HCA.</p>

Many small authorities and county councils would have devolved this kind of issue to urban districts and so on and the situation might have been complex and messy. That is not the case now. We are talking about quite large authorities&#151;which grow larger by the year as the Government slowly reorganises into bigger authorities&#151;which are either large counties, large boroughs or unitary authorities and which have plenty of expertise and specialist staff for dealing with this kind of thing. It is not right to encourage the HCA to set up new departments with new staff and to do it itself. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, referred to Amendment No. 70 as being benign; I suggest, for a particular reason, that the intention of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, to eliminate Clause 15 from the Bill might be described as malign. I regard Clause 15 as the Lord Beaumont of Whitley memorial clause. He was a very distant cousin of mine. I cannot refer to him as either my late noble kinsman or my late noble relative because in my maiden speech I said that that was how I was going to describe my late noble father and my late noble mother.

The anomaly in the Bill has been inherited from the powers of the current bodies, which reinforces the point made earlier by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles. We consulted on the basis that the HCA would have powers no less wide than those of its predecessor bodies. To secure that, we modelled many of the provisions in the Bill on the legislation that framed the Urban Regeneration Agency, the Commission for the New Towns and the Housing Corporation. The condition to which the amendment refers was modelled on the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. I agree with the noble Lord that, given the exceptional circumstances under which the designation powers are likely to be considered, Condition 2 seems

<a name="08060477000006"></a><a name="80604-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80604-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08060477000036"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (James Plaskitt) has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08060477000007"></a>The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council will be held on 9 June in Luxembourg. The UK will be represented by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (John Hutton). Health and consumer affairs issues are being taken on 10 June.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08060477000008"></a>The presidency hopes to reach agreement on an amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the council amending directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time (9554/05, formerly 12683/04). UK priorities remain a solution to the problems caused by the ECJ<I></I>SIMAP and<I></I>Jaeger judgments and the retention of a workable individual right to opt out of the 48-hour maximum working week. The UK is still analysing the proposal from the presidency, but believes that it is a further step forward in that it provides further legal clarity on the use of the opt-out and the solution to the issues raised by the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08060477000009"></a>The draft directive of the European Parliament and the council on working conditions for temporary workers (15098/02 (24066)) is also on the agenda. The UK has twin objectives in relation to this directive: flexibility for employers and fairness for workers. The UK has been seeking a directive that gives people a fair deal at work without putting their jobs at risk or cutting off a valuable route into employment. With these goals in mind, the UK Government welcomed the recent agreement between the CBI and TUC on how fairer treatment for agency workers in the UK should be promoted. The UK Government will seek agreement on the terms of the directive that will enable this agreement to be brought into legal effect in the UK.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08060477000010"></a>The council will seek the adoption of conclusions on the Commission recommendation to enhance administrative co-operation in the context of the posting of workers. These relate to measures to improve the implementation of the posting of workers directive through enhanced administrative co-operation and exchange of information between member states and to set up a committee to identify and exchange experience and good practice. The UK supports the recommendation.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08060477000011"></a>The council will also seek adoption of conclusions on anticipating and matching labour market needs, with special emphasis on youth. This is a presidency priority, as youth employment has remained stubbornly high in some EU member states. Additionally, the  


<notus-date day="4" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS24"></a><b>4 Jun 2008 : Column WS24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>council will also seek to endorse the Employment Committee&#146;s opinion on skills, jobs and youth. The opinion does not call for the prioritisation of youth over other disadvantaged groups, as measures that ease unemployment generally also benefit youth. The UK supports the text.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08060477000012"></a>The council will aim to agree a partial general approach on the latest instalment of an implementing regulation for social security co-ordination, regulation 883/2004 title IV&#151;financial provisions. This is a continuation of the work to simplify and modernise the co-ordination rules by discussing implementing procedures. This presidency has covered financial provisions, in particular issues relating to recovery of overpaid benefits and contributions. The UK fully supports the council text and welcomes improved provisions for recovery.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08060477000013"></a>In addition, the council will aim to agree a general approach on the proposal to amend the annexes to regulation 883/2004 on the co-ordination of social security&#151;Articles 42 and 308 of the treaty. The annexes cover issues such as special rules for applying member states&#146; social security legislation, which parts of social security agreements between member states are still to be taken account of, lists of benefits that are not paid abroad and how pension calculations are to be carried out. The UK is happy that the presidency has pushed negotiations forward so well.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08060477000014"></a>The council will also seek adoption of conclusions on two further items in a follow-up to the Beijing platform: indicators in respect of the girl child and women in political decision-making. The Slovenian presidency has chosen to work on the subject of the girl child and has produced draft council conclusions and a report including a set of indicators. The presidency has also prepared a review report on women in political decision-making and produced draft council conclusions, which among other things encourage the member states and the Commission to launch quantitative and qualitative studies on the outcome of positive measures for increasing women&#146;s access to and participation in power and decision-making and to promote dissemination of good practices.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08060477000015"></a>The council will also seek adoption of council conclusions on elimination of gender stereotypes in society. The conclusions among other things call on the member states and the Commission to &#147;continue and strengthen active co-operation with the social partners and other stakeholders in order to reduce gender segregation and gender gaps on the labour market, including by taking concrete actions to eliminate the gender pay gap and improving the recognition of the value of work in jobs and sectors predominantly occupied by women&#148;. The UK has no objection to the draft council conclusions.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08060477000016"></a>Under any other business, there will be an oral report from the chair of the Social Protection Committee on social services of general interest (following up the 2007 communication annexed to the single market review). There will be reports from the presidency of recent presidency conferences. There will also be information from the presidency about a proposal for a council directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08060477000019"></a>Items on the main agenda are: adoption of council conclusions on reducing the burden of cancer and on a co-operation mechanism between the council and the Commission for the implementation of the EU health strategy; and conclusions on antimicrobial resistance. The UK supports these conclusions. There will also be a progress report from the Slovenian presidency on the proposal for a regulation on novel foods.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08060477000020"></a>Ministers will have a policy debate on the provision of information to patients on medicinal products and will be asked to adopt draft council conclusions on this. The UK is broadly supportive of the council conclusions.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08060477000021"></a>Over lunch, the presidency has arranged an introductory presentation by Zsuzsanna Jakab, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and will chair a debate and exchange of views on an EU action plan to fight tuberculosis. This follows on from the publication in February 2008 of the <I>Framework Action Plan to Fight TB in the EU</I>, which the UK supports.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08060477000022"></a>Under any other business, the presidency and the Commission intend to provide information on the proposal for a directive on cross-border healthcare and patient rights; the conference on eHealth without frontiers, which took place Slovenia on 5 to 7 May; the EU strategy to support member states in reducing alcohol-related harm; nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues; the framework convention on tobacco control; organ donation and transplantation; the proposed package on patient safety to be published later in 2008; health security-related matters; the strategy for Europe on mental health; the proposal for a directive on the variations to the terms of marketing authorisations for medicinal products; the networking meeting of the competent authorities for pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals, which was held on 28 and 29 April 2008 in Slovenia; and, finally, the food improvements package.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08060477000024"></a>Land Registry&#146;s revised framework document is published today, 4 June 2008.</p>

<a name="80604-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08060477000025"></a>Land Registry became an executive agency of the Lord Chancellor in July 1990 and over the past 18 years has enthusiastically grasped the opportunities that agency status and, since 1993, trading fund status have provided. During that period, it has met improving financial, customer service and development targets while making land registration services progressively more efficient and cheaper.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08060477000026"></a>The framework document is a statement of Land Registry&#146;s legal position and reflects its status as a non-ministerial department.

The department has no evidence to suggest that the population of birds currently listed in Schedule 4 is other than from primarily legitimate sources. The costs of DNA-testing the whole captive population would be prohibitively expensive and would not be justified by any possible enforcement or conservation benefit. Any DNA testing to be carried out by Animal Health will be based on a risk and intelligence-led approach.</p>

My department therefore revised the criteria for the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) assessment of species to be listed in Schedule 4. The list of species provided by the JNCC was considered in terms of the proportionality of the burden that registration of these species would place on keepers, balancing any conservation benefit that may arise from registration against the regulatory burden imposed by registration.</p>

It will not be a legislative measure&#151;its aim will be to set principles and outline measures to improve the framework conditions for European small businesses, while taking full account of their diversity. It will cover a range of policy areas; for example, the impact on small business of EU regulations, facilitating access to finance and helping them enter new markets, including the single market.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_67"></a><a name="08060483000130"></a>Small businesses regularly say that their key concern is the disproportionate burden of regulation on them and so our priority is to see a bold set of measures within the Small Business Act to reduce regulatory burdens coming from the EU. It is as part of this &#147;better regulation&#148; element that we are pressing the European Commission systematically to consider, where possible, exempting small businesses with fewer than 20 employees from EU regulation, as we plan to do for domestic regulations. Where exemption is not possible, either for legal or policy reasons, we suggest the Commission should work with small firms to design specific approaches for them, including simplified enforcement and effective guidance.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_143"></a><a name="08060483000228"></a>The exact method by which fingerprints are enrolled during passport applications has yet to be finalised. However, the needs of those living in remote communities is being taken into consideration. First time passport applicants are already required to attend an interview as part of the application process. The IPS has explored ways to make this more accessible to those in remote communities with video-linked offices currently being delivered as a solution.</p>
