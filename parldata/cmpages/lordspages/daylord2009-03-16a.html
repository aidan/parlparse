As I informed the noble Baroness in my Written Answer of 15 January, we remain strongly committed to constitutional renewal and our aim is to bring a Bill forward as soon as parliamentary time allows. We expect that to be later this Session.</p>

Does the Minister realise that in the mean time it has become an incredible ordeal to protest? Not only is your name taken and your number plate recognised but if you refuse to give your name your credit card will be asked for, and if you obstruct the police you will of course then be up on a charge. This is criminalising protest. Will the Minister ensure that the guidance from the Home Office and the actions of the police move in the opposite direction so that we never see another Kingsnorth policed as it was, with climate protesters being treated as they were?</p>

However, the Joint Committee raised a number of other things to be looked at, which we are doing. We want to ensure that we have a sensible package in the Bill when it is introduced. With regard to Kingsnorth, I would need to look at that and consider exactly what was said there before I made any response about it.</p>

This whole issue is interesting. I was struck by Lord Justice Laws&#146;s judgment in the case regarding Aldermaston. This quotation is not overlong, and it is worth repeating:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="0903167000151"></a>&#147;Rights worth having are unruly things. Demonstrations and protests are liable to be a nuisance. They are liable to be inconvenient and tiresome, or at least perceived as such by others who are out of sympathy with them. Sometimes they are wrong-headed and misconceived&#148;.</p>

As I say, we are moving forward with this. We have listened to what was said. I think that the way it was brought in was wrong. It was brought in for very good reasons; people thought it would help because there are issues of access to the House, security and noise, but it was clearly a very blunt, heavy-handed instrument. It was not right and we have recognised that. We will repeal it and we are working very hard to do that. I am afraid that I do not have the actual numbers at my fingertips, but I shall get back to the noble Baroness in writing on those.</p>

Finally, will people who assemble outside Parliament be able to take photographs of policemen?</p>

It published its report in July 2008. It supported the repeal of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act. I think all of us agree that it should go, and that is what we are moving towards. However, it identified a number of other things such as access to Parliament, noise and security, which need to be addressed. We are looking at all these issues in terms of tying them together in the constitutional renewal Bill. It is our absolute intention to go with that. As someone who comes from the military, I agree that sometimes the speed of things within government seems slightly slow, but, of course, we have to look at all aspects and it is rather tricky sometimes, but we are pushing that very hard indeed.</p>

The gardens belong to the GLA, which through a by-law has now stopped people using them. However, Westminster City Council has been unable to stop them being on the pavement. I fear that it will be something as prosaic as an American lawyer breaking his ankle while trying to go along that pavement&#151;rather than legislation&#151;which will cause such a furore in terms of cost that they will have to move.</p>

That is why the British Government are extremely guarded in our response to developments in Zimbabwe. The noble Lord is right that there is a role that Thabo Mbeki is to play in monitoring the development of and encouraging the restoration of those features which I have indicated in terms of the rule of law and the return to democracy. We wait and see. At this stage, it would be premature to reach judgments, but the noble Lord is right to raise the issue. We must be watchful of what are very limited developments in Zimbabwe at present.</p>

The position of the British Government with regard to aid in Zimbabwe is that aid is concentrated on food aid under the United Nations programme and on concern about the health and welfare of the people of Zimbabwe, particularly given the background of the recent cholera epidemic. Those are both priorities to which international support is being given. Although there is always a difficulty about monitoring certain flows of funds, the international community and the British Government have a great interest in ensuring that the two main issues in Zimbabwe&#151;food and the restoration of some degree of public health&#151;are priorities that can be monitored.</p>

He is right to express anxiety about appointments, as I have indicated, but one or two developments and appointments, including the swearing into office of Mr Bennett who has been freed from prison, offer some limited encouragement.

Rules 72 and 73 advise cyclists not to ride on the inside of vehicles signalling or slowing down to turn left, to pay particular attention to long vehicles which need a lot of room to manoeuvre at corners, and not to be tempted to ride in the space between them and the kerb.

As for bendy buses, however, the most recent statistics I have to hand are for London in 2007. They show that a total of 155 incidents involved cyclists and buses, of which 28 were bendy buses.

I recently hosted a round-table meeting with allotment interests to consider current trends, issues and priorities for action. With their help we are drawing up options about how we can provide further support to local authorities to meet their duty under Section 23 of the 1908 Act to provide allotments where they perceive a demand for them in their area.</p>

We are trying to do all that we can to help local authorities to satisfy that. The noble Baroness is right that local authorities are required to consider the allocation of protection of green space in their core strategies and local development plans, which is a good way to secure allotments for the future. It also involves the community, which is a good thing in itself. We are concerned that it has taken longer to provide the LDFs than we thought&#151;they are complex documents&#151;but we are putting in a lot of extra help, particularly through the Planning Inspectorate and Planning Advisory Service. I am pleased to say that we have over 100 finalised and found sound.</p>

Are not statutory allotments the only service for which parish councils and town councils have a statutory duty? In many cases, they provide allotments that are non-statutory. One of the keys to providing more allotments is to provide capital finance to parish councils to be able to purchase land and set up allotments. They are good at running allotments and often do it economically, but finding the money to buy the land and set up the scheme is often difficult. There seem to be no schemes at the moment for that.</p>

It is a website that enables people who want to grow their own food to match up with landowners who have private land which they are prepared to give over.

Three major issues are at stake. First, I want to make it clear to your Lordships that this is not an attack on the integrity or independence of the Boundary Commission. Like others, I have appeared at a Boundary Commission inquiry and have been impressed by the process. However, in the exceptional circumstances of the process by which the commission decided to recommend changes to the boundaries in the two Somerset constituencies referred to in the order, the commission has misdirected itself. Significantly, I am joined in that view by both Members of Parliament whose constituencies are affected, who both argued forcefully to that effect last week.</p>

<a name="90316-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="0903167000071"></a>First, the commission misdirected itself on the need for a further interim review just because the second-tier authority, the district authority, had changed its ward boundaries. This is not required by Parliament, by the 1986 Act or by any other statute, and it has not been a deciding factor everywhere else in England. Instead, the commission decided to take more notice of its own rule, which it had invented, than of the local ties that Parliament had asked it to make its major consideration. The Conservative Member of Parliament for Wells argued this point so convincingly last week that I am sure his colleagues in this House will wish to support the amendment on those grounds alone.</p>

<a name="90316-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="0903167000072"></a>The misdirection also failed to take account of important links between villages and their local town. Any Members of your Lordships&#146; House who are aware of those important links, historic and social, will, I am sure, understand that the failure to do so was important. The commission also failed to take account of substantial objections to its revised proposals, even from Mendip District Council, whose ward changes were alleged to be the rationale for reopening the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0903167000073"></a>Secondly, there is no party-political motive in challenging the process by which this draft order comes before us. There is no suggestion of any electoral advantage either to the Conservatives, who hold Wells, or to the Liberal Democrats, who hold Somerton and Frome&#151;hence the total agreement of those two senior Members of Parliament, the right honourable David Heathcoat-Amory and David Heath, in the committee last week. Mr Heathcoat-Amory summed it up as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="0903167000152"></a>&#147;It is beyond doubt that in 2007 those of us in Somerset were told that the parliamentary boundaries had been fixed for the next election. Indeed, they were approved by order&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Second Delegated Legislation Committee, 9/3/09; col. 10.]</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_13"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0903167000147"></a>The issue is simply that the commission has very unusually&#151;exceptionally&#151;failed to take account of Parliament&#146;s instruction and has instead given precedence to a rule of its own in relation to district council ward boundaries.</p>

<a name="90316-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="0903167000074"></a>Thirdly, we are faced with an insidious argument from Ministers that we should not question this order. Indeed, in the committee in the other place, the Minister went so far as to suggest that any challenge should be by judicial review. Imagine asking the inhabitants of small villages in Somerset to go to the expense of judicial review when we, in the high court of Parliament, are given a specific duty to scrutinise these orders. Why do noble Lords suppose that Parliament has laid down that this process should take place here? Were we expected to act like the proverbial rubber stamp? There might be a case for MPs to avoid taking the final decision on matters that could be considered to be of electoral significance in their own constituencies. However, in your Lordships&#146; House there is no reason to have such qualms. We have a firm, principled and statutory duty to say so when we think that the process has gone wrong. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0903167000075"></a><b><a name="90316-0002.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="0903167000489"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> My Lords, before expressing a view on this amendment, perhaps I may take the opportunity to set out the legislative background to the order. Section 2(1) of the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 established, among other things, the Boundary Commission for England. Under Section 3(3) of the Act, the commission may submit to the Secretary of State a report recommending the way in which any particular area should be divided into constituencies. The boundaries of the current parliamentary constituencies in England are set out in the Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 2007, and these constituencies conform to the pattern of district and borough council areas as established on 12 April 2005.</p>

<a name="90316-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0903167000076"></a>However, as your Lordships know, since that date a number of changes to the local government wards have been recommended by the commission and subsequently implemented by order. As a consequence, the boundaries of a number of parliamentary constituencies no longer align with the relevant changed areas. Two of those local government changes occurred in the district of South Northamptonshire and the district of Mendip in Somerset. For reasons that are unclear to me, the commission decided that in the case of those two areas, but not in the remainder of those altered since 12 April 2005, realignment should be made to the affected parliamentary constituencies, which are Daventry, South Northamptonshire, Somerton and Frome and Wells.</p>

<a name="90316-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0903167000077"></a>Accordingly, the commission conducted a statutory review under Section 3(3) of the 1986 Act. The commission published its provisional recommendations in July 2007, inviting representations. As there were a number of objections to the recommendations, the commission held public inquiries in both areas, thereafter producing revised proposals in each case. Despite further written objections to those proposals, the commission decided to make no further adjustments and reported to the

The draft order before us implements, without any modification, the Boundary Commission report.</p>

<a name="90316-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0903167000078"></a>I should say at the outset that we have no intention of supporting the Liberal Democrat amendment, or, indeed, of challenging the order. Parliament, although it has the constitutional right to do so, as the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, pointed out, should, in our view, be very slow, for obvious reasons, to challenge decisions about the composition of individual parliamentary constituencies.</p>

<a name="90316-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0903167000079"></a>However, the decisions that the order implements raise three issues on which we suggest that clarification would be helpful for the future. First, there is no statutory duty on the commission to realign parliamentary boundaries following alterations to local government ward boundaries. Nevertheless, the commission has always so acted as a matter of policy and practice. Here, if I understand the situation correctly, the commission appears to have altered the boundaries of four constituencies affected by ward boundary changes since 12 April, 2005, but to have ignored the remainder in the same class. If I am correct about the facts, perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to explain why that was so.</p>

<a name="90316-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0903167000080"></a>Secondly, following the public inquiry in Somerset, so the debate in another place suggests, the inspectors&#146; revised proposals contained a solution that was never, it is said, raised or discussed at that inquiry. The revised proposals&#151;again, so it is said&#151;are those that appear in the order. If that version of events is correct, would it not be preferable to alter the inquiry rules so that, in future, a public inquiry can be reconvened so as to furnish objectors with the opportunity to test such a solution, which would otherwise remain unexamined?</p>

<a name="90316-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0903167000081"></a>Finally, there will plainly be occasions when the Boundary Commission&#146;s policy to realign parliamentary constituencies following ward boundary changes will conflict with its statutory obligation contained in the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 to take into account local ties that would be broken by an alteration to a parliamentary boundary. It would be desirable if some help could be given to inspectors in the form of guidance to assist them in determining the appropriate approach to balance those potentially clashing considerations.</p>

For once in my nine or 10 years in this House, I want to say something almost party political, because his contribution today has veered into that area. I was always under the impression that everyone in this House subscribed to the primacy of the House of Commons. I came here on that basis. We are unelected. We accept that, in being unelected, primacy is identifiable with the other House, not with this House. By tabling this fatal amendment, the noble Lord is saying that he, an unelected Liberal Democrat Peer in Parliament, has taken it on himself to defeat the House of Commons, where there is primacy, by overturning a majority of more than 350. That is wrong in principle. I am astonished that the Liberal Democrats are prepared to support this amendment

<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="0903167000083"></a><b><a name="90316-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0903167000491"></a>Lord Bach:</b> My Lords, I thank those noble Lords who have spoken in this short debate, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, who made some excellent points. I will take back the issues that he raised and look at them for the future, as he asked, but I can deal with one now. The noble Lord says that his advice to his party is not to support the amendment. We are grateful for that, but not surprised because, of the 402 votes in another place, 139 were from his party, supporting 257 Labour MPs. Not one Conservative, not even the Member of Parliament involved, voted for the amendment on that occasion.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0903167000084"></a>My remarks will be short because this matter has already been fully debated in the Moses Room. However, it is important to make one point, as I attempted to do in that debate. Although I am not in the habit of quoting myself, I will on this occasion. I said that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="0903167000153"></a>&#147;the Government&#146;s view is that this is very much a matter for the Boundary Commission itself. Having considered it and having also held a public inquiry, when I understand a minor change was made, the commission came to a view, and it is that view which makes up this draft order ... the commission went through its normal procedures and the inquiries were conducted properly. The recommendations following the commission&#146;s inquiries were accepted and we do not see it as our role in government to second-guess on matters of this kind. If we were to do so, it would represent a fairly dangerous precedent in terms of government power&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 4/3/09; col. GC 322.]</p>

<p><a name="0903167000148"></a>Governments set up Boundary Commissions to give them independent advice, and any party that is really serious about power would take the view that we take today. It would be only in extraordinarily extreme circumstances that a Government would try to interfere with a decision of the Boundary Commission. On something like this, important though it is to the localities involved, it would be quite wrong, in principle, for the Government to knock down the commission&#146;s proposals and recommendations, which had been built up over the course of an inquiry.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0903167000085"></a>The one question from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that I can answer is: why these four constituencies and not the others? The answer is that, as I mentioned in passing in Grand Committee, the Boundary Commission concluded that it should carry out a review but decided to postpone its reviews of the other areas, to which the noble Lord referred, because of local government reorganisations that are taking place. The Boundary Commission will no doubt make up its own mind about what to do once those local government reorganisations have taken place.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0903167000086"></a>If this matter is taken to a vote, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, seriously to consider whether it is really in the interests of this House to seek to overturn an overwhelming majority in another place on an issue of this kind. I ask him to think carefully about whether to divide the House. If the noble Lord decides to, which is, of course, his right, I ask the House to defeat the amendment.</p>

I understand the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, and I bring this amendment before the House with considerable regret because it is exceptional. I was struck by the argument made by the Minister in the other place that the proper process for those who felt that this had not been handled correctly within the law as Parliament lays it down was to go to judicial review. That is not an appropriate remedy when we in this House are given a specific responsibility to look at an order of this sort.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0903167000090"></a>When the matter was first raised, I would have preferred the Minister to say that he would delay the implementation of the order and not bring it forward for consideration in your Lordships&#146; House, or indeed in the other place, until the Boundary Commission had been given another chance to look at this issue. However, we are given a statutory responsibility to look at these issues, which is why this is exceptional.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0903167000091"></a>All the concerns that have been expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, are perfectly legitimate. Indeed, if I had not tabled this amendment, I believe that he would not have taken the step that he has taken and expressed these concerns in your Lordships&#146; House. I am very disappointed that Conservative Members, it seems, are not going to support their own local Member. Indeed, if I am right about what the Minister has said, the Member, having argued so strongly against the order on Monday, must have voted for it on Wednesday, which is an amazing U-turn, if that is the case.</p>

On this occasion, yes, I believe in the primacy of the House of Commons, but we would not be doing our duty if we did not face up to the responsibilities laid on us. If the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, is right that we should never vote differently from the House of Commons, what precisely would be the point of your Lordships&#146; House?

According to the briefing so kindly provided by the Minister and

The Government have an ongoing consultation seeking stakeholder views on whether the current sea fisheries committees arrangement will be moderately adjusted, resulting in 10 associations following local authority boundaries, or whether economies of scale could be enjoyed by reducing the number of associations to six with a few more local authorities involved in each association.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0903167000095"></a>I realise that I am anticipating the result of that consultation here, but I was hoping that the Minister would be able to shed a little light on which of the options appears to be the most preferred. As much as cost savings are always welcome, the second option would lead to some rather large areas being incorporated. The consultation also noted that there will be a further consultation on the exact boundaries when the orders for each new IFCA are being drawn up. I am sure that the Minister will not find it difficult to reassure the Committee and the stakeholders involved that the nature of the coastline and existing fisheries will be considered to ensure that these boundaries are drawn in sensible places.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0903167000096"></a>One aspect that has confused me is that neither option in the consultation suggests that any local authority will find itself dealing with two districts, and yet the Bill makes specific provision for this. I suppose it is possible that the requirements might lead to a very slight overlap, but hardly more than a matter of miles, if that. I am also interested in why the Government have decided to extend the IFCA jurisdiction out to only six nautical miles when the Bill suggests that it might be 12.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0903167000097"></a>Finally, the impact assessment attached to the consultation expresses the hope that the reorganisation will have been completed by 2011, which does seem to be rather a long way away. Can the Minister explain why it will take two years? I beg to move.</p>

The noble Duke talked about some of them, such as the nature of the coastline, the size of the area covered and how far it extends out to sea, but there is also the issue of local accountability, particularly to and through local authorities. It goes without saying that the bigger these areas are and the fewer they are, the more local authorities will be covered by them. As the Bill stands, some local authorities will not be represented on their local IFCA, which on the face of it seems to be undesirable.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0903167000099"></a>Two of the areas in the option to reduce to six should have huge question marks over them. One, the north-east option, covers the whole north-east coast from the Scottish border down to the Humber. I can see that there may be some operational or marine justification for it, but when we consider the size of the area, which is about 200 miles long, and the number and variety of communities along that coastline, there must be a serious question mark over it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0903167000100"></a>There is an even bigger question mark over the southern and western area, which includes both a large area of the south coast, from the Devon-Cornwall  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_20"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>border to the border between Hampshire and Sussex east of the Isle of Wight, and a substantial amount of the Severn estuary and the Bristol Channel. That is not a single area and if the Government are going for the large option they should seriously consider splitting it into two and have one area for the Severn and one for the south coast. This might create a potential difficulty in that the county of Devon would be in two areas but it would not be a serious matter because that county has two coasts, a north coast and a south coast, and the management of inshore fisheries in those two areas is different; they are separate areas. There may be an argument that Devon and the Isle of Wight should be in the same IFCA area along the south coast, but I can see little argument that the Isle of Wight should be in the same area as the north coast of Somerset.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0903167000101"></a>These are important questions. Are the Government consulting on the two options of six or 10, or are intermediate and different options possible because, at the moment, neither option is ideal?</p>

I could go on but I shall desist at that point. I accept that, if one went for the 10 option, there would be fewer local authorities within each boundary, which might make relationships more effective. It is a point well taken. However, we need to see the outcome of the consultation before we come to conclusions.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0903167000109"></a>I assure the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that however many local authorities are defined as relevant, it is our intention that they should all be represented on the IFCAs. I accept that, if local authorities are to feel involved, the relevant ones must be represented. I know that there is a later group of amendments on the issue.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0903167000110"></a>I say to the noble Duke that 2011 is a year after the MMO will be established and, as we will debate in later amendments, it will make appointments to the IFCAs. There is an argument for delaying the creation of IFCAs to allow that to happen. In Wales, the Welsh Assembly Government have decided to take responsibility for Wales in-house, and the current sea fisheries committee, which covers both north Wales and the north-west, will have to be split up. The remnant in the north-west will be used as an early adopter when it comes to preparation for IFCA status. That should be extremely helpful.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0903167000111"></a>In this opening debate, I stress that IFCAs will be different from sea fisheries committees in a number of ways. As we have discussed, the membership will be different. We are also introducing a clear duty on inshore fisheries and conservation authorities to ensure that the exploitation of sea fisheries resources is undertaken sustainably. That duty includes the need to protect the marine environment from the impact of fishing activity. This is at the heart of the model for inshore fisheries and conservation authorities.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0903167000112"></a>I know that we will debate one or two of these points later. This approach has the support of current sea fisheries committees and the Local Government Association. These organisations have recognised the need to change. As I said to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, every upper-tier local authority with a coastline will be entitled to sit on the inshore fisheries and conservation authority. We have set out a project board to progress matters and, as we have learnt already, we plan to establish the authorities in April 2011.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0903167000113"></a>The noble Duke asked about the limit of six nautical miles. IFCAs will be responsible for the enforcement of legislation regulating inshore fisheries out to six nautical miles: that is the same as sea fisheries committees now, with the addition of marine species management in estuaries. This will bring together responsibility for inshore fisheries management into one organisation, thereby streamlining the delivery landscape and ensuring efficient use of resources.</p>

<a name="90316-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0903167000114"></a>We have heard already that between six and 12 nautical miles, access rights for certain member states are set out in the common fisheries policy. Limiting IFC

We have the option, in the light of circumstances and if we feel it necessary, to extend the seaward jurisdiction of IFCAs out to a maximum of 12 nautical miles. That provision gives us the required flexibility.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0903167000115"></a>On aligning local authority boundaries, we see that there is a clear benefit from these measures, because local authorities will be required to be part of, and contribute to, only one inshore fisheries conservation authority, and the district boundaries will be identical to local authority boundaries. Under Clause 165, IFCAs will have a duty to co-operate with each other and will work in a joined-up way across boundaries.</p>

I fully accept the point. I should have said to him, when he asked me whether we would consider an intermediate option, that this is an open consultation and, if we receive comments that suggest that neither of the options we propose is acceptable, we will consider such an opinion. Equally, while I accept that where a county has two different coastlines there will be issues that will have to be dealt with, one could argue that there are advantages in one county area being taken as a whole and dealt with consistently.</p>

<p><a name="0903167000150"></a>It is important to achieve that balance, but, as the Bill is drafted, that balance would apply only to persons appointed by the MMO. Indeed, the third category of &#147;other persons&#148; could lead to a considerable imbalance one way or the other. Balance is an important issue. That is why the amendment seeks to include those with a specific interest in and knowledge of marine environmental matters but also seeks to ensure that, overall, there is a balance between the two most important stakeholder interests.</p>

It might be very invidious to ask someone to represent one community. Having had experience of representing fishing communities, I know that getting a consensus view can be difficult. Therefore, the amendment seeks to provide for the diverse interests that may arise in fishing communities. I beg to move.</p>

I received a letter from the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, just before I entered the Chamber today, which confirms that under the new arrangements the Government propose that IFCA membership will comprise statutory members from Natural England, the Environment Agency and the MMO. That is comforting.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0903167000131"></a>However, the amendment would go a little further. It seeks to balance the competing interests of environmentalism and fisheries by means of assuring their equal numerical representation. I have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment in this regard. The finding of a balance, which the IFCA is obliged to seek under Clause 149(2)(b) and (c), will not be easy, and this would certainly go some way to ensure that the balance of power within an IFCA is fair. At the risk of lengthening the list, what about a scientist on each authority? Indeed, one could argue that all those with interests in this area should be represented.</p>

We sought to prevent that occurring by drafting amendments to ensure that any order amending this subsection would be subject to the affirmative procedure. I am happy to note that the Government have gone one better and tabled an amendment that would prevent any order amending subsection (2) as it stands. Instead, the power will now be restricted to the adding, varying or removing of any additional safeguards the Secretary of State might think wise to add in the future. We are very satisfied with this approach and thank the Minister and his officials for their amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0903167000135"></a>It is our clear intention that there will be a statutory seat on each inshore fisheries and conservation authority for the Environment Agency, the MMO and Natural England. This will be set out in the secondary legislation that sets up each inshore fisheries and conservation district and authority. It is not included in the Bill&#151;although I well understand why noble Lords were keen to see that happen&#151;in order to provide flexibility should the name or nature of these organisations change. We will also set out in the secondary legislation setting up each inshore fisheries and conservation authority the maximum number of local authority members that there can be on that inshore fisheries and conservation authority. Our intention is that this will be up to one third.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0903167000136"></a>I want to make it clear that if that means that there are 10 relevant local authorities, it follows that the local authority membership will be 10 and that the total number on the committee will be of the order of 30. Taking the three statutory appointments, that leaves approximately 27 people to be appointed. That is the thinking behind our intention. We do not want to exclude local authorities; we see that it is important that the relevant local authorities are represented. In a sense, that sets out the marker for the composition of the committee. Clearly, if we went for the sixth option in the paper, there would be more local authority membership on the authority, and there would be other members as well. There is a balance, and one can see arguments both ways on that.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0903167000137"></a>Clause 147(2)(a) requires members appointed by the MMO to comprise those with fishing and marine environmental knowledge or expertise. MMO appointments to each inshore fisheries and conservation authority will be made according to the particular economic, social and environmental needs of that inshore fisheries and conservation authority. The detail of the appointment process will be drafted in guidance on which my department will consult this year. That will include information on how the MMO should decide on the balance of interests to be appointed. The guidance will stress the need for the balance of members to enable the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities effectively to deliver their new statutory duties. This will require there to be a balance of expertise that includes both fisheries and environmental interests.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0903167000138"></a>I very much take the point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, about having members with scientific expertise. I should have thought that when one thinks  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_26"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about those with marine environmental knowledge, one would expect people with scientific expertise to be appointed. With the appointments by the MMO, Natural England and the Environment Agency, I should be very surprised if people with a scientific background and expertise were not appointed to these organisations. In a sense, we begin to see some of the advantage of the new approach, which balances expertise in the marine area, appropriate fishing representatives, commercial interests&#146; representatives, local authority representatives and the statutory bodies. That does not mean to say that they are going to find it easy to come to a balanced view, but at least the right people will be around the table.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0903167000139"></a>We do not think that it is appropriate to specify that there should be equal numbers of fishing and environmental members. The MMO should appoint the most appropriate members, depending on local circumstances and need. Some members may have fishing and environmental expertise, so it would not be practical or appropriate to attempt to make an equal split of members. However, the fact is that each IFCA will be the subject of its own order and, therefore, be subject to appropriate parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0903167000140"></a>Amendment A228B proposes that some of the MMO appointees must be persons acquainted with the needs and opinions of the fishing &#147;communities&#148; of the district, rather than &#147;community&#148;, as the current wording proposes. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, made a relevant point in relation to that, a point which was well taken. My understanding from the advice that I have received is that &#147;community&#148; is used in the wider sense to include any relevant &#147;communities&#148;. Of course, I well take the noble Lord&#146;s point that there are many different interests and, as has been pointed out in relation to the west country, different coastlines could be covered by the same IFCA. We will very much take the noble Lord&#146;s point on board, but the legislation does not get in the way of that issue.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0903167000141"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, has tabled amendments, but he has indicated that the Government have put down amendments which we hope will deal with this matter. We addressed the concern that the clause as drafted could allow the Secretary of State to vary or remove the descriptions of persons currently set out in subsection (2)(a) and (b)&#151;that is, those appointed by the Marine Management Organisation. This issue was raised by the Delegated Powers Committee during its consideration of the Bill. This was not the intention of the clause, so we propose to amend the wording by introducing government amendment A230 whereby the Secretary of State would have a power to vary or remove only anything that is added to subsection (2) rather than a power to amend what is currently in subsection (2)(a) and (b).</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0903167000142"></a>Subsection (2)(a) and (b) will not be able to be varied or removed by the Secretary of State as these descriptions will always be appropriate for inshore fisheries conservation authority appointees, but it is useful to retain a power for the Secretary of State to add new descriptions of persons, and to vary or remove those descriptions in future. Therefore, we think that we have dealt with the point raised by the Delegated Powers Committee, but we have the flexibility we need

On that basis, we do not think that the order should be taken through the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0903167000143"></a>I hope that I have answered the point sufficiently and that noble Lords will recognise that the Government, in bringing forward their own amendment, have considered very carefully the comments of the Delegated Powers Committee and the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart.</p>

Will the number of people who will be involved on the authorities increase? I should know this, but, coming from another part of the nation, I am completely ignorant of it. Presumably these people will not be paid, but have travel expenses. Some will have to travel some distance if they represent bodies such as the Environment Agency. Are there sufficient people to represent the bodies mentioned by the noble Lord&#151;Natural England, the Environment Agency and so on? Can the Minister fill in a little bit, just for our information?</p>

<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="09031611000001"></a><b><a name="90316-0004.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09031611000081"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> Yes. I would be happy to send a note to noble Lords on the number of members on the sea fisheries committees as compared with the IFCAs. The SFC in Cornwall, for example, has 26 members; Cumbria 14; Devon 20; Eastern 20; Isles of Scilly eight; Kent and Essex 22; Northumberland 20; North Eastern 36; North Western and North Wales 38; Southern 20; and Sussex 20. It depends on which model is adopted. If, for instance, one took the sixth IFCA option, it is likely that the committees will be larger in future because the size is determined essentially by how many upper-tier or single-tier local authorities have to be represented. Equally, we want to get a much more effective balance than we have at the moment. Looking at the representation on the sea fisheries committees at the moment, one sees that local authorities have roughly half the membership. The remaining half is appointed mainly by my department. We seek a much more balanced representation ensuring not only strong local authority representation but, obviously, representation of the fishing sector in its many different components and representation of the environmental and conservation interests. That is probably worth the price of somewhat larger committees.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09031611000002"></a>At the moment, about &#163;6 million of local authority funding is paid to sea fisheries committees. We reckon that there will be an additional expenditure, and my department will provide additional funding of around &#163;5 million per year through the area-based grant. One has to say that we expect more of these new authorities. We see a developing role for them and we see the issues around environmental conservation as particularly important. On n that basis, we see some expenditure as reasonable.</p>

I therefore hope that we can spell out some reassurance to the fishing communities. I noticed that the Minister referred just now to &#147;the fishing sector in its many components&#148;. As that does not sound to me like a very united and integrated &#147;community&#148;, singular, I think that he has already given away his reaction to my noble friend&#146;s Amendment A228B.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09031611000004"></a>It is important that we indicate to the fishing communities as clearly as we can in the Bill that they will not be swamped by people coming in with a different viewpoint and attitude and that there will be a collective and cohesive approach to the problems of marine conservation. There are many people involved in the current regime who will have some concerns and who will see the possibility of imbalance. Although I am sure that the Minister is perfectly honest in saying that the Government&#146;s clear intention is to do this or that, it is difficult for people to be reassured on that point in advance, when such matters are left to secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09031611000005"></a>I specifically take issue with the Minister&#146;s idea that the word &#147;community&#148;, in this particular respect, can somehow encompass &#147;the fishing sector in its many components&#148;&#151;I am quoting back the Minister&#146;s own words. My experience of fishing communities is that they are very disparate. They have very different interests based not just on whether they are on the north or south coast of Devon but on whether they are involved in sea fishing or in shellfish. Take the lobstermen and the crabbers, for example: it is not always possible to get them into the same boat, facing in the same direction. If the Minister honestly thinks he can somehow wave a magic wand and the whole fishing community can be brought together, &#147;in the widest possible sense&#148; was his phrase, into one community, I think he is in never-never land.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09031611000006"></a>I also listened very carefully to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart. In Amendment A228A my noble friend is proposing a balance between,</p>
<ul><a name="09031611000071"></a>&#147;persons acquainted with the needs and opinions of the fishing communities&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031611000007"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="09031611000072"></a>&#147;persons with knowledge of, or expertise in, marine environmental matters&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031611000008"></a>The latter category must include the scientists involved. I am sure that my noble friend took that on board. I do not think that we need on this occasion one of the famous lists about which the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, is so anxious. However, we need more clarification from the Minister, otherwise the suspicion to which I referred at the outset may grow.</p>

<a name="90316-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09031611000009"></a>I am sure that we are right to insist that all major local authorities are properly and directly represented. However, as the Minister himself admitted, that is a critical issue in terms of the number of IFC districts that we have. It could make a huge difference to the management if we had too few so that they became too large and unwieldy.</p>

<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_29"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that I fully accepted that &#147;community&#148; is taken to mean &#147;communities&#148;. It has become fashionable for Ministers to read what they said as authority for what they then maintain, as we saw in the debate before the triumphant vote of my noble friend Lord Bach half an hour ago. Clearly there are many different interests in the fishing community. The task of my department when it comes to guidance to be issued to the Marine Management Organisation, the work that the MMO will need to do on each IFCA, and the bringing of an order before Parliament will be to ensure that so far as possible we recognise diversity of interests in a particular sector, such as the fishing community. Clause 147(8) is a helpful explanation of what is meant by &#147;the fishing community&#148;, saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="09031611000073"></a>&#147;&#145;the fishing community&#146; means all persons with any sort of interest in the exploitation of sea fisheries resources or in fisheries for such resources&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031611000062"></a>That seems a pretty wide definition. The challenge will be to ensure that we embrace sufficient interests within an IFCA without having a huge number of members; as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, would probably point out, that would cost a lot more in expenses but also be unmanageable. We have to try to get the balance right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09031611000011"></a>I have no argument at all with what the noble Lord said about the need to represent. We want the fishing community represented, but there are a lot of different interests within what is meant by &#147;the fishing community&#148;.</p>

I thank the Minister for his reply, which was helpful in allowing a greater expansion on some of the ideas about what will happen when the authorities are constituted.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09031611000014"></a>I share the concern expressed by my noble friend Lord Tyler that there is a lot of uncertainty and apprehension&#151;from not only fishing communities but environmental interests&#151;that there could be an imbalance one way or the other. What was said should give some reassurance, but often to have something set down gives even more reassurance, particularly as there is a category in subsection (1)(c) of &#147;other persons&#148;, which is mighty wide. I was going to say that it covers a multitude of sinners; that is probably unfair, as I am sure that they are people of great virtue and ability.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09031611000015"></a>I also take the Minister&#146;s point that those appointed from Natural England or the Environment Agency would almost inevitably have a scientific background. To that extent, the important point made by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, is met.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09031611000016"></a>I think that the Minister is seized of the issue of &#147;communities&#148;, and if he has an opportunity to reflect on it before we return to it, perhaps there is a way in which that can have expression in the Bill. The Interpretation Act says that the singular embraces the plural, but in this case the sensitivities are somewhat greater than the reassurances allowed for in that Act.</p>

The group also includes Amendment A231 in the name of my noble friend Lady Miller. This group of amendments probes the relationship between local authorities that are members of IFCA and&#151;the Minister tells us&#151;represented on it, particularly in terms of their representation.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09031611000020"></a>Amendment A230 is a probing amendment that would ensure that representatives of local authorities must form a majority of the IFCA. The Minister has already told us that in practice they will form one-third. That is the factual answer to my question in the amendment, and I look forward to an explanation of why that is thought the appropriate proportion. These bodies will in fact be joint committees of local authorities; indeed, there will be committees of local authorities if there is only one. On the 10 option that could be the case in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, but everywhere else there will be a joint committee of the authorities. If that is their status, the question is whether one-third is enough. This also bears on the question already discussed about the size of the IFCAs and the representation on them by local authorities.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09031611000021"></a>I turn to Amendment A230B. The Minister has already told us that each local authority which has a coast that forms part of the IFCA will have a representative on the IFCA. However, Clause 147(5)(b) clearly states that the order setting up the IFCA will state,</p>
<ul><a name="09031611000074"></a>&#147;the number of members to be appointed from each council (which may, in the case of any particular council, be none)&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="09031611000063"></a>My amendment A230B seeks to delete those words so that the Bill will state what the Minister has said will happen. If I move the amendment, I take it that the Minister will support it. He shakes his head. That is interesting. We will come to discover why he will not support it even though it states what he says will happen. I wonder if we are coming on to Alice in Wonderland legislation here.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09031611000022"></a>I will say no more about that and will listen to what the Minister has to say with interest. However, if we have an IFCA that consists of one representative from each of the authorities, and if it is the 10 option as set out and we are talking about the southern and western IFCA with its two different coasts, there would be 16 authorities on the IFCA, which means that the IFCA would consist of 48 members&#151;unless Devon has two, because it has two coasts, in which case it might be 51. That is quite a large body. It is not a totally unmanageable body: it can make arrangements; and in the case of southern and western, if that came about, it would have to function as two separate IFCAs and might have separate meetings of the people from the two coasts. It would be rather like having an IFCA for the Irish Sea and the North Sea in the north of England. It would require very special arrangements. Therefore, the intention behind Amendment A230B is to probe why the Bill does not say what the Minister says will happen.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09031611000023"></a>With Amendment A230C, councils would appoint their own representatives. I suppose that the amendment should simply have changed &#147;from&#148; to &#147;by&#148; so that the number of members would be appointed by each council. That is what I wanted to say. The intention behind the amendment is to ask the Minister whether councils will appoint their own member or members or whether someone else will do it for them.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09031611000024"></a>Amendment A230D is really a probing amendment to question who is to appoint all the other members or representatives. We have come close to discussing that but it will be interesting to have a clear statement from the Government about how it is to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09031611000025"></a>Finally, Amendment A230E in my name is quite different. It is intended to question why &#147;physiographical&#148; suddenly appears in this part of the Bill to describe the physical features of the area on the seabed rather than &#147;geomorphological&#148;. The word geomorphological appears quite a few times in the Bill but I think it is used to cover what the Government mean by physiographical. I have a series of references to where the word appears but I shall not bore the Committee by reading them all out. Everywhere else in the Bill, the word geomorphological is used . Geology is of course the science of rocks and geological is taken to mean the features and structure of rocks, whereas geomorphology is the science of land forms and is taken to mean the land forms in an area. I question why we suddenly have the very old-fashioned word physiographical. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09031611000027"></a><b><a name="90316-0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09031611000092"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> I shall speak briefly to my Amendment A231, which is grouped with those of my noble friend. This amendment seeks to explore why the Government have defined marine environmental matters under this section as,</p>
<ul><a name="09031611000075"></a>&#147;the conservation of flora or fauna&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031611000064"></a>The amendment would change that to &#147;of flora and fauna&#148;. We know that conservationists will come together with members of the fishing community, and it seems that, by taking this slightly divisive approach&#151;that is, not recognising that marine environmental matters should mean conservation of the marine ecosystem&#151;the Government are opening up the possibility of a rift for an IFCA right at the beginning. The conservation of fauna&#151;that is, the fish&#151;would, understandably, be of prime importance to the fishing members of the IFCA but the conservation-minded members might be more interested in preserving the eelgrass beds and feel that all fishing should be prohibited therein. Therefore, I think that the wording creates a division that should not be there. Perhaps the Minister can give me a reason for that.</p>

<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="09031611000028"></a><b><a name="90316-0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09031611000093"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> With the first three amendments in this group, the noble Lord seems concerned to ensure that the number of members from relevant councils is not limited, that they will be the majority of members and that each member of the relevant council will be appointed to the IFC authority by the relevant council. The number will not be limited by order. We agree that adequate representation from the relevant councils is very important to obtain the greatest amount of expertise possible.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09031611000029"></a>Here, I have a problem. Before I came into the Chamber, I thought that there would be representation from relevant councils. I thought of district councils, county councils, and single authorities and thought that the whole authority will have far too many councillors on it and not enough expertise. We need the expertise on the IFCA, but we must also have representation. I was refreshed to read the letter from the Minister, which I received just before I walked into the Chamber. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09031611000069"></a>&#147;In terms of local authority membership, it is proposed that each IFCA will comprise those single and upper tier local authorities with seashore in the IFCA district. Every single or upper tier local authority within an IFC district will be entitled to sit on the IFCA committee. The make-up of each IFCA and its constituent local authorities will be set out in the order establishing each IFCA but it will be left to the local authorities themselves to appoint their representative on each IFCA&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031611000065"></a>To me, it makes perfect sense that each local authority appoints one person to the IFCA. However, we then move to the example that the Minister gave on the first amendment of having six districts. In the north-east, I counted more a dozen different local authorities which, if they are to be a third of the total, would make for a very unwieldy committee. I have not quite got my mind round that and I would be grateful if the Minister would explain that to the Committee.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09031611000030"></a>Lastly, the two amendments changing &#147;physiographical&#148; to &#147;geomorphological&#148; are very sensible. We used the word geomorphological earlier with reference to the marine conservation zones and it makes sense to maintain consistency throughout this long and complicated Bill, so that there is no room for

The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, tightens up the definition of marine environmental matters to ensure that it includes the conservation not of flora &#147;or&#148; fauna but of flora &#147;and&#148; fauna. I agree with that amendment. It tightens the definition so that there is no suggestion that one might be more important than the other, or that marine environmental matters could include one without the other. I very much look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="09031611000031"></a><b><a name="90316-0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09031611000094"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> This has been an interesting debate. We have heard arguments that it is essential to ensure appropriate local authority representation. In the previous group of amendments, the Committee was concerned to ensure that where there are different interests within the fishing community, they should also be reflected in IFCAs. We have also heard about the need to ensure that expertise about flora and fauna and other issues should also be reflected. The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, is worried about the size of the authorities, which I also well understand. Getting the balance right is not easy. We hope that we are steering ourselves through this rather choppy water and have come to sensible conclusions.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09031611000032"></a>Although we do not spell out in the Bill what percentage of members will be from local authorities&#151;we think it much better to embrace that within orders&#151;we intend to ensure that local authority members will constitute up to one-third of the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities. The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, is quite right: I listed 12 authorities which will be constituted in the north-west IFCA if we accept option 2, which is the creation of six IFC districts. Indeed, in the southern and western districts, there will be a larger number of local authorities.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09031611000033"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, asked: why one-third? There is no absolute science in this, but essentially, we want to get a balance between the various interests who have considerable knowledge and expertise to bring to the table. One-third membership, allowing each relevant authority and the other interests to be members of the IFCA, will enable us to get the balance right.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09031611000034"></a>We will discuss this later, but because of the local authority funding responsibility for inshore fisheries and conservation authorities, the voting provisions in Clause 171 are included. Although they will be in a minority, local authority members can vote to veto their inshore fisheries and conservation authority budgets. There is the safeguard that, in essence, although local authorities form one-third of the membership, they cannot be dictated to in relation to the budget.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09031611000035"></a>I come to Amendment A230B; I think I have really dealt with the matter. It is made clear in Clause 177, on interpretation, that &#147;relevant council&#148; in relation to an IFC district means the council for a local authority area falling within that district. Earlier in the interpretation clause, it is made clear that local authority area means a single-tier or upper-tier local authority. That is absolutely clear. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, rightly asked why we cannot put that in the Bill. I shook my head because of the possibility that definitions of categories of local authorities in local government legislation  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_34"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may change in the future. We want some flexibility to provide the option of excluding local authorities where it is sensible to do so. I stress that any such exclusion would need to be agreed with the affected local authorities, and it is not proposed to exclude representation from any local authority that is required to fund the inshore fisheries and conservation authority.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09031611000036"></a>Amendment A230C concerns who appoints the local authority representation. It is implicit in the clause that council members will be appointed by their own council. No other method of appointment is provided. I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on that point. The local authorities themselves will be invited to make the appointment.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09031611000037"></a>Amendment A230D would remove the requirement for an order setting up an inshore fisheries and conservation authority district to specify who should appoint the other persons appointed to the committee, as set out in Clause 147(1)(c). I have made it clear that the other persons are members from Natural England, the Environment Agency and the MMO. This detail will be set out in the orders that set up the districts. It gives us some flexibility in case there are changes in the nature of those bodies in the future.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09031611000038"></a>On the question of changing &#147;physiographical&#148; to &#147;geomorphological&#148;, we have spent so much time debating this Bill in Committee that noble Lords have, of course, sometimes observed differences in approach to different parts of the Bill. There is a very good reason for that. I think we debated only last week why &#147;physiographical&#148; is mentioned in this part of the Bill and &#147;geomorphological&#148; is used elsewhere. This is because &#147;physiographical&#148; is consistent with Section 5A of the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967. However, in view of what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has said, I will check between Committee and Report to make sure that I am satisfied that, notwithstanding the different terminology, there is consistency here. Perhaps I could come back to the noble Lord on that important point.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09031611000039"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, raised the question of expertise in marine environmental matters including the conservation of flora and fauna. The MMO will appoint those members who are best placed to contribute the necessary expertise to IFCAs. In practice, it is highly likely that any person appointed for expertise in flora or fauna would have expertise in&#151;or knowledge of&#151;both flora and fauna, though it may not be needed in every case. We want to keep options open and retain flexibility, so we would not want to exclude any potential appointee with important knowledge and skills in flora or fauna, but not both, from being members of the IFCA, although I very much take the substantive point which the noble Baroness makes in her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09031611000040"></a>This is an important matter. I go back to the point made by, I think, the noble Lords, Lord Wallace and Lord Tyler, about members serving on existing sea fisheries committees being concerned about the future. I well understand that. We have been gratified by the help that we have received from the existing committees to take forward our views. I understand why various interested parties may be concerned about the future,

We very much understand that people of good calibre are wanted. We want a balanced membership, and we want the members to work together. This debate has been helpful in informing the Government of some of the aspects of guidance that we need to give to the MMO on membership of the IFCAs.</p>

I still cannot get into my mind how this will work. If, as the Minister says, the south-west has more than a dozen local authorities and only six local districts&#151;local districts have to be a third of the total of the committee&#151;it will have a committee of 40-odd members. The statutory members from Natural England, the Environment Agency and the MMO will be completely overwhelmed by the other 37. Other than the local authorities and the three statutory bodies, who will the rest be? We have not got that quite right, and I ask the Minister to take this away and look at it again.</p>

It would be particularly helpful because we are still in the middle of the consultation process. I am very happy to give that commitment.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09031611000043"></a>The noble Earl is right that under option 2&#151;the creation of six IFC districts aligned to local authority boundaries&#151;if there were 16 local authorities in the southern and western IFCA, that would tend to suggest that the entire membership would be about 48. That would be a large number. On the other hand, under option 1, which I think the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, favoured&#151;perhaps it is fairer to say that he veered towards it&#151;Devon and southern would end up with nine local authorities.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09031611000044"></a>This is not easy. These proposals reduce local authority involvement from roughly 50 per cent to roughly a third. There is clearly a reduced proportion of local authorities, but I would be very wary of going below the one-third level, which preconditions the numbers that we end up with on an IFCA. That is why, under that option, you would end up with a large body in that part of the country. We cannot have it all ways. Either we have an organisation that does as much as possible and has all the right interests around the table or we do not, and sometimes that means that we will have a larger body.</p>

<a name="90316-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09031611000045"></a>The Marine Management Organisation will appoint the other people to be on the committee. The MMO is in a very good position, guided by the excellent guidance to be issued by my department, to ensure the right balance. As we have heard, we want the fishing communities to be represented, but we also want to make sure that people with a concern for conservation and the marine environment will have a place on the committee. This debate sounds like our debate on Clause 2, if Members of the Committee can remember that far back in history, when we discussed the meaning of sustainable development. In a sense, we are still

In the end, we think that the construct of one-third local authority membership, the three statutory bodies each having an automatic place and the Marine Management Organisation making balanced appointments subject to guidance will probably get it about right.</p>

The first time I tabled an amendment about these words was in respect of the CROW Bill nine years ago. I am not sure which way around the words were or which side I was on. I am in favour of consistency and geomorphology is now in current use and better understood than it used to be. It would be interesting to know whether the Minister believes that the words &#147;geomorphological&#148; and &#147;physiographical&#148; are synonyms and, if not, in what ways they differ.

My understanding is that we have tried to be consistent with the 1967 Act, which is why we have used that word.

In my view, the difference is that one word is modern and the other is old-fashioned. On representation and local authorities, the Minister referred to &#147;one-third&#148;. On one occasion, he referred to &#147;up to one-third&#148;. I never know what the phrase &#147;up to&#148; means when used with figures or statistics. I assume that the Minister meant to say &#147;one-third&#148; and that the words &#147;up to&#148; were a slip of the tongue.</p>

I was also satisfied with the Minister&#146;s answer on at least one other of my amendments. I am less concerned about the size of the body than is the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, whom I thank for his comments on this group of amendments. There is an obsession with the idea that the smaller a body, the more efficient and more effective it is. I do not believe that that is necessarily the case. Big bodies can run effectively; they just need different ways of working. I am not too bothered about the fact that some of these bodies might be quite large.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09031611000051"></a>An answer to the problem of 48 representatives would be to have an IFCA for the Bristol Channel and an IFCA for the south coast. Without going over this again too much, that would avoid the ludicrous position  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_37"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in which, for example, the representative from the Isle of Wight is involved in what happens in the Bristol Channel, which would be a nonsense. But we have gone through that already.</p>

<a name="90316-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09031611000052"></a>Finally, I was fascinated, while listening, to begin thinking what reason the Government might have not to take out the words that they say will not be operative. The Bill clearly says that some local authorities as defined&#151;that is, top-tier and unitary authorities&#151;may not be members of the IFCAs, yet the Government say that that is not the case and that they will all be IFCA members. Why, then, are those words in the Bill? The only argument being put forward is the extraordinary one that some new type of local authority might be invented in the future to which the Bill might not refer. For some of us who have been involved in the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill and in other discussions with the Government about the future structure of local government, that only increases our suspicions that the Government are messing about wholly unacceptably with local government and intend to do more. I am sure that the Minister does not intend to do that.</p>

<a name="90316-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09031611000053"></a>The Government are clearly not going to invent new local authorities that would make nonsense of this part of the Bill. Hundreds of statutes, right across the board, would need consequential amendments if the local government structure were completely changed; this would be one of them. The Minister&#146;s arguments, therefore, are pretty weak. It is a bit Alice in Wonderland to say, &#147;We agree with you, but we have to find some excuses why we cannot make the changes that you want&#148;. Can the Government think again about this? If they are going to have no authorities unrepresented, why does the Bill say that there may be some? It is nonsense and we ought to be stopping the Government making nonsense legislation. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

However, they were not very good at conserving anything other than sea fish and, sometimes, not even that. My amendment, which is about the terms of

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09031611000055"></a>In my view, Clause 149 still gives the slight flavour that sea fisheries are the primary objective, by saying that the first objective is managing,</p>

That is in line with the recommendation by the Joint Committee on the draft marine Bill. The amendment tries to put a more prominent and stronger duty on IFCAs in respect of sustainable development, furthering the conservation of the marine environment and coastal flora and fauna. Several of the other amendments use different wording to that end, but it is comforting to know that concern and disquiet about this issue is felt by Members all around the Committee. Equivalent proposals in similar terms were put forward for the Marine Management Organisation, which would mean that at least two of the bodies in the marine environment would be singing from roughly the same hymn sheet and have consistent environmental responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09031611000056"></a>In their response to the consultation and the Joint Committee, the Government said that the duty on IFCAs to realise the social and economic benefits of these resources in sustainable ways is a sufficient protection and provides an adequate balance. I do not think that it does. In the previous debate on the membership of IFCAs, the Minister was keen on the issue of balance, but the reality is that the history over the past 35 to 40 years of the management of our marine resources, particularly fish stocks, shows that virtually without exception social and economic issues have taken precedence over environmental ones. Jobs and livelihoods have always had more political purchase than environment and conservation. Quotas, catch limits and issues of decommissioning and exclusion zones have been driven by those arguments. In signalling to the IFCAs that they must take a balanced approach, we have to jack up the importance placed on conservation and the environment by putting them right at the top and giving them a better profile. I am sure that other noble Lords will express similar sentiments on this issue and I beg to move.</p>

They seek to ensure a fundamental cultural shift for the new inshore fisheries and conservation authorities. Indeed, a change is being made even to their name by the introduction of the word &#147;conservation&#148;, which was absent from sea fisheries committees.</p>

<a name="90316-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09031611000059"></a>We have spoken already about the difficulty that the IFCAs will have in reconciling the competing interests of fisheries and environmentalism. These amendments go a little beyond that and hope to establish the integration of two opposing sides. When one talks to different stakeholders, each with their own narrow agenda, it is easy to forget just how similar the essential objectives of the different organisations are. Indeed, one often has the impression that they, too, have forgotten. That is certainly the case for fishing communities and conservation groups</p>

<a name="90316-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09031611000060"></a>During a recent meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Fisheries Group, the spokesman for the organisation Seafish talked at length about how one of the greatest challenges facing us over the next 40 years is food security. He rightly emphasised how valuable fish stocks within our territorial waters will become and how important it is to maintain the ability to fish them. The corollary of that concern, of course, is that there must be some fish stocks left to exploit, which is where the concerns of fishermen mesh entirely with those of the conservation bodies. The development of inshore fisheries that are truly sustainable, providing both for the recovery and development of fish stocks that have been depleted in the past and for the continued survival of the fishing industry and the availability of food in the future, should be the objective of these clauses and I hope will be the result of the new IFCAs.</p>

<a name="90316-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09031611000061"></a>My remaining amendments would update and strengthen the existing duty on Ministers as regards sea fisheries. Given our debates on Clause 2, the Minister will not be surprised by our hope that the Government will be willing to replace the words &#147;have regard to&#148;, which are generally accepted by noble Lords to be rather weak, with the much more meaningful &#147;further&#148; . The second of my amendments would also ensure that the conservation of the entire marine environment was considered as well as the marine flora and fauna. We feel that this is a much more appropriate approach to marine conservation and would ensure more consistency within the organisations that the Bill establishes.</p>

We are faced with a difficulty because the current draft of Clause 2 is unsatisfactory. The Minister knows that the Opposition, the Liberal Democrats and certain distinguished figures from the Cross Benches have been seeking a version of Clause 2 which reflects what we feel it ought to reflect. So we have to measure Clause 149 against not the current draft of Clause 2 but against Clause 2 as we would wish it to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09031629000002"></a>Subsection (2) is the key ingredient in the clause and paragraph (a) is an excellent first consideration. Indeed, it must be one of the rare moments in the Bill

Clause 149(2)(b), however, is wholly unsatisfactory because it gives equal weight to the social and economic benefits of exploiting the sea as against,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000140"></a>&#147;the need to protect the marine environment from, or promote its recovery from, the effects of such exploitation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000117"></a>The whole purpose of the Bill is to put the protection of biodiversity in the forefront of the decision makers&#146; minds; and this will almost certainly produce the opposite effect.</p>

<a name="90316-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09031629000003"></a>It would be highly dangerous to include paragraph (c) in the final draft of the Bill. It would be an invitation to internecine warfare within the decision-making body. How do you identify the different interests that will be engaged in the exploitation of sea fisheries&#146; resources in the district? One may make a reasonable fist of it today; but what will the picture look like in five or 10 years&#146; time? Before any decision is taken, Clause 149(2)(c) requires the decision-making body to take all these factors into account. Plainly there will be many factors in decision making, but to place on the body a statutory requirement equal to the other two statutory requirements to take these matters into account would be counterproductive to speedy decision-making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09031629000004"></a>As for the guidance, I should like to see a reference to the importance of the guidance conforming to an ecosystem approach, just as we hope that the guidance will be under Clause 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09031629000005"></a>I would wish to have been more specific, but, since I am not clear about the ultimate content of Clause 2, I will rest my case.</p>

However, the overlap has a common thrust of trying to add more substance to the duty that is being imposed on the IFCAs. In many respects, the duty replaces the current one specified in the Sea Fisheries (Wildlife Conservation) Act 1992. As has been echoed in earlier contributions to the debate, there is a constant need to strive for a proper balance between the interests of those who make their livelihoods from fishing&#151;and of the communities that are very much dependent on a healthy fishing industry&#151;and the interests of conservation and environmental protection. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, struck the right note when he indicated that these two interests often come together, because the long-term sustainability of the fishing industry also depends on the long-term conservation of fishing stocks. It is important that we bear that in mind when we address the duties that we are placing on the IFCAs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09031629000007"></a>The amendments in my name and that of my noble friend pick up three points to make more particular the duties that are to be specified in the Bill. Amendment A232A in many respects replicates the second part of the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor. It both looks to conservation and takes into account past exploitation as well as current exploitation of the marine environment. As well as seeking to further conservation&#151;the importance of which was emphasised by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor&#151;it also takes account of recovery. There is a difference between  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_41"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>furthering conservation and having a positive duty to promote recovery. It is an important distinction that we wish to see imported into the Bill.</p>

<a name="90316-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09031629000008"></a>There are two further considerations that we wish IFCAs to take account of. The first is that they should have regard not only to animals or plants that live in the sea, but also to those on the seashore. It might seem a small point, but for some plant life it could be very important. Perhaps most important in this connection is Amendment A233C, which defines fauna as including birds,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000141"></a>&#147;which are dependent on, or associated with, a marine or coastal environment for part or all of their lives or whilst migrating&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000118"></a>People who are familiar with the marine environment know how important it is to many coastal birds. The relationship between the resource of the sea and the welfare of birds on our coastlines is crucial. Many of us have had concerns expressed to us about the breeding failures of a number of species, and we know how crucial the link is between the availability of resources in the marine environment and the bird life around our coasts. It is appropriate that bird life should be taken account of when IFCAs are considering their duties. That is why these amendments have been tabled.</p>

It is in the same grouping and would insert a new clause amending the Sea Fisheries (Wildlife Conservation) Act 1992 to incorporate the Marine Management Organisation. That would give much more beef, if you like, to the Bill&#146;s environmental and conservation credentials. In a similar way to some of the Conservative amendments, we also wish to take reasonable steps to further many of these functions, particularly to ensure that we are talking not only about conservation but about enhancement of the marine environment and indeed incorporating the marine ecosystems as well. The amendment would change the balance much more in favour of conservation than is the case as the Bill stands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09031629000010"></a>I shall refer briefly to other amendments that have already been referred to. Amendments A232A to A233C would also give protection to flora and fauna that are dependent on the marine and coastal environment. The points made by my noble friend Lord Wallace about migration are very important. I support these matters as well as the duties imposed on Ministers in Amendment A242. Amendment A245ZA is similar to our new clause in Amendment 240 in relation to marine ecosystems and conservation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09031629000011"></a>In passing, but certainly not lightly, I shall mention the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, which would insert into the Bill and underline important fundamental principles: sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment, a much stronger use of the wording than is contained in the Bill at present. It would give authority to an IFC district so that it would have not only to manage resources in a sustainable way, which is what the Bill says, but to promote sustainable development and further marine environment conservation. That would

That is also reflected in Amendment A232A.</p>

<a name="90316-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09031629000012"></a>These amendments, as has already been said, are trying to achieve a similar objective. That is a clear indication that the conservation, sustainable and marine environment parts of the Bill are not sufficient. The amendments underline the importance of those factors in not only conserving the marine environment but enhancing it and seeking to ensure that there will be recovery.</p>

That is understandable, because we have come to the main duties of the IFCAs. It is important that we get this right. I have noted that my noble friend Lady Young, who opened the debate, was concerned, partly in the light of previous experience with the SFCs, that we had not got Clause 149 right. I understand entirely the point that she made.</p>

<a name="90316-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09031629000014"></a>We believe, and it is our intention, that inshore fisheries and conservation authorities will work to achieve sustainable development in the marine environment. We think that the duty in Clause 149(2)(a) and (b) to,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000142"></a>&#147;seek to ensure that the exploitation of sea fisheries resources is carried out in a sustainable way&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000119"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000143"></a>&#147;balance the social and economic benefits ... with the need to protect the marine environment&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000120"></a>is a strong one. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, does not like paragraph (b), but it seems to me to achieve the necessary balance between exploiting social and economic benefits, protecting the marine environment and promoting its recovery from the effects of exploitation.</p>

<a name="90316-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09031629000015"></a>As regards Clause 149(2)(c), I noted the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on internecine warfare. However, it is a case of one noble Lord&#146;s warfare as against another&#146;s understanding of fishing communities. I understand what he is saying but these authorities will have to make balanced judgments, not just on issues to do with fishing and exploitation of the sea but as regards different elements&#151;if I may put it that way&#151;of the fishing community. However, I hear what noble Lords say about whether we have this right. I understand that it is to an extent coloured by our long-promised discussions on whether we can agree a sensible way through in relation to Clause 2. I am happy to have further discussions with noble Lords, without commitment, on Clause 149(1) and (2) to ensure that we have the balance right. As I say, I offer that without commitment but on the understanding that because we have not resolved the questions in relation to Clause 2, it is difficult to have that debate, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said. As I say, I am very happy to have those discussions on that basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09031629000017"></a>On Amendments A233A, A233B and A233C, the noble Lords, Lord Greaves and Lord Wallace, propose to insert a definition of &#147;marine flora and fauna&#148; in subsection (6) of Clause 149 to include those species, including birds,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000144"></a>&#147;which are dependent on, or associated with, a marine or coastal environment for part or all of their lives or whilst migrating&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000121"></a>The duty placed on inshore fisheries and conservation authorities includes a duty to protect the marine environment from, or promote its recovery from, the effects of exploitation when managing sea fisheries resources within their district. The &#147;marine environment&#148; is defined in Clause 177 and includes,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000145"></a>&#147;flora and fauna which are dependent on, or associated with, a marine or coastal environment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000122"></a>Since the definition of &#147;marine environment&#148; captures all flora and fauna associated with the marine or coastal environment, including birds, this makes the need to define &#147;marine flora and fauna&#148; unnecessary.</p>

The Act requires UK Ministers to have regard to the conservation of flora and fauna in the discharge of their functions under the Sea Fisheries Acts. The amendments would extend the Act to the MMO; require Ministers and the MMO to further or,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000147"></a>&#147;take reasonable steps to further&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000124"></a>conservation and enhancement of marine ecosystems, flora and fauna; and require those affected to seek to balance that consideration and any other consideration to which they are required to have regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09031629000020"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that my understanding is that the 1992 Act in its present form is already extended to the MMO by virtue of Clause 11. In terms of the proposed changes to Section 1(1)(a) of the 1992 Act, a duty to further the conservation and enhancement of marine ecosystems would be imprecise and, particularly in relation to enhancement, potentially open-ended. In addition, most fishing activities will impact to some degree on the marine ecosystem, making the duty impossible to meet.</p>

<a name="90316-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09031629000021"></a>As far as the MMO is concerned, we could not accept a duty to further conservation, as that would be to favour one element of its overall sustainable development duty over the others, notwithstanding the second part of the amendment and our more general discussion about the sustainable development duty, which I have already referred to in relation to Clause 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09031629000022"></a>I understand that the noble Lord wishes to ensure that fisheries do not have an adverse impact on the marine environment and wishes to impose duties to protect the marine environment. That is covered more precisely through the various commitments or duties that Ministers currently have; for example, the conservation of the marine environment and biodiversity under the habitats directive, the birds directive and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 and, in this Bill, the creation and protection of marine conservation zones. We have a range of powers in the Bill&#151;</p>

The amendment is about the broader conservation of the wider sea, the general environment and conservation across the totality of the marine environment, not simply in protected areas. We learnt that lesson very hard on the terrestrial environment, where no amount of protection of protected areas in terms of SSSIs, SPAs and SACs stopped the massive decline of wildlife in the wider farmed countryside.</p>

The question before us is whether we have a range of powers under the Bill and existing Acts to regulate fishing to protect the marine environment to meet those objectives. Clearly, I have been referring to a number of pieces of legislation that may apply, as the noble Baroness says, to what we might call specially protected areas, one example being marine conservation zones. However, the question still arises whether, under the general provisions in the Bill and specifically in terms of the duties of the IFCAs, there is sufficient leverage to ensure that these matters are given proper attention. We believe that they are and that the duties placed on IFCAs are sufficient to do that.</p>

One shudders to think how it will work if every councillor turns up and some 30 people discuss these matters. If that is the case and they have to come to a decision, it is probably easier to word the clause in a way that people more readily understand that they are reconciling what the majority interest will probably be, as the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said, and the aspirations of the Bill.</p>

In a sense, the Bill seeks to do what the noble Baroness suggested. We start from a premise of defining the role of an IFCA; it is to manage the exploitation of sea fisheries resources in a district, because they have to be managed&#151;that is a fact of life. In managing those resources, the authority must,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000148"></a>&#147;seek to ensure that exploitation ... is carried out in a sustainable way&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000125"></a>The Bill goes on to say that an IFCA needs to,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000149"></a>&#147;seek to balance the social and economic benefits of exploiting the sea ... with the need to protect the marine environment&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000030"></a>and in subsection (2)(c) to,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000150"></a>&#147;seek to balance the different needs of persons engaged in the exploitation of sea fisheries resources in the district&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000126"></a>In the light of our debate, there is clearly some dispute as to whether we have got the balance right, and I have agreed to reflect on this. The noble Baroness has said that this will be a difficult task and that we are talking about local communities who are concerned with the environment and with the exploitation of sea fisheries. Getting the balance right is crucial but difficult.</p>

I take issue with him on one matter; Clause 149(2)(a) is clearly a satisfactory paragraph, because the exploitation of sea fisheries has to be carried out in a sustainable way. However, unlike fisheries, the standard for protecting the marine environment is different. The word &#147;sustainable&#148; is not to be found in paragraph (b), nor is the supremacy of biodiversity over social and economic benefits, which, I take it, is what this Bill is all about. Its main intention is, fundamentally, to protect biodiversity, otherwise we would not need the Bill at all&#151;there would be no point in it. In my respectful submission, Clause 149(2)(b) gets the matter entirely wrong. It is not a question of balancing, but one of hierarchies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09031629000033"></a>On the noble Lord&#146;s question regarding what the Bill is all about, one has to reflect that different parts of the Bill have slightly different approaches because

They also reflect previous legislation. However, we also must reflect that there is a balance to be brought to achieve sustainability in its best sense. We have tried to express that in terms of IFCAs in this part of the Bill, but we need to look at the issue to make sure we have got it right, and I look forward to further discussions.</p>

It was important that several noble Lords pointed out that conservation is vital for future fisheries and I am glad that the issue of getting the IFCA&#146;s duties into line with Clause 2 has been raised and that the Minister has given a commitment to hold discussions, without commitment on his part, to see if we can reach a view on a draft for Clause 2 and a draft for the IFCA duties that would flow from that.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09031629000036"></a>However, perhaps I may comment on the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy. Her case supports the concerned lobby rather than the view that the existing wording is right. The reality is that we know from bitter experience that local pressures and interests tend to focus on jobs and the economy at the expense of the environment. Somehow the fact that you will have an impact on something that is nationally or internationally important in the longer term pales into insignificance if you are a local councillor who is being lobbied heavily by local economic interests because they or their kids do not have jobs. That pressure will increase even more and, therefore, we need a corresponding counterbalance for the environment, because it will be a tough job to resist these strong pressures.</p>

This amendment addresses the interaction between the new IFCAs and the existing Environment Agency. I appreciate that the Bill is drafted so as to draw a division between the responsibilities that will fall to these two bodies, since their territorial remit overlaps considerably. As it stands, the Environment Agency is to remain responsible for the fish specified in Clause 149(7), basically migratory and freshwater fish, while the IFCAs are to concentrate on other species. This appears on paper a very neat and tidy division, but of course in the real world it will be considerably more difficult to separate their respective responsibilities. In many ways this is the first time we have had a chance to look at the question of migratory and freshwater fish.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09031629000041"></a>The fisheries that the IFCAs will manage will in many cases directly impact on the attempts of the Environment Agency to conserve many of the fish specified in subsection (7) which, as is indicated, frequently spend much of their lives in saltwater. I am pleased that the Bill gives IFCAs the power to regulate fisheries in order to conserve fish that do not come directly under their remit, but as has often been the case there is little indication in this Bill of how the relationships between the different bodies will ensure that the implementation of these provisions meets their potential. Close interaction between the two agencies will be critical in estuarial and intertidal habitats, where there is no clear boundary between sea and freshwater, and the two classes of species frequently coexist. What possibility is there for IFCAs to delegate their functions to the Environment Agency, or vice versa, in areas where this in particular is the case? I hope the Minister can give some response.</p>

I have also for a long time been a member of the Salmon and Trout Association. As the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose,  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_48"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has said, the purpose of this amendment is to place on IFCAs a duty to take account of the conservation needs of fish that migrate from freshwater to seawater and later back again. That duty is in addition to their primary duty to manage sea fisheries in their districts. The amendment would not make IFCAs responsible for the regulation and management of those fish, because that would remain the responsibility of the Environment Agency, but the IFCAs would have to ensure that fishing for sea fish did not threaten the conservation of migratory fish: salmon, sea trout, eels, shad and so on, and I intend to speak about shad in another amendment later today.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09031629000043"></a>There are two reasons why I believe the amendment is necessary. First, the Environment Agency acts as the sea fisheries committee in most of the estuaries of the major salmon and sea trout rivers in these islands. This enables the Agency to ensure that salmon and sea trout within the estuary are not targeted by fisheries and by fishermen who claim to be fishing for sea fish, whether deliberately or accidentally. Indeed, methods of fishing that are likely to catch salmon and sea trout can be banned as the law stands. Under the arrangements to be created by the Bill, this will change, and IFCAs will become responsible for managing sea fisheries throughout their districts, including the estuaries of the major rivers, and it will therefore be for IFCAs to take action necessary to protect salmon and sea trout stocks in those estuaries from sea fishery activities.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09031629000044"></a>Secondly, migratory fish remain vulnerable to exploitation by sea fisheries well beyond the estuary limits. That applies to sea trout and is particularly so with salmon. At present, the sea fisheries committees have powers to make by-laws to protect salmon and sea trout from that sort of exploitation. The Bill will give IFCAs similar powers, and it is very important that they should make use of them. The Minister may consider that the proposed duty of IFCAs to protect the marine environment already covers migratory fish. That may very well be the case, but I and perhaps other noble Lords would like to see a more explicit duty on the face of the Bill to ensure that IFCAs will take this responsibility very seriously and devote the necessary resources to it. If the Minister cannot go that far, perhaps he would give a very clear assurance that the IFCAs will be left in no doubt that the protection of migratory fish is important to the continuance of those species and that, if necessary, the Secretary of State would use powers of direction to that end.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Dear, has made most of the points that need to be made about the conservation needs of salmon, trout, sea trout, eels, lamprey, smelt and shad. This is extremely important and our Amendment A244, to which I shall speak later in Committee, addresses an identical situation in Wales.</p>

I, too, am a keen rod and line fisherman. I return most species, catch very few salmon, but go sea trout fishing

But I was dismayed to be fishing in the west of Ireland and see a big notice which said &#147;SOS&#148;. I wondered what that meant. It was &#147;save our sea trout&#148;.</p>

I have fishing interests in Scotland, but I was appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland to chair the strategy taskforce in 1997 and, rather like the Warren Committee, I was delighted to see that the Scottish Government had produced a strategic taskforce. Had I been able to be present at the Second Reading, and I apologise that I was not, I would have liked very much to welcome this Bill, particularly Clauses 205 to 233, which largely implement the recommendations of the Warren Committee.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09031629000048"></a>However, I would like to speak in support of the amendment which we are addressing now, particularly in relation to the very complicated matter that arises with migratory fish. I illustrate the problem by drawing the Committee&#146;s attention to the huge gap that exists in the situation with salmon now, as against 30 years ago. The United Kingdom puts to sea every year in the order of 10 million to 15 million small fish, smolts. That is not a scientific figure but it will not be too far out. Thirty years ago, perhaps 25 per cent might have come back as adult salmon. In other words, we were looking to 3 million to 4 million adult salmon returning to the shores of this country. Now, we are quite lucky if it is 5 per cent. Therefore, &#147;lost at sea&#148; describes what is happening to this hugely important species: important environmentally because it is an iconic species and a litmus test to the environment, but economically it also supports many jobs and a great deal of pleasure, as noble Lords have already said.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09031629000049"></a>We do not know where that loss at sea occurs. We know that it could be due to climate change, temperature, predation, or bycatch in other sea methods, and we do not know where that occurs. We do not know whether it occurs in estuaries, or in an area six miles out that would be the responsibility of IFCAs, or whether it totally occurs in the area for which the MMO would be responsible. It could be in international waters. A major scientific project is under way, the SALSEA project, which is sponsored by NASCO, the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization. It is attempting, by science, to prove where that black hole appears in the oceans. Gradually over the next five to 15 years, the scientists may tell us where that is happening; it may be due to any of those causes. It may be close inshore and the responsibility of IFCAs, or may be further out. However, genetically&#151;by DNA&#151;we will know where the fish come from, and I hope that we will find out where they are disappearing.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09031629000050"></a>In this important Bill, it is therefore important that there be flexibility in the powers. In this amendment, the power is there to look at migratory fish, not only in the areas of IFCAs but under the MMOs and further out. I entirely support the purpose behind the amendment and hope very much that the Government will consider it.</p>

He will appreciate that the Bill defines certain obligations within a certain framework, but he is absolutely right that we have enough anxieties about conservation issues on these extremely important species and need to take that into account when making our arrangements.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09031629000052"></a>I shall deal first with the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, who asked me specific questions about the split of responsibilities between inshore fisheries and the conservation authorities and the Environment Agency, which is an important dimension to the Bill. The Environment Agency will lead on protection for salmon, trout and other migratory species and freshwater fish in estuaries and as far out as the six-nautical-mile limit. Inshore fisheries and conservation authorities will lead on marine species. That is the division in the Bill. However, the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities will be able to introduce by-laws for the regulation of sea fisheries to protect salmonids and other migratory species. That arrangement exists at present and will continue under the Bill, because migratory species are included in the wider definition of the &#147;marine environment&#148;, so by-laws to regulate sea fisheries&#151;for example, to set bass nets at a certain level so that salmon can swim over them&#151;can continue.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09031629000053"></a>Inshore fisheries and conservation authorities will work with the Environment Agency, as sea fisheries committees do at present, so that appropriate measures can be taken to regulate sea fisheries in a way that protects salmon and other migratory species. The Government are at one with all representations made on the amendment about the necessity for protection, of course. Such an approach has been used in the past. For example, the Southern Sea Fisheries Committee worked with the Environment Agency to introduce a fixed engine by-law to protect salmonids within the district. The general duty of inshore fisheries and conservation authorities, along with the duty to co-operate, cross-warranting arrangements and Environment Agency representation on each inshore fisheries and conservation authority, will ensure that that arrangement continues and is strengthened by the Bill.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09031629000054"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dear, raised some wider issues. He was supported by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, and the context was established by the noble Lord, Lord Nickson. There is no provision for delegation of the functions of the IFCAs, as we believe that the model in the Bill is correct; obviously, we are defending the structure of responsibilities in the Bill. However, a range of provisions will ensure joined-up working. There is clearly a duty for co-operation between the IFCAs and the Environment Agency in Clause 165, cross-warranting of others will be possible and, as I mentioned a moment ago, the Environment Agency will have a seat on every IFCA. Therefore, while defending the responsibilities of the IFCA, we have the basis for the fullest co-operation and participation of the Environment Agency in the work.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09031629000055"></a>The substance of the amendment commends itself to Members of the Committee, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Dear, who spoke forcefully on this issue, and the noble Lord, Lord Livsey. However, we have the structure in the Bill right and this additional wording is unnecessary for migratory species because

The general duty of the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities in Clause 149 includes the protection of the marine environment from the effects of exploitation of sea fisheries resources. I hasten to re-emphasise that the definition of the &#147;marine environment&#148; includes, under Clauses 149(2)(b) and 177(1), flora and fauna which are dependent on or associated with a marine or coastal environment.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09031629000056"></a>The general duty of the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities therefore includes the protection of those species set out in subsection (7) which fall within the definition of the &#147;marine environment&#148;. That is all the migratory species. The duty set out in the Bill will require the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities to take action where sea fisheries under their jurisdiction are impacting, or have the potential to impact, on salmonids, other migratory fish or freshwater fish.</p>

<a name="90316-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09031629000057"></a>I hope that I have given to Members of the Committees a response to the two anxieties presented in the debate. One was about the relationship between the IFCAs and the Environment Agency and how they would dovetail. On the second, the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities have responsibility for the migratory species in the way in which I have described it. Having allayed anxieties, I hope that the noble Duke will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09031629000127"></a>It sounds slightly as though that could be read to mean that IFCAs did not have responsibility for migratory and freshwater fish, but we will look at what the noble Lord said in some detail before we decide what to do further on the amendment. We recognise the Government&#146;s desire to draw the distinction between the two groups, but actions that take place within the six-mile limits will obviously have an effect on the migratory fish. Part of the value of the debate is the way in which it has brought out the practical and historical knowledge of people round the Chamber, which is important for us to consider as we look further at the practical implications.

<a name="09031629000059"></a><b><a name="90316-0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031629000185"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> This amendment deals with the by-laws that the IFCAs can make. In particular, it deals with what will be one of the most contentious by-laws but also the one that will make real the efforts that IFCAs will have to make to reach their conservation objectives: the by-law in Clause 152 that enables an IFCA to limit the number of permits that it issues. Those are the permits that allow exploitation of the resources&#151;in other words, fishing.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09031629000060"></a>My purpose in tabling the amendment is to find out the Government&#146;s thinking on a fair way to limit them. I presume that the Government will have to issue guidance on the matter, or will they leave it up to the individual IFCAs? The Minister might say that this is not going to be such a contentious issue. However, I think that it will be a much more difficult issue than it is now because, as marine conservation zones are created, often inshore, the inshore fleet that operates from that area will have to go further to find its fishing area.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09031629000061"></a>The Minister might at first glance have thought that fair distribution might be by auctioning off the permits, for example. However, that might not be at all fair because the inshore fishing fleet in that area might not be able to buy them. Alternatively, perhaps it would be fair, because others would need more fuel to get to those fishing grounds. One might decide that the person who has the whole of their fishing life in front of them&#151;the younger fishermen&#151;should have a better stab at the limited number that there will be.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09031629000062"></a>My purpose in tabling the amendment is to see what the Government have in mind when it comes to the distribution, bearing in mind that the pressure on the resources to be exploited will be very different from now because of the conservation effort. The creation of marine conservation zones will inevitably mean that there is a much reduced number of places that can be fished, possibly of times of year when the fishing can take place and possibly of the sorts of gear that can be used. A huge variety of restrictions will come in over a large number of what have been traditional fishing grounds. I accept that fishing may still take place in some of them, but to me this by-law in the clause is likely to be one of the most contentious unless there is a clear way in which provision for fairness can be made. I beg to move.</p>

Once again, my amendments in this group overlap, on this occasion with the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace. However, I would like to think that my drafting meets the concerns of his Amendment A234B and goes a little further.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09031629000064"></a>Amendments A234AA and A234AB would extend the powers of IFCAs beyond the prevention or restriction of particularly damaging methods of fishing or types of fishing equipment and would allow them to insist on certain more environmentally friendly methods or equipment. As the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, highlights, this would be a useful power as regards the minimisation of by-catch. The ongoing research into new technologies to reduce incidental damage to species or sizes of fish not commercially exploitable will, I hope, soon produce  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_53"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>results. IFCAs would therefore benefit from the option of the take-up of those new technologies at some point in the future.</p>

<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="09031629000065"></a><b><a name="90316-0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09031629000187"></a>Lord Wallace of Tankerness:</b> I shall speak to the amendments standing in my name in the group. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has added his name to the one that would insert the word &#147;vehicles&#148;. That is a recognition that some of the techniques being used in some fisheries are somewhat more sophisticated than implements that might be described as &#147;vessels&#148;. Therefore, the amendment would ensure that, when by-laws are made, there is sufficient scope and power to the IFCA to be able to stipulate vehicles without falling foul of any ultra vires rule.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09031629000066"></a>The second amendment, Amendment A234B, is also intended to ensure that IFCAs are not challenged on the grounds of ultra vires. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, and I clearly have the same objective. If I have understood his amendments and my own amendment correctly, one of the differences is that his amendment relates to paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (5), which require a prohibition or restriction, whereas Amendment A234B would positively require the use of particular equipment. It would not outlaw certain equipment but would cover any technology that emerged which, if used, could reduce a by-catch. There is common ground about the need to prevent or reduce by-catches. However, without specific reference to that in the Bill, it may be possible to challenge a by-law that required the use of a certain technology on the grounds that the current provisions do not cover that. The amendment tries to ensure that, where technology provides a way of limiting, reducing or preventing by-catch, there is a means of enforcing that without leaving it to good will. That is the thinking behind the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="09031629000067"></a><b><a name="90316-0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09031629000188"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> If I may say so, that is also the thinking behind the Government&#146;s approach to the Bill and the clauses that are subject to the amendments. I am in the most interesting position of agreeing with every word that has been said but not agreeing to any of the amendments, not least because we feel that the Bill already meets the amendments&#146; objectives. We agree with the sentiment behind the amendments, which has been expressed so graphically. It is essential to making the Bill work well. By-laws have an important role to play, for the very reason given by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and other noble Lords: there are specifics that are necessary to control and to affect, which is why the IFCAs need this opportunity.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09031629000068"></a>I begin with the point about the permits. The mechanism for the distribution of permits will need to be set out in a by-law, which will require extensive consultation. I agree with the points that have been made that this is a potentially controversial issue and that the process has to be seen to be fair. That is why the arrangements, although the IFCAs are to produce the by-laws, must be confirmed by the Secretary of State. An unfair by-law will also be vulnerable to legal challenge, but we would probably say that more important at this stage is that there must be provision in the Bill for a judgment on the fairness of the by-law&#151;a judgment that must be made by an elected person, who is of course the Secretary of State.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_54"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90316-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09031629000069"></a>The amendments have provoked an interesting debate but they are unnecessary because the effects that they seek to establish are already captured by the Bill. The list of provisions that inshore fisheries and conservation authorities can make by by-law, set out in Clause 152, is not exhaustive but it is the product of consultation in the preparation of the Bill. The provisions listed include examples of the types of by-law that are likely to be required. Clause 151(1) provides inshore fisheries and conservation authorities with the power to make any by-laws that are required for them to meet their duty to manage the exploitation of sea fisheries resources in their districts.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09031629000070"></a>Therefore, where IFCAs establish the need for a by-law, subject to the fact that any by-law needs the recognition of the Secretary of State, under the Bill it is within their power to make that by-law. The Bill currently gives IFCAs the ability to propose by-laws of the type intended in all these amendments. The opportunity for IFCAs also to make by-laws which we have not yet considered but which, in an evolving situation, may be necessary in the future is also provided by these clauses.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09031629000071"></a>Amendment A234E would change the drafting of Clause 156(1) by replacing &#147;may&#148; with &#147;must&#148;. In explaining why we cannot have the word &#147;must&#148;, I am in danger of sounding a little precious when I hope simply to be precise. There is no question but that regulations will have to be made by the Secretary of State but, given that this clause will come into effect before IFCAs have been created, it is not appropriate to impose a duty on the Secretary of State to make regulations immediately. He cannot do that. We want the regulations to relate to IFCAs, but the word &#147;must&#148; would not add anything as, without regulations, it would not in practice be possible for by-laws to be made. If IFCAs are to have the power which we are expressly giving them in the Bill and which we all recognise as necessary, the Secretary of State must make regulations. That necessary and logical path follows from the structure of these clauses. Therefore, we do not need &#147;must&#148;, as it is already implicit in the structure of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09031629000072"></a>This approach is consistent with that taken in Section 5 of the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act 1966, so we are not doing anything novel; we are merely creating the basis on which the Secretary of State will make regulations to give IFCAs the opportunity to make the by-laws that they define as necessary. However, particularly with regard to permits, as the noble Baroness emphasised, and because the concept of fairness is very important, those by-laws will then be subject to a judgment as to their fairness. I hope that noble Lords will accept that the Government&#146;s reasoning follows the exact lines as those expressed in this debate, which is why these clauses should stand as they are.</p>

I am  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_55"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>conscious that in other parts of the Bill we have been somewhat in denial about lists and I have no doubt that I will be upbraided about this. In the case of Part 6, existing legislation, to which I made reference a moment ago&#151;namely, the 1966 Act&#151;will be highly relevant to the work of IFCAs. By-laws made by them will tackle many of the same issues that have been dealt with via by-laws made by SFCs. Indeed, SFCs and IFCAs will be very similar. Consequently, if a specific power is provided in Section 5 of the Act to which I referred a few moments ago but is not included in Clause 152, there is a risk that a court would assume that that was because the power was intended to be excluded, when that is not what we intend.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09031629000075"></a>In addition, SFCs have been making fisheries by-laws for decades and the sort of matters that they need to be able to regulate are very well understood. If we know that we will want to exercise a power for a specific purpose, it is sensible to include that specific power, and that is the basis of this list.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09031629000076"></a>We know from meetings and consultation with stakeholders that SFCs are strongly in favour of the long list, as it provides real clarity about the extent of their powers. They are especially keen that a specific provision is included to cover permits, including charging and being able to limit the number of permits issued. Therefore, I was not surprised that this matter was identified as being of the highest salience and as causing difficulty in these provisions. It is of great importance and that is why we feel justified in including the long list. However, I hope that noble Lords will accept that we have considered the other matters raised during the debate on these amendments.</p>

My point relating to the amendment that I spoke to was that an IFCA might wish not to prohibit but to stipulate the use of a technology. For example, a fisherman might come along and say, &#147;If you&#146;re going to oblige me to do that, it is going to cost me money and I&#146;m going to challenge your right to do it&#148;. The Bill refers to by-laws that tell you what you cannot do, but I should like to know where it says that a by-law can be made saying what you have to do. Is the Minister confident that a by-law would be intra vires in these circumstances?</p>

If we were dealing with an issue such as the noble Lord has described, where it looked as though an IFCA was acting in an arbitrary and less than fair manner, that issue would then be open to public debate because the Secretary of State would be reaching a judgment on it.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09031629000079"></a>I think that the noble Lord would accept, when he is talking about equipment, that here we have the clearest illustration of where changing technologies can impact on the marine environment in particular and even dramatic ways. It is therefore right, first, that we have the capacity for a by-law to be made and, secondly, that there is a framework in which it may be seen to be a fair and justifiable by-law.</p>

I hesitate to tease the Minister about this whole section of lists, but they do not appear to crown it by having a little catch-all at the end stating, &#147;and any other matter that may be relevant to the performance of their duties&#148;, or some such phraseology which we know has been used in the past.

I am absolutely all for localism and diversity where possible, but the least that the Secretary of State could do is to give what will be very new bodies&#151;IFCAs&#151;which have a new make-up and have not worked together before, some clear guidance about what a fair provision will be, given the restraints that I mentioned, in particular in areas that may become unavailable for fishing. I hope that we can discuss that with the Minister between now and Report. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09031629000084"></a>In Clause 153(2)(b), IFCAs are expected to prove that they could not have foreseen the need for the emergency by-law before they can impose one. Why are IFCAs being held to a higher level of foresight than the MMO? Both organisations will suffer from conflicting and lacking scientific evidence and opinions, and both will have to pick their way through as best they can. To prevent a useful emergency by-law being imposed because of an inaccurate earlier assessment would seem to be counterproductive. The best way forward would of course be that IFCAs use the normal by-law procedure, but the second-best option should surely be that the emergency by-law powers are used, rather than that the damaging activity be allowed to continue unrestricted.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09031629000085"></a>Similarly, subsection (6)(a) requires an IFCA to use its best endeavours to use the normal procedure, rather than relying on the Secretary of State to extend the emergency by-law. Again, we agree entirely with the principle behind the provision. IFCAs should not rely on an extension rather than going through the proper procedures but, again, the Bill ensures that the marine environment, rather than the IFCA, will suffer from its negligence. Surely there is a better way to ensure that IFCAs take a responsible attitude to the imposition of by-laws. I beg to move.</p>

Of course, that is impossible, but he raises a legitimate point. The question of emergency by-laws has been dealt with differently in relation to IFCAs in contrast to the MMO. Those differences are appropriate. Inshore fishery and conservation authorities are under a duty to protect the marine environment. As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, suggested, it is much better that they go through the regular by-law-making channels to fulfil that duty, but there may be an exception where a committee considers that there is an urgent need to introduce a by-law where the need for such a by-law could not reasonably have been foreseen.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09031629000087"></a>To give an example, an IFCA could introduce an emergency by-law to prevent an activity such as scallop dredging where it is found to be damaging an ecosystem and where significant damage could occur if the activity were not stopped quickly. For the most part, we expect IFCAs to anticipate damaging fishing activity and introduce a regular by-law to regulate any damaging activity. We want the emergency by-law provision to be used only where a damaging fishing activity could not have reasonably been foreseen and a by-law is considered urgent. We would be worried about removing the criteria of it being unforeseeable, because then the provision in the Bill would not be proportionate.</p>

<a name="90316-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09031629000088"></a>Why is that different from the MMO emergency by-laws? The MMO by-laws have been designed to regulate threats to nature conservation from non-fishery-related activity where an urgent need for protection has arisen. For the most part, those will be unregulated activities, such as regulating the speed of jet skiers, which may be more difficult to predict and plan ahead

On the other hand, IFCAs will be regulating threats from fishing activity within their district, so it would not be appropriate to regulate fishing impacts through emergency measures in the same way as non-fishing impacts because, for the most part, the regulation of commercial activity should predominantly be subject to full consultation and confirmation by the Secretary of State. Only where the committee considers that there is an urgent need for protection where a damaging activity could not have been readily foreseen should the power to introduce an emergency by-law be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09031629000089"></a>On Amendment A234D, my response is the same. We would expect inshore fisheries and conservation authorities to go through the regular by-law-making channels. It is important that the Secretary of State is satisfied that every effort was made by the IFCA to introduce a by-law in the time that the emergency by-law was in place before approving any extension. It is important to note that the regular by-law-making channels are a democratic and evidence-based approach to regulation, where full consultation is carried out and confirmation by the Secretary of State is required. In essence, the IFCAs are probably in a better position than the MMO to forecast the activities that need to be covered by by-laws. We need the backstop of emergency by-laws. It is rather different with IFCAs, where it may be more difficult to anticipate in advance the activity to be covered. That is why there is a more open-ended approach to emergency by-law-making when it comes to the MMO.</p>

He mentioned in particular the problem of local jet skis, which may cause concern. The need for by-laws might well be considerably broader than that sort of thing. Indeed, it may well come to matters such as scallop dredging, as was mentioned earlier. This would suddenly present the IFCA with a challenge to its environmental and conservation roles. The difficulty is that if it could not reasonably have foreseen this particular activity taking place within its boundaries, it might find itself excluded from using the emergency procedure. I am not sure that the Minister would wish for that to happen. As I read the Bill at present, it would be quite difficult for IFCAs to take action promptly and quickly in the face of a conservation threat. I note what the Minister says and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="09031629000091"></a><b><a name="90316-0009.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09031629000200"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> My Lords, with the leave of the House, I will now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the G20 Finance Ministers&#146; meeting. The Statement is as follows.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09031629000092"></a>&#147;Mr Speaker, with permission, I would like to make a Statement about the meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and central bank governors held on Friday and Saturday, to prepare for the meeting of leaders and Finance Ministers in London next month.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09031629000093"></a>Since November, when the G20 last met in Washington, we have seen a collapse in international trade. This is a much deeper and more widespread economic downturn, with every country in the world affected. In October, the IMF was forecasting world growth this year of 3 per cent. Now it predicts negative global growth for first time in 60 years. At the meeting, it was clear that every G20 country was determined to act together to restore growth, take steps to restore bank lending and prepare for recovery. There was unanimous recognition, too, that we must take action to help emerging and developing economies deal with this global downturn.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09031629000094"></a>We agreed on the following. First, to support our economies, we agreed that we must take whatever action is necessary, for as long as it is necessary, to boost demand and support jobs. Many countries have already taken substantial steps to support their economies. The IMF calculates that in the US this year&#146;s fiscal stimulus is worth 3.5 per cent of GDP; in Germany it is worth 3.2 per cent; in China and France it is worth 2.6 per cent; and here our fiscal stimulus is 3.4 per cent of the economy. We also agreed that we should be ready to do more if necessary&#151;not all countries in the same way or at the same time, but whatever is needed to deal with today&#146;s problems and prepare for recovery.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09031629000095"></a>Secondly, to support people and businesses, it was recognised that it is essential to restore bank lending. It was agreed that countries need to consider the full range of options available, including liquidity support, recapitalisation and dealing with assets for which there is no market or whose value has fallen significantly. In dealing with these assets&#151;something that we, America and other countries are already doing&#151;there is no single solution or overnight fix, but we have developed a common framework so that countries can use the full range of options when dealing with the immediate problems in their banking systems.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09031629000096"></a>Thirdly, on monetary policy, we welcomed recent reductions in interest rates and G20 central bank governors made a commitment to maintain lower rates for as long as it is needed. This is important as it sends a clear signal that central banks all over the world will keep interest rates at low levels to support economic recovery. It was agreed that central banks can also use measures other than interest rates; that is why the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and the Swiss Central Bank are currently putting money into the economy through their credit easing programmes.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_60"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90316-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09031629000097"></a>It was also agreed that financial supervisory and regulatory regimes need to be strengthened both nationally and internationally. There is a significant consensus emerging, here and across the world, that we need to reform the system of banking regulation. That is why I asked Lord Turner, when he became chairman of the Financial Services Authority in the autumn, to come forward with recommendations on how to strengthen our regulatory regime. He will publish his proposals this week and I expect his overview of the system to cover four broad themes: first, capital and liquidity rules; secondly, remuneration and the links to risk management; thirdly, how to better anticipate risks to the wider economy presented by problems in the financial sector; fourthly, rather than abolishing our single regulator, how the FSA can be strengthened to regulate large complex institutions.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09031629000098"></a>It was clear at the G20 meeting that financial regulation in most countries needs strengthening. In particular, all important financial institutions should be regulated, including those hedge funds that are systemically important. Wider regulation must be complemented by strengthened prudential oversight, by looking not only at individual banks but at how they contribute to wider risks to the economy. In future, banks throughout the world must have sufficient reserves at all times, and regulators need powers to ensure that banks do not overextend themselves.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09031629000099"></a>We must also improve international co-operation, building on the 25 supervisory colleges set up since last year to supervise banks that trade across the world. We also need a joint international early warning system that will enable us to deal with emerging problems sooner. That means working with the European Union, too, recognising the need for co-operation which we have been demanding for some time while at the same time recognising the essential role of national regulators.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09031629000100"></a>We also agreed a range of other measures on international banking supervision: all credit rating agencies need to be regulated; there needs to be full transparency of off-balance sheet exposures; accounting standards will need to improve; regulation will cover payment and bonus systems; and we agreed that tax havens must be opened up&#151;we welcomed recent agreements by Switzerland, Hong Kong, Andorra and Singapore to share information according to OECD guidelines. Here at home, we expect banks to comply fully with their tax obligations. So I can tell the House that I have asked HM Revenue and Customs to publish shortly a draft code of practice on taxation for the banking sector so that banks comply not just with the letter but with the spirit of the law.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09031629000101"></a>The World Bank currently estimates that 129 developing countries, many in sub-Saharan Africa, are facing financing shortfalls, and up to 90 million more people could fall into poverty as a result of this global crisis. We agreed that we must minimise the impact of this on developing and emerging economies, many of which&#151;India, Indonesia, Turkey and South Africa, for example&#151;were represented at the G20. We agreed that this would require a very substantial increase in resources for the IMF and the development banks having the capital that they need. Agreement on total levels of support will need to be reached next month.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_61"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 61</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90316-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09031629000102"></a>We remain committed to fighting protectionism and maintaining open trade and investment. That is essential if we are to avoid a prolonged downturn. It is also imperative that the international institutions reflect the reality of the day: the IMF and the World Bank were set up 60 years ago. Once, when we talked about the global economy, we meant the West and Japan, but not any more. China, for example, is already the third largest economy in the world. Emerging and developing countries need to be at the table too, so we agreed that the next review of IMF representation should be concluded by January 2011, while World Bank reform must be completed by next spring. We welcomed the recent decision to extend the Financial Stability Forum to cover all G20 member countries.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09031629000103"></a>The G20 leaders and Finance Ministers will meet again in three weeks&#146; time. We must seize the moment to make a real difference: supporting our economies, dealing with the banks&#146; problems and preparing for recovery. Ours must be a time for renewal to tackle the downturn and build a more sustainable future. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09031629000104"></a>That concludes my right honourable friend&#146;s Statement.</p>
<a name="time_24"></a>
<a name="90316-0009.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="09031629000162"></a>6.43 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="09031629000105"></a><b><a name="90316-0009.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031629000201"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place. A good subtitle for the Statement would be &#147;Much Ado about Nothing&#148;.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09031629000106"></a>The G20 communiqu&#233; is full of platitudes, and the Chancellor&#146;s Statement followed suit. Ever since the Washington summit last year, the Government have been hyping the fact that they now chair the G20. Real action was promised, but they forgot the inconvenient truth that summits and preparatory meetings rarely produce anything concrete, which is why they have been desperately trying to find a reverse gear in recent days.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09031629000107"></a>Only last month, the Prime Minister was quoted as saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09031629000138"></a>&#147;The whole point of the G20 is that the whole world must take action to deal with a global problem&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031629000128"></a>By last weekend, however, the Chancellor was talking only about,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000151"></a>&#147;pointing in the same direction&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000129"></a>and the Prime Minister&#146;s official spokesman described,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000152"></a>&#147;the world ... coming together to deal with the common challenges&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000130"></a>That is not exactly action-oriented.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09031629000108"></a>The communiqu&#233; issued on Saturday started off by bragging:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09031629000139"></a>&#147;We have taken decisive, coordinated and comprehensive action to boost demand and jobs&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031629000131"></a>This demonstrates an extraordinary lack of awareness of what the economy feels like to the people around the world, including in the UK, who are still losing their jobs at unprecedented rates.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09031629000109"></a>In keeping with the Prime Minister&#146;s absolute refusal to accept any measure of blame for what has happened in the UK economy, there was not even a collective &#147;sorry&#148; anywhere in the Statement. Surely when they all get together, they could muster up a joint apology. How out of touch can the world&#146;s finance leaders get?</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_62"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90316-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09031629000110"></a>The communiqu&#233; goes on to say that the G20 are also,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000153"></a>&#147;prepared to take whatever action is necessary until growth is restored&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000132"></a>What does that mean? It is certainly not the co-ordinated fiscal stimulus which the Prime Minister said last month would be a feature of the G20 meeting. We know that France and Germany have ganged up to prevent that, even if it were ever a real possibility.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09031629000111"></a>Closer to home, will the Minister explain how the Statement puts the UK&#146;s existing fiscal stimulus at 3.4 per cent of GDP, but Parliament was told that it was only 1 per cent at the time of the PBR? There are rumours of the Chancellor coming around to our view that a further attempt at fiscal stimulus would be reckless, given the state of our economy, although it is far from clear that he has yet convinced the man who actually got us into this mess. Will the Minister confirm that the Government are now taking to heart the need for the fiscal sustainability to which the communiqu&#233; specifically refers?</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09031629000112"></a>The communiqu&#233; said that the G20 was committed,</p>
<ul><a name="09031629000154"></a>&#147;to fight all forms of protectionism and maintain open trade and investment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031629000133"></a>We fully support that, but it has to be more than words. Only last November, the G20 committed itself to rejecting protectionism, and specifically to a 12-month ban on raising new trade barriers. India went home and increased tariffs on soya beans, the US introduced its Buy American programme, and our own Prime Minister talked about &#147;British jobs for British workers&#148;. Does the Minister think that there is any hope of resurrecting the Doha round? As a minimum, does he expect the G20 to go beyond words and produce some genuine bankable commitment to avoiding further protectionism?</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09031629000113"></a>The second element of the communiqu&#233; was the priority to restore lending. We have been saying for a long time that credit is the most important issue to tackle in our own economy. The Government have regularly been grabbing headlines with various new plans to restore the flow of credit, but they have delivered little. How many mortgage borrowers have yet benefited from the mortgage protection scheme that was announced in December? None has yet benefited. How many businesses have benefited from the scheme to help the car industry, which was announced in January, or the working capital scheme? None has benefited. Whatever the G20 ends up saying about restoring lending, the plain fact is that nothing will help the UK economy unless our own Government turn promises into reality. We have consistently advocated a simple and bold national loan guarantee scheme. When will the Government see the light on this?</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09031629000114"></a>Much has been made of the apparent agreement to increase the funds available to the IMF &#147;very substantially&#148;, but what does this actually mean? The Chancellor has already said that he did not even try to reach agreement on a number. The smaller countries have said that they will not contribute until they get more influence, and that is not scheduled to happen before 2011. Can the Minister give any more detail on this &#147;very substantial&#148; increase in funds, which apparently  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_63"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 63</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be agreed in detail in a couple of weeks&#146; time, and can he say what the impact will be on the UK&#146;s finances?</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09031629000115"></a>The communiqu&#233; committed the G20 to getting on top of the pro-cyclicality bias of Basel 2, which we have advocated for a long time. Yet again, however, there is neither timetable nor detail. We have yet to be convinced that there is a real consensus on this issue. Can the Minister say whether the UK, as one of the countries with banks that are very large compared with the size of our economy, will proceed whatever the state of international agreement? If there continues to be international foot-dragging, will we address the issues? There are many concepts in the communiqu&#233; that we support, such as the need for better early warning systems; but again, there is so little detail that we are left wondering whether anything will really change.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09031629000116"></a>Lastly, the Chancellor&#146;s Statement included something which was not in the weekend communiqu&#233;&#151;namely, a code of practice for taxation in the banking sector to make banks comply with the spirit of tax law. How will this work in practice? I believe that taxation needs to be imposed by clear law. We do not have purposive legislation. How can a code of practice alter that? Our tax system is so complex&#151;a point which we have continually pressed&#151;that it is difficult to see where the spirit really is. But perhaps that is just another mirror of the G20 communiqu&#233;; that is, words and political gestures which conceal the fact that nothing much will happen.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_time2"></a><h5><a name="09031634000023"></a>6.50 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="09031634000001"></a><b><a name="90316-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09031634000026"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for repeating the Statement. I have written as my opening comment that it is very easy to be sceptical about G20 meetings and the noble Baroness has made that point in spades. But it seems to me that whatever one&#146;s doubts about what flows from these meetings, the best hope of avoiding the kind of depression that we saw in the 1930s is that we have a G20-type process and other intergovernmental-type processes taking place, which means that any Finance Minister or Prime Minister who goes outwith the agreements made one to the next at the very least has to justify what they have been doing to their peers. In the absence of any external force, that seems to be one of the most persuasive ways of getting people to toe the line.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09031634000002"></a>Let us take, for example, almost the first statement in the communiqu&#233;, to which the noble Baroness referred. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09031634000021"></a>&#147;We commit to fight all forms of protectionism and maintain open trade and investment&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031634000019"></a>That would not have been said, and was not said, in the 1930s, which is one of the main reasons why the depression lasted as long as it did. Okay, the Indians have put a tariff on soya beans, which is somewhat different from a tit-for-tat protectionist war. I firmly believe that this process, flawed as it is&#151;anyone who has ever had any negotiations internationally knows the force of them&#151;offers not necessarily the perfect but the best opportunity for avoiding the worst of a prolonged global recession.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_64"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90316-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09031634000003"></a>However, it has been suggested, unkindly perhaps, that one reason why the Prime Minister puts so much emphasis on international initiatives is that it is a displacement activity from looking at some of the problems that need dealing with urgently at home. Certainly, on looking at the Prime Minister&#146;s track record on dealing with tax havens, which is 12 years of almost total inactivity followed by the enthusiasm of the convert, one can see why people might think that he is looking externally for that kind of reason.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09031634000004"></a>However, the Government need to take further action urgently on a number of things at home. First, on the crackdown on the tax avoidance of banks, the noble Baroness referred to the wonderful phrase in the Statement that HMRC is to produce a code of conduct to ensure that banks comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the law. She suggested that one of the reasons why these poor chaps have such difficulty in knowing what the spirit of the law is is that the law is more complicated. Did she read yesterday&#146;s <I>Sunday Times</I> about the way in which Barclays has deliberately sought to avoid hundreds of million of pounds of tax? It was not because it did not understand the law, or thought that the law was too complex and the poor souls were confused; it was because it knew that it could make a lot of money and did so assiduously and very successfully. How confident is the Minister that the banks now owned by the Government have stopped this kind of tax avoidance activity? If he is not confident, will he ensure that they are instructed to stop? Will the Minister assure the House that Barclays will not receive any help under the asset protection scheme until it has given a categoric assurance that all the tax avoidance activities exposed at the weekend have ceased?</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09031634000005"></a>The Government have accepted the need for reform of banking regulation, particularly in respect of large, complex institutions, and we should bear in mind that three of the five biggest banks in the world are now British. In view of the growing consensus in support of this, will the Minister revisit the idea of introducing at least a modified version of the Glass-Steagall Act into the UK so that we can clearly segregate off the casino-type activities of the investment banks from the straightforward deposit-taking activities of the retail banks? There is no doubt that the majority of people want a straightforward bank that does not do that kind of thing. It is now virtually impossible, unless one goes to a building society, to find a bank which fits that definition.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09031634000006"></a>There are two bland statements in the communiqu&#233;, which mean something or nothing. Perhaps the Minister will help us. It says that credit rating agencies are to be regulated and registered. Will that be by means of national regulators alone or will there be some kind of international framework for them? We then have a wonderful statement:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09031634000022"></a>&#147;Accounting standards will need to improve&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09031634000007"></a>On global matters, the IMF and a number of points made by the noble Baroness, the Statement says that significant additional funding will be going into the IMF. I think everyone can see why that might be

But it is strange that while numbers have been floated in the press, the communiqu&#233; was completely silent on them. Does the Minister have any idea of when a decision will be taken on the scale of that increase? Finally, why will it take until January 2011 to complete the review of IMF quotas? One would have thought that it was a mathematical exercise of working out the current size of the various countries&#146; economies within the global marketplace and accepting that the quotas should reflect them. It seems bizarre, perverse and unacceptable that we should have to wait nearly another two years to do that straightforward exercise.</p>

It is quite the contrary in my view. A considerable amount has been achieved over a short period, which will have a very real impact on the lives of people here and throughout the developed and developing world. I salute the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the other Finance Ministers and the central bank governors for a thoroughly industrious and worthwhile outcome from a weekend of work here in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09031634000009"></a>The report, far from achieving little, is full of initiatives. There was significant agreement about the importance of fiscal stimulus and recognition that that is critical to driving the world out of this global recession, but also recognition that each nation has its own issues in terms of fiscal management and that a single solution does not fit all. It will depend on the precise circumstances of the fiscal regime in each country, but the key thing is to have a continued, concerted and effective fiscal stimulus that provides demand from the public sector to absorb the capacity which is no longer being used because of the crisis of confidence in the private sector. There will be detailed reviews of fiscal stimulus and calls to report to the G20 and the IMF on the actions that are being taken globally on fiscal stimulus in recognition that this needs to be done by nearly all countries if we are to pull the world economy out of this global downturn. Similarly, there are clear commitments on monetary policy from central bank governors throughout the G20 countries: to keep interest rates low for as long as necessary and&#151;to follow the lead set by the United States of America and the United Kingdom&#151;to consider and, if necessary, implement credit and quantitative easing, with or without complex formulae.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09031634000010"></a>There was also a series of co-ordinated actions on regulatory issues. On the macro front, there is reform to the IMF, enlargement of the financial stability forum&#151;a small, under-resourced unit that has achieved a great deal and which I, and others, believe can play an important role in future&#151;and a commitment from the full G20 group to root out the deleterious effect of tax havens. On the micro level, much was achieved through agreement: on bank lending ratios, on liquidity management in addition to capital management&#151;a clear deficiency of the Basel approach to managing bank capital&#151;and on embracing within the regulatory regime the non-banks that have had such a damaging effect on the downturn of the global economy. I refer to the shadow banking sector&#151; organisations that

Clearly, there was also agreement that this is a real global challenge, not one linked to a few countries but, rather, one which the world has to unite behind to find solutions.</p>

<a name="90316-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09031634000011"></a>The noble Baroness said that she is picking up some suggestions that the Chancellor is now of the view that further attempts at fiscal stimulus would be reckless; we shall await the judgments he reaches on that in the Budget, but whatever they are, we are committed to sustainable fiscal management. That is why we have taken the quite extraordinary step of spelling out changes that will be introduced once the economy is recovering in terms of slowing the pace of growth in public expenditure and identifying tax increases that will then be introduced. There is a clear statement on protectionism, which I welcome. As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said, it is important that that comes at the top of the G20 communiqu&#233;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09031634000012"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said that people have not benefited from car and mortgage schemes. Goodness me: the fiscal stimulus has been very significant. The noble Baroness also asked, on the mathematics, why the figure given by the Chancellor differs from the IMF calculation. That is because the IMF includes the fiscal stabilisers in its calculation of 3.4 per cent. As we have previously discussed in this House, the UK economy has some of the world&#146;s most powerful fiscal stabilisers, as a consequence of our very real programmes to support those who find themselves in need during an economic downturn. The car industry and those borrowing for house purchases are benefiting from the fiscal stimulus, from a good and sensible monetary policy introduced and maintained by an independent Monetary Policy Committee, and as a consequence of our support for banks&#151;through capital, through funding and liquidity and, now, through the asset protection scheme. I have already praised the comments on protectionism made by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. His observations about the need to avoid a move toward protectionism are absolutely right, and the Government clearly share that concern.</p>

<a name="90316-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09031634000013"></a>Regarding the taxation of banks, it would probably be inappropriate for me to comment in detail on allegations made in yesterday&#146;s <I>Sunday Times</I> in connection with Barclays¸ but in his Statement today the Chancellor was absolutely right to make clear the spirit that banks are required to recognise. In my view, there is no difficulty about that spirit; banks, and all corporations, must behave as responsible members of society and make the contribution through taxes that we expect them to. Quite frankly, some schemes and structures that banks and other companies have pursued do not pass the &#147;Can I look at myself in the mirror?&#148; test, being the behaviours of people acting in a way that would command the respect of their peers and of others in society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09031634000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, also asked about Glass-Steagal. My own sense is that the report by the noble Lord, Lord Turner, which we are expecting, and other thinking on bank regulation, will mean that we will, effectively, see a move back to more specialist institutions. The cost of capital being placed behind the proprietary dealing, derivative and exotic trading

We need to put much more significant capital and liquidity requirements behind those activities, which will have the impact of dampening down their scale. I, for one, will have no discomfort with that. The noble Lord also asked about credit rating agencies, and who will regulate them. I must be absolutely frank; I am limited to the G20 communiqu&#233; and while it is, as I have said, a wonderful document of considerable achievement it nevertheless asks a number of questions. That detail will, no doubt, be provided in due course, as will the matter of improving accounting practices. We can be perfectly frank, however; the failure to incorporate into banks their off balance sheet activities and the impact of market-to-market will, I imagine, be two issues that the accounting profession will be working to address.</p>

<a name="90316-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09031634000015"></a>Finally, the noble Lord asked about IMF quotas. I am sure that he is, in some ways, right to say that we could all make a simple review, agree it on the back of a menu and sign up for it at the end of the dinner. I suspect that people are more delicate about those issues and that it will take a little longer, but spring 2011 is a target date for completing the review. With good will, perhaps an earlier date can be achieved.</p>

I welcome that, but does he agree that, since this crisis started in the banks and the finance industry, we ought to start looking at the possibility of putting limits on the leverage ratios of banks?

Although, in answering his Question, I said they were a somewhat blunt instrument, I find myself increasingly persuaded that blunt instruments have a role in regulating banking activity.

However, one glaring defect of the G20 is that it has no direct representative of the world&#146;s poorest countries, particularly those of sub-Saharan Africa. Can the Minister say a little more about the measures that may be taken at the G20 summit next month to ensure that the poorest countries, and the most vulnerable people within them, will not suffer from the implications of the present financial crisis?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09031648000002"></a>I share the noble Lord&#146;s concern about the world&#146;s poorest. That was clearly covered in the G20 communiqu&#233; and I know that it will feature on the agenda of the meeting to be held in London at the beginning of April. Our own Prime Minister is particularly concerned about the economies and people who are most vulnerable as a consequence of the downturn. We will make representations in the G20 to ensure that the needs of those in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere are not overlooked during this challenging global crisis.</p>

The reality of the situation is that there is no point in having a low price for money if in fact you do not have a supply of it. At some stage we will have to consider whether pursuing the policy of low interest rates, when carried to extremes as it has been, is really the right thing to do.</p>

<a name="90316-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09031648000004"></a>I have another point. There is a crucial difference between tax evasion, which is illegal, and tax avoidance, which is legal&#151;I am glad to see that a former Financial Secretary to the Treasury on the Cross Benches agrees with me. If we blur that distinction, it would be very dangerous indeed. If the Government do not like what a particular taxpayer is doing, the right solution is to legislate. It is completely wrong to say, &#147;We will introduce a code of practice&#148;, because that leaves the directors of a company in the dark as to whether they are doing the best thing for their shareholders. They cannot suddenly say, &#147;We are not going to do what is best for our shareholders&#148;. They can go on to do something that is entirely legal and create a situation where the Government have to rely on the spirit of the tax system. However, the tax system does not have a spirit and does not have a soul. What we have is taxation law.</p>

The fiscal deficits being run across the world at the moment are not sustainable in the long term, which is why the G20 communiqu&#233; makes it very clear that there will come a time when we have to move towards a more sustainable position. The same clearly applies to interest rates. At the moment, with a low risk of inflation, interest rates can be sensibly held at these levels. In real terms, however, if the RPI goes into the negative soon, one could argue that real interest rates are still high by comparison with various periods in the past.</p>

There is a dilemma. The boards of directors of companies are clearly charged with managing the activities of their businesses in the best interests of their shareholders, and tax is in some respects a cost that they should seek to mitigate in so doing. Indeed, I have been familiar with that in my own business career. However, my experience is that the good boards on which I have sat have always tended to hold an annual review of tax strategy and through that have sought to determine how far they would go in aggressive tax management. I believe that good companies&#151;those that are respected members of the community&#151;say, &#147;This far and no further. This structure is so complicated and devoid of any commercial reality or merit, would be so exposed to ridicule and would cause such reputational damage that we will not go beyond that point&#148;. A code to help and guide thinking in that respect is well worth a try.</p>

The third paragraph of the communiqu&#233; concerns the reputation of economists and economic forecasting. Is it not astonishing that side by side with the sins of bankers and the maestros of new financial instruments, we had a forecast last October that growth would be at 3 per cent, with which, like the Gadarene swine, all the world&#146;s economists&#151;the Bank of England, financial institutions, the Bank of Tokyo&#151;agreed? Now growth is in the negative. Is there not something that needs to be looked into in the model of economic forecasting used around the world whereby everyone says, &#147;Well, we have to stay in line with what the Bank of England and someone in the <I>Financial Times</I> has said&#148;, when they are all up the pole? Could not an inquiry be made into the characteristics of the internal workings of the City and the financial system that made all these economists march over the edge of the cliff together?</p>

However, my own experience in business suggests that economists are rather good at extrapolating trends and factoring in modest changes in the delta but are hopeless at forecasting inflection points. That is true of economists whether they are operating in commercial organisations, international agencies or academia. The answer to that lies in the fact that human behaviour goes beyond their modelling ability. Their lack of capacity to capture fear as the reverse of the exuberance that they also failed to recognise in the previous strong global economy is a real limitation. I think that economists&#146; forecasts are helpful, but they should always be treated with a high degree of scepticism. I have always been much attracted to the Bank of England&#146;s use of fan diagrams to indicate not only a central expectation of certain important metrics but also a spread of decile expectations to give a sense of whether it has a high degree of confidence and certainty about its forecasts.</p>

Do the Government take no responsibility for having held down interest rates? As far as gearing and excessive debt are concerned, were their policies&#151;for example, cutting the effective rate of corporation tax to 10 per cent for private equity and others&#151;not partly responsible for this?

There is much more evidence that people whose views one respects in this area recognise that global imbalances were the core source of the problem. Global imbalances as a consequence of the high productivity of developing nations, together with their low propensity to consume, coming after the Asian banking crisis at the end of the previous millennium, meant that large credit balances were produced in the developing world, which fed the insatiable demand for products produced by the developing world. The developed world manifested a sense of, &#147;I must have it and I must have it now and, if necessary, I will borrow&#148;, and the large global imbalances meant that it was possible for people to borrow on what appeared to them to be attractive terms.

<a name="09031648000015"></a><b><a name="90316-0010.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09031648000232"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, I have already touched on this point. I do not think that, in practice, there is a clear point at which most boards or trustees can say that that is the end of avoidance and this is the beginning of evasion, not least because many of these issues would need to be tested in a court of law. My experience is that companies that have a responsible approach to tax management build into their policies a statement that they will not use strategies that they believe are likely to be challenged by the Inland Revenue. They will also take full advantage of the facility that the Government have established for companies to discuss tax strategies with the Inland Revenue and to form a view with it on whether the tax strategy is acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09031648000016"></a>I believe that there is a good possibility of a code being effective; it is certainly worth trying. However, I also recognise that there issues that HMRC will need to continue to develop in order to ensure more clarity.

This is a battle that may never end but it is one in which we should use as wide a range of instruments as possible. Morality plays an important part in this process. Companies that engage in wholly artificial structures, often involving dozens of trusts, companies and Anstalts, in order to avoid tax need to say, &#147;How do I look to those in my society? Can I defend the fact that these strategies are placing at risk important programmes?&#148;.</p>

Employment tribunal panels usually consist of a legally qualified employment judge and two lay members, one each from the employee and employer sectors. However, since the mid-1990s there have been specific instances, set out in the Employment Tribunals Act 1996, where an employment judge can sit alone to decide a case. Initially this power applied to claims including breach of contract and unauthorised deductions from wages. Claims for redundancy payments and certain national minimum wage claims were added to the list from 1 August 1998 and 1 April 1999 respectively.</p>

<a name="90316-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09031648000018"></a>Today&#146;s order adds a further category, referred to as &#147;holiday pay&#148;. Again, it covers simple monetary matters and relates to leave entitlements under the working time regulations. Straightforward monetary disputes typically involve clear issues of law where there is no dispute over the facts. In such cases a lay member&#146;s practical experience of the workplace is less relevant. Consequently, the Government, and the majority of our stakeholders, view this order as a sensible measure that will enable the most productive use of the precious time of lay members.</p>

<a name="90316-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09031648000019"></a>Lay members make an immensely important contribution to employment tribunals. They bring an understanding of the realities of the workplace from the perspective of both employers and employees. During the passage of the Employment Act last year, there was widespread support among members of both Houses for their role. My noble friends Lord Wedderburn and Lady Turner raised a number of valuable points, for which I am grateful. I apologise to my noble friends for an oversight by the department in not consulting them before this measure was tabled, as  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_73"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was promised by the noble Lord, Lord Jones. The request was not conveyed directly to the department and Ministers. However, we would have wished to consult them, and I hope they will accept this apology.</p>

<a name="90316-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09031648000020"></a>I know that my noble friends are concerned that there should be no diminution of the role of lay members and I can assure the House that this order will not undermine their valuable contribution. Indeed, as employment tribunals continue to see rising numbers of individual claims it is important that lay members are involved in these cases where their skills and experience can bring most benefit.</p>

<a name="90316-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09031648000021"></a>During 2007-08, 3,000 holiday pay cases were disposed of by an employment tribunal. Some would not have been suitable to be heard by a judge sitting alone but many would. This order will free lay members to sit on more complex cases instead, allowing them to be heard sooner.</p>

<a name="90316-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09031648000022"></a>The majority of respondents to the Government&#146;s consultation last year agreed that lay members&#146; time could be better used. The Council of Tribunal Members&#146; Association said that it had no objection in principle to this measure provided that appropriate safeguards were in place. I can assure the House that such safeguards are already in place for cases where an employment judge can sit alone, and these will apply equally to cases concerning holiday pay.</p>

<a name="90316-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09031648000023"></a>When deciding whether a case should be heard by a judge sitting alone or by a full tribunal, an employment judge must consider the circumstances of the case and the views of the parties involved. A judge may also decide at any stage that a case should be heard by a full tribunal; for example, if the facts of the case are likely to be disputed.</p>

<a name="90316-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09031648000024"></a>The order is part of broader efforts to simplify and improve the dispute-resolution framework. In addition to today&#146;s measure, we are expanding the confidential and impartial ACAS helpline. It is available to answer specific employment questions and to provide advice on resolving workplace disputes. From April, ACAS will offer, in appropriate circumstances, a free pre-claim conciliation service, accessed via the helpline, to employees and employers unable to resolve their disputes.</p>

<a name="90316-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09031648000025"></a>For the reasons that I have outlined, the Government believe that the reform is a sensible addition to the jurisdictions that can be heard by a judge sitting alone. We are confident that it will ensure that the valuable expertise that lay members bring to the tribunal process is used where it can add greatest value. On that basis, I commend the order to the House.</p>

However, I will ask a few general questions.</p>

The Gibbons review found that the average cost to a business of defending an employment tribunal claim was &#163;9,000. In the light of this significant figure, what plans have the Government to address the problem of vexatious claims, particularly against small businesses that can ill afford them?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09031648000028"></a>The noble Baroness will be aware that the Federation of Small Businesses has called for a moratorium on the implementation of new employment laws due to come into force on 6 April, until the next implementation date of 1 October. The federation says that these laws could cost small businesses nearly &#163;800 million a year and will put more financial pressure on already struggling companies. The FSB is concerned that firms will be unable to retain staff&#151;or employ extra staff&#151;if they are burdened with such new legislation. Have the Government met the FSB to discuss its request, or have they given it any consideration; and if so, what is the likely outcome?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09031648000030"></a>It has been 10 years since the last updating of this kind. Do the Government envisage any further changes to the rules on employment tribunal composition in the next few years? If the Government have in mind areas where this power might be used again in future, will they guarantee that a full and comprehensive consultation will again be carried out before any such proposals are brought to the House for consideration?</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09031648000031"></a>My honourable friend the Member for Solihull raised concerns in another place about the initial decision on whether a full tribunal is necessary, and whether the decision can be reversed if a case appears more complex than was first thought. The guidance from the Minister suggests that the judge will take the decision, taking into account the views of both parties. Will the Government issue any guidance to employment judges to assist them in coming to a decision when one party prefers a full tribunal and the other prefers a single judge? As the Minister has indicated, there is a danger that the party against whom such a decision goes could feel aggrieved, particularly if they had sought a full tribunal and a lone judge was eventually selected. That could have damaging consequences for the rest of the tribunal hearing. We hope that such situations could be avoided as far as possible. If the Minister can reassure us on these matters, we shall be happy to support the measure.</p>

When the industrial tribunals, as they were then called, were established in 1964, they were set up with a legally qualified chairman and two wing persons, one from a panel of employers and one from a panel of employees. The reason for that was not to create what the Conservative Opposition have yet again this evening called &#147;rigidity&#148; in their structure&#151;I know from my experience in this House that they have been saying that since 1971. It was in order that the legally qualified chairman should have in his or her tribunal something that is not available in ordinary courts, namely two wing persons who brought to the facts experience from both sides of industry, in order to illuminate the court&#146;s understanding of questions of  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_75"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>law that the legally qualified chair, now called an employment judge to satisfy the Ministry of Justice, would deal with in his handling of the case.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09031648000033"></a>The Donovan Royal Commission in 1968 advocated, in chapter 10 of its report, the tripartite structure for what it foresaw to be a potential source of new labour courts, dealing with employment issues between employer and employee, and the Ministry of Labour, in its wise evidence to that commission, suggested that this was a desirable development in the structure of our law and that it should be promoted. Ever since then, as I understand it, it has been a bipartisan policy, not a party issue. that the tripartite nature of the employment tribunals, as they are now called, should be sustained and promoted.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09031648000034"></a>The reason I am speaking is that there is abroad, among practitioners in the tribunals and the employment appeal tribunals, an apprehension and concern that are shared by a wide number of lay members on the employment tribunals&#151;the wing persons, as I call them&#151;that we are groping in the dark more and more towards a system that would merely have an employment judge with two wing persons who were really added extras and not very important. It is true that my noble friend on the Front Bench has said today, as the Government said in response to their consultation, that the wing persons in employment tribunals are valuable and much appreciated. I am glad that that has been repeated, but there is an anxiety among lay members of tribunals that their functions are being gradually diminished, and this order takes a further step towards the jurisdictions that can be dealt with by an employment judge alone.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09031648000035"></a>The rationale for doing so is not easy to see. The first substantive type of case that is selected is the question of holiday pay, to put it in layman&#146;s language. Paragraph 7.4 of the Explanatory Memorandum from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09031648000179"></a>&#147;The Government believes that some tribunal cases, which revolve around the determination of facts in cases of monetary disputes, could be dealt with more quickly and simply. Holiday Pay claims often involve straightforward monetary issues&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031648000168"></a>There may be a case for having wider jurisdictions for a judge alone sitting on the tribunal, but it certainly is not substantiated by choosing cases that are primarily questions of fact. It is the questions of fact that the wing persons, the non-legal judges, are equally, if not more, able to deal with than what is now called the employment judge. Indeed, the Donovan commission&#146;s 1968 report said four times that the point about the tripartite judges, the legally qualified chairman and the two wing persons, one from an employers&#146; panel and one from an employees&#146; panel, was that the judges were, and should be, on a footing of equality. I thought that that notion had been shared by different Administrations, even when there was a great deal of difference about employment law, from 1971 until today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09031648000036"></a>My difficulty with the reason for moving in this direction and expanding the &#147;judge alone&#148; jurisdictions is to be found in paragraph 7.4 of the department&#146;s  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_76"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>memorandum, which I quoted just now. Once again, the question of a better resolution of disputes in the employment tribunals should not be justified on the basis of how quickly they deal with disputes, or indeed of matters of cost, but of whether they deal with employment issues fairly and whether the fairness of the procedure is improved by any changes that take place in the structure.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09031648000037"></a>I hesitate to mention it, but if the Government want the structure of the employment tribunals to pass the test of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, they must address themselves to the fairness of the tribunals and the fairness of the due process that their structure puts before the litigant. It cannot be done simply because a tribunal might get rid of a case more quickly than would otherwise be so.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09031648000038"></a>In effect, what I quoted from the memorandum is rather back-to-front. The determination of fact in cases like holiday pay may or may not be just as difficult as in any other type of case. If the safeguard, as the Government say in their response to the consultation, is in fact that the parties can demand a full tribunal, the idea that you are going to get a quicker process flies out of the window. Yesterday evening I was in the company of hundreds of members of the Industrial Law Society, which comprises a large quantity of practitioners in the employment tribunals. If you told them that you were going to have a case heard by a judge alone unless they objected and found some reasons, some safeguard, why it should be heard by the usual tripartite tribunals, many of them would have a great deal to say on behalf of their client, whether claimant or respondent, which might well prolong the argument on the question of whether or not the judge alone should be the person to hear the claim. Even the Government&#146;s own justification in the paragraph of the memorandum that I have quoted is then under suspicion&#151;will it really be quicker to have an argument about whether the proceedings should be &#147;judge alone&#148; or whether there should be the usual tripartite full tribunal hearing? As I understand it, that is the safeguard that the Government put forward.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09031648000039"></a>The apprehension among practitioners and lay members of tribunals is that the lay members, although they are given many thanks for their past services, are about to be pensioned off as though they were some optional extra. They are not. The tripartite character of the tribunals is the reason why they have the confidence of various areas of industry and the public service, among employers and employees, from trade unions to employers&#146; associations. It is a tribunal that has experience from the wing persons of both sides of industry and what is now called an employment judge&#151;a legally qualified chairman, as we always used to call them&#151;to try to ensure that they do not go off the rails on legal issues.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09031648000040"></a>Of course, there is always an appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, but even there the Association of Lay Members of the Employment Appeals Tribunals has also raised with me&#151;I know that my noble friend Lady Turner has had the same quantity of e-mails and approaches&#151;its worry about the future of the tripartite nature of the tribunals. My noble friend clearly explained where we are going with this order. I wish to ask her  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_77"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>two questions. First, do her advisers lead her to foresee further orders in the near future to expand the area and jurisdiction of judge-alone hearings without wing persons? Secondly, will there be consultation with the associations of lay members, of whom there is an association of employment tribunal wing persons and of employment appeals tribunal wing persons, so that in any further adventures into this land of judge-alone hearings&#151;those would not have been recognised when the industrial tribunals, as they were then, were set up&#151;does not come about without it being very clearly mapped out as territory which the Government foresee as being necessary to the future of employment disputes?</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09031648000041"></a>I have no status, nor would it be proper, to do anything to prevent this order going through. It is not the function of this House to do so with secondary legislation. However, there is fear and apprehension abroad that the lay members of tribunals may be gradually on their way, if not out, at any rate further out than they were. I ask my noble friend to take that fact back to her advisers, because it is a fact, and to recognise that the gradual expansion of the jurisdiction of judge-alone hearings will not cause that fear and apprehension to go away.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09031648000042"></a>I hope that your Lordships do not object to my taking the opportunity to place these points on record. There is very little available to read about this situation, which is considered very serious among tribunal members. I am sure that my noble friend will also agree that she has been approached by a very wide circle of people on this matter.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09031648000044"></a>We had been contacted by the organisations representing lay members serving on employment tribunals. They believed that they were being gradually phased out as they had been sitting on fewer cases. Moreover, a review commissioned by the Government appeared to be inclined in that direction. Indeed, the view seemed to be taken in the review that all tribunal members could be interchangeable. There seemed to be a lack of understanding of the special knowledge of employment issues that could be deployed by the lay members representing employees and employers. As a result of the representations made to us by these lay members, we raised the issue during debates on the Bill and had discussions with the then Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham. We believed that we had convinced the Minister of the validity of our concerns. He certainly assured us that the Government were well aware of the worth of lay members and the need for their continued involvement in employment tribunals. I am very glad that the Minister has reiterated that view this evening.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09031648000045"></a>After our discussions, we expressed our satisfaction with the outcome and duly reported accordingly to the lay members who had approached us. I was therefore somewhat surprised to see in the draft order now before this House that the Government are departing from what we took to be firm assurances about the continuing role of lay members in these important tribunals. I do not doubt at all that the noble Lord,  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_78"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Jones, certainly did not intend to mislead us in the discussions. He himself no doubt believed that what he said was accurate, and he was working from the brief that he had from the department.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09031648000046"></a>This is an important issue. An employment judge, sitting alone, is unlikely to have the breadth of knowledge and experience of the current lay members representing employees and employers. The matters that the order stipulates as being suitable to be heard by an employment judge sitting alone are likely to be of considerable importance to the workers bringing the cases. The Government claim that there has been full consultation, but tucked away in the accompanying paper is the single line,</p>
<ul><a name="09031648000200"></a>&#147;there was some opposition from employee organisations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031648000169"></a>Yes, I do not doubt that there was.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09031648000047"></a>Important workers' rights are involved. Unions have raised the possibility that some of the cases could be complex. The safeguards proposed only seem to involve a communications strategy&#151;a matter of simply telling people what all the changes mean. It is our belief that the whole idea of an employment judge sitting alone in these cases should not be proceeded with.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09031648000048"></a>When we had talks with the lay representatives during discussion of the Employment Bill, some expressed the view that, despite what the Government had said about the value of the contribution they made, there was a view within the department that they should indeed be gradually phased out over time, leaving the process entirely in the hands of single employment judges. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn has dealt in detail with their feelings in that respect. We thought that we had managed to deal with that feeling, and as a result the lay members we met pronounced themselves satisfied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09031648000049"></a>However, perhaps they were right after all and this is a first step towards the objective, and the valuable contribution that these people make to justice and employee rights is to be discontinued. I very much hope that this is not so. Generally speaking, employees have confidence in the present system. They know that their cases will be heard before people who have knowledge of the world of work. That is important. Incidentally, I had discussions today with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, who has experience in these matters. He was involved in the original Donovan Commission report, which eventually led to the establishment of these tribunals. Unfortunately, he cannot be here this evening for personal reasons, but has given me permission to say that he fully agrees with what my noble friend Lord Wedderburn and I have said. He opposes the idea that eventually lay people should not sit on the tribunals. He believes that they have a great deal to offer and he does not care for a situation in which an employment judge sits alone on these cases. He asked me to bring that to noble Lords&#146; attention. I urge the Government to think again about what has been said this evening.</p>

I remind the Liberal Democrat Benches that my noble friend Lord Wedderburn referred to the Donovan report and the way in which industrial tribunals&#151;employment tribunals, as they are now called&#151;have a wing-men approach. That tripartite function of membership is so important. It dates back to Lloyd George, who introduced tripartite membership of tribunals dealing with national insurance and other matters. He conceived that there should be a three-person tribunal with a legally qualified chairman and people representing the employer and the employee. It has a notable and significant history and I am worried, as are my noble friends, that the clock may be being turned back without adequate justification.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09031648000051"></a>Let us look at paragraph 7.4, which my noble friend Lord Wedderburn quoted:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="09031648000180"></a>&#147;The Government believes that some tribunal cases, which revolve around the determination of facts in cases of monetary disputes, could be dealt with more quickly and simply ... by an Employment Judge sitting alone to hear the case&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031648000170"></a>As my noble friend indicated, factual questions about holiday pay are just the sort of thing where wing men are most useful and most experienced in a way in which a lawyer/judge probably is not. Yet it is suggested that the employment judge sits alone to hear the case. It might make more sense if it were one of the wing men, but that would not do, because it would have to come from one side or the other, so that would not be satisfactory.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09031648000052"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Garden, from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench, said that there is a degree of flexibility. Indeed there is, and the Minister in opening the debate mentioned the flexibility, which is referred to in paragraph 2.2. If the employment judge reviews the papers before the hearing and considers that a full panel will be desirable, there will be one. Why should it be the employment judge who determines the flexibility and the question of whether there will be a full tribunal? Why does the whole tribunal not determine whether it is satisfactory that the employment judge should sit alone? I am all in favour of the flexibility that there is here, but who determines it is a significant question. It is not determined by the tribunal as a whole, but by the judge alone. I am not sure that that is entirely desirable. For a number of reasons, I have questions, and I would be only too glad if the Minister will in particular answer the questions asked by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn.</p>

Therefore, I shall write on any questions that I am unable to answer. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked about the 17 recommendations from the Gibbons review. My understanding is that we accepted almost all of them and that they come into force on 6 April. If there are any exceptions to the 17&#151;which is a rather precise number&#151;I will write.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09031648000054"></a>With respect to the question asked about the moratorium, this is a very difficult area, not least because at a time of economic crisis it is important that we reduce as much as possible the burden of regulation and other burdens on businesses. That is why we have had discussions with the FSB and other wider business organisations. It is clear that it is very difficult to stop employment regulations that have been planned for and are in mid-flow, because preparations have been made by certain companies. It is difficult both in law and in practice to discriminate between employees who work for small employers and those who work for larger employers. That is something that small employers simply do not wish to happen, because they do not believe that they would be able to compete effectively in the labour market if they were seen in any sense to not have protections that would apply if employees worked for larger employers.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09031648000055"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Garden, my noble friend Lord Wedderburn and other noble Lords asked whether there were any further plans for changes to the tribunals and the composition of the tribunals. I am advised that there are no current further plans, but if there were, obviously we would consult fully. I have already made a commitment, as I am aware that noble Lords would have wanted to have been consulted personally and specifically, and we will ensure that happens, but there happen to be no current plans for changing the composition of the tribunals.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09031648000056"></a>I wish to go back to the main issue, which is that there is in some sense a view or a desire&#151;in the rather emotive language used by my noble friend&#151;to pension off lay members or to see them phased out. I reassure noble Lords that that is absolutely not the case. I will take back to the department the strength of feeling on this matter, to make sure that we consider it effectively and properly, but I do not believe that that is the view of the department or of the Government. As I stated at the start of the debate, we value the role of lay members.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09031648000057"></a>The issue was raised that, essentially, whether lay members are used is a matter for the sitting judge to decide. I assure noble Lords that there is specific guidance on this matter, and this guidance has obviously been in place and has been working effectively since the mid-1990s, because it already applies to certain areas of employment law, including claims for breach of contract, unauthorised deductions from wages, claims from redundancy payments and certain national minimum wage claims since 1998. There is a practice that is seen to have worked effectively. In particular, the judge is required in the guidelines to take account of the views of any of the parties on whether the proceedings ought to be heard by a full tribunal or by a judge sitting alone; so there are safeguards in place.</p>

<a name="90316-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09031648000058"></a>Nevertheless, I understand and accept the strength of feeling that has been expressed. I would be very happy to take that back to the department and write to noble Lords to assure them that we have no further plans and that we value very highly indeed the role of lay members. In fact, the number of tribunal claims is forecast to increase, so we would expect their role to increase. The holiday pay issue that we are talking about relates only to 3,000 claims, so it is not material.

I do not believe that we are talking about any material impact on the integrity of the tribunal system, which we respect. I appreciate the points that have been raised, and I shall take them back to the department. I commend the order to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09031648000062"></a>I am very grateful for that frank note. The only reason I am a bit surprised is because this amendment came from members of sea fisheries committees who are concerned that when all this is being converted to a regime that will need more oversight and probably more enforcement, it seems very strange to reduce the powers of those who will need to enforce them. I await the Minister&#146;s reply. I beg to move.</p>

Quite a lot of these powers will have to be exercised in the Scottish area by the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency. On the question of powers, there is a strange phrase in the clause whereby officers have powers of &#147;hot pursuit&#148;. If someone misbehaves in their area, officers can follow them wherever they go. If officers near the border of their area see someone misbehaving on the other side of the line, it seems that they will probably have to telephone the MMO and say, &#147;Would you empower me to chase this person?&#148;. Has the Minister any views on how the officers would carry out those tasks?</p>

The single set of core powers in the Bill replaces powers in numerous existing Acts, including, as the noble Baroness suggested, Section 8 of the Sea Fisheries Act 1968. Since the new core set of common powers will enable an officer of an inshore fisheries and conservation authority to perform all of its functions in the marine area, the authorities will not need to rely on the 1968 Act powers, since it would be pure duplication.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09031648000065"></a>As the noble Baroness suggested, we have not carried over the power of a constable because it is outdated and SFC officers simply do not currently use it. My understanding is that they do not foresee using it. However, they are not without the ability to take action where required. IFC officers will instead have a power to stop and detain persons suspected of an offence. This will be particularly useful in shore-based regulation such as recreational fishing or nature conservation offences. This is because these types of offences are often committed on or close to shore where the power to stop and detain may be necessary.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09031648000066"></a>On the question of &#147;hot pursuit&#148; raised by the noble Duke, my understanding is that hot pursuit means pursuing a vessel or vehicle from within the district where an offence is believed to have been committed to an area outside an IFCA&#146;s jurisdiction. In this clause, hot pursuit of a vessel or vehicle into Scotland can take place when an offence has been committed within an IFC district. A power to engage in hot pursuit will obviously be useful on occasions where a vessel or vehicle moves out of a district in which they committed an offence in the hope that they will escape possible prosecution. Hot pursuit can be carried out on water or on land and applies to vessels or vehicles. This power applies only to Scotland, because in adjoining IFC districts and Wales, IFC officers will have powers to enforce without relying on powers of hot pursuit. I hope that that deals with this matter.</p>

I am not enjoined to suggest legislation for Wales, because we have an Assembly, but in this Bill the primary powers for Wales reside within the Bill. These amendments include matters which are highly desirable by giving powers to the Assembly to ensure that many of the Bill&#146;s objectives are completed.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09031648000069"></a>Amendment A237 relates to the duty of co-operation in Clause 165. It specifically directs Welsh fisheries managers&#151;that is, Ministers&#151;to co-operate with neighbouring fisheries management authorities. This is a highly desirable objective which has already been discussed in some of our debates. Welsh fisheries managers are not directed to co-operate with neighbouring fisheries management authorities, whereas IFCAs are. Such a requirement is crucial to securing the co-ordinated management of border areas, such as the Dee and Severn estuary</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09031648000070"></a>Clause 165 provides an IFCA with a duty to,</p>
<ul><a name="09031648000202"></a>&#147;take such steps as it considers appropriate to co-operate with&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09031648000171"></a>the IFCA adjoining a district, or,</p>
<ul><a name="09031648000203"></a>&#147;the Welsh Ministers, in a case where that district adjoins the Welsh inshore region&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90316-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09031648000071"></a>Clause 164 also provides IFCAs with the ability to,</p>
<ul><a name="09031648000204"></a>&#147;enter into arrangements with any person or body for the provision... of services... in connection with the exercise of... functions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031648000072"></a>These provisions do not currently apply to Welsh Ministers, and although an IFCA could use Clause 164 to initiate and enter into an agreement with the Welsh Ministers, in terms of specific fisheries management powers, these are one-sided. The Welsh Ministers do not at present have a duty to co-operate with IFCAs whereas the situation in the Bill is that IFCAs must co-operate with Welsh Ministers. So we are trying to put that right.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09031648000073"></a>The duty to take steps to co-operate with neighbouring fisheries managers should help to ensure that more effective, efficient and ecologically meaningful protection is achieved at border areas, such as the Dee and Severn estuary. This amendment should be straightforward as a principle, because comparable duties already exist in the Bill for Welsh Ministers. For example, in the marine planning provisions, Welsh Ministers are under a duty to take all reasonable steps to ensure that their plan is compatible with related neighbouring plans.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09031648000074"></a>Amendment A244 is quite detailed. The new clause extends duties to Welsh Ministers which are the same as those imposed in relation to IFCAs. It places sustainability, conservation and enhancement responsibilities on Welsh Ministers. It covers an immense amount of territory. To outline it, it is headed:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="09031648000184"></a>&#147;Duties of Welsh Ministers in relation to management of inshore fisheries&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031648000075"></a>It goes through a series of subsections, with Welsh Ministers managing the exploitation of sea fisheries in Wales, through exploitation of the resources of sea fisheries, conservation enhancement, and the different needs of persons engaged in the exploitation of sea fisheries resources in the district.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_84"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 84</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90316-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09031648000076"></a>It refers to animals, plants, and marine flora and fauna. It also refers to duties concerning migratory fish. In subsection (4) there is reference to,</p>
<ul><a name="09031648000205"></a>&#147;salmon, trout, eels, lampreys, smelt and shad&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031648000172"></a>We debated that on Amendment A233 earlier on. So this mirrors that amendment, and imposes these duties on Welsh Ministers, so that we can have seamless responsibilities between the IFCAs and the Welsh Ministers and ensure that the protection measures are carried out to the same standard.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09031648000077"></a>In Wales there is now concern that if duties such as these are imposed on the Assembly, and in our view rightly so, there is a huge question of funding. We know, for example, that Defra has set aside &#163;5 million of new money for sea fisheries committees and for IFCA work associated with the creation of the MMO in England. We are very concerned in Wales that the UK Government, if they want a seamless standard between England and Wales, should provide sufficient funding to ensure that this can occur. I know that this is a problem which occupies the members of the current sea fisheries committees. There are a number of duties which come into this; for example, with regard to protection vessels which involve considerable investment. Apparently the two vessels are in need of replacement in the two areas concerned at the moment in Wales. Stakeholder involvement, the transfer of management powers, scientific input, and the participation in EU marine conservation responsibilities are considerable costs which the Welsh Assembly Government will incur. It is hoped that it will get some assistance to do this properly. Amendment A244 covers those responsibilities.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09031648000078"></a>Our other amendment is Amendment A245, which would ensure that an annual report is produced by the Welsh Assembly Government so far as fisheries are concerned. At present, Welsh fisheries managers and Welsh Ministers are under no duties in the Bill equivalent to those of IFCAs or the Secretary of State to collect information relating to the exploitation of sea fisheries or formally to report on the discharging of fisheries management functions. Clauses 166, 168 and 169 require IFCAs to collect information and publish annual plans as well as an annual report. Clause 174 requires the Secretary of State to report to Parliament every four years on the conduct and operation of the IFCAs. The result of the lack of equivalent requirements is that fisheries management in Wales will be less automatically accountable and accessible than the regime in England. There are fewer guarantees that adequate information will be available on the exploitation of sea fisheries to inform management and the consideration of marine environmental matters as part of fisheries management.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09031648000079"></a>Welsh Ministers are under a duty in Clause 120 to report to the National Assembly on progress in securing a network of marine protected areas, so the Bill already contains precedents for reporting duties on Welsh Ministers. Therefore, our requirement for the responsibilities for producing reports in Wales for the inshore fisheries sector seems reasonable.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09031648000080"></a>There are two other amendments in the group that are not ours. If I may comment after they have been spoken to, I would welcome that opportunity. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09031648000082"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, has brought up some important concerns about the effect of devolution on the effective management of inshore fisheries outside the control of the Secretary of State. The control given to Welsh Ministers means that they could pursue completely different and possibly contradictory policies in their inshore fisheries. Since the whole purpose of this Bill is to ensure a co-ordinated and consistent approach to the sustainable development of the marine environment, it is not surprising that we have spent so long debating its provisions that call the success of that objective into question. In some ways, part of the answer to the noble Lord&#146;s question is bound to concern what powers are expected to be used by or available to the Welsh Assembly in producing its own measures for conducting marine management within the Welsh area. Of course, we may not be able to know in detail, but we would be interested if the Minister could throw any light on that question.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09031648000083"></a>As the noble Lord&#146;s Amendment A237 highlights, co-ordination is of course important where the responsibilities meet, but also critical and unfortunately not so likely to happen automatically at a higher level. The marine environment is, of course, an interrelated whole, and increasing the number and complexity of bodies exercising control on it makes maintaining that overall consistency much harder. The noble Lord&#146;s amendments address that concern quite neatly&#151;even down to his last point about whether the Welsh Assembly would be required to produce a report&#151;while still accepting the reality of devolution by ensuring consistency of duty, rather than of implementation, and proper transparency. We therefore support the amendments.</p>

I have a little information that I wish to impart with regard to one amendment and I want to be severely critical of another amendment, but I want to be extremely supportive of a third amendment. I do not know which order I ought to do it in&#151;good news last, I think.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09031648000085"></a>Let me deal first with the factual position that I want to cover. The noble Lord asked about the powers of Welsh Ministers, and Amendment A244 addresses the question. Welsh Ministers have devolved powers for the management and enforcement of fisheries in Wales and are responsible for ensuring compliance in Wales with EC commitments and obligations. Further to that responsibility, the National Assembly for Wales and Welsh Ministers&#151;as with all Ministers of the Crown&#151;are bound by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 to have regard, so far as is consistent with the proper exercise of those functions, to the purpose of conserving biological diversity in accordance with the UN Environment Programme Convention on Biological Diversity of 1992. They are also specifically bound when exercising sea fisheries&#146; functions to have regard to the conservation of marine

Also, as the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, knows only too well, Welsh Ministers have a duty placed on them by the Government of Wales Act 2006 to produce a sustainable development scheme. I might also add that the Welsh model will rely for funding on existing Welsh government funding schemes for fisheries. The marine environment duties have yet to be fully identified but will be costed and factored into existing budgets. That, I hope, clarifies our response to Amendment A244.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09031648000086"></a>I am critical of Amendment A245. I do not know whether I dare upbraid him in these terms, but the noble Lord seems to be guilty of trying to appropriate to Parliament what is devolved to the Welsh National Assembly. After all, Welsh Ministers are accountable to the Assembly as to the exercise of their powers and responsibilities under Welsh, UK and European legislation. It is therefore for the National Assembly for Wales to decide the manner in which Welsh Ministers discharge their functions, including the need or otherwise for Welsh Ministers to report annually to the National Assembly for Wales on fisheries matters. I am therefore critical of the proposal that the proper role of the National Assembly for Wales in this regard should be subject under this Bill to Parliament, as the noble Lord suggests with his amendment.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09031648000087"></a>Far from being critical of Amendment A237, I am glad that the noble Lord raised the issue. I cannot accept the amendment in its entirety at present, but I notice that it highlights an inconsistency in the Bill whereby inshore fisheries and conservation authorities whose districts adjoin the Welsh inshore region are subject to a duty to co-operate with the Welsh Ministers, who have no reciprocal duty. That is the burden of a well made point. I would like to see how we can address that inconsistency and repair the deficiency. On that basis of one win, one loss and one draw, I hope that the noble Lord can withdraw his amendment.</p>

I am pleased that he has taken on board the point about reciprocal powers between IFCAs and Welsh Ministers. That can be accepted perhaps not precisely in the same form, but I hope that it may find its way into the Bill. I certainly have never had any ambitions to take powers away from the National Assembly for Wales and I would not wish to do that; I have many more thoughts about giving the Assembly more powers. Given the interpretation that the Minister places on Amendment A245, the Assembly is well capable of producing the report and I am sure that it will do so. Perhaps I am harking back to both the Government of Wales Act 1999 and the Government of Wales Act 2006, where we seemed to be insisting on reports on one or two matters. I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s reply and I am glad that we have stirred up some positive vibes in respect of the amendments. I accept what he says about Amendment A245. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

They will of course be financed primarily by the local authorities involved but, given that a local authority may well have given an indication of the size of precept that it is going to make to an IFCA in any one year so that it can budget, it is not unreasonable that an IFCA should be allowed to borrow money to pursue something that it knows it will need to do&#151;for example, buy a new patrol boat. It might want to buy something in advance that would have to be financed over two or three years. By denying IFCAs the right to borrow money against a certain amount that they know they will get from the local authorities, the Government seem to be denying them the freedom to use their resources as best they can. In moving this amendment, I am seeking to find out what on earth the Government&#146;s thinking is here. I beg to move.</p>

I gave notice of my intention to oppose Clause 171 in order to allow the financial matters to be probed in a general way. I do not want to pursue it any further than that because the information that will be supplied by the Government in responding to these amendments will probably be sufficient.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09031648000091"></a>I support the amendments put forward by my noble friend Lady Miller, who puts her finger on an important issue. If IFCAs need to carry out capital spending, how will that capital spending be financed? If it is substantial capital spending and more than just a penny or two, I think that there is an issue.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09031648000092"></a>My Amendments A240A, A240B and A240C concern some of the details of the financing arrangements. The first one is intended simply to probe whether IFCAs will be able to have any sources of finance other than their constituent local authorities. It is a simple question. The Bill currently says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="09031648000186"></a>&#147;The expenses incurred by the authority for an IFC district are to be defrayed by the relevant council or councils&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031648000173"></a>Are there to be no other sources of money of any kind?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09031648000093"></a>Amendment A240B would leave out lines 13 and 14. It is intended to probe how the calculations will take place, what the Government&#146;s views are about how the calculations could take place and which proportion of the expenses are to be paid by each of the constituent authorities. The Bill reads:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="09031648000187"></a>&#147;The order may provide for the portion of the expenses payable by a relevant council to be calculated by reference to any circumstances whatsoever&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031648000174"></a>What sort of circumstances do the Government have in mind as to how this will be worked out?</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09031648000094"></a>Amendment A240C concerns an apparently minor matter of wording but it relates to the extremely important matter of the local authority members of an IFCA being able, as the Bill suggests, to veto a levy on the local authorities. Presumably, it is unlikely that the authority would demand that the levy be higher than that proposed by the whole membership of the IFCA. Therefore, it would presumably be a requirement by local authorities that the IFCA&#146;s expenses be reduced, perhaps in line with government financial constraints on local authorities. My amendment would make the provision slightly more positive. It would make the Bill read that the decision,</p>
<ul><a name="09031648000206"></a>&#147;must be approved by a majority&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031648000175"></a>of local authorities, rather than,</p>
<ul><a name="09031648000207"></a>&#147;may be vetoed by a vote&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031648000095"></a>There is a significant difference. If there is a simple veto, the normal procedure would be that the IFCA decides what the levy will be for a particular year and a special procedure of veto must then be invoked by the local authorities. I suggest that it should as a matter of course each year be put to the local authority representatives, so this is a positive rather than a negative provision. People may say that it does not make any difference in practice. However, it may well make a considerable difference to how this operates.</p>

Each IFCA will prepare a budget and will receive sufficient funds to discharge its commitments from local authorities and from its share of the &#163;5 million to be given by Defra. If the MMO, the Environment Agency, Natural England or another body delegates any additional functions to IFCA, no doubt funds will follow. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, mentioned capital commitments. Capital commitments are not made up on the spur of the moment, so there will be time for the next budget to be prepared for those capital commitments to be included and voted on accordingly, I should have thought.</p>

<a name="90316-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09031648000097"></a>Amendment A240B, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, addresses an interesting part of Clause 171, which refers to &#147;any circumstances whatsoever&#148;. That is an all-embracing, sweeping statement. It could mean anything. I, too, would like to probe the Minister on that. What is the rationale behind it? Will the same method be used as is used with the sea fisheries committees? What will be the norm? Will it be based on the number of the electorate or the number of miles of seashore for each area? How will it be done? What will be those other circumstances? That brings us to the question of who has the deciding vote on financial matters. We certainly subscribe to the principle that the body providing the funding&#151;the councils&#151;should have the final say. Those who have to account for the spending of public money to taxpayers should be able, by use of the veto, to maintain control over that money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09031648000099"></a>On the face of it, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, suggested, there are benefits from inshore fisheries and conservation authorities being able to borrow money to purchase a new patrol vessel, for instance, which can cost a few million pounds. However, we must consider two issues. In practice, because parent local authorities would have the ultimate responsibility for any inshore fisheries and conservation authority borrowing, there is not much to be gained from giving them a direct power to borrow. Parent local authorities would still have a veto over any borrowing, and local government finance rules mean that borrowing would still count against the parent authority, given its legal responsibility to repay interest and capital via inshore fisheries and conservation authority budgets. Having their own borrowing powers would not mean a great deal to the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities. They cannot bypass local authority approval for their spending plans in that way.</p>

<a name="90316-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09031648000100"></a>Secondly, codes of practice for local government finance would mean that the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities would be very constrained in the amount that they could borrow. A loan requires that annual revenue of 10 per cent of the value of the loan is available for repayment. This would mean that the authorities would only be able to borrow relatively small amounts, yet the noble Baroness gave the example of a very significant purchase, a new patrol boat. There is little to be gained from the authorities having borrowing powers, but it would certainly complicate the budget process. There would need to be both agreement of the total budget by the Committee and agreement about any borrowing.</p>

<a name="90316-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09031648000101"></a>Our preferred option is that the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities work closely with their parent local authorities to obtain the necessary funding from them, particularly if it came to anything such as large capital spending for a new patrol boat. This approach works pretty well at present. In the north-east the Sea Fisheries Committee and the local authority work closely together to enable the Sea Fisheries Committee to operate effectively, so we have a model for effective action. We do not see many gains from the proposal in this amendment.</p>

<a name="90316-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09031648000102"></a>Amendment A240A, which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, spoke to, would mean that where an expense incurred by an inshore fisheries and conservation authority is covered by a means other than local authority funding, the relevant local authorities would not be required to defray that expense. I listened carefully to what the noble Lord said about this. I assure him that it is possible for the IFCAs to get money from other sources. They can get it through sale-of-permit schemes, which we allow under Clause 152. There are also other services that they offer, such as enforcement for a fishery, which would potentially bring in revenue. They have sources of revenue other than the parent authority. I want to indicate the positive aspect of that. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, enjoined the Government to be positive, because he said that he would be positive about these issues. There is a positive dimension.</p>

<a name="90316-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09031648000103"></a>As for authorities, under the noble Lord&#146;s proposal, local authorities would not be required to cover expenses  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_90"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 90</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because another means of cost recovery is available to them. However, this is implicit in Clause 171 as it stands, because the expense incurred, as in the case of a charging permit scheme, for example, would be defrayed by charging for each permit. Therefore, it would not be the responsibility of the relevant councils. We have that covered and do not see that the amendment adds anything to the clause, whereas it contributes an element of uncertainty. That is why I would defend the Bill as it stands.</p>

<a name="90316-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09031648000104"></a>Amendment A240B is interesting. It leaves out the final sentence in Clause 171(2), which clarifies that the order that establishes an inshore fisheries and conservation district can provide for the expenses to be split between the local authorities in a district by reference to any circumstance. The noble Lord said that here he was probing about the distribution of costs. Let me explain why this sentence is there and why I will resist its excision. The sentence is necessary because it clarifies that the order can go further than simply requiring each council to pay a portion of the expense incurred by the inshore fisheries and conservation authority, but that this portion can be calculated according to circumstance. It can be calculated, for example, according to the length of the coastline&#151;a suggestion that emerged during this short debate. It is important to include this sentence so that we preserve flexibility about how local authority contributions will be calculated, partly because we have not entirely made up our minds about how they will be calculated yet&#151;it is a difficult issue, as the noble Lord recognises; that is why he has alighted on it&#151;and partly because there will be an element of flexibility, whatever means of allocation is decided on. The means will need the support of the relevant local authorities and will need to be appropriate and fair.</p>

<a name="90316-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09031648000105"></a>Amendment A240C proposes changing the wording in Clause 171(4), which says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09031648000208"></a>&#147;an IFC authority&#146;s expenses ... may be vetoed by a vote of ... members of a relevant local council&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031648000176"></a>by inserting,</p>
<ul><a name="09031648000209"></a>&#147;must be approved by a majority&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031648000177"></a>The concern behind the amendment is obvious&#151;the noble Lord expressed it in terms of the local authorities having to approve the payment of expenses by a majority vote&#151;but we already have this. We agree with him that it is right that the local authority should have a say about this, so it must have a vote. We should remember, however, that the budget for each inshore fisheries and conservation authority will be proposed, discussed and voted on by the committee as a whole. If accepted, the budget can then be put to the local authority members for approval, although in most cases this vote will be unnecessary: it being clear that the local authority members are content with the size of the budget. In this way, local authority members of committees will, by majority vote, be able to veto the total amount of IFCA expenditure. They are in a position to do so by dint of their membership of the authority. This will ensure control over the overall size of the budget by local authority committee members. Under the clause, the voting will be by majority vote, so the Bill already provides for what the noble Lord&#146;s

In practice, he is quite right; the fact that local authority representatives can veto the budget will mean that when it is worked out in any sensible system, it will be worked out consensually to ensure that there is no veto. However, there may be occasions when there is a veto, and my point is whether there should be a special procedure to invoke the veto or whether there should be an automatic stage in agreeing the budget; the budget is put together, is agreed by the majority of the committee of the IFCA, and then, as a further stage, is subject to agreement by the local authorities. If things are done well, such agreement will be formal, but that is my point; it is perhaps a matter of procedure rather than what should be in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09031648000107"></a>I am grateful for what the Minister said about the other points, which I understand. I do not want to pre-empt what my noble friend might say, but I really want to understand&#151;I do not yet understand this&#151;how the capital expenditure will work. How will a large item of capital expenditure that is necessary for the functioning of an IFCA, whether it is for a building, a boat or anything else, be financed in practice? It is quite clear that, if it is big enough, it will not be financed simply out of revenue in a particular year. I do not think that it has been explained yet. As I say, I may be pre-empting my noble friend&#146;s amendments, so I will sit down and let her have her say.</p>

The day-to-day expenditure may be a source of argument between local authorities that eventually come to an agreement, one hopes. The Minister has optimistically dismissed my noble friend&#146;s amendment. However, there is a very real issue with capital expenditure and I do not think that we have heard a sufficient explanation from the Minister. In part, this is an issue of the Government trusting local government and the IFCAs to come up with appropriate solutions. It seems micromanagement to include in the Bill something such as this which cannot be done. Whether the IFCA or the local authority borrows the money, it will be subject to the same public spending rules, so why deny them the right to do it? I am sure that before Report the Minister will be able to afford me a better explanation of where the capital expenditure will come from.</p>

The noble Baroness is likely to say that that is one stage removed from the actors on the ground, the conservation authorities. But, again for the reasons I have identified, we do not think that there is any point in giving them powers to borrow when they are automatically subject to the position that the local authorities responsible will take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09031648000110"></a>This is a productive debate in terms of identifying how it should work, but it is not productive in the sense that we could be persuaded of the only alternative to our model which is being countenanced; namely, that the conservation authorities should have the power to raise money, presumably without the veto from the local authorities. Surely, that does not make sense. If there is a veto from the local authorities, we are back to where the Government say we are, which is why I hope the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

It would worry me if IFCAs could raise revenue through enforcement. Certainly, if money for patrol boats and whatever came from local authorities, I would be worried that overenthusiastic enforcement could lead to the sort of situation we have with speed cameras and that the whole system would be used just as a revenue-raising exercise, which we should avoid.</p>

He will remember that I have had to answer a few questions on how cameras work and whether they are revenue raising, and he will recall how much I denied that assertion. Local authorities were not beneficiaries as regards that form of transport. The Government agree with the noble Lord that the capital expenditure involved in the purchase of a patrol boat is substantial. The limited additional resources that the conservation authorities can get from permits should not to be posited as a possible fund from which capital expenditures of such magnitude could ever be envisaged. That is why I return to the Government&#146;s position that funding is the responsibility of the local authorities.</p>

My only problem is with the Minister saying that, on capital spending, he prefers the government scheme to IFCAs being able to borrow money. Personally, I have not heard enough to understand the government scheme or how it will work. If an IFCA has up to 16 local authorities in it, how will they all get together to borrow any necessary money or to make arrangements to be repaid for it from revenue? I can see how it could work, as local authorities, by and large, behave sensibly when they are faced with a problem and have to do something, but it would be nice to understand how the Government think their scheme will work.</p>

I see that I shall not persuade the Minister tonight, but my years in local government getting various capital schemes funded lead me to conclude that the Government&#146;s design comes from those who have not had to operate within those constraints and, therefore, do not quite know what they are.

Because I feared lest some draconian new prohibitions were proposed against our poor, hard-pressed fishermen, I examined Part 7, Chapter 1 and Schedule 15 rather carefully, checking their provisions with the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967, and soon found that they made no sense at all as in many cases the words that this Bill seeks to alter are not in the 1967 Act. Obviously that Act had been amended, and indeed on asking a librarian here, I found out that it has. The librarian kindly printed out for me 16 pages of amended and additional clauses, the results of innumerable statutory instruments and miscellaneous Acts. This he was able to do courtesy of an organisation called LexisNexis Butterworths to which the Library subscribes, no doubt at vast expense, and without whose help it would have been almost impossible to discover the present state of the law.</p>

<a name="90316-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09031648000122"></a>By the time the law has been amended yet again by the Bill before us, it will be a complete pig&#146;s breakfast, and I pity anyone who needs to know what it is. I then examined Chapter 2 and found that the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 had also been amended, although not quite so much. In Chapters 3 and 4, the relevant Acts were more recent and had not in the past suffered quite so much mauling, although the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 had been amended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09031648000123"></a>What I am asking the Minister to do, immediately after this Bill has passed through both Houses, is introduce a consolidation Bill to marry Part 7 to all those Acts, amended and otherwise, which Part 7 seeks to amend; or if that is too much like hard work, at least to marry Chapter 1 and Schedule 15, and perhaps Chapter 2, to their predecessors. Chapters 3 and 4 are less of a mess but it would be nice if the Government were to do the job properly while they are about it. Of course, in the process, Part 7, or the relevant chapters from it, could be repealed. It cannot be right to produce legislation which is such a mess that only a rich clairvoyant with a LexisNexis crystal ball can discover what the law is. At the very least Part 7, Chapter 1, should make it clear that it is the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967, as already amended, that is being amended and so on. But even that is not going to help the fishermen on the boat very much.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09031648000124"></a>I wish that were all but there is one sentence in Clause 187(2) on page 108 which reads:</p>

<p><a name="09031648000178"></a>Perhaps I am very thick but as far as I am concerned that is complete gobbledegook and I wonder how many Members of the Committee can understand it. I began to get a faint inkling when I read the notes to clauses, but the fisherman on the boat does not have the notes to clauses handy, any more than he has LexisNexis Butterworths handy. No doubt the Minister can understand it and perhaps he will be kind enough to tell the Committee what it means. It should be put into plain English even if it is part of an Act of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09031648000127"></a>The sheer number of amendments helps to support the noble Lady&#146;s argument that legislation relating to fisheries is complicated and confusing. New provisions and complex amendments to existing legislation mean that clarity is distorted and it is difficult for people to understand their legal position and to comply with the law. That is at the heart of the noble Lady&#146;s argument. The new clauses in this Bill mean that another layer of complexity is added to fisheries legislation which will serve to make compliance with the law more difficult. Legislation cannot be useful if those it is intended to guide and limit are not sure where the boundaries are. I therefore support the noble Lady&#146;s call for a consolidated body of fisheries legislation. There are a huge raft of measures contained in the provisions to which she objects&#151;the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act, the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act, the migratory and freshwater fish regulations&#151;and the repeal of the obsolete fisheries enactments. While I am supportive of many of the clauses, I am also aware that their success depends on people being able to understand them and so to obey. With this in mind, I agree with the noble Lady&#146;s suggestion that we must find a way to clarify fisheries legislation.</p>

Does he agree that there is a potential problem here? Does he agree that a consolidated version of all fisheries legislation might be useful? Do the Government have plans to make the legislation easier to understand? We all look forward to his response.</p>

My own experience has been in the NHS, which also has suffered from the fact that considerable numbers of amendments have been made over the past 40 years.

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09031648000131"></a>The noble Lady referred to Clause 187(2), which does take some understanding.

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09031648000132"></a>The Government have given serious consideration to producing new consolidated legislation. Unfortunately, so far it has not proved possible to produce a consolidated measure. The Bill has been our best opportunity to introduce necessary changes to fisheries legislation. Our problem is that if we miss this opportunity, it may be a considerable time before we will be able to make some of the changes that the Bill provides for. The amendments in Chapter 1 of Part 7 are relatively minor, and in these circumstances there is a lesser case for consolidation. Amending the Acts makes it easier for the reader to focus on the changes being made.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09031648000133"></a>As these are mainly amendments to enabling powers available to Ministers, there is less of a requirement to issue guidance; but we will ensure that a summary of the key changes is published on the Defra website.

<a name="09031648000139"></a><b><a name="90316-0014.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09031648000279"></a>Lord Wallace of Tankerness:</b> There is a series of amendments in this group, which I will briefly speak to. Amendment 245A has echoes of an amendment that we debated earlier today with regard to by-laws that the IFCAs could make. By now, though, we have moved on to a new part of the Bill, and we are dealing with regulations that the Secretary of State can make in relation to England or that Welsh Ministers can make in relation to Wales.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09031648000140"></a>The first amendment is again to make it clear in statute that regulations regarding equipment, methods or materials not only might relate to the prohibition of certain fishing gear but could actually require certain gear to be used. As I indicated earlier&#151;I will not elaborate more&#151;there is, as we are all well aware, a considerable amount of advanced technology in this field as well as research being done to try to ensure that new techniques and equipment are brought forward that will seek to eliminate or reduce by-catch. We want to ensure that if Ministers, Welsh Ministers or the Secretary of State were to make an order that required gear to be used, as opposed to restricting or prohibiting certain gear, that would be competent and within the powers available under statute.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09031648000141"></a>The other two amendments in this group relate to the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act. Section 3 of the original 1967 Act related to orders that could be made with regard to fishing gear, while Section 5 related to fishing activity. By virtue of the Environment Act 1995, there was an extension to allow the issues of the marine environment to be taken into account. The purpose of these amendments is to make it clear that the power to control fishing gear can indeed be used for marine environmental purposes as opposed to purely protecting undersized quarry species.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09031648000142"></a>The final amendment in the group, Amendment A246A, which would insert a new clause after Clause 189, is drafted in a similar spirit. Rather than referring solely to protection of the marine environment, quarry species or particular habitats, it seeks to promote ecosystem recovery. That wider objective would take account of gains that might be made through adopting the ecosystem approach. We are obliged to do that under the common fisheries policy and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Therefore, I believe that it makes sense to include it in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

It is worth making the point that we have introduced regulations in recent years with that purpose in mind. For example, in 2008, we introduced restrictions on the use of scallop dredgers and other damaging fish gear in Lyme Bay to protect the important seabed features in that area. In the same year we implemented a ban on scallop dredging in the Fal and Helford areas to protect the marine environment. These examples demonstrate that we already have flexible powers to hand to regulate fishing for marine environmental purposes. The powers we have used in these circumstances are those available under Sections 5 and 5A of the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967. This has wide powers to allow prohibitions to be made to restrict fishing by any method so specified. Any order using these powers could therefore prohibit all specified methods of fishing other than those that do not damage the marine environment or species to be protected. Therefore, we do not think that the provisions sought by these amendments are needed as we already have powers to do what they seek to achieve, and those powers are actively being used.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09031648000145"></a>Amendment A246A seeks to add to the powers under Section 5A to restrict fishing for marine environmental purposes by including in the definition of &#147;marine environmental purposes&#148; the promotion of ecosystem recovery. Of course, we support the intention behind the amendment. However, we have clearly defined powers to achieve this aim. As I have argued on previous groups of amendments, the promotion of ecosystem recovery is too open-ended a concept to be placed in primary legislation in the way suggested. More precise commitments or duties on Ministers to conserve the marine environment are included in the habitats and birds directives and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. We can also exercise appropriate regulatory power in the areas that will be protected under marine conservation zones. If we are required to regulate or restrict fishing to meet these duties and commitments, the powers available under Section 5A can be used. The current wording of Section 5A is wide enough to encompass all elements of the marine environment where protection from fishing is called for, but we do not disagree at all with the substance of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

Ecosystems have been discussed on a number of occasions. No doubt when we reach the next stage of the Bill they will be discussed again once we have had a chance to see how all this fits together. The Minister referred to the powers and orders that the Government brought forward to try to ensure that safeguards are in place, and he mentioned at least two very recent orders that have banned, prohibited or restricted dredging.</p>

I think that there is a distinction between positively requiring that something be used and using an order to prohibit a particular activity. I want to clarify whether making an order to require the use of particular gear is permitted. I am not necessarily persuaded that simply saying that because the order is there to stop things happening it can equally require things to happen.

The first general matter that I must ask the Government about is whether they feel that the  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_101"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Crown Estate&#146;s duty to maximise its returns may be at odds with some of the other aims of the Bill; for example, with regard to the Marine Management Organisation. It will be asking the Crown Estate to take less return, for example, from a highly protected marine conservation zone than, say, from a wind farm. That is the big issue.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09031648000153"></a>The amendment addresses a specific issue of enormous importance. The amendment deletes the provision by which the Crown Estate has a power under the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 effectively to veto the granting of several regulating orders. I have very good briefing from the Crown Estate and the Shellfish Association of Great Britain. Both parties are very anxious to clarify the position that has been left following a court judgment.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09031648000154"></a>I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, will speak to this amendment so I will not dwell for very long on the huge importance of the shellfish industry to this country, save to say that its final sale value is some &#163;900 million, of which 80 per cent is from exports. The other point that I should bring to the Minister&#146;s attention is that the immense food value of shellfish should not be underestimated. As long ago as when Collins produced its <I>New Naturalist</I> series, it was pointed out that an acre of mussel bed was by a factor of thousands a more efficient way of producing protein than an acre of beef field. This is obviously not a competition, but as we think about food security it is important to safeguard the good and sustainable sources of food. I am sure that the Minister is interested to make sure that the terrible situation hanging over the shellfish industry is resolved as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09031648000155"></a>In brief, what has happened as regards the court case is that some 10 years ago a marina developer applied for planning permission to build a marina in the Menai Strait near Anglesey. The foreshore belongs to Anglesey council and the sea bed to the Crown Estate. The grantees of the fishery order, the regional sea fisheries committee, claim that the development would be illegal, and the two landowners, despite their respective saving provisions in the order, have no right to allow the development to proceed. That area is, I gather, subject to a 60-year lease in terms of the shell fishery.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09031648000156"></a>Faced with this claim, the council and the Crown Estate instigated declaratory proceedings to determine their rights. The case has been through its initial court proceedings and the Appeal Court. The appeal is awaiting judgment. The difficulty is that the Crown Estate as a result has felt that it has been unable to consent to any new or renewal orders anywhere else around our coasts, because the problem is that if it consents unconditionally to the orders, it may not, in light of the present judgments, be afforded the protection of the saving clause. If the Crown Estate puts conditions on the consent, in the view of Defra, which makes the order, this would render the consent non-compliant with the legislation; so the Crown Estate would fail in its duty to maximise returns, Defra cannot do anything about it, and meanwhile the shellfish industry is suffering enormously.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09031648000157"></a>The one thing that a shellfish industry needs in order to develop and continue is certainty. It is quite stunning how much work it takes to get an order; it

The applicant has to pay for all this and the whole process can take up to two years. The Crown Estate says that it can give temporary permission for a period, which has increased from six months to two years, but the process of applying for an order is more than two years, and then the development of the bed can take decades until the operation becomes satisfactory.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09031648000158"></a>It is for that reason that I move the amendment. The amendment would effectively take the Crown Estate out of the loop of the order granting; it would prevent it having the duty to have a veto over the order in this situation. It is a problem that the Bill could solve. It desperately needs to be solved as otherwise the shellfish industry will very shortly be on its knees. I hope that the Government will be able to use the Bill as a vehicle for solving this very difficult situation. I beg to move.</p>

I declare my interests: I am the patron of the National Lobster Hatchery at Newlyn in Cornwall, I am a member of the Fishmongers&#146; Company which is home to the Shellfish Association of Great Britain, and I am vice president of the Fishermen&#146;s Mission. I will try not to repeat what the noble Baroness has said, but this is very important to a particular group of people. The shellfish industry, as noble Lords have heard, has a good sales value: 80 per cent of what we catch goes abroad, which does well for our people and for the Treasury.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09031648000160"></a>The Shellfish Association of Great Britain is responsible for the shellfish industry development strategy, which is a whole-industry, Defra-supported project towards managed, sustainable shellfish production with a target to double molluscan culture. The only route to achieve this is through the several and regulating orders. These orders are vital to the shellfish industry throughout the United Kingdom. There are currently 11 regulated fisheries and 30 several orders operating round the coast of England, Scotland and Wales. This shellfish industry, based on fishery orders, was worth &#163;26 million in the year to March 2006, and provided approximately 200 jobs. It is worth noting that there have been year-on-year increases in production from fishery orders, so that production in 2006 was more than double that of 2002.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09031648000161"></a>The reason for this growth is that fishery orders have been recognised as an effective management measure. Orders provide security for operators cultivating shellfish, and thereby encourage long-term investment in the sustainable development of the shellfish beds. Orders also ensure that shellfish beds are protected from overexploitation, from pollution or damage from disease, or other development activities. They provide the regulatory authority with the powers to manage fisheries sustainably, protect nature conservation interests, limit exploitation to named licence holders, set catch limits, ensure the fishery is exploited safely, and, most

The establishment of new several and regulating orders is a prerequisite to achieving targeted growth in molluscan shellfish culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09031648000162"></a>The Marine and Coastal Access Bill now before Parliament represents an opportunity, which may not recur for several generations, to legislate for the effective management and nurture of our marine environment and those who rely on it to earn their livelihood. The production and gathering of seafood should be high on the list. We need therefore to cater for all the issues that we can now identify which have a material impact on the objective.</p>

<a name="90316-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09031648000163"></a>We have a threat to orders which has been well described by the noble Baroness, and at this late time I will not go through the many pages that I had listed to explain to everybody exactly what this all means. But in 2006, the Crown Estate mounted a legal challenge to a several order in the Menai Strait in north Wales, where it wished to promote the construction of a marina on the area of a mussel fishery which was already protected by an order. If this legal challenge had succeeded, all several and regulating orders in the United Kingdom would have been lost. Many of the orders could immediately be ruled to be ultra vires, and all would lose their protection from external development on fisheries. Pending the outcome of that legal action, the Crown Estate refused to grant adequate consent for renewal of expiring orders or new applications for orders. In the past, fishery orders have generally been granted for periods ranging from 10 to 60 years. A lot of time and effort has been invested, and a lot of families have invested themselves, in this work. However, as orders usually take several years to set up, the fact that the Crown Estate is now willing to give consent for only two years makes it virtually impossible to see this as a long-term way of running businesses in areas where other forms of employment do not so easily come about. We hear that orders are not a viable option and will not provide the long-term security required for investment in fisheries.</p>

While that continues, it will prevent anything happening. I am anxious to ensure that the Crown Estate will revert to its previous routine practice of granting long-term consent for fishery orders around the United Kingdom&#146;s coastline. It may simply refuse in future to accept any application, which would result in the loss of all the fishery orders, all the jobs, and all those investments in all those boats over the next 10 to 20 years as one by one the orders fail to be renewed. The Bill is the ideal opportunity to address those threats and put the security of fishery orders and the shellfish industry beyond doubt.</p>

However, new pressures on the marine environment mean that we have to make the best possible use of the space available. The shellfish industry recognises that orders should provide for the interests of landowners and other users of the sea, but we also consider that shell-fisheries should be encouraged and protected in the national interest so that they continue to provide a vital contribution to the nation&#146;s food supplies.</p>

<a name="90316-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09031648000166"></a>The secure operation of several and regulating orders can be achieved by the removal of the Crown Estate&#146;s unique status of having the power of veto over applications for orders. Under the current system, the consent of the Crown Estate is the only landowner consent that must be obtained before an application can be submitted. The Crown Estate would become a statutory consultee in common with all other landowners. The industry would accept that landowners be given a financial return on their land under fishery orders. There needs to be clarification of the rights and responsibilities of mariculture operators, landowners and other sea users within the areas of several and regulating orders to ensure security of tenure. Amendment of orders following the full consenting process should also be compensated where a conflicting development proposal is deemed to be of overarching national importance. Those matters could be dealt with administratively at a later stage.</p>

<a name="90316-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09031648000167"></a>The critical issue is the Crown Estate veto on Defra-issued orders. The Marine Management Organisation is designed to be a one-stop shop for wind farms, aggregate dredging, exploration or sea storage following broad consultation. There is absolutely no reason why relatively environmentally benign shellfish cultivation should not be similarly managed by the MMO and not subject to that veto.</p>

<a name="90316-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09031651000001"></a>The Crown Estate has gone from Queen to quango. The Crown Estate Act 1961 made it possible to have a non-elected board. We can see how it has changed. Kings and queens have loved and supported our fishermen over hundreds of years. Two of our monarchs have died from a surfeit of fish&#151;how much they enjoyed to eat it. If the Government make an effort and remove the veto, remove the decision, take it back to Defra and leave the management to the MMO they will make our industry happy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09031651000003"></a>On a wider note, the situation is an example of how the inconsistency between different bodies in the same sectors can hinder or be perceived to hinder sustainable development.

I declare an interest as I am inordinately fond of shellfish. I appreciate the way in which this relatively short debate has been conducted. I owe particular gratitude to the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, who has saved me the problems  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_105"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column 105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of describing a great deal about the industry and about the nature of the judgment and the problem that confronts us.</p>

<a name="90316-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09031651000005"></a>Of course I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, who has drawn attention to this difficult problem. I do not think that any of us can underestimate the problems that we face in dealing with the issue and the attendant problems for the industry of which both noble Baronesses made us fully aware. The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, also had some pertinent points to make. It is certainly the case that the Shellfish Act does not allow a several or regulating order to be granted on any part of the foreshore owned by the Crown without the Crown Estate commissioners giving their consent. Nor does it permit such orders to be granted without the consent of the Duchy of Lancaster or the Duke of Cornwall in relation to parts of the foreshore owned by them.</p>

<a name="90316-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09031651000006"></a>The amendment removes the necessity for those consents. Would that the world was that straightforward. Of course, I recognise the intent behind the amendment&#151;the attempt to overcome the delays in progressing some several and regulating order applications in England and Wales caused by the recent court case relating to the Menai Straits, which the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, described so accurately. Judgment, pronounced on appeal last month, found in favour of the shellfish cultivators, as she indicated, and the Sea Fisheries Committee, upholding the judgment at first instance.</p>

<a name="90316-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09031651000007"></a>We are asked what the Government are doing about the matter. We are holding discussions with both the shellfish industry and the Crown Estate commissioners to assess the implications of the decision to try to find a way of resolving the current impasse in agreeing new orders for the benefits of all parties. Careful consideration is being given to the possibility of finding a way to resolve the issue by amending the Shellfish Act. Shellfish orders are important tools for the sustainable and safe exploitation of shell fisheries and we have restated our commitment to them by introducing an amendment in this Bill to the Shellfish Act aimed at ensuring that shellfish orders can be used effectively. The Bill is predicated on that assumption. Of course we are concerned by the potential implications for the progressing of any future orders arising out of this consent issue, but we do not believe that the issue can be resolved by the amendment.</p>

<a name="90316-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09031651000008"></a>The amendment is too blunt an instrument in a difficult situation. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, mentioned the two-year consent issue proposed by the Crown Estate, which recognised that that is an interim solution for the very reasons that she identified. Two years is scarcely a basis on which to establish and continue an industry and for investment to be made in it. That was an interim solution pending resolution of the ongoing court action. Once the court case is settled, we expect the Crown Estate to review this policy. We shall press it on this matter because we agree with the noble Baroness that a two-year consent is merely an interim period. I might add that a further potential appeal on this case can be made until 20 March. Therefore, the Government are in a particularly difficult position in responding to this amendment at this point and it will be recognised why we have to proceed with care.</p>

<a name="90316-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09031651000009"></a>The problem with the amendment is that it does not balance properly the rights of the owners of the foreshore against those of the shellfish cultivators, and so it does not provide a long-term solution to the current problems. If the requirement to obtain consent were removed, it would, I am sure, be open to the Crown Estate commissioners to challenge the order, most likely using the public inquiry procedures under the shellfish Act, and at the cost of the applicant for an order. I cannot see how that would be a satisfactory solution for the industry.</p>

<a name="90316-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09031651000010"></a>We believe that the only sensible way forward is through continued negotiation and discussion between the parties concerned. We believe that there is a genuine desire by all parties to address this issue, but there is the complication of the court case and I do not underestimate the significance of all that. I am not sure that I totally agree with the figure that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, put forward for the value of the industry. We estimate the value of landings from several and regulating orders in England to be about &#163;10.5 million&#151;a substantial sum. This is an industry to take seriously. We know that, as the noble Baroness identified, it represents an extremely efficient way of providing a protein-rich, as well as a hugely enjoyable, food.</p>

<a name="90316-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09031651000011"></a>I hope that the Committee recognises that we are grateful that the issue has been raised. It would have been neglectful had it not been raised in the context of the industry&#146;s current difficulties. However, we are in very difficult circumstances at present and I hope that the noble Baroness will be satisfied that she has pressed the Government about as far as we can go this evening. There will be developments in the immediate future. We fully recognise our responsibility to the industry and are greatly concerned about the position in which we find ourselves. However, there is no simple solution to this issue. Certainly, the amendment would be a blunt instrument which would provoke a blunt, and probably effective, riposte, but that would not help the cause that the noble Baroness is seeking to advance with her amendment. Therefore, I hope that she will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

I also pay tribute to her knowledge of the area. I know of only one monarch who died of a surfeit, so perhaps afterwards she will tell me who else it was besides Henry and whether the cause was something other than lampreys. On that basis, I also have to declare an interest, as there is nothing that I like better than an oyster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09031651000013"></a>The Minister said that this issue is subject to the various court processes going through, and I agree. He then said that this solution was too blunt an instrument. However, I would have to reply bluntly to him that the Crown Estate says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="09031651000016"></a>&#147;In essence, a simple and practical way forward is for an amendment to be made to the 1967 Act so that The Crown Estate&#146;s consent is no longer required for an Order to be valid and in this respect, we agree with the proposed amendment that has been tabled&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031651000015"></a>Therefore, I say bluntly to the Minister that the Crown Estate is happy to give up that right and I am surprised at him for being quite so definite in dismissing our amendment. In fairness, the Crown Estate goes on to state that it would require a saving provision to be inserted in the enabling legislation to protect its rights, and would expect to be a statutory consultee, which seems entirely fair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09031651000014"></a>The Minister has been much too dismissive of that as a solution.

These statutory instruments provide legislative safeguards for creditors and counterparties of UK banks by directly responding to concerns that partial property transfers made under the Banking Act 2009 could negatively affect their rights and interests.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000004"></a>Although the debate should not be difficult, it is unlikely to involve simply going through the motions. Overall, the policy issues involved are complicated. Noble Lords will recall that there was close consultation with stakeholders in connection with the Banking Act 2009. I believe that these regulations provide strong legislative safeguards for creditors and counterparties of UK banks in the event of a partial transfer. They address the concerns put to the authorities that partial property transfers could negatively affect creditors&#146; and counterparties&#146; rights and interests. If counterparties and creditors of UK banks do not have legal certainty as to how partial property transfers may affect their contractual interests and their position as creditors of a failed bank, negative market consequences are likely. The contractual interests that could be affected include risk reduction arrangements, such as set-off and netting arrangements, and financial collateral arrangements. The possible negative market consequences  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of a lack of legal certainty in this area could include higher regulatory capital requirements and cost of funding for UK banks.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000005"></a>As stated in the consultation stages for the SRR and during the parliamentary stages of the Act, the Treasury's aim in providing these legislative safeguards has always been to avoid damaging negative financial market consequences as a result of taking partial property transfer powers. I believe that this aim will be delivered by these instruments, which provide legal certainty to the market and an assurance that the Government would have to have regard to leaving creditors no worse off after a partial property transfer.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000006"></a>As well as running a full public consultation process, with the publishing of a dedicated consultation document on 6 November 2008, the Treasury has worked extensively with industry stakeholders, particularly with the expert liaison group, presently being replaced by the statutory Banking Liaison Panel, to reach an outcome acceptable to both the market and the authorities. As the Committee may be aware, during this process, the Government listened to the concerns raised by noble Lords and others and moved their policy significantly towards providing the market with greater legal certainty.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000007"></a>I now turn to the safeguards order in more detail. The safeguards order is made under Sections 47 and 48 of the Act. In summary, it provides legislative protection against possible disruption under a partial property transfer for important risk management arrangements and other financial arrangements in use in the markets today. These arrangements include set-off and netting arrangements, financial collateral arrangements and structured finance arrangements.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000008"></a>The Committee will be aware that the Government have provided broad protection for set-off and netting. The order provides that property included under a counterparty&#146;s set-off and netting arrangement with a bank may not be split up under a partial transfer. The possibility of damaging cherry-picking of a counterparty's relationship with a failing bank is therefore avoided, and the ability to obtain clean legal opinions in relation to the effectiveness of set-off and netting should not be compromised.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000009"></a>However, to allow the authorities necessary flexibility to carry out partial transfers in the interests of financial stability and depositor protection, the order features a number of carve outs from the protection provided. The most notable of these is property belonging to a Financial Services Compensation Scheme eligible person, which is not covered by the set-off and netting safeguard. This particular carve out from the set-off and netting safeguard will allow the authorities to transfer, for example, the retail deposit book of a failing institution to a solvent new company in a short time-frame, which is important to allow the authorities to provide continuity of service, which was an interest of a number of noble Lords who spoke in the debates during the passage of the Bill, and to protect public confidence.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000010"></a>I now turn to an important point on the practical effect of the order. Property that is not covered by the set-off and netting safeguard under the order is referred to as &#147;excluded rights&#148; or &#147;excluded liabilities&#148;. Under the order, the authorities may choose to, for example, transfer only the excluded rights and liabilities and  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>leave the remaining rights and liabilities in place in the original entity, regardless of any wider set-off and netting arrangement that the authorities would otherwise have needed to have kept whole. However, it is not the Government's policy intention that the presence of excluded rights or liabilities under a wider set-off and netting arrangement should render that entire arrangement unprotected by the order. I would like to make it clear that, in the Government's view, the drafting of the safeguards order does not yield this legal effect.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000011"></a>I am aware that some market participants are concerned that the scope of the safeguards order is not wide enough, in particular with regard to the protections provided for set-off and netting. I understand that these concerns are primarily related to technical drafting, rather than the property that the order clearly excludes as a result of government policy, and that there are varied legal interpretations on whether some relevant financial contracts have been excluded. Let me say that the Government remain committed to a safeguard regime that is as effective as possible and appreciate these potential concerns.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000012"></a>Indeed, the Government have already been clear that the safeguards will be subject to review and, as noble Lords will remember, the Banking Act provides for a Banking Liaison Panel of financial services representatives to keep the ongoing effect of the existence of the special resolution regime under review. As part of the Government's existing commitment to work in partnership with the industry in this area via the panel, I can announce that one of the first orders of business for the panel will be to review the safeguards order. If changes to the order are necessary and are compatible with the authorities' flexibility, the Government will make such changes before the Summer Recess. I hope this will reassure stakeholders on this point.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000013"></a>However, I should make clear that while an initial review this summer is appropriate, and while the panel will advise the Government on possible changes needed in the future, perhaps sparked by market innovation, it is not the Government's intention continually to change the safeguards order. Any perception that the order is subject to constant change could itself damage the certainty the order intends to bring to the market. Taking a little more time to review the order should allow a less hurried process for the Government and industry stakeholders definitively to iron out any the outstanding concerns in the medium term.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000014"></a>I now turn to the next safeguard featured in the order. This safeguard protects financial collateral and other secured arrangements to which a bank is party. In short, it provides that where either party has a security interest over an asset held by its counterparty, related to a liability owed by that counterparty, the asset may not be split up from the liability under a partial transfer. In this way, counterparties can continue to be confident that they will be able to have recourse to security they have taken.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000015"></a>There is also a safeguard for financial arrangements broadly covered by the term &#147;structured finance&#148;. These arrangements are referred to as &#147;capital markets arrangements&#148; and refer to, for example, covered bonds and securitised vehicles. The safeguard provides that  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>partial property transfers may not interfere in the operation of such arrangements to which a bank is party by transferring some, but not all of the relevant property, rights or liabilities.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000016"></a>Noble Lords may recall from the later stages of the debates on the Act that we discussed issues related to events of default and financial contracts. The statutory instrument provides certainty for counterparties that a partial property transfer will not prevent them from calling events of default in relation to specified financial instruments, or set-off, netting or title transfer financial collateral arrangements. The measure also protects the operations of important central market counterparties, such as clearers and settlement houses from possible disruption under a partial property transfer. For example, clearing house default rules, which are given legal force by Part VII of the Companies Act, are given explicit protection.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000017"></a>I now turn to third party compensation arrangements regulations, which are made under Section 60 of the Act. Their purpose is to ensure that, following a partial transfer, no creditor will be worse off than he would have been had the whole bank been put into an insolvency procedure. In summary, the regulations provide that, where certain stabilisation options have been exercised under Part 1 of the Banking Act the,</p>
<ul><a name="09031610000023"></a>&#147;compensation scheme order or a resolution fund order&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09031610000022"></a>must&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09031610000024"></a>&#147;include a third party compensation order&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000018"></a>This compensation order must or may include certain provisions: for example, it must provide for the appointment of an independent valuer; and it must provide for the valuer to assess the treatment that the creditors of the failing bank that was subject to a partial transfer, would have received had the whole failing bank been put into insolvency. The order must also provide for the valuer to assess the treatment which such creditors have received, are receiving or are likely to receive if no compensation or further compensation is paid. If the independent valuer determines that a creditor in such a situation has been made worse off than he would have been had the bank entered insolvency, he must consider the compensation to be paid to that creditor. In assessing the amount of any compensation the valuer would be obliged to follow the principles specified in the regulations. These include the principle that no financial assistance would have been provided to the bank by the Bank of England or the Treasury after the relevant time specified in the regulations.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031610000019"></a>I remind noble Lords of the important protections that these statutory instruments provide to the market. I believe that this legislation, formed in intensive consultation with the industry, meets the vast majority of the market&#146;s concerns. The Government are committed to working with the industry to ensure that the regime is as effective as possible. I thank various stakeholders for their hard work on this subject up to this point.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>

We recognise that these initial statutory instruments dealing with partial transfers needed to be in place for the commencement of the Banking Act and have no problem with the fact that the Treasury has used the procedure laid out in Section 259 to lay the statutory instruments subject to later affirmative approval.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000002"></a>While the statutory instruments were published in draft in November, we are aware that there have been debates on the substance of them right up to almost the last minute before they were laid&#151;the Minister referred to that in part. It would have been a miracle had the Treasury&#146;s legal team got the statutory instruments 100 per cent right first time. I shall refer to the specific points that have been made to us later on so that at least they are clearly on the record.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000003"></a>From the perspective of the financial services industry, the use of the expert liaison group was regarded as a very constructive and good way of dealing with the detailed concerns about the secondary legislation, even though not all of those concerns have in practice been addressed. I hope that the Treasury will continue to work with the Banking Liaison Panel in a similarly constructive way to resolve any remaining issues. The work of implementing the Bill cannot be regarded as being at an end when these statutory instruments are approved.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000004"></a>While it is clear that consultation has worked well for the industry, I should like to raise it from a different perspective: that of Parliament. The Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee of your Lordships' House raised in its eighth report the fact that the documentation for the statutory instruments includes relatively little about the consultation with stakeholders. It noted that it is seeking further information on that from the Treasury. The Minister did not refer to it in his opening remarks. Can he update the Committee on how the Government intend to respond to that request?</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000005"></a>Processes such as the expert liaison group and the Banking Liaison Panel serve a good purpose of bringing the market experts into the same room as the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, which should enhance the quality of the secondary legislation that is developed. However, at the same time, there is a danger that the process of consultation becomes virtually secret. For example, I know that the Treasury had a large number of consultation responses to the November consultation document, to which the Minister referred. Those responses are available on the Treasury website, but the Treasury has given little or no direct public response to the matters raised in them. For example, the documentation accompanying the impact assessment for the partial transfer safeguards order deals with consultation over the whole period since the first proposals were put into the public domain more than a year ago and with the changes over that period. However, that obscures the fact that there were a number of consultation responses to the very specific draft statutory instruments contained in the November proposals. There was no focus on the changes, if any, that were made following the November document.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000006"></a>Parliament has to approve these statutory instruments, for which the affirmative procedure is mandated. Parliament may also debate instruments which are  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>made under the negative procedure. The information that is normally available to Parliament is a consultation, the responses to it and the Government&#146;s responses to it. But when there is an inner circle of consultees, such as the expert liaison group, considerably less information is available to Parliament, which is what the Merits Committee was reflecting in its request for further information on consultation.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000007"></a>We discussed during the passage of the Banking Bill what degree of transparency should be attached to the processes of the Banking Liaison Panel, and the Government resisted any formal reporting requirements in respect of it such as the release of minutes. While I had some sympathy for that position at the time, when faced with statutory instruments such as those that we are considering today, the process of consultation has become almost invisible to those of us not involved in the detail. Perhaps the Minister could comment on how the processes of consultation could be made more transparent for Parliament when we consider any later instruments under the Banking Act, which I am sure will be intermediated through the Banking Liaison Panel.</p>

<p><a name="09031613000040"></a>I also ask the Minister to set out whether and to what extent the Government intend transparency of the workings of the Banking Liaison Panel to be implemented notwithstanding the lack of a formal requirement, as set out in the Banking Act.</p>
<h5><a name="09031613000045"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000008"></a>Moving from process to the substance of the statutory instruments, I have received no specific comments on the Banking Act 2009 (Third Party Compensation Arrangements for partial Property Transfers) Regulations 2009, which the Minister referred to by their nickname of the &#147;no creditor worse off&#148; regulations. It is perhaps unsurprising that we received no comments on this statutory instrument, because our clear legal advice was that the &#147;no creditor worse off&#148; arrangements added nothing to legal certainty. They are nice to have, but not essential to the working of financial markets, so we must simply hope that if they ever have to be used&#151;we hope they do not&#151;the regulations are robust.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000009"></a>However, we received briefing from the British Bankers&#146; Association, the London Investment Banking Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association on the restriction of partial property transfers safeguards order. This is what the Minister referred to in his introductory remarks. As I said earlier, I shall set out those concerns for the record. Those who have briefed us believe that they raise significant issues.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000010"></a>The first concern is the approach to safeguards for netting arrangements, and whether the definition of &#147;excluded rights&#148; in Article 1 is correct. I am told that there are two issues here. First, the definition of &#147;financial instruments&#148; cross-refers, in effect, to MFID, which will exclude a number of instruments and contracts that are commonly subject to netting arrangements. These include spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, physically settled commodities derivatives, and spot and forward bullion transactions as well as derivatives on newer asset classes such as longevity and mortality. Quite a number of areas appear not to be covered by the current reference.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000011"></a>Secondly, the definition of &#147;excluded rights&#148; is in terms of contracts entered into otherwise than in the course of an activity that relates solely to relevant financial instruments. The fear is that many contracts will become excluded rights just because they could include non-relevant financial instruments issues. I am told that this could be a problem, even if all the transactions under a master netting agreement are protected, but used to hedge a non-protected transaction such as a loan.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000012"></a>The Minister implied that the Treasury was aware of the technical issues; I am sure that it is fully aware. The Minister said that this would be on the first agenda of the Banking Liaison Panel, and that if any changes were necessary, they would be brought in before the Summer Recess. That is welcome up to a point, but I am also told that, as we speak, legal opinions on existing arrangement are being drawn up. If clean legal opinions cannot be given on existing arrangements, that could cause significant problems for those with material amounts of such contracts. In addition to causing specific difficulties for particular institutions, it could also put a further dent in the attractiveness of the UK and English law as the home for many of these financial instruments. I am sure that the Minister agrees that that would be undesirable given the pre-eminence of our financial services industry.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000013"></a>The second issue raised with us concerns the inclusion of small companies, which are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The Minister also referred to this. A consequence appears to be that the FSA is saying that it is required by the EU capital requirements directive to treat balances with these customers on a gross basis. This obviously increases the regulated capital required to be held, the cost of capital that banks incur and&#151;other things being equal&#151;would lead to higher costs of borrowing for the small businesses within the retail deposits carve-out. I am sure that the Minister would not regard that as desirable either, especially in today&#146;s economic environment.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000014"></a>The Minister will recall that we debated the problem of regulatory capital during the passage of the Bill. The November consultation document, at paragraph 2.16, said in terms that,</p>
<ul><a name="09031613000043"></a>&#147;the Government&#146;s clear intention is to protect contracts relevant for regulatory capital purposes from the threat of disruption under a partial transfer&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031613000041"></a>We urged the Government to place that clear commitment on the face of the Bill, but they declined to do so. We now appear to be facing an issue where regulatory capital will indeed be affected by the threat of a partial transfer. I am told that discussions are continuing with the FSA on this point and I do not know whether the Minister can update the Committee on that, but I understand that even if the regulatory capital issue is resolved, the same issue can also affect clean legal opinions where a group of companies contains one or more small companies, which most groups do.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000015"></a>I have a further point to put to the Minister on a more general level about future statutory instruments under the Banking Act. The Treasury was asked by the Merits Committee about the breach of the 21-day rule in relation to statutory instruments made under  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC8"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the 2009 Act and the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008. I have no problems with the responses that the Treasury gave in respect of the specifics, but when dealing with the issue of further statutory instruments made under the 2009 Act, the Treasury's memorandum submitted to the Merits Committee said at paragraph 27 that the Treasury's intention is to observe the 21 day rule,</p>
<ul><a name="09031613000044"></a>&#147;where this is necessary and appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031613000042"></a>That is completely the wrong approach. The Treasury should observe the 21-day rule unless it can establish that it is necessary and appropriate to ignore it. Will the Minister confirm that the Treasury will regard the 21-day rule as of the utmost importance unless it is necessary genuinely to breach it?</p>

<a name="90316-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000016"></a>I conclude with foreign property. The consultation responses to the November consultation have one consistent theme&#151;that foreign property is a problem. I note that the compensation arrangements do not cover the issue of the purported transfer of foreign property which is not effective due to foreign law and the partial property safeguards order singles out ineffective foreign property transfers as not breaching the order. We discussed in Committee the broad area of who bears the risk of ineffective property transfers and I understand that the Government want to leave the risk wholly in the market. I will content myself today with one prediction, which is that foreign property will cause some real problems in respect of partial transfers whether in this country or&#151;perhaps more likely due to regulatory action&#151;in other countries, where the uncertainties regarding foreign property may lead to regulatory capital inefficiencies. I do not know whether those problems will in turn have an effect on our financial services market, but I hope that the Minister will confirm that the Banking Liaison Panel and indeed the Treasury will keep this firmly under review.</p>

<p><a name="09031613000017"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09031613000054"></a>Lord Newby:</b> I, too, am grateful to the Minister for setting out the background and content of these regulations so fully. As the noble Baroness said, the concerns fall into two parts. The first relates to the consultation procedure and the second to the substance.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90316-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000018"></a>As far as the consultation procedure is concerned, there is no doubt that the expert liaison group played an important and positive role as the banking Bill was going through the House. The regulations that we see today are the fruits of its work. Equally, the Banking Liaison Panel should carry forward at least the spirit of that work. The noble Baroness talked about the fear of the process becoming secret. One has to strike a balance&#151;which she discussed. We want the process to be transparent but should avoid everyone spending their time reporting on what they are doing rather than doing it. In terms of good process, the process that led to the regulations that amended the Lloyds market had a lot to recommend it in the way in which it was reported to Parliament. We had a set of statutory instruments with a document attached&#151;which was rather fuller than the documentation we have had today&#151;that set out the representations that had been made and, as the noble Baroness suggested, the Government&#146;s response to them. Therefore, at the time the statutory instruments came forward, we had a narrative of all the issues that had been raised, where  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC9"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC9</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there were still outstanding difficulties and why the Government had not felt able to accept proposals that had been made. That was a very satisfactory way of proceeding and is probably more satisfactory than having endless minutes, although, if one wants, one can have them as well.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000019"></a>The noble Baroness set out the concerns expressed by the BBA and others on the substance of the regulations. As the process moves on, the concerns become more technical and narrower. When we started, we were both being lobbied by the banking industry on the basis that unless the Bill changed quite significantly, it would be the end of banking as we know it in London. Although there is still a faint echo of that in the representations, great progress has been made. I was always slightly sceptical, given everything else that is going on in world financial markets, that London&#146;s position would be undermined to the extent that was suggested if this legislative framework was not absolutely right at first blush. It is important that further discussions go ahead between now and the summer so that any outstanding concerns can be addressed as far as possible. However, I would be slightly surprised if, at the end of the process, there was not at least one eminent lawyer who disagreed with the consensus. My experience, not least in listening to eminent lawyers in your Lordships' House, is that getting consensus on many of these technical matters is absolutely impossible and, beyond a certain point, not worth seeking.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000020"></a>Finally, I echo the point made by the noble Baroness about the 21-day rule. It is difficult to see many circumstances in which the 21-day rule should not be followed. The terminology used by the Treasury is typical Treasury-speak; namely, &#147;Oh, I suppose we might do this if we&#146;ve got no option&#148;, rather than, &#147;We will do it, unless there is a real emergency&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031613000021"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031613000055"></a>Lord Myners:</b> I thank noble Lords for their inputs on this subject. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, made the powerful point that the work of Banking Liaison Panel does not cease with the approval of these statutory instruments but is part of a continuing dialogue and role. The innovation and creativity of financial markets will almost certainly mean that we regularly have to revisit this and achieve clarity in our own minds that the existing provisions are appropriate to cope with new instruments as they emerge.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000022"></a>The noble Baroness also raised wider issues relating to consultation. I have considerable sympathy with her comments. A good consolation process is a dialogue. It is one in which people who take the trouble to respond are entitled to a considered and reasoned response. There are perhaps some pointers here that we should bear in mind in further consultations. The submissions we receive are posted on the Treasury website, which helps enhance debate and discussion, but it is a somewhat incomplete meal because it does not explain the responses, save in statements made to this House and in the other place during the evolution of legislation and instruments.</p>
<h5><a name="09031613000046"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000023"></a>The noble Baroness raised questions also in connection with process in respect of the publication of the minutes of the Banking Liaison Panel. The Government are  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC10"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not opposed to their publication; indeed, we would be very happy to have them published if that was the wish of the Banking Liaison Panel. The first thing to do is to ensure that the panel is content that that is a way of working which will not inhibit it fulfilling the role that we expect from it. The forerunner, the expert liaison group, was happy with summary minutes being published; I hope that the Banking Liaison Panel may be drawn towards a similar conclusion, but we should leave it to it to establish its own views on that.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000024"></a>I have already referred to the issue relating to formal responses to the consultation process. I have added in that respect that I can commit that the published minutes of the BLP should be accompanied by a narrative on the Government&#146;s response to consultation responses. I hope that that will take us a further, significant step forward in achieving an open dialogue and debate. The noble Baroness made another important point about the need to ensure that the Act and these statutory instruments are consistent with promoting the UK as a good place in which to conduct the business of banking. One of the ways that we shall do that is by showing clearly the way in which we arrive at public policy decisions.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000025"></a>The Government responded to the Merits Committee&#146;s eighth report and its request for more information on the consultation process. Our response appeared in the Merits Committee&#146;s 10th report and I direct noble Lords to it. I am also inclined to agree with the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, about the form of words used in respect of the 21-day rule, which we should always endeavour to respect. Rather than say that we shall comply where necessary and appropriate, I would prefer to reverse that and say that we shall comply unless there are circumstances in which we judge that to be unnecessary or inappropriate. In such circumstances, we would explain why we had reached that conclusion.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000026"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, raised a point in respect of smaller companies. In making the order, the Government needed to strike a balance between ensuring that they can deliver vital continuity of service, about which the noble Baroness was particularly concerned when we debated the Bill, and liquidity for small businesses in the event that their bank fails and suitable protection for the more advanced risk mitigation techniques that may exist between larger firms and their banks. For this reason, the Government believe that a carve-out from the netting protection for all FSCS-eligible depositors, including small companies, is appropriate to allow the authorities effectively to provide continuity of service for those depositors.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000027"></a>However, we are aware that certain stakeholders believe that the combination of this carve-out and the FSA&#146;s interpretation of the relevant European rules could lead to firms requiring more regulatory capital. We are investigating this concern and are aware that there will be a meeting between the FSA and the banks on this topic soon. Irrespective of the FSA&#146;s position, I note that how banks meet increased regulatory capital costs is a commercial decision for them. The Government will be watching developments in this area carefully. I have already indicated that the Banking  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC11"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC11</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Liaison Panel will review the order now that it has been made. This issue will be picked up as part of that review.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000028"></a>The noble Baroness raised a point about foreign property and made a forecast, which we shall watch with interest. Foreign property is not carved out of the safeguard. We think that the likelihood of foreign banks withdrawing from lending to UK banks due to formulation of the safeguard is very small. We have formulated the safeguards to ensure that the UK authorities have the necessary flexibility to make partial transfers of failing banks in the interests of financial stability, reducing risk for the UK taxpayer. The Government take this position for the following reason: foreign property is not carved out of the set-off and netting safeguard. The order simply states that if property that UK authorities attempt to transfer is not transferred due to the failure of a foreign court to recognise the transfer, this failure does not constitute a breach of the order by virtue of not all the relevant property rights or liabilities being transferred.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000029"></a>Foreign counterparties are likely to want to be transferred and ought to be able to take action before their local courts to get a transfer recognised. Counterparties could write into their contracts the need for a foreign bank to recognise a transfer under the SRR. A partial transfer under the SRR is almost certainly a reorganisation measure under the Credit Institutions Winding-Up Directive. As such, EEA states are required to recognise the transfer.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000030"></a>The noble Baroness asked, too, about the scope of the safeguards order and whether it was wide enough for relevant financial instruments. As I indicated in my opening remarks, we are aware of concerns in this area that some stakeholders hold. It is our understanding that these concerns are primarily related to technical drafting and that there are varied legal interpretations on whether some relevant financial contracts have been excluded. I should note that in drafting we amended the order to address the core concern in relation to relevant financial instruments&#151;the need for the order to cover loans. As I mentioned earlier, as part of the Government&#146;s existing commitment to working in partnership with the industry, the Banking Liaison Panel will review the safeguards order. If changes to the order are desirable, the Government will make such changes before the Summer Recess; we certainly recognise the need to do that as quickly as we can, subject to doing a good piece of work, because we understand that opinions will be developed on the basis of these statutory instruments.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000031"></a>The noble Baroness reminded us that when this Act was first discussed, many forecast that the roof would come tumbling in on our heads. A considerable degree of credit for the fact that it has not is due to this Chamber and the debates that took place over a number of days, when we progressively improved the quality of the Bill that had been presented to Parliament. A great deal of credit is also due to the expert liaison group for the work that it has done, which I am sure that the Banking Liaison Panel will continue to do in what I think we all acknowledge is an extraordinarily tricky but very important area for an important part of our financial economy.</p>

As I have indicated, it will be subject to further review this summer in close consultation with the industry, under the auspices of the new Banking Liaison Panel.</p>

<p><I>Relevant Document: 8th</I><sup><I></I></sup><I>Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.</I></p>
</ul>

<p><a name="09031613000034"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09031613000058"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> I cannot say that this is a terribly exciting statutory instrument but I will seek to bring it to life as best I can. In moving this Motion, I shall speak to two other statutory instruments: the Banking Act 2009 (Bank Administration) (Modification for Application to Multiple Transfers) Regulations 2009 and the Banking Act 2009 (Parts 2 and 3 Consequential Amendments) Order 2009.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000035"></a>The two sets of regulations apply the bank administration procedure that is set out in Part 3 of the Banking Act 2009 to various scenarios. Although we have recently debated this Act, let me set out a brief background to the bank administration procedure to provide the context to the first two regulations.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC13"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000036"></a>The bank administration procedure supports the use of the property transfer resolution tools under the new special resolution regime. This procedure may be required in the event of a partial transfer of a bank&#146;s business to a new publicly owned company, such as a bridge bank, or to a private-sector purchaser. Where a partial transfer takes place, the &#147;residual bank&#148;, which is the part left behind, may be insolvent and, crucially, some essential services and facilities that are required by the transferee to conduct any business transferred to it may be non-transferable.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000037"></a>In such circumstances, in order to ensure the business transferred from the bank can continue to be operated effectively, under the provisions of Part 3 of the Act, the Bank of England may make an application to the court for a bank administration order.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000038"></a>Under a normal administration, the administrator would have no obligation to provide support facilities to a commercial purchaser or bridge bank and would be required to take actions in the best interests of creditors. This could include taking immediate steps to wind up the affairs of the company, selling its assets and distributing the proceeds to creditors. Such action could threaten the successful resolution of a failing bank through a partial transfer since it may render a bridge bank unworkable or deter any private-sector purchaser from making an acquisition. Private-sector purchasers are likely to have a low appetite for risk and, if they are not sufficiently assured that services will continue to be provided to the transferred business, they may refuse to take part in the transaction.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031613000039"></a>Clearly, the bank administration procedure places a duty on the court-appointed bank administrator of an insolvent residual bank to provide essential services and facilities to the transferee. To this end, the bank administrator will have unique statutory objectives: first, to provide support to a commercial purchaser or bridge bank and, secondly, to rescue the residual bank as a going concern or wind up its affairs in the best interests of creditors.</p>
<h5><a name="09031620000041"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000001"></a>Once it is no longer necessary for the residual bank to continue to provide support services, the procedure would continue in a similar way to an ordinary administration. The procedure is largely based on existing insolvency provisions, specifically the procedure of administration as set out in Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986. To keep down costs, maximise returns to creditors and protect the interests of creditors by providing for a full range of outcomes, some of the existing powers of a liquidator have been built in to the procedure.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000002"></a>The Banking Act 2009 (Bank Administration) (Modification for Application to Banks in Temporary Public Ownership) Regulations apply the bank administration procedure to situations when a bank or bank holding company has been taken into temporary public ownership and then later the Treasury transfers some of the business of a bank in temporary public ownership to another person such as a private sector purchaser. In such circumstances the Government believe that it is appropriate for the Treasury to apply to the court for a bank administration order. This will be  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC14"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>done where, in the opinion of the Treasury, the bank from which the business has been transferred is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the residual company is required to provide services or facilities to the transferee.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000003"></a>The Banking Act 2009 (Bank Administration) (Modification for Application to Multiple Transfers) Regulations modify the provisions of Part 3 of the Act to apply in circumstances where the Bank of England or the Treasury transfers the property, rights and liabilities of a bank to more than one transferee. This ensures that the provisions made for bank administration accommodate effectively situations where multiple property transfers are made in respect of the business of a bank. An example could be a transfer of a failing bank&#146;s business to different private sector purchasers, all of whom require the use of some of the services or facilities of the residual bank.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000004"></a>The general process of bank administration set out in Part 3 of the Act will work in the same way in relation to multiple transfers as it does where a transfer is effected by a single property transfer instrument. However, these regulations make necessary modifications primarily to the bank administrator&#146;s objectives and the duration of the objectives, so that it is clear that the bank administrator is under a duty to ensure the provision of services and facilities from the residual bank to each of the transferees. Both these statutory instruments support the Government&#146;s policy of having a flexible special resolution regime in place to deal effectively with the varying circumstances in which intervention might be required to resolve a failing bank.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000005"></a>Finally, the Banking Act 2009 (Part 2 and 3 Consequential Amendments) Order 2009 makes consequential amendments to existing legislation. Part 2 of that order is drafted to ensure that references within certain pieces of legislation to the insolvency of companies also refer, where applicable, to the new insolvency procedures created by the Banking Act. The bank administration procedures that I described earlier and the bank insolvency procedure&#151;the modified insolvency procedure under Part 2 of the Act&#151;are designed to facilitate the FSCS making a fast payout to depositors in the event of a bank&#146;s insolvency. The schedule to the order contains a list of enactments so modified.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000039"></a>Part 3 of the order provides that, as a consequence of bank insolvency or bank administration, certain pieces of primary legislation are to be read with specific modifications. For example, the order modifies the Companies Act 2006 to allow disclosure of information by or to the authorities under Parts 2 and 3 of the Banking Act to be treated in the same way as disclosure in an insolvency to the authorities under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 or the Insolvency Act 1986. This part also sets up textual amendments to statutory instruments to provide for bank insolvency and bank administration to be included alongside the references to general insolvency proceedings within these instruments.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000006"></a>The bank administration and bank insolvency procedures have been consulted upon and were broadly supported by stakeholders. The regulations before us  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC15"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC15</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>adapt the bank administration procedure to support the different resolution options provided for in the Act. The order makes consequential amendments to other legislation to ensure that, as is supported by stakeholders, the new bank insolvency and bank administration procedures apply to relevant legislation in a similar way to normal insolvency and administration procedures. I commend the draft orders to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09031620000007"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09031620000052"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing these orders. He will be relieved to hear that I have only one point to raise on them because they are really much too technical for me. It takes us back to a point I raised on the earlier group of orders; namely, consultation. My point was there were draft statutory instruments available for the November consultation, but the process of consultation stopped being visible to Parliament. Very little consultation has been carried out on these orders. For the order relating to consequential amendments, the only consultation was within government and, as far as I can tell, there has been no consultation on the other two orders. The orders are highly technical, and it may well be that only insolvency experts and, possibly, the BBA would have had something to say on them, but it is the hallmark of good government to consult on draft instruments, especially when they are technical, even if the full three months that we normally expect for consultation could not have been met. So far as these orders are concerned, it is water under the bridge, and I am not going to object to them on the grounds of lack of consultation. However, I hope that the Minister will commit the Treasury to a more normal process for any further orders that are issued under the Banking Act or, indeed, more generally so that, even if they are highly technical orders of which few would understand the detail, the normal process of exposure to obtain the views of stakeholders is followed.</p>

<p><a name="09031620000008"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09031620000053"></a>Lord Newby:</b> In introducing this short debate, the Minister said that these are not very exciting orders but he would do his best to breathe life into them. I am sure he has done his best, but it is a tough job being a Minister at times. These are very technical orders, and we have no objection to them.</p>

<p><a name="09031620000009"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09031620000054"></a>Lord Myners:</b> I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, for their comments. I referred earlier to consultation. I remain strongly of the view that good legislation and effective orders are more likely to arise as a consequence of an open consultation in which thinking is exposed to challenge and those responsible for drafting are informed by a wider community of experts. That is particularly the case in orders of the sort we are looking at today, relating to what we all recognise are extraordinarily complex technical matters. In parenthesis, one might say that perhaps bankers should give some thought to whether complexity is something to be eschewed in future in the interest of going back to something simpler and more straightforward. However, for the time being, we need to ensure that the orders we have in place are consistent with the needs of the sophisticated banking market. I shall seek to ensure that, in developing

However, it is incumbent upon government, and to government&#146;s benefit, to encourage wide consultation. In developing orders, we will benefit from the advice that we receive.</p>

<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC17"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09031620000010"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09031620000058"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> I beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper. I will also speak to the Northern Rock plc Compensation Scheme (Amendment) Order as the two draft orders are related.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000011"></a>In February 2008, when it became apparent that it would be impossible to achieve a private-sector sale of Northern Rock that would adequately protect taxpayers&#146; and consumers&#146; interests, the Government transferred into temporary public ownership all shares in Northern Rock. This transfer was effected using the powers conferred on the Treasury under Section 3 of the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000012"></a>Section 5 of that Act specifies that, where an order is made under Section 3, the Treasury must make an order providing for a scheme for determining the amount of any compensation payable to former shareholders of Northern Rock and other specified persons. In accordance with this requirement, the Treasury made the Northern Rock plc Compensation Scheme Order on 12 March 2008. The order makes provision for the appointment of an independent valuer to determine the compensation, if any, payable to the former shareholders of Northern Rock and other persons specified in Part 2 of the Schedule to that order. Following a competitive process, the Treasury announced in September 2008 that an independent valuer had been appointed to undertake the valuation exercise.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000013"></a>In order to ensure that the valuer is able to do his work efficiently, it is essential that he has the powers necessary to conduct his valuation work. The Treasury made clear in its brief to applicants that it would consider any requests by the valuer for powers additional to those set out in the compensation scheme order, which the valuer considers are necessary for the effective conduct of the valuation exercise.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000014"></a>The independent valuer has requested from the Treasury powers to obtain from third parties information reasonably required for the purpose of assessing the amount of any compensation payable. Having considered that request, the Treasury laid in Parliament the Northern Rock plc Compensation Scheme (Amendment) Order 2009, which confers powers on the valuer to apply to the court for an order compelling the production of information by third parties.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000015"></a>The court process will enable any persons from whom the information is sought, or to whom the information relates, to make representations to the court as to why the information is not reasonably necessary for the purposes of the valuation exercise. The order makes provision specifying the circumstances in which a person may not be required to provide information&#151;for example, information in respect of which a claim to legal professional privilege could be maintained in legal proceedings. The order also makes it clear that the independent valuer may share information with his staff and advisers, and disclose information if necessary for the purposes of exercising the functions of his office. Information must not be shared more widely without the consent of the persons from whom the valuer obtained the information and to whom the information relates.   


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC18"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The valuer must have regard to the need to exclude from disclosure, so far as practicable, certain classes of information, such as commercially sensitive information. The order also specifies that a person who provides information to the valuer for the purposes of the assessment of the amount of any compensation payable is not, by that reason, liable in any proceedings relating to a breach of confidence.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000016"></a>As the Committee will be aware, the Treasury has recently commenced the process for the appointment of a valuer to undertake the valuation exercise in accordance with the Bradford &amp; Bingley Compensation Scheme Order 2008, which was made last December. Under that scheme, the valuer must assess any compensation payable to the former shareholders of Bradford and Bingley plc and other specified persons who suffered interferences in their property rights arising as a result of the provisions of the Bradford &amp; Bingley Transfer of Securities and Property etc. Order 2008</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000017"></a>The Treasury considers it appropriate that the person appointed as the valuer should have the same powers as the Northern Rock valuer. Therefore, the same powers for information gathering and sharing are conferred on that valuer and are set out in the Bradford &amp; Bingley plc Compensation (Amendment) Order 2009. In addition, it is important to note that Article 3 of the order amends paragraph 5 of the Bradford &amp; Bingley Compensation Scheme Order to make clear it that the independent valuer must assess any compensation payable to any subordinated debt holders who suffer compensatable interferences in their property rights arising from the amendments to Article 6 of the Bradford &amp; Bingley plc Transfer Order, specified in the Bradford &amp; Bingley plc Transfer of Securities and Property etc. (Amendment) Order 2009.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000018"></a>I hope that the Committee will agree that it is necessary to confer these information-gathering powers on the independent valuers for Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley in order to ensure that they can conduct the valuation process effectively and that the valuers may reach their determinations without unnecessary delay. I commend both instruments to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09031620000019"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09031620000059"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing these two orders, which are of course not unexpected, given the insertion of Section 237 into the Banking Act during its passage through this House.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000020"></a>I have been uncomfortable about Sections 55 and 237 of the Act, and these orders leave me no more comfortable about the valuers being given the power to compel the provision of information. With regard to procedure, the valuer has to apply to the court to get the information, which seems sensible, but the order says nothing about procedure. For example, does the valuer have to notify the person whom he wishes to compel about the application? How much notice must he give? What rights do the persons who could be affected but who are not the ones who are compelled to give the information have? The Minister implied that such rights exist but there is nothing in the order setting that out.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000021"></a>When considering Section 237 during the passage of the Bill, we were told that the Northern Rock valuer wanted to obtain information from the auditors and from potential commercial purchasers for Northern Rock, but in the event they were not permitted to proceed with the acquisition of Northern Rock. I assume, therefore, that those persons declined to give that information voluntarily. Thus a Banking Act valuer would be in a position to obtain information which, in the ordinary course of events in the commercial world, he would probably not be able to obtain. I believe that that places an onus on the Government to ensure that the persons who can be coerced into giving information are fairly treated.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000022"></a>Section 55(3) allows the Treasury to make provision about procedure but this order has not done so. Can the Minister explain why? My concerns are increased when we get to the information disclosure elements of the order. Proposed new Section 9C seems to give good protection in the form of consent for persons who are forced to hand over information to the valuer or who are affected by the information, but that is considerably watered down by proposed new Section 9D and, in particular, proposed new subsections (3) and (4). Will the Minister explain in what circumstances the valuer might need to disclose information he has obtained for the purposes of his office, as referred to in proposed new subsection (3), against the wishes of the person forced to give the information?</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000023"></a>In connection with proposed new subsection (4), will the Minister explain why the rider &#147;so far as practicable&#148; is attached to the valuer having regard to the need not to disclose commercial or private information? Surely, there should be an absolute requirement to respect commercially confidential information and, perhaps even more importantly, private confidential information.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000024"></a>Can the Minister explain what remedies are available to deal with the improper disclosure of information by a valuer? That is disclosure by the valuer of information that is obtained by virtue of the powers that are given to him, but which are not within the specific terms of the order. Can the valuer be liable in damages if information is disclosed without consent or one of the protections offered by the order?</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000025"></a>In addition, Section 55 allows the Treasury to create a criminal offence in connection with an order, but it has chosen not to do so. Criminal offences are not unusual protections against the abuse of information powers. That is particularly important because once information has been disclosed, it cannot be put back into the private domain. Proper sanctions are extremely important. Perhaps the Minister can explain why the Treasury has not used its power to create an additional protection for those who might be forced to disclose information.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000026"></a>The Minister would not expect to get through a debate on either Northern Rock or Bradford &amp; Bingley without some more general questions. Of course, the possibilities are endless, but I shall confine myself to business plans. We have still not seen a business plan   


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC20"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for Bradford &amp; Bingley, notwithstanding that its mortgage book has been nationalised for nearly six months. How difficult is it to prepare a business plan for a rump organisation? Can the Minister at last be precise about when we can see its business plan? Taxpayers have a right to know what is being done with their money.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000027"></a>Turning to Northern Rock, a business plan was prepared last year, although only the briefest of outlines was put into the public domain. In January, the Government announced a U-turn and said that Northern Rock would tear up that business plan and start lending again. However, two months on we have seen no revised business plan even though Northern Rock itself has said that it will involve capital and legal restructuring. I remind the Minister that taxpayers&#146; money is bankrolling this organisation.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000028"></a>Lastly in this context, will the Minister say who is setting the agenda for these organisations? Is it the Treasury or UKFI? Whoever it is seems not to understand the meaning of speed or accountability. We need to be clear about who is to blame.</p>

<p><a name="09031620000029"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09031620000060"></a>Lord Newby:</b> As the Minister said, these are not surprising statutory instruments; we have expected them for some time. I start where the noble Baroness just finished in terms of speed. In respect of Northern Rock, the whole process of the evaluation of Northern Rock&#146;s assets has happened at a snail's pace. As the Minister pointed out, the order allowing a valuer to be appointed was made on 12 March. Six months later, a valuer was appointed. In my view, that was a completely unacceptable delay. How difficult can it be to appoint a valuer of a bank that is bust?</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000030"></a>Secondly, why have we had a six-month gap between the valuer being appointed and this order coming forward? More importantly, in respect of Northern Rock, is why such an order should be necessary at all. What kind of body is refusing to divulge information to the valuer that could have a serious influence on the valuation of Northern Rock? To a non-technical person, the conditions that were placed on the valuer would seem by definition to mean that Northern Rock had no residual value at the point at which it was nationalised. It would be extremely helpful to know what class of person is refusing to co-operate with the valuer in this respect, because it is shameful behaviour.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000031"></a>The noble Baroness talked about the need to be concerned about people who are coerced into giving information in respect of both these orders. It is not a question of being coerced into giving information. Anyone who has information that is relevant to the process should, as a matter of public duty, be willing to give it. If he has to be dragged to court in order to give it, he should not feel that he is being coerced. Rather, he should not be allowed to act as an obstacle to the pursuit of the public good.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000032"></a>The noble Baroness rightly talked about the delay in seeing a business plan for Bradford &amp; Bingley. She will recall that when Northern Rock was being nationalised, we were promised a strategy document by the Government within days of the Bill being passed which never appeared, despite assurances on   


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC21"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Floor of the House that we would see it within a day or two. I am slightly jaundiced about the Government making available business plans in respect of these two bodies. I revert to this: I accept that Bradford &amp; Bingley is a more complicated case, but is the Minister able to tell us why on earth anybody needs to have this procedure applied him to given the situation in which Northern Rock finds itself? Who is obstructing the valuer in trying to get the information which he feels he properly needs?</p>

<p><a name="09031620000033"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09031620000061"></a>Lord Myners:</b> The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked about the procedure for applying for information. The valuer would of course notify any third party of information required by the valuer for the purposes of the evaluation exercise.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000034"></a>We anticipate that he would notify them at the same time as the court procedure is commenced. If the third party refuses to comply with the request, the valuer may apply to the court at the same time and the third party would be put on notice. The court may also invite any party to make representations. Therefore, the third party&#146;s interests are properly protected.</p>
<h5><a name="09031620000045"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000035"></a>The noble Baroness raised a number of questions about why we did not specify protections in the order and a remedy for inappropriate disclosures. On the question of protections, I should like to write to the noble Baroness and the noble Lord in explanation as to why in this case such protections were not included. As for the remedy for inappropriate disclosure, if the valuer discloses confidential or private information not in accordance with the provisions of the order, it is possible that a person may bring a claim for breach of confidence.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000036"></a>Questions were also raised by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord on the business plans for Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, whose business plan will be finalised by 29 March 2009. A high-level business plan will be published very shortly thereafter. I cannot give precise dates as this is a matter for Bradford &amp; Bingley&#146;s board. The Northern Rock business plan will be published shortly following the Chancellor&#146;s decision to split Northern Rock into two banks, one to enable &#163;14 billion of new mortgages to be granted over the next two years.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09031620000037"></a>Questions were raised by both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord about the people from whom information was being sought by the independent valuer, who has made representations to the Treasury seeking powers to obtain information. Given that this is an independent valuation process, it is right that the Government provide these powers. I am not in a position to comment on who, if anyone, has refused to give information as this is an independent valuation process. The process of valuation is complex but very sensitive, and it is important that the independent valuer has all necessary powers to complete a valuation which is independent, thorough and beyond reasonable challenge. It is in those circumstances that we seek the authorities embodied in these instruments.</p>

When he introduced the orders, he said that they would make an order if the valuer made a reasonable case for the information to be obtained. Is the Minister saying that the Government will not share with Parliament what that reasonable case is based on? Once an order is granted, presumably this could end up in court and it would be plain and evident in any event. I referred in my own remarks to the auditors and to one or more potential purchasers of Northern Rock, on which I understood&#151;though from memory, so I cannot quote chapter and verse&#151;that the Minister informed the House during the passage of the Banking Bill. I am just a little concerned about what this secrecy is all about, because it is not enough for the valuer to say, &#147;I want to get information at will&#148;. The Government rightly referred to the fact that that request had to be reasonable. Therefore, they should be prepared to share with the House the nature of that request made to them.</p>

<p><a name="09031623000001"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09031623000048"></a>Lord Myners:</b> I believe that the identity of those from whom the valuer sought information would become a matter of knowledge when the valuer sought the necessary court order, if required, to secure the information. However, I am not in a position to give details of the people from whom the Northern Rock valuer is currently seeking information because I have not been given them, nor would it be right for me as a Minister to seek that information in any way that might seek to interfere with the work of the independent valuer.</p>

<p><a name="09031623000002"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09031623000049"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I am sorry, but we have to probe this a little further. The procedure is that the Government decide to confer the powers on the valuer. It has to decide that on the basis that the Minister explained from his own speaking notes, which was that a reasonable request had been made. The valuer does not just come up to the Treasury and say, &#147;I want to go to the court to get whatever information I want, so give me a broad power&#148;; it must make a case. If the Minister is saying that they are handing out those powers willy-nilly, Parliament should be much more concerned about the way in which they are being used. We had assumed from the Minister&#146;s remarks that the Government were satisfied that it was appropriate to give the valuer this power because of the circumstances of the case. The Minister is now saying that it is not appropriate for the Minister to know&#151;but it is of course appropriate for the Minister to know. I request that the Minister reconsider that position.</p>

I am not in a position to identify those parties. Should the valuer continue to seek information from them, and it is not forthcoming, the valuer may apply to the court, which will then assess whether the information should be provided. That is a very careful process, in which the court exercises the ultimate judgment as to whether the valuer has made a case that the information is necessary to the valuation process, and in which parties&#146; rights are

<p><a name="09031623000004"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0003.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09031623000053"></a>Lord Brett:</b> All members of the Committee will be aware of the important work being done by the UK Statistics Authority. The body was created by this Government last year with a statutory responsibility to promote and safeguard the production and publication of official statistics.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000005"></a>Two of its main functions are to monitor and report on official statistics, wherever they are produced in the UK, and independently to assess the quality of a core set of key official statistics for formal approval as national statistics.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000006"></a>The order before us today relates to the definition of official statistics; that is, the set of statistics that the authority must monitor and report on. Under the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, which created the authority, all statistics produced by the Office for National Statistics, government departments, the devolved Administrations and other Crown bodies, are automatically deemed to be official statistics. This means that numerous bodies are automatically under the oversight of the statistics authority and must follow its code of practice. For example, the Insolvency Service, the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission and the DVLA are Crown bodies, and are thus official statistics producers.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000007"></a>However, the Act also allows us to add further statistics by order, so that we can cover bodies that do not fall within this core definition but which clearly  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC24"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>produce statistics that we feel it is important for the public to have trust in. Such bodies that do not fall within the core definition but which should produce official statistics include the Training and Development Agency for Schools and the Independent Police Complaints Commission. If a body is included in this order, the public can be assured that the statistics authority can monitor and comment on its statistical work. It also makes it possible for a statistic to be nominated for formal assessment as a national statistic, assuring the public that it has been produced in a way that is fully code compliant.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90316-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000008"></a>During debates on a similar order last year&#151;the first such order&#151;the Government accepted that they would need to return to the House of Lords with a new list of bodies. The priority last time was to make sure that all producers of national statistics were covered, but other bodies were included with different departments applying different criteria for nominating bodies for inclusion. We have this year made the criteria clearer and the result, with which I hope the Committee will agree, is a more coherent list. The bodies in the list are producers of significant, national-level statistics which the Government feel are important that the public should trust.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000009"></a>In the Act, the Government are required to consult the statistics authority before laying the order. Officials from the Cabinet Office have worked closely with the authority while drafting this order. The authority has had several opportunities to comment on the drafts. After the formal consultation required by the Act, the authority has said that it is content with the order before us today. We expect to update this list once a year. It is an advantage of the flexible definition in the Act that we can respond to changing needs and refine the list in this way, subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000010"></a>In summary then, the order extends the number of bodies which are subject to the UK Statistics Authority&#146;s oversight. These bodies will have to work to the new code of practice for official statistics, and their statistics will have the potential to be nominated for formal assessment by the authority to be national statistics. It is a vital part of the Government&#146;s statistical reform programme, allowing greater independent monitoring and assessment of official statistics in order to enhance public trust in statistics. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09031623000011"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031623000054"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> The Minister may or may not be aware that, last year, with the support of the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, I submitted a paper to the Liaison Committee of the House in which we recommended that the accountability of what was then called the Statistics Board, but which is now the UK Statistics Authority, should be to a Joint Committee of both Houses. I am happy to say that the Liaison Committee accepted that proposal unanimously, and that the former Leader of the House, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, wrote to her opposite number in the other place, Harriet Harman, and asked that this should be drawn to the attention of another place with a view to its agreeing to set up a Joint Committee.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000012"></a>I am perfectly certain that the noble Lord, Lord Brett, had nothing whatever to do with this, but the fact is that, after three months, we had no reply at all  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC25"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from another place. In the event, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, had to tell me&#151;as she said, &#147;with some regret&#148;; and, of course, the Liaison Committee&#146;s report had been approved unanimously by this House&#151;that the Leader of the House in another place had refused to accept the recommendation of this House.</p>
<h5><a name="09031623000043"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000013"></a>Therefore, the position now is that the UK Statistics Authority is accountable only to a Select Committee in another place and not to this House. Happily, there are opportunities, and this is one of them, for Members of this House to exercise a form of parliamentary accountability that should, to some extent, make up for the lack of the proper, formal accountability that we should have had. I make no secret of the fact&#151;and I am sure that the noble Lord&#146;s advisers will confirm it&#151;that from the very beginning of the procedures on what became the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, I argued that there should be a Joint Committee of both Houses. At every stage of the Bill, I had the same argument. In the end, that was accepted by the Liaison Committee and this House. However, because the other place did not agree&#151;the right honourable Harriet Harman refused to accept that proposition&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Brett, finds himself, through no fault of his own, in the unfortunate position of being subjected to a form of accountability for statistics. This is the only opportunity we have to raise this, apart from going in for a ballot and having a separate debate on a separate question.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000014"></a>The noble Lord produced a perfectly sound argument about why the order is necessary. That is to say, some 54 new bodies whose official statistics are going to be subject to control, review and monitoring by the UK Statistics Authority need to be added. If that authority agrees that the statistics produced by all these bodies comply with the code&#151;and I shall have a word to say about that in a moment&#151;they may be classified not just as official statistics but as national statistics.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000015"></a>What is the purpose of this? The noble Lord very properly said that the purpose is to give assurance to the public that the figures that they are being issued with by these various bodies, including government departments and Ministers, can be trusted. He used the word &#147;trust&#148; twice, and he used the phrase, which is exactly what the Minister said in the other place,</p>
<ul><a name="09031623000040"></a>&#147;assuring the public that it has been produced in a way that is fully code compliant&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons, Third Delegated Legislation Committee, 2/3/09; col. 3.]</ul>
<p><a name="09031623000028"></a>If the noble Lord looks at his notes, he will see that he said exactly those words.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000016"></a>What is the example that is being set to these 54 bodies to produce statistics in a way that complies with the code? Perhaps we should first look at the code. It has a foreword by the chairman of the authority, Sir Michael Scholar, that sets out a code of practice for official statistics. It is divided into a number of principles. Principle 1 is meeting user needs, Principle 2 is impartiality and objectivity and Principle 3 is integrity. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031623000034"></a>&#147;At all stages in the production, management and dissemination of official statistics, the public interest should prevail over organisational, political or personal interests&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC26"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09031623000029"></a>That is so obviously right. Indeed, we argued throughout the passage of the Statistics and Registration Service Bill that these were the kind of principles that the Government were seeking to establish in order, as they put it, to build trust or, as we said, restore public trust, in statistics.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000017"></a>What has happened since then? First, an OECD survey showed that, out of the 27 countries in the European Economic Community, this country ranks 27 on the question of public trust in statistics. The EU average for trust is 46 per cent and not trusting is 45 per cent&#151;the balance is &#147;don&#146;t know&#148;. In this country, only one-third of those polled trusted official statistics, and nearly 60 per cent did not trust them. This country ranks 27th out of 27 in the crediting of official statistics. If that is going to be corrected then, at every level, the Government as well as the 54 new bodies being added by this order must comply with the principles of the code of practice. Under principle three about integrity, there is a whole lot of things; I shall not bother to read them all out, because they are all perfectly clear.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000018"></a>What is the most recent example that we have had of a Government issuing statistics in a way that they ought not to have? I put it neutrally. Noble Lords will remember that No. 10 and the Home Office issued press releases apparently quoting statistics about knife crime and admissions to accident and emergency units as a result of knife crime which totally failed to comply with anything in the code of practice. Worse than that, not only did they not comply but a whole series of e-mails have been published by the Select Committee in another place&#151;which has not yet issued its report; I am very much looking forward to that&#151;that passed between No. 10, the Department of Health and the National Statistician on whether those statistics should have been published in that form. At every single level of officialdom, it was said firmly that those statistics should not be published as they had not been checked or verified, had not been subject to any of the normal rules of the dates and time of release of statistics and that it would be an outrage if they were published. The fact of the matter is that that counted for nothing. The demand that the knife crime statistics should be published came from the Prime Minister. There is a minute from 10 December that says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031623000035"></a>&#147;Here is the statement that the PM would like us to publish tomorrow as part of the knife crime announcement&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031623000031"></a>Then come the details of the statistics that he wanted. There was a very firm view by officials directed to No.10, expressed in another e-mail of 10 December, saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031623000036"></a>&#147;I&#146;ve spoken to a number of people here, including the Head of Profession at the NHS IC and our view is that these provisional data are NOT released.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031623000037"></a>Our reasons are:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031623000038"></a>1) As explained already these are provisional data for 2007/08 and 2008/09 and therefore they are potentially inaccurate and may possibly give the wrong impression&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031623000032"></a>The second reason is perhaps less creditable. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031623000039"></a>&#147;2) If we allowed these data to be published, we open ourselves up to provide these provisional data to others who may ask for data which shows different trends&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC27"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09031623000033"></a>That is to say, somebody might ask for data that might show the whole thing up in a much less favourable light. That is the way that this Government now think, apparently.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000019"></a>However, that had no effect. A later e-mail, after a number of futile telephone calls, stated, &#147;I have also been informed that Number 10 are adamant about the need to publish this statistic. As a result, I have been informed that they are likely to publish the data irrespective of the concerns raised&#148;. The representations went right to the top. They went to the Permanent Secretary at Number 10, Jeremy Haywood. The National Statistician, Karen Dunnell, &#147;has spoken to Jeremy this morning about the inclusion of certain unpublished statistics in a statement the PM may be making.&#148; It was all for no purpose at all. Number 10 went right ahead and published the statistics. Why did it do that? It turned out that Mr Brown, the Prime Minister, had an appointment to meet a number of parents of the victims of knife crime that day, and he wanted to have the statistics published to show that everything was getting much better. That is why.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000020"></a>What sort of example does that set to the 54 bodies listed in this schedule? How will that restore public trust in statistics? What sort of temptation may some of these bodies be under to say, &#147;Well if it&#146;s all right for the Prime Minister, it&#146;s all right for us&#148;? We had an apology from Jeremy Haywood who said that perhaps they did not pay enough attention to the views of the professional statisticians. What he meant was that the Prime Minister did not pay enough attention to the views of the professional statisticians. He summed it all up in the word &#147;we&#148;. There was a brief apology on the Floor of the House from the Home Secretary, who said that perhaps some of the statistics should not have been published and that she was sorry. Both apologies were totally inadequate for what was a major breach not only of the code, but of all possible principles that should apply to the issue of statistics.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000021"></a>The Minister has commended this order to the Committee on the grounds that it greatly extends the list of bodies whose statistics the public will be invited to trust. But 27th out of 27? We can only go up. The history of this Government&#146;s misuse of statistics has been utterly deplorable. Ministers must recognise that if they are going to achieve their objective of restoring public trust in statistics, the kind of example set by the Prime Minister last December has simply got to stop.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000022"></a>When it issues its report, I would expect the Select Committee in another place to use more politic language than I have used, but for those of us who took part from the very beginning in the proceedings on the statistics Bill, it is nothing short of disgraceful that here we are, more than two years later, still facing such misbehaviour by Ministers, despite the best advice that they could get from the people who really ought to know, which sets a perfectly deplorable example.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031623000023"></a>I have now got that off my chest. I hope that the Minister will himself add to the apology given by his colleagues. If he does not like listening to Back-Bench Peers expressing these views, he has a perfectly good remedy. He can go straight to Harriet Harman and tell   


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>her that there should be a Joint Committee of both Houses. Then these matters would be dealt with there and not, as they are this afternoon, on the Floor of this Grand Committee.</p>
<h5><a name="09031627000043"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09031627000002"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09031627000045"></a>Lord Newby:</b> It is always a pleasure to hear the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, speak on statistics. We debated these issues during the passage of the Bill and in subsequent debates on the establishment of a Joint Select Committee, when he said that there was a unanimous view in your Lordships&#146; House that this would be desirable, but the Commons rejected it out of hand.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000003"></a>As the Minister said, the purpose of this exercise is to improve trust in official statistics. If it is the case that 33 per cent of people now trust official statistics, unless I am very much mistaken, that is a significant improvement from the position when the Bill was going through. If my memory serves me correctly I think that only 17 per cent of people trusted statistics. I had a question for the Minister on the extent to which either the Statistics Board or the Government have a regular series of opinion surveys on trust in official statistics. We are at a low level&#151;27th out of 27&#151;when one recalls that Bulgarians, Romanians, Latvians and many others have far greater trust in their statistics than we have in ours. That is dismal, but it would be useful to know whether or not there is a trend in a positive direction.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000004"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, referred to knife crime. I am tempted to ask whether he is surprised. The track record of the Prime Minister as Chancellor in this regard was lamentable. He will know better than anybody that the Government, having set their face towards reforming how official statistics and national statistics are managed then produced a weak Bill that had to be almost completely rewritten by your Lordships&#146; House to make it stronger. In the end the Government had to capitulate. The Bill was weak because the Government did not want a strong one. There is no effective sanction in cases when the Government misbehave. The Bill allows national statistics to be downgraded to official statistics. When it was going through, Ministers explained that the prospect of having statistics downgraded so appalled Permanent Secretaries and senior officials that there would be no question of misusing information. The sanction would bring such public obloquy that they would bend over backwards to avoid it. The truth is that politicians still override that kind of consideration for the short-term consideration described by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. There is no effective sanction against Ministers who misuse statistics in this way.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000005"></a>I read the Explanatory Notes with great interest. Noble Lords will know that we on these Benches have argued that there should be no difference between national and official statistics; all official statistics should be national statistics. For noble Lords who wonder why we take that view I commend them to the simple sentence in paragraph 4 of the Explanatory Notes, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031627000040"></a>&#147;This was because, once the Act came into force on 1 April 2008, a National statistic had to be an official statistic&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC29"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09031627000036"></a>It is perhaps appropriate that the Act came into force on April Fool&#146;s Day because that statement is complete gobbledegook.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000006"></a>In practice that means that the bodies specified in the order will be expected to follow the code as best as they can. That is pathetic. The principles set out by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, about the kind of practices that should be followed in producing statistics would strike the ordinary person as being so blindingly obvious that anybody producing statistics, whether covered by the order or already covered, should be following the code. What is so difficult about that? What circumstances can there be in which the bodies covered by this order would find it impossible to follow the code? If all bodies are being told is that we would quite like them to follow the code as best they can, it is a very weak injunction.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000007"></a>When we discussed the list last year, there was some discussion about where the Bank of England sat in respect of statistics. I believe that it is the case that the Bank of England is not covered by the legislation and that the Statistics Board and the National Statistician does not have oversight of statistics provided by the Bank of England. At that time, there was some discussion about why that might be the case, and I am spurred to raise the question again when I see that the Financial Services Authority is now covered by the schedule and the order. The Office for National Statistics has oversight over two legs of the tripartite authorities involved in statistics&#151;namely, the Treasury and the FSA&#151;but does not have oversight over the Bank of England. Do the Government have any plans to rectify that omission?</p>

<p><a name="09031627000008"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09031627000046"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, for his remarks, with which I want to associate myself. As a new boy in this place, hearing distinguished Members holding the Government to account over the quality of statistics is very impressive and serious. The charge that was made was extremely serious, and I hope that the Minister will respond to it in his comments and that the Government will adhere to it in going forward.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000009"></a>I make a couple of pleas in considering these orders. The order comes up, we are presented with a list of 54 deemed persons whom we are told are relevant, then we are told in the explanatory note on the back that,</p>
<ul><a name="09031627000042"></a>&#147;28 are new, and 10 are omitted&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09031627000037"></a>from the last list. It would probably be helpful for debate if we could see asterisked or sorted in some way which ones are new and which have been dropped from the previous list. The accompanying Explanatory Memorandum gives one example of the ones that have been dropped&#151;the Royal Air Force Museum&#151;and, of course, nobody is going to pick on that. However, I am always slightly suspicious about 10 being omitted from the order last year when only one example is given. It would be helpful to see that information.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000010"></a>I am very struck by, and associate myself with, the remarks made about Bank of England. In the midst of an economic crisis, when the centre of the debate is on the state of public finance, it would seem absolutely appropriate that the Bank of England should be included in that schedule along with many other bodies that are  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC30"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column GC30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>directly associated with that effort. The whole statistical process has resonance; it is not just a debating point about the use or misuse of statistics. These statistics drive the allocation of scarce resources by the Government, so if they do not have veracity and cannot be trusted, we may be wasting money and spending it in the wrong place as well as understating the need in certain other areas. That is something else that I urge the Minister to give care to.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000011"></a>On the guidance that is followed, we are told that we can have confidence in these statistics. However, as has been said, the guidance goes only as far as saying that those bodies specified in the order will be expected to follow the code&#151;that all sounds good&#151;as best they can. Is not being able to do so as best as they can an admissible excuse in this regard?</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000012"></a>I am also very interested in the fact that if the statistics comply with the code the board will approve them as national statistics. It would be useful to have a statistic about how many of those statistics have not received such approval and how many have been turned down. To see that level of detail would be useful. That speaks to the point of my noble friend Lord Jenkin, who said that, had there been extra scrutiny in this place and a Joint Committee, that is exactly the type of information which could come before it and help our debate.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000013"></a>The horrendous case mentioned was the misuse of the knife crime statistics. The head of the UK Statistics Authority described the release of the figures as &#147;premature, irregular and selective&#148;. He revealed that statisticians behind the data had tried to prevent the Government publishing the information&#151;again as evidenced by my noble friend Lord Jenkin&#151;and said that the data in their current form were &#147;corrosive of public trust&#148;. That is a bold statement by the person now in charge of the accuracy of our statistics. I ask the Minister to reflect on that, certainly given that it has been raised on a couple of occasions, and hope that we might get a response.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000014"></a>Paragraph 8.2 of the Explanatory Notes, under the heading &#147;Consultation outcome&#148;, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031627000041"></a>&#147;Bodies that have been included in the order have been consulted ... those bodies that were in the first order were consulted last year ... This has generally been done by the statistical Head of Profession in each Government department contacting those bodies which are sponsored by that department&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031627000038"></a>Again, that is the type of information&#151;that is, the extent and nature of the consultation, and the feedback from it&#151;that would be extremely helpful in discussing this order. It is clear that the objective of the statistics order is to build trust in national statistics. We have heard it argued how those statistics have been misused in the past in a grossly irresponsible way and how there is a need for greater scrutiny. When this order was discussed in another place, it took 11 minutes. The fact that we are up to 34 minutes and counting speaks of the importance that we at this end attach to these matters, and I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="09031627000015"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09031627000047"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I rise with some trepidation following the battering that I have received from the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. I do so also partly protected by my ignorance of the discussions to which he referred in

However, some of the answers to the questions that he posed are in the questions that he raised.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000016"></a>We are not proud of our position within the OECD in terms of trustworthiness of statistics, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said, there has been an improvement of some 15 per cent in public perception and trust since Act came in, which means that we have started to turn the situation around, although there is a lot more to be done. That is why the list has been refined; that is why the code, to which I shall come in a minute, is so important. It is also why the Government have taken more action than any other to ensure the independence of statistics. We have created an independent authority, reporting directly to Parliament&#151;not, I agree, necessarily in the way that the noble Lord wishes&#151;to oversee and assess the production of official statistics. Our setting that authority on a statutory footing built on the framework for national statistics as set in 2000. We are therefore building the statute on what we already had as a practical operation. We have reduced pre-release access to official statistics from five days to 24 hours, and have limited the number of statistics to which it applies and the number of people who get it. We have also taken Ministers out of the governance of the ONS.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000017"></a>I turn to the laboured point on knife crime statistics, which caused such a furore last December. I offer it as proof that the system works, because it led to a furore and the admission that those statistics had been produced and released prematurely. It led to the Home Secretary apologising to the House of Commons. Most importantly, it led to action to put in place measures to ensure that those errors would not be repeated.</p>
<h5><a name="09031627000044"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09031627000018"></a><b><a name="90316-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09031627000048"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> How can the Minister possibly argue that the system was working as it should have when the Prime Minister overruled all his officials, including the National Statistician, and insisted upon publishing statistics that he had been firmly told that he ought not to? We had debate after debate on the Floor of the House, in Committee and on Report on the whole question of the misuse of statistics. Here we have had, in the past two or three months, a classic example of Ministers not learning anything about this at all. It is not working properly.</p>

I am not suggesting that the system was working properly on that date. I am saying that it that caused a furore, and caused Parliament and Ministers to respond. It caused an apology to be received by the House of Commons. That shows that attention is paid to the issue. In that sense, it is working&#151;not that this error was in any way permissible. I was starting to outline how we are trying to ensure that it is not repeated. I know that confession is good for the soul, and that the Opposition are demanding apologies. An apology has been made on this, and I have nothing to add to that.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000020"></a>Of course, in Gus O&#146;Donnell&#146;s and Kevin Brennan&#146;s letters, they said what happened and there had been an apology. It is more important in many ways that we

On the actors&#146; role on that occasion and why the National Statistician&#146;s intervention did not prevent the statistics being produced, she phoned No. 10 at 8 am but the press release had been released the previous evening on the basis of a midnight embargo. In that sense, preventing the release of the statistics was not practical.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000021"></a>However, that is history and we know the problems that it caused. Since then, the Government have ensured that the action taken cannot be repeated. They have produced and circulated to all appropriate persons in Whitehall a memorandum on exactly how statistics are to be treated in future to ensure that it does not happen again. Michael Scholar was invited, and spoke, to the permanent secretaries&#146; conference to ensure that it does not happen again. There was a lesson to be learnt, which I believe has been learnt.</p>

The point was made by my noble friend to say that the Prime Minister specifically said on 10 December that he required this information to be released.

He knows precisely that I am not suggesting that. I am suggesting solely that he has raised evidence about a Select Committee report in another place which is dealing with the problem. I am suggesting that we await that report. The Ministers concerned are Ministers in another place. That is the appropriate course of action.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000031"></a>I now turn to some of the points raised. If I do not do justice to them, I am more than happy to reply in writing because all three noble Lords made points in their contributions. I start with the points about the Bank of England, which is not included. The authority and the bank have been in regular contact with each other through 2008. They have agreed not to include the bank in the 2009 order. That is with the consent of the Cabinet Office and the Treasury. The bank has its own code of practice for statistics, which works well for its specific and important role. It passes a lot of data to the ONS and any resulting statistics, including parts of the national accounts and much of the <I>Financial Statistics</I> publication, are national statistics and so are fully compliant with the authority&#146;s code.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000032"></a>The point of greater interest is why we are not including the bank at the present time. Those discussions are continuing. The bank sometimes collects data which it decides not to publish even without announcing that it will not publish them. That would go against the code as it stands&#151;in this case, on the protocol on release practices. As I said, the bank and the authority are working closely to see how best to use the code in a specific area of monetary and financial statistics in a way that does not hinder the bank's ability to perform

<a name="90316-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000033"></a>The other points raised included a sensible point from the noble Lord, Lord Bates, about having a clearer understanding of which bodies were new and which had been dropped. Those dropped from the first order tended to be dropped because they were not producing national statistics or continuing to exist beyond 2009. They include the British Hallmarking Council, the Fleet Air Arm Museum, the Hearing Aid Council, the National Army Museum, the Royal Air Force Museum, the Royal Marines Museum, the Royal Naval Museum and the Royal Navy Submarine Museum. That is because they are not producing significant national-level statistics. Also excluded are the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection, the Commission for Social Care Inspection, the Commission for the New Towns, the Housing Corporation and the Urban Regeneration Agency. That is because, as the Committee will have spotted, they are due for abolition on or before 1 April 2009. The first two bodies in the list will be replaced by the Care Quality Commission and the second two as a result of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. None of the statistics has been lost, but will be picked up in respect of the replacement bodies. I hope that that assists with that particular question.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked whether there were surveys. The ONS produces a regular annual survey, which is how it hopes to glean the increasing confidence that it expects to get from the improved performance, notwithstanding the highly rehearsed question about the statistics produced and released prematurely in December.</p>

<a name="90316-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031627000035"></a>I will write to the noble Lord, Lord Bates, to answer his question about statistics and the consultation about statistics. That covers most of the points raised by noble Lords. I will examine <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow, and if there are any points that I have not covered, I will write to noble Lords. With that, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09031627000039"></a><I>Motion agreed.</I></p>

<p><i><a name="09031627000058"></a>Committee adjourned at 5.54 pm.</i></p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0903163000006"></a>I announced on 8 December 2008 a pause in negotiations over the St Helena Airport contract. Having reviewed the situation in the light of the current global economic climate, I have decided to hold a consultation on options for access to the island. DfID will issue a consultation document in early April. Any interested parties will be invited to submit their views. The Government of St Helena and relevant commercial parties have been advised of the situation and will be kept updated.</p>

<a name="90316-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0903163000008"></a>On 15 July 2008 the Minister for the Overseas Territories informed the House that on 10 July the governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands had announced the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry into whether there is information that corruption or other  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS2"></a><b>16 Mar 2009 : Column WS2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>serious dishonesty in relation to past and present elected Members of the House of Assembly may have taken place in recent years.</p>

<a name="90316-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0903163000009"></a>I wish to inform the House that on 16 March 2009 the governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) published the interim report of the commissioner, the right honourable Sir Robin Auld (<a href="http://www.tci-inquiry.org">www.tci-inquiry.org</a>).</p>

<a name="90316-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0903163000010"></a>The commissioner states that the written information obtained in the first six months of the commission&#146;s inquiries, when coupled with the evidence in the public hearings in TCI earlier this year, have provided information in abundance pointing to a high probability of systemic corruption or serious dishonesty. In his view this, together with &#147;clear signs of political amorality and immaturity and of general administrative incompetence, have demonstrated a need for urgent suspension in whole or in part of the constitution and for other legislative and administrative reforms&#148;, and change in other related matters.</p>

<a name="90316-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0903163000011"></a>In light of the accumulation of evidence in relation to TCI in the past year or so, and fortified by the commissioner&#146;s interim report, the Government have formed the view that parts of the constitution will need to be suspended and have decided to take steps to enable it to do so. I am today making available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) website a draft Order in Council prepared by the FCO which would suspend parts of the constitution, including those relating to ministerial government and the House of Assembly, initially for two years, although this period could be extended or shortened. The draft order will be submitted to Her Majesty in council at a meeting on 18 March. If made, the order will be laid before Parliament on 25 March. Unless the commissioner&#146;s final report significantly changes our current assessment of the situation, the order will be brought into force after the final report is received. However, the order could be brought into force sooner if circumstances arose in the territory prior to that date which justified suspending relevant parts of the constitution. This intervention is for an interim period only.</p>

<a name="90316-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0903163000012"></a>As drafted, the order would leave in place important elements of the constitution such as the fundamental rights chapter and provisions relating to the governor, the courts and the public service, while removing the Cabinet, House of Assembly and references to ministerial and related powers. Powers and functions currently exercised by Ministers would be exercised by the governor acting in his discretion, including in relation to public finances, legislation and necessary regulatory reform.</p>

<a name="90316-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0903163000013"></a>This would be an act of constitutional significance in order to restore the principles of good governance.</p>

<a name="90316-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0903163000014"></a>This Statement is being laid at this time to allow the governor to announce the publication of the interim report in parallel in the territory.</p>

As and when new material comes to light it is considered and the organisation re-assessed as part of that process. Any decision to proscribe must be based on evidence that a group is concerned in terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Act 2000, and must be proportionate.</p>

The pace of progress of negotiations with Turkey is determined by the pace of Turkey's own reforms to meet the EU accession criteria including good neighbourly relations.
