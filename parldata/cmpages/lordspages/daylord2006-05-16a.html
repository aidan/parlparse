<a name="60516-01_star0"></a><h3 align=center>Parliament: Accountability of Executive</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Waddington </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether they have made any plans to improve parliamentary accountability of the Executive.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  My Lords, parliamentary accountability is at the heart of our constitutional arrangements. The Government are accountable to Parliament for all their actions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Waddington: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her very courteous reply, which is helpful as far as it goes, but is it not a very serious matter that, while there is talk of reducing the powers of this place, nothing is being done to restore to the House of Commons its ability to hold the executive to account and scrutinise legislation properly? Is it not shocking that, because of the guillotine, the Communications Bill should have come to this place with 101 clauses and five schedules entirely unconsidered in the Commons? Is it not really rather scandalous that, after the Prevention of Terrorism Bill had been extensively amended in this place, it went back to the Commons and all the amendments made in this place were weighed off in one three-hour debate&#151;most of which, incidentally, was taken up by replies from the Secretary of State? Can we therefore have an assurance that, before there is any further messing about with this place, the Government will make changes to allow the House of Commons to do its job properly?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord will not be surprised to hear me say that I think that programming has its benefits. In another place, the Government work through the usual channels with the Opposition parties to ensure that the critical issues are debated fully. In your Lordships&#039; House, we have always had the privilege of debating a lot of issues, and we should continue to do so. As my right honourable friend the Leader of the Commons said this morning, the ambition is to ensure that this House is complementary to another place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that when the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, was the Leader of this House, what he describes happened to us on several occasions? Surely we are just continuing what he started years ago.

<a name="60516-01_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I was not here, so, unfortunately, I cannot comment on that. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, did his best.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, do the Government accept that scrutiny of their actions is central to accountability? Will the Government therefore co-operate in setting up a Select Committee to scrutinise the treaty-making process before treaties are agreed and signed?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, that issue needs to be considered. I know that the noble Lord feels strongly about it. I will, of course, ensure that his comments are referred to those who are considering the matter at the moment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, the Minister is not quite right&#151;is she?&#151;when she says that all of the Government&#039;s actions are subject to scrutiny by Parliament as a whole. The Finance Bill is still not subject to proper scrutiny by this House. Given that the Finance Bill has now doubled in size to, on average, 445 pages; given that vast swathes of it are simply not debated in the other place; and given the Government&#039;s fascination with the powers and role of this place, would it not be appropriate to consider giving this House a proper role in scrutinising Finance Bills?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I do not agree with the noble Lord, which will be of absolutely no surprise to him. It is not beyond the ability of those in the opposition parties in another place to determine precisely how they wish to scrutinise legislation. I am sure that they will be able to do that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Soley: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend recall that debates in Westminster Hall were introduced in 1997 partly to aid greater scrutiny of the Executive? Does she also recall that the Prime Minister answers questions before a Select Committee, which was never previously done? Are there not many other examples of that type? Would it not be better if parliamentarians both here and in the House of Commons sat down and asked how they could improve the system which we operate and did not wait for governments to do things to us? It is supposed to be parliamentarians, not governments, who drive Parliament.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend Lord Soley. It is important to recognise all of the changes that we have made to ensure that we are able to deal with scrutiny appropriately. It is indeed for parliamentarians to make their voices heard, which I believe is what the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, was seeking to do in this case.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Shephard of Northwold: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree with me and many on this side of the House that to talk of reform of this House means reform of Parliament and indeed of the whole of our constitution?

</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I would refer the noble Baroness to my comments earlier about my right honourable friend the Leader of the House, who said on radio this morning that he saw the role of this House as complementary. Therefore, he is thinking across Parliament in that way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </b>   My Lords, are not Bills that arrive from the other place without proper scrutiny a testament to the incompetence and the stupidity of the Opposition?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I am not sure of the parliamentary language in this context, but it is very important that scrutiny of legislation is carried out in another place and in your Lordships&#039; House. I accept, however, as I said, that programming has its role in making sure that critical issues are dealt with properly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, if a committee of this House were to suggest that evidence should be taken in committee on the basis of subpoenaing Cabinet Ministers and taking their evidence on oath, would the Government support that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I am not going to get into the idea of subpoenaing Cabinet Ministers in your Lordships&#039; House today.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Davies of Coity: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend recognise that this Question refers to parliamentary accountability? That is the accountability of both Houses of Parliament. Does my noble friend recall that, until their removal in 1999, the hereditary Peers, the majority of whom were on the Conservative Benches, held their Government to account in the Commons not once?
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend that it is very important that proper and effective accountability takes place in your Lordships&#039; House and in another place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Saatchi: </b>   My Lords, I think that one of the members of the Public Administration Committee in another place said this morning that his Select Committee was the pre-eminent court in the land. Alas, that is not strictly true, is it? I believe that <i>Erskine May</i> has made clear in all its editions from 1859 to the present day that there are clear limitations on the powers of our Select Committees to send for persons, papers and records. Therefore, would we not be better off on the accountability that my noble friend and, I am sure, all of us seek if our Select Committees had more powers of the type given to US congressional committees? Those powers include, as my noble friend Lord Kingsland said, the awesome power of subpoena and the fact that a false statement before a committee counts as perjury.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60516-01_spnew19"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, we had a long and interesting debate about the powers of Select <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_134"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 134</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Committees during the passage of the Inquiries Bill. I hope that the noble Lord might look at that. Indeed, I spoke with the chairman of the Select Committee in question, Mr Wright, about the issues of concern. I think that the noble Lord will find that the powers of Select Committee are wide and varied, and I do not recall any Minister refusing to attend.

<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What assessment is being made of the incidence of suicide amongst men falsely accused of rape.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My Lords, such cases are tragic but extremely rare. A recent analysis of reported rape cases indicated that approximately 3 per cent were false allegations, none of which went beyond the investigative stage. Deaths in prison custody are investigated by the Prison and Probation Ombudsman, including individual circumstances and contributory factors. During 2006, data will be collected for the first time on suicides of offenders under community supervision, including post-release.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept that suicide among men falsely accused of rape is some indicator of the scale of miscarriages of justice? Surely any review of rape law must take into account the number of occasions where women have withdrawn an allegation of rape after the accused has been sentenced. Should we not now have an audit of the incidence of false rape accusations?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend that the withdrawal of a rape allegation on the basis that it was falsely made initially is a matter of real importance. However it is very difficult to look at the scale of miscarriages of justice on the basis of those who commit suicide. The figure of 3 per cent relates to those who have withdrawn the allegation, as recent studies make clear. There is a lot of work for us to do. I certainly agree with my noble friend that the consultation is an opportunity for us to look at these issues much more closely.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, a little while ago there was a very critical report by the Police and Crown Prosecution Inspectorate about the prosecution and investigation of rape cases. Since then a rape action plan has been considered in terms of stocktaking. Can the Minister indicate why the success rate in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_135"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 135</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

convictions for rape so low and whether there is any intention to measure the situation relating to people who are falsely accused of rape?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, it would be right to say that the real issue is the under-reporting of rape. We know that a huge number of women are put off and frightened by the process of coming forward. We have taken that very seriously indeed and it is one of the reasons why the consultation is going to look at this matter more closely. But we have done a great deal to address this issue. We have introduced specialist rape prosecutors in every CPS area. We have overhauled the law, as noble Lords know, on sexual offences. We have created special measures to enable people to give evidence more easily. We have limited the circumstances in which the victim&#039;s previous sexual history is admissible in court and we have clarified and expanded the circumstances where evidence of the defendant&#039;s bad character is admissible. Now there is the issue as to what amounts to consent and how we should deal with it. All those matters have to be looked at in order for us to get the best and fairest system, not only for the accused but for the victim.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, is the anonymity of the accused as well as the accuser taken into account in this consultation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, it is because noble Lords will know that the accused is not identified prior to charge. During the arrest period, anonymity is maintained. We have debated the whole question of whether anonymity should be continued throughout the trial on a number of occasions and noble Lords will know that all the reports we have had indicate that the current balance is the fairest one.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, has my noble friend seen the research by a Dr Eugene J Kanin of Purdue University in the United States of America, whose paper <i>False Rape Allegations</i> found that 41 per cent of forcible rape allegations were false following admissions by the complainants when they were questioned? Is that not a startling figure and does it not suggest that the figure given by my noble friend of 3 per cent may well be a gross underestimation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I have certainly heard of that research but I respectfully say to my noble friend that our own research&#151;many noble Lords will have seen it&#151;called <i>A gap or a chasm? Attrition in reported rape cases,</i> undertaken by Liz Kelly, Jo Lovett and Linda Regan, has looked at this very issue. They looked at the figures that were apparent in this country and, in examining those figures, they came up with 3 per cent They interrogated the cases that had been identified by the police as being false allegations. I have to say, we still live in an environment where people are very sceptical about <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_136"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 136</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

these allegations and are quite rigorous in the way in which they approach them before cases are brought forward. That is an issue which we have to look at, too.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness referred to the victim and the accused. Would it not have been more even-handed to have referred to the accuser and the accused? Until the trial is complete and it is discovered whether the allegation is true or false, there is no victim, there is only an accuser.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, of course I accept the noble Lord&#039;s nicety of language, but I have to tell him that there are many rape victims who never have the courage to come forward and who are never able to get the justice they need. They remain victims, irrespective of whether their perpetrator is or is not charged and properly convicted.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What progress they are making in the control of bovine tuberculosis.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spmin2"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My Lords, in recent months the Government have introduced pre-movement testing in England to help reduce the geographical spread of TB, implemented a new system of compensation to avoid overpayment and speed up the removal of reactors, and consulted on the principle and method of badger culling to control TB in the high-incidence areas in England. We continue to work closely with our stakeholders on all elements of the TB programme, which is very complicated.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, while thanking the Minister for that reply, does he agree that the figure of 3,653 new herd incidents recorded in Great Britain is a disgrace? That was a 9.1 per cent increase on 2004. This disease is out of control. Does he support the comments made by Ben Bradshaw on 20 April about international experience suggesting that leaving the reservoir of wildlife untouched will prevent us containing and eradicating bovine TB?
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, this is an incredibly complex issue, which I have not had the opportunity of examining. I certainly cannot comment on what Ben Bradshaw said. At the moment we are looking at the results of the consultation that took place over 12 weeks and finished on 10 March. We will conclude our deliberations as quickly as possible.
</p>

<a name="60516-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>I have obviously looked at the figures, coming back fresh to this serious issue after seven years&#151;it was an area I was responsible for a few years ago. However, it goes back: in 1980 Lord Zuckerman chaired a committee looking at the issues of bovine TB; after that was Professor Dunnett; and now we are operating on the basis of Professor Krebs&#039;s original report. In the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_137"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 137</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

last week some figures have been published about a reduction in incidence, although we do not know the reason, even though more tests have been taken. It is an incredibly complicated and sensitive issue. It is important from the point of view of public confidence that it does not get out of control.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60516-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Grantchester: </b>   My Lords, one of the statutory aspects of the TB situation concerns cattle taken as reactors that subsequently prove negative at culture and negative at slaughter. With the current rather incomplete compensation scheme, everyone loses. Can the Minister tell us how many false positives to TB there are, what percentage of the total this is and what the Government are doing to improve the science of the tests?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60516-03.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="60516-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I cannot give the figure that my noble friend has asked for. In 2005, 30,000 cattle were slaughtered. That was a 30 per cent increase on 2004. As I said, we have just changed the compensation system to avoid overpayments. It is not perfect and has only just changed; it is early days yet and the Government are paying for the first testing anyway. We need to speed up reactor removal. I will check on the compensation issue for those cattle later found not to have TB, but I suspect that that is a minority of the figure that I have just cited.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="60516-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </b>   My Lords, Professor John Bourne, who is in charge of the Krebs programme to look at the control of TB and the elimination of badgers, recently stated that the large-scale control of badgers would be necessary to accomplish that, which could be unacceptable in the United Kingdom. What work is being done to look at alternatives such as the vaccination of badgers and of cattle, as well as the measures that the Minister mentioned?
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60516-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is absolutely right: there is an issue as to whether the trials which have just taken place should have been on a larger scale. They were not the trials that Professor Krebs originally designed, which Professor Bourne and his team set out to initiate, because of gross interference with the culling. We spend &#163;15 million a year on vaccines, but obviously there is no perfect solution. As noble Lords know, there is a problem in the sense that there are no real tests for live badgers. Testing is being carried out for a field study of a badger vaccine. Trapping will start in June and an attempt at vaccination will start in September. With cattle, in January the Veterinary Laboratories Agency began further work in looking at new vaccine candidates and the delivery protocols. It is not easy to get the necessary badger vaccine to the badger.

<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="60516-03_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the Minister that he makes a very serious point and, although it may not sound like it, this too is a serious point: will he investigate the possibility of confirming the almost total decline of hedgehogs in this country since the doubling of badgers has occurred over the past decade? My understanding is that hedgehogs are treated as <i>hors d&#039;oeuvre</i> by badgers. If this could be confirmed, perhaps public opinion would be less hostile to culling badgers sick with TB, and then a balanced programme in TB hotspots of culling both cattle and badgers with bovine TB can proceed in a balanced way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="60516-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I fully accept what the noble Lord said about the need for balance. In my experience&#151;including two years in MAFF and even the past year in Northern Ireland, where there is an incidence of TB&#151;I have never had a conservationist come with a delegation and say, &quot;We are very worried about the TB in cattle&quot;, but I get plenty of people queuing up to say, &quot;Leave the badger alone&quot;. But the badger is a predator. I accept that it is a protected species, but we have to look at this in the balance. It is very important for the food chain and animal health in this country that this issue is tackled seriously and in a mature way. It should be based on science, it is true, but the science does not always deliver the clear results where you can be absolutely certain that the route you take is the correct one.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="60516-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   My Lords, while the Minister is, of course, absolutely correct in confirming that this is an extremely complex issue, I am old enough to have seen the ravages of bovine tuberculosis in children when I was a young doctor. This caused not only spinal tuberculosis, with frequent paralysis of the limbs, but much damage to bones and other organs. Since that time, the universal pasteurisation of milk has protected the population very largely, but is it not the case that these isolates of bovine tuberculosis in wildlife and cattle still carry a threat to human health? For that reason, is it not important that every conceivable effort should be made to eliminate this infection?
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="60516-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is absolutely right&#151;pasteurisation is the key but, as in everything else, nothing is 100 per cent I understand that there are still a few dozen&#151;maybe 40 or 50&#151;cases a year of bovine TB in humans. That is unacceptable.

&quot;(   )   The notice of the resolution must state the reasons for the proposed removal of the auditor from office.&quot;

<p><a name="st_71"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I rise to move Amendment No. 336, which inserts a new subsection into Clause 502, which deals with the special notice procedure for removing an auditor from office. I am pleased to see that so many noble Lords are interested in this issue. My amendment requires the notice of the resolution to include the reasons for the proposed removal. In most cases members appoint auditors at the annual general meeting. In some cases the directors appoint new auditors if one resigns during the year. Quite rightly the auditors cannot be removed by the directors during the year; instead they must seek the members&#039; approval. The auditors can submit their own representations, and in most cases the directors have to circulate them. However, the directors are not required to say why they are seeking a resolution to get rid of the auditors. Indeed, if the auditors prepare no representations, there might be no information at all available to shareholders, who need to decide how to cast their proxy votes, or whether to make the effort to attend the meeting.
</p>

<a name="60516-04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>The current procedure seems designed to keep the shareholders in the dark, placing the entire burden of information on the auditors&#039; representations. But the auditors are not seeking their own removal. In any event, the directors do not in all cases have to circulate the representations.
</p>

<a name="60516-04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>A related point is Part 1 of Article 36 of the eighth directive, which the Minister told us in Grand Committee the Government do not know how to implement. This says that auditors must not be removed on the grounds of divergence of opinion on accounting treatments or audit procedures. It is highly likely that at present, when auditors are removed, it is precisely for these reasons. I rather suspect that the Government resisted my amendment in Grand Committee because it would make transparent the fact that auditor removal occurs in the very circumstances which will be prohibited by the directive.
</p>

<a name="60516-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>In Grand Committee, the Minister merely told us that implementing the directive caused problems because it might stop members getting rid of an auditor they no longer trust. The truth is that members have no role in initiating the removal of auditors, other than to approve the directors&#039; recommendation. It is not the members&#039; trust but that of the directors that is at issue. In the absence of members being protected from directors removing auditors if they disagree with them over auditing or accounting, we believe that the case for disclosure of reasons is doubly strong. I beg to move.

<a name="60516-04_spnew11"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, as has been outlined by the noble Baroness, at present a company is entitled to remove its auditor at any time by ordinary resolution and does not need to justify its decision. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_143"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 143</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

This provision is currently in Section 391 of the Companies Act 1985, and it is repeated here in Clause 501. The audit directive&#151;the replacement for the eighth company law directive, which was finally adopted on 25 April&#151;will oblige us to ensure that auditors may be dismissed only where there are proper grounds.
</p>

<a name="60516-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>We are implementing some of the new provisions in the new audit directive in this part of the Bill, notably those relating to the senior statutory auditor and to auditors&#039; resignation statements. Other implementing provisions are to be found in Part 32. For the rest, we shall consult fully after publication of the final text of the directive before deciding how to implement it.
</p>

<a name="60516-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>The provision about the dismissal of auditors is difficult to implement in the UK. There is no distinction in the UK between the company and the members acting in general meeting. In other European jurisdictions, however, the general meeting of the members of the company can be an organ of the company, distinct from the company itself. The directive, or at least the provision in it about dismissal of auditors, appears to be predicated upon the distinction between the company and its members in accordance with which a company could act against the interests of the members by dismissing the auditors by resolution of the directors. This, however, is not possible in the UK, where not only is the company identical with the members in general meeting but it is only by resolution in general meeting that auditors may be dismissed. We shall need to do some work to find a way of constraining the company&#039;s ability to dismiss its auditors without preventing the members in general meeting being free to dismiss auditors in whom they no longer have confidence.
</p>

<a name="60516-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>In Grand Committee, and again today, it was suggested that it is fanciful to imagine the members deciding to get rid of an auditor, but in the real world the directors decide such a thing and the shareholders probably take little interest.
</p>

<a name="60516-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>It is important to remember that the provisions in UK company law and the audit directive about dismissal of auditors apply to all companies. It is not just about the small minority of companies with hundreds of thousands of shareholders; most of the companies affected are relatively small, private companies, and in most of those the shareholders are few and engaged.
</p>

<a name="60516-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>At present, such shareholders can dismiss their auditor without having to justify their decision. We believe it is right that they should be able to do that, so we need to think carefully about how to implement the new audit directive. It has to be implemented by June 2008, and we see no reason for haste on this aspect. We need to consult those affected and to find the best way of doing it. We may find that we need to introduce a statement of reasons into a notice of a resolution for removal, as in Amendment No. 336; or we may be able to use the statement of reasons that the company has to send to the audit authority under Clause 514 when an auditor leaves. In any case, there will need to be some method by which the reasons are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_144"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 144</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

disclosed and recorded. But that in itself is not enough: to comply with the directive, we shall also have to provide a rule that the reasons must meet certain criteria, so as to be &quot;good reason&quot;. We will somehow need to work in the reasons that according to the directive are not to be counted as good reason.
</p>

<a name="60516-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>We shall also need to decide whether to provide specific mechanisms for challenging the reasons given and whether to provide specific remedies in the event of reasons being found to be adequate or of challenges being found to be unjustified. It is our strong view that it would be best to work out the best overall approach to this requirement in the directive, to consult widely with all of those who will be affected and then to implement it as an overall solution rather than to introduce parts of a possible piecemeal approach. Accordingly, I ask the noble Baroness not to press the amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>In Grand Committee the Minister explained that the Government positively wanted auditors of quoted companies to make a statement of circumstances connected with their leaving office. Amendment No. 349, to which I have added my name, makes it clear that this is a subjective test, which is an extremely important issue.
</p>

<a name="60516-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a> In Grand Committee the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, said that the objective test was correct because the auditors were protected from having committed an offence by having taken reasonable steps. I suggest that that misses the point. That defence addresses a different issue of whether they took reasonable steps to issue the statement, but it does not address the auditor setting out his own views and not the views of someone else, or some hypothetical auditor on the Clapham omnibus. The issue is that the statement should be of the circumstances that the auditor thinks are appropriate, so I support the amendments.

The policy proposed by the Audit Quality Forum recommends a statement of the circumstances which the auditor considers are connected with his seeking to hold office.

It is of vital importance that the auditor should have the freedom&#151;I hope not the licence, but the freedom&#151;to say what needs to be said and perhaps to give all the explanations and to put totally at rest any doubts with the company shareholders or indeed with the wider world; with others who might be interested.

<a name="60516-05_spnew13"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   My Lords, I would like to support Amendment No. 349. Although the distinction may seem initially to be very slight, to a lawyer I think it would be very substantial. The statement which an auditor makes under Clause 510(3) will be a statement protected by privilege if he is sued for libel in respect of that statement. If the statement can relate only to the circumstances that were actually connected with his ceasing to hold office, he cannot express the circumstances where he feels that he has been removed because members of the company think that he is getting a little too close to the awkward truth.
</p>

<a name="60516-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Surely what is needed is that he can say, &quot;I feel that I am being removed because I am very unhappy about transaction xyz and I wish to investigate it further, and I think I am being removed because they don&#039;t want me to do that&quot;. If he can only say what has actually happened and not announce his suspicions he will be prevented by his partners from going down the latter route for fear of landing them in a massive defamation suit. Therefore, Amendment No. 349 is worthy of serious support.

<a name="60516-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I do not believe that there is anything in the clause as currently drafted that would prevent an auditor saying what he thought was appropriate if, in the terminology, he was getting close to the awkward truth.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="60516-06_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   My Lords, I am not saying that he is prevented: he can say that he has been removed because they do not like his face. The question is whether the statement is made within the scope of the Act and therefore whether it is one for which he will receive qualified privilege. If he rambles on about the chairman&#039;s drinking habits or something, he is not forbidden from doing so, but it is hardly a statement within the scope of the Act. What is important is that he is allowed to make the statement that he needs to make, and to ensure that it is properly protected from defamation proceedings.

</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="60516-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, notwithstanding that, I still do not believe that anything in the Bill would prevent the auditor making a full statement on all the issues he believes are connected with his ability to hold office.
</p>

<a name="60516-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Clause 510 deals with the important obligation on an auditor to provide an explanation of why he is no longer going to audit a company for the benefit of the shareholders and creditors. Auditors already have this duty, and the Bill modifies it so that it is more likely that an explanation will be provided. As we explained in Grand Committee, under Section 394 of the Companies Act 1985, an auditor who ceases to hold office for any reason is required to make a statement of the circumstances only if he positively considers that there are circumstances that should be brought to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_148"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 148</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

attention of the members or creditors of the company he is leaving. By contrast, for unquoted companies, Clause 510 requires the auditor to make a statement as the general rule, with the exception that he need not make a statement if he positively decides that there are no circumstances to be brought to the attention of the members or creditors.
</p>

<a name="60516-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>As we explained in Grand Committee, we are making these changes because of the importance of ensuring that whenever auditors are leaving because they believe there is a problem with the accounts or with the management of the company, they should make that known to the shareholders and to the public. The change from the 1985 Act shifts the balance in favour of disclosure, not against it. An undecided auditor at present might persuade himself that there are no circumstances that he considers should be brought to the attention of the members or creditors. He may find it more difficult to persuade himself that there are no circumstances that need be brought to their attention.
</p>

<a name="60516-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>Amendments Nos. 347 and 348 would together revert the Bill to the existing position under the Act, and the Government continue to believe that the proposals in the Bill are an improvement and help disclosure. For quoted companies, the Bill provides that auditors who are leaving are to be required to make a statement of circumstances in all cases, without any option.
</p>

<a name="60516-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Amendment No. 349 would change the content of the statement from

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>which is the nub of the noble Baroness&#039;s point. This can be seen as weakening the requirement unnecessarily. It goes without saying that an auditor, or anyone else making a statement of circumstances, will use his judgment in deciding what is relevant to include. That will inevitably be the case. I do not believe that any risk here would be avoided by the amendment. As we said in Grand Committee, there is a defence for an auditor who took all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence, but I accept the point made by the noble Baroness made on the relevance of that provision.
</p>

<a name="60516-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Given that defence, it is not clear whether there are circumstances in which the amendment would have a practical effect. I do not believe that there is a real problem to be solved. Nevertheless, in light of the opinions that have been expressed around the House, we will take this matter away and consider it further, because we want to ensure that we reach the right position. There is no disagreement about what we are trying to achieve.

<p><a name="st_93"></a> of the application.&quot;
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this small amendment, which seeks to enhance the information that members receive about a departing auditor, was suggested by the UK Shareholders Association. In Grand Committee, the Government were keen to emphasise the relationship between members and the auditors; but that is something of a myth, because, in practice, the relationship is between the directors and the auditors. If the auditor leaves office for any reason, it is right that shareholders are informed. We support in principle Clause 511, which requires the company to circulate an auditor&#039;s statements of circumstances and will be an invariable requirement for quoted companies.
</p>

<a name="60516-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>But the company can apply to the court not to circulate the notice. If it does so, the shareholder is left completely in the dark until the court has made its decision. That could put weeks, or even months, into the process. My amendment merely asks that the shareholders and others entitled to receive the accounts are informed of the application to the court so that they are on notice that there is an issue.
</p>

<a name="60516-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>The very fact that there is a dispute between the outgoing auditors and the directors is an indication that shareholders should have concerns, especially if there should be&#151;as the Government appear to believe&#151;a relationship of trust and confidence between the shareholder and the auditor. It is nonsense to suggest, as the Minister did in Grand Committee that, an

<a name="column_150"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 150</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I said in Grand Committee, we have sympathy with the idea behind this amendment but, on balance, would prefer to leave arrangements as they are and not adopt it. As has been explained, Clause 511 puts a duty on a company to circulate the statement made by a departing auditor. It then provides the company with an opportunity not to circulate it if it can persuade the court that the auditor is abusing his right, or&#151;as it is intended to be amended by the very next amendment, which we have already debated&#151;if he is seeking to secure


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;needless publicity for defamatory matter&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>There have apparently been cases where directors have gone to court for permission not to circulate an auditor&#039;s statement and not because they genuinely believed the auditor&#039;s purpose was to secure needless publicity for a defamatory matter. The directors hoped rather to delay the release of the auditor&#039;s statement because it included reasonable criticism of the directors that would be valuable to the shareholders. The directors&#039; hope was that by the time the court had turned down their application, the auditor&#039;s statement would be stale and would not have the impact it would have had if circulated straightaway.
</p>

<a name="60516-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>In considering such a case, there is an argument that the company must inform the shareholders, although it is not clear how much good it does. All they learn extra is that the directors do not want to circulate to them the statement the auditors have made. This might be of interest to them but it may not be of great value. More importantly, we should look at the main purpose of the clause, which is to enable the company not to circulate material that is unnecessarily defamatory and unlikely to be of use to the shareholders. In such cases, it is plainly of no value to the company to have to go to the expense of informing all its shareholders that it has gone to court.
</p>

<a name="60516-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Whereas we can see that there are cases where circulating this information might have some value, on balance we believe that it would generally have no value, and that it would therefore be inappropriate to force this extra expense on companies. I reiterate, we do have sympathy with the thrust of this point, but ultimately it is just a balance of which is the best way to take it forward. We would prefer to stick with the current formulation.

I accept that it is a question of balance between imposing unnecessary costs on companies on the one hand and on the other hand giving information to shareholders and perhaps even strengthening the hand of the auditors who might be being removed for reasons that are not entirely good. That has happened in the few cases which have gone to court to date where&#151;certainly in the most recent one&#151;the court punished the company by awarding costs against it. That did not go quite far enough because in that case the issue was kept from shareholders for a very long period of time.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 353, I shall speak also to the other amendments in my name in this group. This is a slightly complicated group of amendments because, as the House will see, the Government have tabled Amendments Nos. 361 and 362, which introduce two new clauses in place of Clause 513. These new clauses highlight the points made by my amendments in this group, but I fear that, far from answering them, they accentuate the points that I was making.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>We have been concerned about the duplication of information flows. Clause 513 and, indeed, the replacement clauses require both the auditor and the company to send identical information to the appropriate audit authorities. We do not believe in waste, and we can see no practical purpose for double information flows unless it is simply to provide evidence that either the company or the auditor has not done what Clause 513 requires for the purposes of a prosecution.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I am aware that the information flows from a company are reduced in the Government&#039;s amendments but, unless the Minister makes a convincing case that these duplicate flows should remain, we shall have reservations about accepting the Government&#039;s amendments in this group.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I have one question to put to the Minister about his Amendment No. 370, which is in the next group of amendments but has a bearing on these amendments. Amendment No. 370 defines the appropriate audit authority in subsection (1)(a) of the new clause after Clause 514. In the case of a major audit, this is either the Secretary of State or another body, which I believe will be the Public Oversight Board for Accountants. Can the Minister clarify whether it is for the company and the auditors under his new clauses to choose to whom the notifications and statements are sent? If so, what happens if the company sends material to the Secretary of State and the auditors send material to POBA? Do they have to check with each other and do they have to send information to one or both? Are we not creating the possibility of some dreadful paper chases between Whitehall and the City?
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>We do not oppose the thrust behind Clause 513 and we agree that information about auditor resignations should be passed to the appropriate audit authorities. But we believe that the associated processes should <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_152"></a>

be as efficient as possible and should be based on the principle of avoiding rather than creating bureaucracy. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="60516-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I start by dealing with the specific question on Amendment No. 370 concerning which body is the appropriate audit authority in relation to a major audit. We believe that, where that delegation has taken place, it is the body to which the Secretary of State has delegated that function, which I think would now be the POB&#151;the &quot;A&quot; has recently disappeared from its title. So we believe that there should be no confusion or duplication with the various flows going in two different routes, as the noble Baroness suggested might arise.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 360, 361, 362, 498 and 500 and respond to the other amendments in this group that have already been spoken to. I shall move Amendment No. 360 and so on in due course. We have brought our amendments forward having reflected on the debate on Clause 513 in Grand Committee in relation to amendments similar to those to which the noble Baroness has spoken.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Clause 513 introduces new requirements about the statements that auditors and companies must send to the appropriate audit authority when an auditor&#039;s appointment comes to an end. That is in line with the EU audit directive, which was agreed last year and formally adopted on 25 April.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Debate in Grand Committee revealed that the clause is confusing in conflating the duties on the auditor and the company, and the purpose of the new clauses introduced by Amendments Nos. 361 and 362 is to set out these duties separately and clearly. The first new clause deals with the auditor&#039;s duty to inform the audit authority when he ceases to be auditor of a company and divides it into two categories, based on the type of company being audited.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>If it is a listed company, or another company of major public interest according to criteria issued by the Financial Reporting Council, all statements should be sent to the Secretary of State or to the body to which he has delegated auditor supervisory functions. As that delegation has taken place, it would be to the Professional Oversight Board.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="60516-07_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister clarify this point? It is important and I would like to pursue it.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>Amendment No. 370 states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;in the case of a major audit, the Secretary of State or the body to whom the Secretary of State has delegated functions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>It does not indicate that it has to be the body to which the functions have been delegated. It implies that those persons lodging the appropriate statements can chose to which of those two they give them. The Minister repeated that point twice and I would like to be clear about it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>

<a name="column_153"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 153</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

point. But the provisions before us do not only deal with the current delegations that have taken place. Who knows what might happen in the future? That is why it is important to provide the alternative. I would like to repeat that and put in on record. If anything else is needed, I am happy to write on that matter. As that delegation has taken place, the POB is the body to which those submissions should be made.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>If the company that the auditor has left is an unlisted company and not otherwise of major public interest, a statement need only be submitted in the case of an auditor&#039;s resignation or dismissal by the company and the statement is sent to the auditor&#039;s own supervisory body&#151;for example, one of the institutes of chartered accountants&#151;rather than to the POB.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>The second new clause sets out the company&#039;s duties when its auditor resigns or when it dismisses its auditor. The company has to inform the appropriate audit authority and send it a statement. This can either be a copy of the auditor&#039;s statement or a separate statement by the company explaining the reasons for the auditor&#039;s departure.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>The reason the company and auditor are both required to send their statements is that when an auditor resigns or is dismissed, it is quite possible that the auditor and the company will have different accounts of the circumstances. This is a requirement of the newly adopted audit directive.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Amendments Nos. 354 and 355 would remove reference to the supervisory bodies so in practice all the statements would go to the POB. Burdening the POB&#151;a relatively small organisation&#151;with details of the circumstance of every auditor who resigns or is dismissed would not be of value.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The relevant part of the audit directive refers to authorities responsible for public oversight and I am advised that the supervisory bodies can be included as they are part of the public oversight system for auditors. The supervisory bodies may have a closer interest in any case as some of the circumstances around dismissal may suggest a problem with an auditor, particularly if there is a pattern. Our intention is that the company should have the choice of whether to send any statement made by an auditor or to send its own. That is what the two paragraphs of subsection (2) of the new clause to be inserted by Amendment No. 362&#151;linked by the word &quot;or&quot;&#151;are meant to achieve.
</p>

<a name="60516-07_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>If the Secretary of State has delegated the functions of supervisory statutory auditors to a body, it is that body to which the auditor or the company should send their statement. That will be clear from the wording of Amendment No. 370, but we will reflect to see if anything further needs to be said. That is the clear intention and I am happy to put it on the record.

(4)   The auditor must comply with this section&#151;

discussed. Unless there are questions about them, I shall move on to discussing the other amendments in the group.
</p>

<a name="60516-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>On reviewing the debate on the similar amendments in Grand Committee, I think that there may have been some misunderstanding about the Government&#039;s intentions in Clause 514. The statements made by resigning or otherwise departing auditors and the corresponding companies are to be sent to the audit authorities because their role is to oversee auditors, and they should take an interest in the reasons for their dismissal or resignation.
</p>

<a name="60516-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>On occasions, it is possible that these statements will reveal that the auditors believe that there has been some significant accounting irregularity and, when it happens, we think it appropriate for the audit authority to bring it to the attention of the accounting authorities. The Financial Reporting Review Panel will want to know about such accounting irregularities, as will the Department of Trade and Industry. The FRRP may want to apply to the court for an order requiring revision of the accounts. On the other hand, the DTI can consider investigation, inspection or prosecution. There are two accounting authorities mentioned in the Bill because they have different roles and powers.
</p>

<a name="60516-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The FRRP will not want to receive statements about most situations where the auditor and company may have had a difference of view but where the published accounts have been agreed. Nor will the DTI, so the task we are giving the DTI is not to deal with a flood of paperwork of modest interest, as I think was suggested in Grand Committee, but to receive occasional reports of serious irregularities.
</p>

<a name="60516-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I am sorry that we did not explain what was envisaged more clearly in the Explanatory Notes or in Grand Committee. I hope that, with this explanation, the noble Baroness will accept that it is entirely reasonable that the audit authorities should have discretion about what statements to forward to the audit authorities, and that those few statements that are worth sending should go to both the FRRP and the DTI. I beg to move.

When we discussed this in Committee, I agreed that we would take these provisions away. We believe that, together, the amendments clarify and improve the provisions on auditors&#039; liability. They will both meet the concerns that were expressed in Committee and achieve the effects intended by the other 13 amendments to this chapter.
</p>

<a name="60516-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>For the record, the other government amendments that I need to speak to are Amendments Nos. 374 and 375, 379 to 381, 387, 391, 392 and 394. I will also speak to Amendments Nos. 376 to 378, 382 to 386, 388 to 390 and 393, and in due course Amendment No. 391A, which is grouped with them.
</p>

<a name="60516-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>The main changes intended by the government amendments are these. In the new clause to be inserted after Clause 522 by Amendment No. 380, subsection (4) would make it clear that liability limitation agreements can be expressed in any way and are not&#151;as some feared might be the case, based on earlier wording&#151;restricted to being expressed as pure monetary amounts or such amounts expressed with reference to a formula.
</p>

<a name="60516-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Amendment No. 391 clarifies that, when the court is considering what is &quot;fair and reasonable&quot;, it should not take into account,

</p>

<a name="60516-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I hope your Lordships will agree that those two changes improve the drafting of how these clauses achieve the intended policy objective. Noble Lords had raised a number of concerns about possible misinterpretation of the text, so we thought it best to try and put that beyond doubt.
</p>

<a name="60516-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>In addition, subsections (2) and (3) of the new clause inserted by Amendment No. 380 introduce a new power for the Secretary of State to make regulations about how liability limitation agreements are expressed. I should explain why we propose to bring that in. It has been suggested to us, mainly by the mid-tier accountancy firms, if I may so describe them, that there is a risk of liability limitations developing in a way that would damage competition in the audit <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_159"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 159</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

market&#151;particularly if limitations are expressed as fixed monetary amounts. While we would not expect liability limitations to have that effect on the market, we have thought it prudent to take this power so as to be able to respond if there should be problems. In that way, it would enable us to bring forward regulations that either prescribe what sort of provisions must be included in agreements, or specify provisions which must not be so included.
</p>

<a name="60516-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>There are a number of more minor improvements in the drafting of these provisions that I will be happy to explain in detail if necessary. Meanwhile, I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="60516-09_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, I have many amendments in this group which I tabled again because we were advised by those affected by the provisions that the Government&#039;s original drafting would not achieve the result that people wanted, which they thought had been agreed&#151;proportionate liability agreements. I am very pleased that the Government have tabled their amendments in this group. As I understand it, there is now substantial agreement across the piece that the clauses that we shall have after the amendments are passed satisfactorily achieve limitation of liability provisions.
</p>

<a name="60516-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>On behalf of all those who have been involved in discussions with the Government, I place on record their thanks for the positive and constructive way in which the Government have dealt with the issue. It marks a real move forward. I am also grateful for what the noble and learned Lord said about taking power to deal with issues that may arise from the competitive impact if fixed-sum capping ever produced a competitive disadvantage to certain types of firm. I am sure that that is the right way forward.
</p>

<a name="60516-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>I do not need to speak to the majority of my amendments in this group, but I shall speak to Amendment No. 391A, which amends government Amendment No. 391. It is a probing amendment. Amendment No. 391 responds to concern about when fairness and reasonableness of the agreement is to be determined. The government amendment states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;no account is to be taken of . . . matters arising after the loss or damage . . . has been incurred&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>The issue is what that actually means. Loss or damage is normally suffered rather than incurred but, if we leave that on one side, we are unclear whether that is intended to mean the point at which the course of action arises&#151;hence, when the damage first occurs&#151;or the last date at which damage occurs. Damage flowing from the course of action will often take place over a long period. Indeed, it may be continuing at the time that the court considers the issue.
</p>

<a name="60516-09_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>I ask the Minister to set out clearly what the Government intend to be the effect of Amendment No. 391. If they agree that there is undesirable ambiguity in their amendment, I invite them either to agree to Amendment No. 391A&#151;which, I accept, is unlikely&#151;or to table something else at Third Reading.

thanks for how the Government have responded to the concerns expressed in Committee. We now have a workable series of clauses that respond to our original concerns. Although my name is not attached to Amendment No. 391A, the issue that remains&#151;albeit one for which there should be an explanation&#151;is from what point in time the damage accrues. In these sorts of cases, we will be dealing with loss or profit, which may continue over a long period&#151;for example, if an audit mistake is made at point X but the claim is that the profits or losses occurred sometime after that.

When it gets to the general meeting, the motion is not passed, so he says, &quot;I will give up&quot;.

If he has not completed the task, any claim against him for negligence will be quite difficult to bring in any event, because the auditor will be able to say, &quot;Well, you&#039;re complaining that I didn&#039;t do this or do that, but I never got to the end of the audit, so it isn&#039;t really fair to criticise me at all&quot;. The court would have to sort that out in those circumstances.

<a name="60516-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>The counsel for the auditor is to say in those circumstances that, if the auditor is not prepared to do the work without that limitation agreement, he should not do it until it has been approved by the company. It does not have to wait for an annual general meeting; there are other ways of doing it. If the company&#039;s directors are so concerned to get the auditor on board, they will have to take steps to ensure that the auditor has the protection which the noble Viscount described in his example as the only basis on which he is prepared to work.
</p>

<a name="60516-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>I turn to the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Sharman. I appreciate their welcome for the Government&#039;s amendments. I am pleased that we have reached that position. I turn to Amendment No. 391A. We make a deliberate choice of timing. We pick the moment when the loss or damage has been incurred rather than the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_161"></a>

cause of action. Sometimes, those will occur at the same moment; sometimes, they will not. They might occur at the same moment if the cause of action is put not in contract but in tort. In tort, until the damage is suffered, the cause of action is not complete. In that event, the cause of action and the incurring or suffering of the loss would be coterminous. In contract, it may not be.
</p>

<a name="60516-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>In proposing the amendment, the Government were seeking to recognise the fundamental concern raised in Grand Committee. It was, as I recall it, that if you allow all circumstances to be taken into account, the risk is that by the time you get to court, it will be apparent that the only person who has got any money to meet the judgment is the auditor; all the rest will have gone off wherever they have gone or be out of any money. The risk is that the court would say that it is reasonable, having regard to the fact that the only pocket left is that of the auditor, that the auditor should pay for everything and the liability agreement should be set aside. That is the concern with which we were seeking principally to deal by stating that one can have regard to matters up to the time that the loss is suffered. However, it is right to be able to take account of circumstances arising in between breach of contract and the loss being incurred.
</p>

<a name="60516-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>I give one example. The auditor might break his contract one year, but nothing is discovered until the following year. As noble Lords will know, it is not unusual for a problem to become apparent in the course of the following audit. It may be reasonable to take into account, when deciding whether the agreement should stand, that it was the auditor himself who discovered the error the following year, who brought it to the attention of the company and who perhaps took steps to deal with the consequences. If, on the other hand, the auditor spotted the problem but did not deal with it and allowed the problem to get worse, it might be reasonable for the court to take that into account in deciding whether the limitation agreement was right.
</p>

<a name="60516-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>No solution is absolutely perfect in this respect&#151;I acknowledge one or two of the examples that were given by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Sharman&#151;but putting the time bar where we propose meets the thrust of the concerns that were previously expressed about the clause. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will be content with the amendment as it stands. I do not think that there are any other points which I need to address. I commend the amendment to the House.

&quot;LIABILITY LIMITATION AGREEMENTS

<br>
(1)   A &quot;liability limitation agreement&quot; is an agreement that purports to limit the amount of a liability owed to a company by its auditor in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust, occurring in the course of the audit of accounts, of which the auditor may be guilty in relation to the company.


<br>
(2)   Section 520 (general voidness of provisions protecting auditors from liability) does not affect the validity of a liability limitation agreement that&#151;


<br>
(a)   complies with section (Terms of liability limitation agreement) (terms of liability limitation agreement) and of any regulations under that section, and


<br>
(b)   is authorised by the members of the company (see section (Authorisation of agreement by members of the company)).


<br>
(3)   Such an agreement&#151;


<br>
(a)   is effective to the extent provided by section 524, and


<br>
(b)   is not subject&#151;


<br>
(i)   in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, to section 2(2) or 3(2)(a) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (c. 50);

<br>
(3)   Without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by subsection (2), that power may be exercised with a view to preventing adverse effects on competition.

<a name="60516-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Under Clause 532, the court must make an order for the company to reregister as a public company unless it appears to the court that the company does not meet the requirements for reregistration and it is impracticable or undesirable to require it to take steps to do so. If the court does not make an order for reregistration, it must instead make an order for the compulsory winding-up of the company. The amendments provide the court with further alternatives if an order for reregistration is not made.
</p>

<a name="60516-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>The starting position remains that if it appears to the court that the company has acted in contravention of the prohibition on public offers, the court must order the reregistration of the company as a public company unless the company does not meet the requirements for reregistration and it is impractical or undesirable to require it to take steps to do so. Members cannot frustrate the company from seeking to comply with a reregistration order. 
</p>

<a name="60516-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>The court will have all its usual powers available for the enforcement of its orders. Where the court does not order reregistration, the amendments give the court a choice. It might decide to make an order for the compulsory winding-up of the company, or the court may make a remedial order for the purpose of putting anyone affected by the breach of the public offer prohibition back in the position they would have been in if the breach had not occurred. In particular, under <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_165"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 165</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a remedial order, the court can order those persons knowingly concerned in the breach to offer to purchase the shares or debentures that were the subject of the offer on such terms as the court thinks fit, or the court has discretion to make no order at all. This might be appropriate, for example, where the company has breached the prohibition but has not allotted shares, has withdrawn the offer and has undertaken not to do it again. These amendments greatly widen the options available to the court following a breach of the public offer prohibition where reregistration is not appropriate. All the other government amendments in this group are consequential on the new options given to the court.
</p>

<a name="60516-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>Amendment No. 408 would allow the court to make such order as it thought fit. It would give the court a wide discretion but without any assistance as to how it might use it. The amendment goes unnecessarily far, moving away from the consistency of approach we have been aiming to achieve. The government amendments provide a framework for the court&#151;one wide enough for the orders that may be made when reregistration is not appropriate, including the option of making no order at all. The government amendments address the concerns raised in Grand Committee and I hope noble Lords will not press Amendment No. 408. I beg to move.

The amendments, all in Clause 530, deal with the intention behind the issue of shares. The purpose is to ensure that a test should be one of intent, rather than an objective test of whether the securities are likely to get into the hands of the public at some stage in the future.

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 166</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>&#151;the meaning of &quot;calculated to&quot; was &quot;designed or suitable, intended&quot;. He went on to say that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;if it came to court, an objective assessment would be required of whether the motivation or purpose behind the offer was to make the shares . . . available&quot;.</p>

<a name="60516-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>He added:

</p>

<a name="60516-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>However, I am advised that there is judicial authority to the effect that &quot;calculated to&quot; means &quot;likely to&quot; and not &quot;intended to&quot;. That is apparent from the judgment of Dyson J in Norweb plc v Dixon. There is clearly therefore a conflict between the view of the courts and the view of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> as interpreted by the noble Lord. To clarify the position, we feel that the Bill should be amended to use &quot;intended&quot; rather than &quot;calculated&quot;, since this is the meaning that the Government intend.
</p>

<a name="60516-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Amendments Nos. 399, 400 and 402 are to address the effect of shares or debentures becoming available to third parties outside the arrangements relating to the offer. Again, in Grand Committee the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, accepted that a company should not be held responsible for what the recipients of shares or debentures do with them after they have received them, as long as part of the arrangements or understanding reached at the time the offer was made was not that the shares or debentures would be passed on. These amendments are proposed in order to give effect to that view.
</p>

<a name="60516-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>We are concerned that the clause, as now drafted, goes further than the existing law&#151;under Section 724A of the Companies Act 1985&#151;and adds further restrictions on the ability of a private company to make a rights issue or to offer shares under an employee share scheme. I have said enough on that, but if no law is intended, we are too restrictive in what we have. I beg to move.

<a name="60516-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, although my name is not on these amendments, I think that the points the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, is driving at are sensible. I, too, have read carefully the definitions that the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, read out to us from the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> in Grand Committee, but I do not think they answer the reality of what is going on in the City. Indeed, clarity in this area is very important because it is a critical part of the finance-raising function of the City of London. I hope the Government will look sympathetically at what the noble Lord has said.

<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="60516-12_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the nub of the debate is whether we believe there should be an objective or subjective test, whatever wording we use to express that. The Government are clear that we should maintain, as at present, the objective test.

<a name="60516-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>When we discussed these amendments in Grand Committee, I explained why we do not wish to replace the word &quot;calculated&quot; with &quot;intended&quot;. I maintain that &quot;calculated&quot; is the correct word for the purposes of Clause 530. The phrase,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;properly be regarded, in all the circumstances, as . . . not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in securities of the company becoming available to persons other than those receiving the offer&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>imposes an objective test. If it came to court, an objective assessment would be required of whether the motivation or purpose behind the offer was to make the shares or debentures available to persons other than those receiving the offer.
</p>

<a name="60516-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I am aware that the Law Society has raised the case of Norweb plc v Dixon, in which the court said that &quot;calculated&quot; means &quot;likely&quot; and does not mean &quot;intended&quot;. The test imposed by the word &quot;calculated&quot; is not one of actual intention, which is what was being alleged in Norweb plc v Dixon, but nor is it purely a test of mechanical likelihood. It cannot possibly be solely a question of likelihood as, in almost all cases, it is likely that the shares will one day be transferred.
</p>

<a name="60516-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>The test is whether a person looking objectively at the facts would conclude that it was intended. Amending &quot;calculated&quot; to &quot;intended&quot;, as the amendments propose, would make a big change to the operation of the clause. It would replace the objective test with a wholly subjective test of intention. Rather than reaching a judgment as to what a reasonable person would conclude was the intention, the courts would require proof of actual intention. It would be very easy for those behind the offer to stand up and claim that nothing of the sort was intended, and very difficult for anyone to contradict them. Actual intentions would often be extremely difficult for those not directly involved to prove, rendering many breaches virtually unenforceable.
</p>

<a name="60516-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>Likelihood is, of course, relevant to any objective assessment of intent, but it is by no means the sole factor or only way of establishing apparent intent. The likelihood of the shares becoming available to the public is simply one of things that might be relevant, such as what was said and done at the time. It all goes to the evidence enabling the court to make its judgment. The courts will take into account the circumstances of the offer in their entirety, not only the likelihood of the shares becoming available to other persons.
</p>

<a name="60516-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>&quot;Calculated&quot; is not the same as &quot;likely&quot; or &quot;intended&quot;. If we wanted to mean precisely either of those things and nothing else, we agree that it would be better to say so. But we do not. The word has been quite deliberately chosen and has been used in this context for a long time. The law currently requires an objective assessment of intent. The Bill takes the same approach. I hope that the noble Lord will not press the amendment because it would change significantly the current position.

</p>

<a name="60516-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>Turning now to Amendment No. 399, in seeking to clarify subsection (3) the amendment risks widening it. Subsection (3) is an exemption setting out circumstances in which an offer will not be regarded as an offer to the public. In order to fall within the exemption, the offer must not be calculated to result in the shares or debentures becoming available to persons other than those receiving the offer. Of course, shares may be offered in the knowledge that they may one day be sold on. Companies do not have to impose restrictions on the transferability of their shares in order to take advantage of the exemption. But the exemption is not to be used as a means of evading the public offer prohibition by offering shares to a particular person, simply so that they can then offer them on to other people. It is a matter of the link or connection between the offer and the subsequent transfer of the shares to other persons. If there is no real link between the two, other than the fact of issuing the shares, the exemption may apply. Where there is a close connection between both events, however, of which formal agreements or mutual arrangements are probably the strongest example, the exemption should not apply.
</p>

<a name="60516-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a> The amendment focuses too narrowly on arrangements for understandings reached as part of the offer. The perspective of the company offering the shares can also be relevant, whether or not it amounts to an arrangement or understanding shared by the recipient of the securities. The amendment restricts the circumstances the court can look at to the offer itself and arrangements or agreements made in connection with it. It may be difficult to show the existence and contents of such arrangements or understandings. It is surely preferable that the court should be able to have regard to all the circumstances, as the opening words of the exemption provide.
</p>

<a name="60516-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a> I turn now to the other amendments to delete subsections (4)(c) and (5)(c) in Clause 530. Subsection (4) provides that an offer is not to be regarded as an offer to the public if certain requirements are met. It is an exemption for offers made to persons already connected with the company. One of the requirements is that the offer must not be calculated to result in the shares or debentures becoming available to persons already connected with the company.
</p>

<a name="60516-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The exemption set out in subsection (4) is expressed rather differently in Section 742A of the Companies Act 1985, from which this exemption is derived. Our intention was to set out more clearly how the exemption operated, but in doing so we agree that subsection (4)(c) has departed from the current law. Therefore we agree that the approach of the present law should be reinstated. That is not simply a matter of deleting subsection (4)(c); it will be necessary to put back in its place the elements of the current law that the subsection was intended to replace, and it might not be straightforward to draft. The same applies to subsection (5)(c). We therefore agree to consider Amendments Nos. 400 and 402.
</p>

<a name="60516-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I hope the noble Lord will withdraw Amendments Nos. 398 and will not press Amendments Nos. 399 to 403. I cannot stress strongly enough that what is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_169"></a>

<br>
(a)   it is made to fewer than 100 persons,


<br>
(b)   it is made on terms allowing the person to whom it is made to renounce his rights, which may only be renounced in favour of a person connected with the company or another person to whom the offer is made, and

(c)   it cannot properly be regarded, in all circumstances, as being intended to result, directly or indirectly, in securities of the company becoming available to persons other than those receiving the offer or persons not already connected with the company.


<br>
(9)   The Secretary of State may by regulations specify other conditions applicable to an offer which, to the extent satisfied, would result in an offer not being deemed to be an offer to the public for the purposes of this section 526.


<br>
(10)   Any such regulations, as set out in subsection (9), shall be subject to affirmative resolution procedure.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_144"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is another amendment to Clause 530, which defines what is meant by an offer to the public with regard to the prohibition of public offers by a private company. The starting point for this amendment is the point I made <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_170"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 170</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in Grand Committee; that the current interplay of the various regulations creates uncertainty concerning the number of individuals to whom an offer can be made by a private company. I could count in large numbers of filing cabinets the letters I have seen from firms of lawyers which, when asked whether a particular offer can be made by a private company, go on to describe regulations for three pages, but ends up with the position still uncertain.
</p>

<a name="60516-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the position that an offer is not regarded as an offer to the public if it is made to fewer than 100 people by a private company, or under the other conditions set out in that amendment. When this amendment was discussed in Grand Committee, the Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;I stress again to the noble Lord that there is no number which is allowed&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i> 15/3/06; col. GC 478.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>In another reply, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;We do not consider that private companies should be offering their shares to strangers&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i> 15/3/06; col. GC 472.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>I will let the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, into a secret: it is entirely common practice in the City for private companies seeking seedcorn or development capital to do so from outside investors or private equity funds, without being obliged to register as public companies. Indeed, his answer would mean that an offer of shares to even two people unconnected to the company could be treated as an offer to the public&#151;a view that goes beyond any understanding of either the existing law or what the law should be.
</p>

<a name="60516-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>The second argument of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, was that in cases of doubt a company could easily re-register as a public company. I can do no better than refer the noble Lord to the final report of the Company Law Review, which said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;We believe that private companies should not feel obliged to take the unnecessary precaution of registering as a public company, with the tighter regulation that this entails, simply because the existing provisions lack clarity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>There are significant disadvantages for companies with a small number of shareholders in having to re-register as public companies. It certainly goes beyond current practice in the City and elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="60516-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The final point I would like to make is that the Company Law Review went on to recommend the retention of the basic prohibition against private companies offering shares to the public, but with a power to prescribe detailed exceptions to the prohibition by statutory instrument. It referred to the definitions in the old Public Office of Securities Regulations. The second purpose of this amendment is to provide for an enabling power along those lines, which could then allow further consultation and consideration before regulations are brought in. I hope that, with the assistance of the Law Society and others, I have dealt with the reasons why the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, rejected this amendment in Grand Committee and I hope he will reconsider. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="60516-13_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, this amendment seeks to add a further exemption to the public offer prohibition. It is also provides for a power <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_171"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 171</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to prescribe further exemptions. Clause 530 defines the meaning of an offer to the public and provides for a number of exemptions to the general prohibition on private companies&#039; offers to the public. The principle behind these exemptions is that an offer is not considered to be a public offer where there is a sufficient connection or relationship between the company and the persons to whom the securities are being offered.
</p>

<a name="60516-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>Subsection (3) ensures that offers made to particular identified individuals are not treated as offers to the public, provided the shares are not offered to that person in order to be passed on to others. Nor will it be an offer to the public if the offer is otherwise a private concern of the person receiving it and the person making it. This exemption will be particularly relevant for private companies seeking seedcorn or development capital from outside investors. I should make it clear that we do not see these provisions as preventing that in any way. We are very much aware that it is an important means of raising finance.
</p>

<a name="60516-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>Subsection (4) provides an exemption for offers made to persons already connected with the company. This recognises the ways in which private companies may grow organically. Subsection (5) provides a similar exemption for offers for securities to be held under an employees&#039; share scheme.
</p>

<a name="60516-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>I emphasise that it is the connection or relationship to the company that is the crucial issue. Within the requirements, the current definition has the flexibility to take into account the circumstances of the offer and the identity of the persons making and receiving it. So, for example, private companies may seek capital from an outside investor such as a business angel without necessarily breaching the prohibition. An offer may be permissible even if it is made to a very large number of people, perhaps hundreds of people, but we have no intention of preventing the many lawful ways in which private companies currently raise finance and attract investors.
</p>

<a name="60516-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>The amendment would allow the offer to be made to up to 99 persons. These might be individuals, companies or financial institutions. They might hold the securities for themselves or they might take up the offer on behalf of others. They might, for example, hold them as trustees for a group of people. So an offer to 99 persons might in fact involve a much larger group of people. We would have no objection to this if the matter could still properly be regarded as a private concern of those involved. But the amendment imposes no such requirement; it would undermine the whole principle that a private company should not offer its shares to strangers or to the unconnected general public. The prohibition, which is a key distinction between public and private companies, would be so easy to get round that it would become irrelevant.
</p>

<a name="60516-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>If companies wish to seek new investors from the general public, they should become a public company in order to do so. That would bring them within the regulation appropriate for a company with a generally wider shareholder base. The deregulation for private companies contained in the Bill makes it even more <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_172"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 172</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

important that private companies do not make offers to the public.  Deregulation for private companies is possible because the arrangements between the company and its members can be regarded as an essentially private matter. However, members of the public joining a company are more likely to need the increased protections that the additional regulation of public companies brings&#151;for example, the right to an annual general meeting.
</p>

<a name="60516-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>In attempting to describe every circumstance in which an offer is or is not to be regarded as an offer to the public, we would risk either dramatically widening the exemption or inadvertently excluding something which currently would not be regarded as an offer to the public.  We would risk imposing an unduly rigid or restrictive distinction, thereby making the exemptions more limited and the legislation more restrictive. Alternatively, as with this amendment, we would risk making the exemptions so wide that they would no longer act as an effective distinction between private and public companies. We feel it is important not to introduce substantive changes to such long-standing provisions that might create fresh uncertainties. It is not our intention to make the provisions in the clause more restrictive or significantly more relaxed than the equivalent provisions in the Companies Act 1985.
</p>

<a name="60516-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>We are seeking to preserve the current law on what is an offer to the public and not to prevent anything that is lawful now. There is flexibility in the current law which allows all the circumstances of an offer to the public to be taken into account, as well as the identities of the persons making and receiving it. In our view, the current law strikes the right balance. Given that we are not intending to make regulations on this issue, it would send out the wrong signals to include a power for the Secretary of State to make new exemptions.

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendments Nos. 413 to 417 to Clause 540 are designed to deal with a point that was made during Grand Committee. This clause deals with the power of the directors to allot shares in public companies and private companies that will have more than one class of share after the proposed allotment. The concern is that, as currently drafted, an authority given under Clause 540, and any resolution renewing such an authority, must specify,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;the maximum number of shares&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>that may be allotted pursuant to the authority.
</p>

<a name="60516-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, pointed out in Grand Committee that that formulation of words does not take account of the fact that shares may be in different classes or of different denominations. The revised drafting is intended to address the noble Lord&#039;s concerns.
</p>

<a name="60516-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>As noble Lords will see from these amendments, we have returned to the formulation of words used in Section 80 of the 1985 Act&#151;that is, the &quot;maximum amount&quot; of shares&#151;on which Clause 540 is based. This formulation would cover an authority limited to a specific number of shares, but would also cover an authority given to directors to grant shares up to a given maximum nominal amount. The current provision provides this flexibility and we would similarly not wish the Bill to be prescriptive about the form of the limit on the authority to allot shares&#151;hence our reverting to the terminology used in current Section 80 with which companies and their advisers are no doubt familiar and comfortable.
</p>

<a name="60516-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>Amendments Nos. 418 and 419 to Clause 541 are consequential on the amendments to Clause 540.

<p>


</p>


<p class="tabletext">
<br>
<a name="amdtpar_0"></a>&quot;OFFERS TO SHAREHOLDERS TO BE ON PRE-EMPTIVE BASIS

<br>
(1)   Subject to the provisions of this section and the seven sections next following, a company proposing to allot equity securities (as defined in section (Interpretation of sections) (Offers to shareholders to be on pre-emptive basis) to (Saving for company&#039;s pre-emption procedure operative before 1982))&#151;


<br>
(a)   shall not allot any of them on any terms to a person unless it has made an offer to each person who holds relevant shares or relevant employee shares to allot to him on the same or more favourable terms a proportion of those securities which is as nearly as practicable equal to the proportion in nominal value held by him of the aggregate of relevant shares and relevant employee shares, and


<br>
(b)   shall not allot any of those securities to a person unless the period during which any such offer may be accepted has expired or the company has received notice of the acceptance or refusal of every offer so made.


<br>
(2)   Subsection (3) below applies to any provision of a company&#039;s memorandum or articles which requires the company, when proposing to allot equity securities consisting of relevant shares of any particular class, not to allot those securities on any terms unless it has complied with the condition that it makes such an offer as is described in subsection (1) to each person who holds relevant shares or relevant employee shares of that class.


<br>
(3)   If in accordance with a provision to which this subsection applies&#151;


<br>
(a)   a company makes an offer to allot securities to such a holder, and


<br>
(b)   he or anyone in whose favour he has renounced his right to their allotment accepts the offer,


<br>
subsection (1) does not apply to the allotment of those securities, and the company may allot them accordingly; but this is without prejudice to the application of subsection (1) in any other case.


<br>
(4)   Subsection (1) does not apply to a particular allotment of equity securities if these are, or are to be, wholly or partly paid up otherwise than in cash; and securities which a company has offered to allot to a holder of relevant shares or relevant employee shares may be allotted to him, or anyone in whose favour he has renounced his right to their allotment, without contravening subsection (1)(b).


<br>
(5)   Subsection (1) does not apply to the allotment of securities which would, apart from a renunciation or assignment of the right to their allotment, be held under an employee&#039;s share scheme.


<br>
(6)   Where a company holds relevant shares as treasury shares&#151;


<br>
(a)   for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), the company is not a &quot;person who holds relevant shares&quot;; and
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_176"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 176</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(b)   for the purposes of subsection (1), the shares held as treasury shares do not form part of &quot;the aggregate of relevant shares and relevant employee shares&quot;.&quot;

<p><a name="st_157"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving the amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 419B to 419G inclusive. These insert new clauses before Clause 552 in Part 18 of the Bill, which is concerned with the allotment of shares. At the same time, I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 439A to 439E, which are concerned with Part 19 share capital, particularly Clauses 590, 591, 592 and 593, all of which are concerned with the transfer of securities.
</p>

<a name="60516-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The amendments comprise two shots at one issue&#151;we come back to the issue of consolidation, which we have discussed and battled over from the moment that the Bill was launched. We remain of the view, as stated at Second Reading, that the Bill should be as far as possible a comprehensive consolidation of company law, and that it defies belief that despite all the hard work that has gone into it from the Bill team, officials in the Minister&#039;s department, we would still be left with three other Companies Acts when this one leaves your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="60516-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>The first set of amendments to Part 18 aim to clarify the law regarding pre-emption and allotment. Our practitioner advisers have told us that this is an area that is frequently consulted and to have it spread out over the Bill and the other Companies Acts is an unhelpful and undesirable position. The second set, which concerns Part 20, is intended to ensure that the provisions relating to the transfer of securities are in one place; in particular, Section 207 of the Companies Act 1989, which inexplicably has been split between that Act and this Bill as currently drafted.
</p>

<a name="60516-14_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>We tabled these amendments in Committee and we were disappointed by the Minister&#039;s reply. I dare say that he is not going to accept the amendments tonight, but I hope that he will be able to give us some better news about the prospects and about the Government&#039;s plans to achieve further consolidation, either next week or through the passage in another place. Since it is the opening of the cricket season, I regard the amendment as a slow full toss bowled on the leg stump, which I hope he will dispatch immediately to the boundary. In that spirit I beg to move.

<a name="60516-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, as someone who hated cricket with a passion I will resist responding in similar terms. I hope that I can meet the noble Lord&#039;s points. These amendments would all largely have the effect of bringing up elements of the existing law unchanged into the new Bill. They would thus take a further step towards putting the new legislation on to a consolidated basis. We discussed this general issue in Grand Committee, and I said there that I recognised that there were strong arguments in favour of restating elements of the remaining 1985 Act provisions in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60516-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I can confirm that we are now looking at all of the remaining elements of the 1985 Act to see whether they could sensibly be brought into the Bill. There will be certain areas which do not lend themselves to this treatment; for example, areas of the law that have an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_177"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 177</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

application wider than companies, and which it would not make sense to bring up into a new Bill, which would in effect be a consolidated code of companies legislation. In certain other areas where there is a specific power to set out the law in regulations, and where we expect to make such regulations in the medium term, it may not make sense to consolidate the existing primary legislation into the new Bill now.
</p>

<a name="60516-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>These sorts of exceptions apart, I can assure the House that we are looking at what remains of the 1985 Act very much with an eye to bringing it into the new Bill wherever possible. I think the introduction of amendments giving effect to this approach, if it is to be managed in a coherent and co-ordinated way, may need to wait until the Bill is in another place. But I would certainly hope to be able to say more at Third Reading about the areas we are currently identifying as candidates for further consolidation, and I would certainly expect that the areas which are the subject of these amendments&#151;pre-emption rights and share transfers&#151;would be prime candidates for future consolidating amendments.
</p>

<a name="60516-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>In particular, I said in Grand Committee that we support the principle that provisions relating to the transfer of securities should be brought together in one place, and I confirm that the Government will bring forward their own consolidating amendments to Part 20. Unfortunately, there have been other significant issues to be dealt with by way of government amendment on Report and we have not had time to deal with the proposed amendments to Part 20 at this stage. We would also like to consult key City stakeholders on the draft amendments in view of the technical complexity of this part of the Bill.

</p>

<a name="60516-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>I would like to make one final point regarding consolidation. This is already a very substantial Bill and I suspect that there would be a general reluctance to see amendments introduced at any stage that greatly added to the requirement for parliamentary scrutiny during its passage. While I certainly do not seek in any way to constrain the debates that will be held here and in another place, I hope we all recognise that amendments that effectively did no more than restate existing provisions in the law without substantial change would not require the same level of scrutiny as those elements of the Bill that do make changes.
</p>

<a name="60516-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I hope that what I have said has demonstrated how actively the Government are pursuing the principle that lies behind these amendments, and I hope on that basis that noble Lords and noble Baronesses will agree not to press their respective amendments for the moment. I will of course be happy to say more when we return at Third Reading.

<a name="60516-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, that was a handsome offer.

of the Bill which do not directly concern companies may be left over. Steps to bring all the company-relevant legislation into one place would be helpful. Provided that the Minister is prepared to say on the Floor of the House that further consolidation does not entail substantial change in the law, we would be happy to facilitate the passage of such legislation&#151;always provided that we do not hear from an outside body such as the Law Society that there is an issue here which has been waiting to be sorted out for 20 years. It might be worthwhile to address such an issue in this Bill, but, as far as wading through the detail of the legislation, and provided that the Minister can say that there is no plan to change the law, I am sure that we can facilitate the passage of the legislation through this House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="60516-15_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, from these Benches I echo the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. The Minister has been kind enough to explain the Government&#039;s plans on consolidation to us and indeed to the Tory Opposition. We certainly do not intend to hold up the Bill&#039;s passage by arguing the finer points of consolidation, unless those who advise us say there is some noticeable howler in it&#151;which I am sure the Minister would take on board.

<p><a name="st_167"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in Grand Committee the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, tabled an amendment to Clause 566 which if accepted would have completely removed the proviso presently in subsection (1B) of this clause that a company can reduce its share capital in any way under Clause 566 providing that,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a>&quot;as a result of the reduction at least one member of the company would hold shares other than redeemable shares or shares held as treasury shares&quot;.</p>

<a name="60516-15_para9"></a>

<a name="60516-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>In Committee the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, explained that there may be circumstances where a company would want to reduce its share capital to zero; for example where the company is the target of a takeover bid and wants to cancel all of its own shares and issue new shares in the acquiring company. The noble Lord also explained that it is relatively common practice for a reduction of capital which is approved by the court to involve a reduction of the shares&#039; capital to zero. We understand, however, that this is only on terms that the court can see that very shortly after the reduction taking effect, either a reserve will be capitalised in favour of someone who becomes the member or one or more shares are subscribed conditional upon the reduction taking effect. Thus the concern which prompted us to incorporate the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_180"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 180</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provision&#151;namely, a company being left without any issued shares&#151;is not one that arises in the context of reductions confirmed by the court.
</p>

<a name="60516-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Having discussed this matter with the Law Society, we agree that subsection (1B) of Clause 566 does not achieve the desired effect. In particular, we do not intend either to fetter the powers of court or to reduce the flexibility that is currently afforded to companies limited by shares which apply to court to reduce their share capital under Section 135 of the 1985 Act, which is amended by Clause 566. I am grateful to both the noble Lord and the Law Society for raising this point.

<a name="60516-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>Amendment No. 423 is designed to address the noble Lord&#039;s concerns. It limits the qualification that is presently in subsection (1B) of Clause 566 to private companies who wish to use the new solvency statement procedure to effect a reduction of capital. Amendment No. 424 provides a different drafting solution to the perceived problem, but, with the exception of what I am about to say about the reference to treasury shares in subsection (1B), the drafting solution which we have proposed in Amendment No. 423 achieves the same effect as this amendment. I therefore trust that noble Lords will agree to the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60516-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>The deletion of the reference to treasury shares in subsection (1B) has been proposed because a private company may not hold its own shares in treasury, and since the redrafted proviso now applies only to private companies seeking to reduce their share capital under the new solvency procedure statement&#151;whereas previously the proviso applied to both public and private companies&#151;it is no longer necessary to refer to treasury shares.

<a name="60516-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 427, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 428, which is grouped with it. We return to the issue of a definition, and we are advised in this matter by the Law Society.
</p>

<a name="60516-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>Amendments Nos. 427 and 428 would replace the words &quot;principal purpose&quot; with the words &quot;predominant reason&quot;, and their purpose is to overcome a problem in the interpretation of the expression &quot;principal purpose&quot;. This matter was considered by the House of Lords in Brady v Brady 1988, in which the expression &quot;principal purpose&quot; was construed so narrowly that lawyers are reluctant ever to rely on this exemption. The Law Society continues to press for the amendments put forward in Grand Committee to substitute &quot;predominant reason&quot; for &quot;principal purpose&quot; in lines 26 and 34 of Clause 571. In the judgment in Brady v Brady, Lord Oliver said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>&quot;it is important to distinguish between a purpose and the reason why a purpose is formed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>He then went on at length to explain the distinction. I shall not trouble your Lordships with it as I am sure that the noble Lords, Lord McKenzie and Lord Sainsbury, are familiar with the judgment.
</p>

<a name="60516-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>A consequence of this narrow construction is that transactions and arrangements which may well be commercially justifiable are precluded by the financial assistance provisions or, in the case of private companies, can be carried out only after going through the expense of what is commonly known as the &quot;whitewash&quot; procedure.
</p>

<a name="60516-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The Company Law Review accepted the desirability of reformulating the principal purpose exemption in terms of &quot;predominant reason&quot;. We considered that such a reformulation would be in accordance with Article 23 of the second directive, which prohibits a company from entering into certain transactions with a view to the acquisition of its shares, as it seems apparent that the formulation of Article 23 means that it is necessary to look to the result that the company has in view by giving the assistance rather than the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_182"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 182</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reason for entering into the transaction constituting the assistance. The directive prohibits only financial assistance given with a view to the acquisition, and, provided the company has some other tangible and overriding end in view in giving the assistance, the assistance should not be prohibited. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_172"></a>
<a name="60516-16_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, these amendments relate to the existing &quot;principal purpose&quot; exception to the general prohibition on the giving of financial assistance by a public company contained in Section 153 of the 1985 Act. The exception is retained by Clause 570 of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60516-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The exception provides that such assistance is not prohibited if the &quot;principal purpose&quot; of the assistance is not to give it for the acquisition of shares or where the assistance is incidental to some other larger purpose of the company. In those circumstances, the assistance is permitted and no offence is committed by the company or its officers.
</p>

<a name="60516-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>The concern that has prompted these amendments, and various others tabled in Grand Committee, is that the courts, and in particular this House in its judicial capacity, have interpreted the words &quot;principal purpose&quot; too narrowly. We have some sympathy with that view, but first I shall explain why we think that this amendment is not the answer. On that, I can only reiterate what I said in Grand Committee: namely, that the Government are not convinced that the suggested wording means anything other than what is intended by the current wording. We have discussed this issue at some length with the Law Society&#151;we are most grateful for its input&#151;but have not been persuaded that any transactions which companies might wish to enter into, and which would be compatible with the second directive, fall outside the current test but within the suggested reformulated exception.
</p>

<a name="60516-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>If we are to take this matter forward, a clear indication is required of the intended effect of the suggested words rather than the substitution of one pair of words by another pair, which, on the face of it, mean the same. In other words, we cannot have a rational debate about this subject unless we can agree about the difference between &quot;principal purpose&quot; and &quot;predominant reason&quot;. Until we can agree that, we cannot debate whether things that we all might want to do would be allowed by the change.
</p>

<a name="60516-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>As I commented in Grand Committee, this may point to a reworking of the provision so as to have the intended effect. Such a new provision could refer to concepts along the current lines or may be framed on an entirely different basis so long as it remained consistent with the implementation of Article 23 of the second company directive. In this connection I would remind noble Lords that the Government are proposing to take a power to make, by secondary legislation, provisions relating to capital maintenance and we believe that such a reworking would be more suitably addressed by use of that power than by piecemeal amendment to the existing sections.

<p>LIMITS OF PRIVATE COMPANY&#039;S POWER OF DISTRIBUTION
</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_17"></a><br>
 CERTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS PROHIBITED

<br>
 In this Part, &quot;distribution&quot; means every description of distribution of a company&#039;s assets to its members, whether in cash or otherwise, except distribution by way of&#151;


<br>
(a)   an issue of shares as fully or partly paid bonus shares,


<br>
(b)   the redemption or purchase of any of the company&#039;s own shares out of capital (including the proceeds of any fresh issue of shares) or out of unrealised profits in accordance with Chapter VII of Part V,


<br>
(c)   the reduction of share capital by extinguishing or reducing the liability of any of the members on any of the company&#039;s shares in respect of share capital not paid up, or by paying off paid up share capital, and


<br>
(d)   a distribution of assets to members of the company on its winding up.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_182"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 435, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 436 to 439. They all relate to the new Part 19A that I would like to add to the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60516-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>This new clause meets in considerable part the urgent need to reform the rules on dividends. The present rules in Part VIII of the Companies Act 1985 are now in disrepute because, first, the link <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_187"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 187</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

between distributions and accounts has created considerable practical problems leading to more than 100 pages of additional guidance from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Institute of Accountants of Scotland. They are also in dispute because, secondly, private companies that are subsidiaries of public companies are keen to move to using solely international financial reporting standards (IFRS). They are being forced to keep two sets of accounting records&#151;for example, the IFRS one and the existing UK accounting standards one&#151;because the link between dividends and accounts is not catered for under the IFRS. Dividend blocks would be created, leading to a shortage of dividends to the public parent company, leading inevitably to restrictions on the parent&#039;s ability to pay dividends to shareholders, which of course include many pension funds.
</p>

<a name="60516-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>On the distribution of assets, the amendment removes a piece of the 1980 UK gold-plating EC second company law directive. That directive applies only to public companies. The UK chose to apply its distributions&#039; provision to both public and private companies. Public groups have been forced to use IFRS from 2005. UK accounting is likely to converge with IFRS by 2009. The UK cannot wait for an EC solution to emerge. Ministers will see how urgent this will become.
</p>

<a name="60516-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>Amendment No. 436 results in a consistent regime applying to private company distributions&#151;as that proposed for private companies&#039; reduction of share capital set out in Part 19 of the Bill. The focus is on insolvency. Paragraph (b) ensures that directors consider their general fiduciary duties. This is the &quot;solvency&quot; test. Amendment No. 437 preserves the current penalty in the 1985 Act.
</p>

<a name="60516-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>The further clauses seek to exempt private companies from existing rules. Special companies&#151;for example, investment and insurance companies&#151;will stay within the existing regime as of this time. The other provisions are the equivalent of Section 281 of the Companies Act 1985, amended as appropriate to fit the proposed new regime. I think that my final amendments speak for themselves. I hope that Ministers will consider these and come back at Third Reading, if they do not agree this evening. I beg to move.

<a name="60516-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>If one looks carefully at what is happening in the public company arena, the impact of IFRS is that a great many companies and groups are being forced to engage in reconstructions that I regard as completely artificial. Their purpose is to get the reserves in the right place to be able to make the distribution, so a solvency-based test, which has worked well in other parts of the world, is an eminently good solution.

<a name="60516-18_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, as we discussed in Committee, these amendments concern the distribution of profits and the payment of dividends. I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Goudie for raising this important issue. We are very aware of concerns about the current rules that link the payment of dividends to realised profits. These have become more acute for public companies because of the application of new international accounting standards to the treatment of some elements of income and expenditure, and the consequent effects on a company&#039;s accounts.
</p>

<a name="60516-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>The proposed Part 19A would, of course, apply only to private companies, not to public ones. However, it would have relevance for public companies as it would affect their private company subsidiaries. As noble Lords may be aware, the EC&#039;s second company directive constrains what we can provide in respect of public companies. The Commission has undertaken to review distributions in the context of wider capital maintenance issues, and is beginning the process with a study of the issues. The likely outcome of that work is not yet clear.
</p>

<a name="60516-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>In the meantime, companies&#039; experience of the International Financial Reporting Standards is in its early stages, the first full year of IFRS accounts having just finished, and views on the issues that cause most difficulty in presenting accounts are still evolving. We have continued to keep in contact with representative bodies and companies that have made representations to us in the course of the Bill&#039;s passage. They are gathering and assessing data from the last year, which we will discuss further with them when more information is available. In that respect, the work that the accounting institutes, among others, have done in promoting awareness of the issues with the International Accounting Standards Board has been successful. Recent indications are that the board will, at least, look at ways of easing difficulties in determining the cost of a subsidiary on transition to IFRS.
</p>

<a name="60516-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>We believe that we should assess the need for any change in the light of all information available to us, including the new information that interested parties are collecting. We do not believe that the proposed new clause has the right way forward. The proposed solvency test would only require directors to consider debts falling due in the next year, thus allowing the company to pay a dividend even though its long-term liabilities might exceed its assets. For the longer term, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_189"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 189</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

there would be no clear rules&#151;none in the Bill, certainly&#151;to prevent the dissipation of assets for long-term obligations such as pensions.
</p>

<a name="60516-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>While the amendments&#039; approach is thus not the right one, we agree that it would indeed be desirable to have flexibility to tackle the issue. Therefore, in the light of our decision to drop the reform power, we will be bringing forward a power in relation to capital maintenance matters. While we agree that this area requires attention, that needs to be done in a slightly broader context than the one here. These amendments do not meet the issue without having some other undesirable side-effects. I hope that, in this light, the noble Baroness will not press her amendment.

The effect is to prevent companies being able to discover who had an interest in any of the past three years in those of their shares which they now hold as Treasury shares.

<a name="60516-19_time0"></a><h5>5.17 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="60516-19_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b> 
<a name="60516-19_state0"></a> My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_4"></a>&quot;With permission, Mr Speaker, and in the unavoidable absence of my right honourable friend, I should like to make a Statement on primary care trusts and NHS ambulance trusts. Detailed information for each area has, for the convenience of honourable Members, been placed on the Board since 1 pm.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_5"></a>&quot;In my right honourable friend the Secretary of State&#039;s Written Statement of 18 October 2005, she explained that strategic health authorities had been invited to submit proposals to the Department of Health on how to streamline SHAs and strengthen primary care trusts. Four clear criteria underpinned this exercise: the need to improve health and reduce inequalities; to strengthen the PCTs&#039; commissioning function; to improve co-ordination with social services through greater coterminosity between PCT and local authority boundaries; and to deliver at least a 15 per cent reduction in management and administrative costs.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_6"></a>&quot;In the intervening period, strategic health authorities have consulted local people, staff and clinicians, partners in local government and a range of other local bodies on the proposals for SHAs, PCTs and ambulance trusts. Many right honourable <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_191"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 191</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and honourable Members on both sides of the House have offered their views. I am very grateful to them.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_7"></a>&quot;After local consultations, SHAs submitted their reports and recommendations to the department. The external panel, established to advise Ministers on the proposals, has since met to consider each proposal for PCTs and SHAs in detail. After its advice, we announced on 12 April that the numbers of SHAs would reduce from 28 to 10.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_8"></a>&quot;Ministers have now considered the recommendations and the panel&#039;s advice on PCTs. I can inform the House that the number of PCTs will fall from 303 to 152, with the new organisations established on 1 October 2006. The population covered by each PCT will rise from an average of around 165,000 at present to an average of just below 330,000. Just over 70 per cent of the new PCTs will be coterminous with the boundaries of local authorities with social services responsibilities. This compares with about 44 per cent of PCTs that are currently coterminous.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_9"></a>&quot;In some areas concerns have been expressed that larger PCTs could lose a locality focus and divert resources away from deprived areas, or that smaller PCTs could lack commissioning power. We acknowledge the concerns and have sought to strike a careful balance between these conflicting demands.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_10"></a>&quot;In response, we are proposing that four general conditions be applied: one, that all PCTs must retain and build on current partnership arrangements; two, that a strong locality focus must be retained, and where necessary that locality structures should be put in place; three, that all PCTs must deliver their share of the 15 per cent management cost savings, strengthen commissioning and ensure robust management of financial balance and risk; and, four, that the new PCTs and SHAs should consider how any further conditions, on issues that arose during the consultation, could be applied.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_11"></a>&quot;In some areas the new proposals do differ from those suggested by the SHA and the external panel. In these circumstances, having taken into account all the evidence and, wherever possible, sought local consensus, we have judged that the alternatives could better satisfy the <i>Commissioning a Patient-led NHS</i> criteria and have the best possible chance of success.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_12"></a>&quot;On PCTs as providers of services, let me restate the Secretary of State&#039;s clear commitment to the House on 25 October 2005:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78"></a>&#039;district nurses, health visitors and other staff who deliver clinical services . . . will continue to be employed by the PCT unless and until it decides otherwise&#039;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 25/10/05; col. 152.]</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="60516-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_13"></a>&quot;Our aim in making these changes is to benefit both patients and taxpayers. Fewer, more strategic PCTs will be better placed to ensure effective commissioning of services for patients and to support the development of practice-based commissioning <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_192"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 192</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

among GPs and other primary care staff. Patients will receive the right care and treatment, in the right place, at the right time.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_14"></a>&quot;The taxpayer will see the release of &#163;250 million savings annually&#151;by merging back office functions and reducing administrative costs&#151;for reinvestment in frontline services from 2008-09. This could pay for, for example, roughly 50,000 heart operations or major improvements in services for people with long-term conditions, especially older people. The changes will also build stronger partnerships between the NHS and local government.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_15"></a>&quot;The reconfiguration of PCTs is the first stage in strengthening their commissioning function. The next stage is a development programme for all PCTs which will ensure that they are strong, confident organisations, fit for driving forward the NHS reforms that we are implementing.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para19"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_16"></a>&quot;Let me now turn to ambulance trust reorganisation. In June 2005, the Government accepted the recommendations set out in the review by Peter Bradley, our national ambulance adviser, called <i>Taking Healthcare to the Patient: Transforming NHS Ambulance Services. </i>The report set out a vision for ambulance services. In future, they will provide more care in the home and more treatment at the scene, give better advice to patients over the telephone and ensure faster response times to save more lives.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para20"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_17"></a>&quot;The review made it clear that, in order to ensure ambulance trusts have the right strategic capacity, infrastructure and staff to deliver these improvements to patient care, there should be fewer, larger ambulance trusts in future. These changes will enable standards within the new trusts to be levelled up to those of the best.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para21"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_18"></a>&quot;In her Written Statement of 14 December 2005, my right honourable friend set out our intention to consult and to ensure that the benefits outlined in the ambulance review could be fully realised. Following this consultation, the Secretary of State has now decided that, from 1 July 2006, most of the existing 29 NHS ambulance trusts will merge into 12, with separate management arrangements for the Isle of Wight. For now, Staffordshire ambulance service will remain a separate trust, working in partnership with the new West Midlands ambulance service, but eventually merging later.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para22"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_19"></a>&quot;Feedback for most areas was supportive of our proposals. However, in order to address public concern that local responsiveness and flexibility could be lost through having larger trusts, we have decided to address this by requiring ambulance trusts to ensure that their services are meeting the needs of all localities and populations within their boundaries.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para23"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_20"></a>&quot;These changes should mean more investment in frontline services as trusts identify savings in backroom functions; improved patient care by providing an opportunity to raise the standards of services provided by all trusts to the level of the best; better emergency planning with greater capacity <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_193"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 193</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and capability to respond to major incidents of all kinds; and more integrated services and better career opportunities for staff.


</p>

<a name="60516-19_para24"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_21"></a>&quot;Changes of this kind are inevitably difficult. We have not sought to impose a single blueprint on the NHS, but instead have listened carefully to representations from all honourable Members, local communities and organisations. Wherever possible, we have responded positively to them. They have one aim above all&#151;to deliver better healthcare to patients&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60516-19_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>My Lords, that concludes the statement.

<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="60516-20_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord for repeating the Statement.
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>In 2001, in the document called <i>Shifting the Balance of Power, </i>the Government announced that 302 PCTs would replace the existing health authorities and that the nine regional offices of the NHS Executive would be abolished in favour of 28 strategic health authorities. The announcement today effectively returns the NHS to a very similar organisational configuration to the one which the Government abolished only three years ago. That fact alone is enough to call the judgment of Ministers and officials into question. The Minister mentions cost savings arising from these mergers, but we all know that reorganisation itself carries a very considerable cost. Can the Minister say what the cost is likely to be in redundancy pay? Is the figure I have read of &#163;320 million an accurate estimate?
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>There is a further issue here. These very far-reaching changes to the structure of PCTs are being made without real clarity on what their functions are supposed to be. Why was it decided to retain the provider role and functions of PCTs when it was initially said by the Government that there was such a compelling case for removing those functions? What is the Government&#039;s endgame in view? Will PCTs be encouraged to divest themselves of their provider functions? If it is to be down to local decision-making, what criteria should govern such decisions as practice-based commissioning develops? Finally on PCTs, I would like to pick the Minister up on two particular matters that he mentioned. He spoke of the need to retain a strong locality focus. How does he propose to do that with these larger structures? And what added benefits does the Minister see for the commissioning of services? As he will remember, commissioning is an issue that we have debated in this House in recent months.
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Moving to ambulance trusts, I welcome and am relieved by the decision on Staffordshire ambulance service, although its future is still less than clear. But it is not self-evident, despite what the Minister said, that bigger is better in this area. Some of the much smaller trusts which struggle with poorer response times will no doubt welcome a merger and derive a benefit from it, but there is a real issue over whether the creation of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_194"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 194</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

ambulance trusts over sometimes very large areas like the greater part of East Anglia will do anything at all for responsiveness and flexibility.
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>Some interesting comments have been published recently on this theme. According to one unnamed chair of an NHS ambulance trust, the former chief executive of the NHS, Sir Nigel Crisp, told him that the changes were driven by the manifesto pledge of the Government to find &#163;250 million of savings in NHS management and administration costs. The chair said that the changes had,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"></a>&quot;not been thought through operationally&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>The chief executive of Staffordshire Ambulance Trust, Roger Thayne, has condemned the proposed mergers. He has said that there is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80"></a>&quot;no evidence that larger ambulance services are anything [other] than more expensive and do not improve performance and save more lives . . . Services serving a population of more than 2 million cost more and save less lives. The worst thing is we don&#039;t know why they&#039;re doing this&#151;but I do know it won&#039;t save more lives&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>That was from an article in the <i>Health Service Journal</i> of 22 September last year. Those comments are entirely apposite. It seems to many that what the Government are now doing is primarily cost driven, not outcome driven. Can the Minister say in what respects the reorganisation of ambulance trusts is designed to integrate ambulance services with the other emergency services? How can such integration be possible when in many instances different services are using different communication and co-ordination systems?
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>If you talk to those who work in the NHS, you will hear a number of comments at the moment, but one is heard perhaps more than others about the activities of Government. It is: when will they stop moving the deckchairs and let us get on with it? I suggest that it behoves Ministers to ask themselves that question now.

<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="60516-20_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   My Lords, I too thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place. Since this Government came to power there have been seven reorganisations of the National Health Service. The announcement today marks the eighth and ninth. The NHS could have wanted nothing less.
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>As the noble Earl said, four years ago regional health authorities were abolished. Today&#039;s announcement begs the question of whether the Government were right then to abolish health authorities or whether they are right now to recreate them in a new form. They must have been right at one point and wrong at another. Would the Minister tell us which?
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Secondly, today&#039;s Statement made much of the anticipated savings of &#163;250 million. Would the noble Lord tell us the evidence for that figure? In January the Health Select Committee, writing on the subject of PCT reorganisation, said that at best it could estimate savings of between &#163;60 million to &#163;100 million. How was that figure of &#163;250 million arrived at and will it be recurrent? Furthermore, can the Minister tell us the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_195"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 195</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

anticipated number of redundancies of managers and how will that interplay with the number of frontline staff currently being shed by trusts?
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>The Minister said in the Statement that there would be an achievement of 70 per cent coterminosity with social services. On behalf of my colleagues, I welcome that the Government have in some cases listened and changed their proposals, particularly on coterminosity in some parts of the country. Given that coterminosity of PCTs and social services remains the same in London, and they represent 32 out of 152 trusts, there must be a substantial part of the rest of the country where there is no coterminosity. Given that the numbers of older people&#151;particularly heavy users of ambulance trust and PCT services&#151;live in areas that are not coterminous and given that at the same time social services are having to deliver against a background of 15 per cent cuts and savings, can the Minister say what the Statement means for the future integration of health and social care services?
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>I too wish to make some points on ambulance services. I echo the noble Earl&#039;s feeling that bigger is not necessarily fitter for function, but given that ambulance services are going to be reorganised at the same time as the reorganisation of police forces, can the Minister say what the implications of that would be for co-ordination of emergency work? Furthermore, if ambulance trusts are to cover much wider areas, what is going to happen to people in rural areas? How will this reorganisation ensure that there is equity between those who live in rural areas and those who live in larger urban areas, whose demands on the ambulance service can be particularly high&#151;particularly high at key points such as evenings and weekends?
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>This restructuring is to be implemented by October this year. It is being introduced at a time when practice-based commissioning is being rolled out. It is the structural backdrop to the implementation of the White Paper and is being introduced when there is a great deal of uncertainty in all the different parts of the NHS, such as NHS Direct, which this week announced a whole load of job cuts too. Will the targets that PCTs are supposed to achieve, particularly in things like roll-out of practice-based commissioning, be altered in any way while they try to find their way though what seems inevitably to be a summer of job cuts and a winter of confusion?

<a name="60516-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, there is quite a lot there to respond to. I will do my best to give coherent responses to the points made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker.
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>Both raised the issue of redundancy. The &#163;250 million is a conservative estimate of the savings likely to be made&#151;a mixture of staff and non-staff savings, including real estate issues. When people study the changes more closely, they will see that there is a lot of emphasis on sharing back-office services and, in some cases, sharing management systems and doing joint commissioning, too. Some of these provide scope&#151;confidently, we think&#151;for &#163;250 million, which will be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_196"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 196</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a recurring saving. It is worth bearing in mind that the redundancies are a one-off payment to secure those recurring savings. We confidently predict that we will get four-year savings in 2008-09 and these will go, as I said when repeating the Statement, on front-line services. These will help particularly with areas around long-term conditions and some front-line services in acute services.
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>On removing provider functions from PCTs, the Secretary of State, Patricia Hewitt, has made clear on a number of occasions&#151;as have I&#151;that we have no intention of requiring PCTs to divest themselves of their provider functions. However, the trusts will need to continue to ensure that the provider services in their area are fit for purpose. That is why we will be going through, as I said in the Statement, a process of ensuring their fitness for purpose, so that they can ensure that the right services are in place to meet the needs of all the people in their communities, including those in the areas of greatest deprivation, some of whom need new providers and alternative providers to be in place.
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Coterminosity was welcomed by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. We have significantly increased coterminosity with social services through these changes. That was a big issue in the public consultation, which led to the White Paper. People want their services to be integrated. It was not possible to achieve 100 per cent coterminosity. We listened carefully to what local stakeholders said and we have adapted some of the proposals to meet those concerns. There is a balance to be struck in some parts of the country between coterminosity and meeting the needs of health inequalities&#151;also having bodies in place that carry a great deal of public confidence. There is not a lot of point in going through an exercise where more than 12,000 people turn up at public meetings to debate and many more write in with their views, and not listen to those views&#151;particularly where front-line staff such as GPs express their views on the most suitable configuration at a particular local level.
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>I hear what both noble Lords say about big not necessarily being beautiful in relation to ambulance trusts. I note the welcome of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, for the arrangements in Staffordshire. We listened to the advice that was given to us by our National Ambulance Adviser, as I made clear in the Statement. Peter Bradley consulted with a considerable stakeholder group before he fashioned the advice in the report mentioned in the Statement. His views were not the same as those of Roger Thane of Staffordshire&#151;who, let me remind the noble Earl, has resigned and is no longer the chief executive of Staffordshire. Mr Thane has his views&#151;he is entitled to them&#151;but they are not the views expressed by our National Ambulance Adviser and are not necessarily the views which are shared by a large number of people in the ambulance service. We think it is essential to listen to that advice because it makes clear that a number of trusts need to be larger in order to provide the infrastructure and the capability to cope with the changing needs placed on our ambulance service.

<a name="60516-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>As to rural areas, these proposals will not change front-line services or where ambulance stations are located. There is nothing in the proposals which will require any ambulance trust to change its ambulance stations. Of course, over time, in all places, ambulance stations occasionally have to change because populations have the inconvenient habit of changing and people move to different parts of the country, but there is nothing in the proposals which in any way disadvantages rural areas.
</p>

<a name="60516-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>I have tried to deal with most of the points raised. I refute absolutely whatever is attributed to Sir Nigel Crisp in regard to changes driven by the manifesto. It is very clear that we need to strengthen the commissioning function in PCTs. The introduction of practice-based commissioning&#151;which I can confirm we are still aiming to have in place across the country by the end of this year&#151;changes the dynamic; it tends to push in the direction of larger PCTs and more combinations of PCTs because of the functions being carried out in the commissioning sector by GPs.

<a name="60516-21_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Shephard of Northwold: </b>   My Lords, perhaps the Minister can address the question posed directly by the noble Baroness and indirectly by my noble friend, which is this: if PCTs were such a good idea three years ago, why are they not now? What has the cost been to the taxpayer of this experiment?
</p>




<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="60516-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, let me remind the noble Baroness that before the election many PCTs were queuing up to merge because they had found that they could not discharge their obligations effectively and some had struggled with recruiting staff. This issue has been put into the public arena on a number of occasions. The situation has changed since PCTs were introduced. As I have said, we have practice-based commissioning coming along and the focus on commissioning services is much stronger now than was previously the case. We think the time is right to make this change now so that we can have a strong commissioning function. Alongside the changes caused by the introduction of foundation trusts and a national tariff through payment by results, we need a strong commissioning function. It is a new equation which has to be taken into account in making changes now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="60516-21_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Tonge: </b>   My Lords, what does the Minister understand to be the difference between practice-based commissioning and GP fund-holding?
</p>




<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="60516-21_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the key difference is that GP fund-holding allowed people to keep the surpluses they engineered for their own purposes. Practice-based commissioning enables GPs, when they drive a more efficient array of services for their patients, to redeploy the surpluses into new services for patients.

<a name="60516-21_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </b>   My Lords, what is the position in regard to the splendid work of the air ambulances? Many of these are voluntarily funded and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_198"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 198</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

when there is change there is always some uncertainty. Will the Minister tell the House the position? I know that a life was saved yesterday by one of them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="60516-21_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, there are no proposals which in any way adversely affect the splendid work done by the air ambulance services. The noble Baroness may know that we have been putting more public funding into air ambulances over the past year or so. I shall write to her with more details of that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="60516-21_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister say a little more about co-ordinating the larger areas? In country areas and in towns, it is most important that ambulance service drivers know where all the houses are. If you have a large area and you are going to save money, you will have spare drivers who you can allocate around. But this is not good enough because there is no question that the speed at which an ambulance arrives at any accident or illness is very important, particularly in country areas. I should like an assurance that this fact will be taken into account.
</p>




<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="60516-21_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, as I said in response to an earlier question, there are no proposals in these changes to alter the location of ambulance stations, which are the places from where people drive ambulances to provide services to patients. It is true that across the country already there is a significant variation in the types of vehicles being used, but increasingly across the whole of the ambulance service satellite navigation systems are in place which enable people to find their way by the quickest routes. We also know that no ambulance trust will put people in charge of ambulances without the appropriate training to ensure that they can meet the kinds of requirements that the public expect.

<p>&quot;PART 21 A COMPANY&#039;S ANNUAL RETURN
</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_18"></a><br>
DUTY TO DELIVER ANNUAL RETURNS<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_199"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 199</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(1)   Every company must deliver to the registrar successive annual returns each of which is made up to a date not later than the date that is from time to time the company&#039;s return date.

<br>
(2)   The company&#039;s return date is&#151;


<br>
(a)   the anniversary of the company&#039;s incorporation, or


<br>
(b)   if the company&#039;s last return delivered in accordance with this Part was made up to a different date, the anniversary of that date.


<br>
(3)   Each return must&#151;


<br>
(a)   contain the information required by or under the following provisions of this Part, and


<br>
(b)   be delivered to the registrar within 28 days after the date to which it is made up.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_205"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 443, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 444 to 448, 495 and 497.
</p>

<a name="60516-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>The proposed new clauses in Amendments Nos. 443 to 448 replace the provisions in the 1985 Act which deal with the annual returns companies must make to the Registrar of Companies. The clauses retain the existing requirement for a company to file every year a return that, in effect, updates key information required for the public record. It is a relatively simple and effective way of ensuring that the public record is kept up-to-date. To minimise the burden on companies, Companies House provides most companies with a provisional return which already includes much of the current information held by the registrar and which is required to be included in the annual return. This helps the company concerned because it simply needs to check and amend its information, either on a computer screen or by marking up changes on a paper form. The majority of companies now perform this task on line.
</p>

<a name="60516-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>The clauses do not change the existing requirements as to what information is required, and they retain the power for regulations to change these requirements. However, this power differs from the existing power in that it specifically provides for regulations to make exceptions from the general requirements.
</p>

<a name="60516-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>At present, the annual returns of companies with shareholders are required to provide the names and addresses of all who hold shares in the company or did so during the year covered by the return, together with details of their holdings. When in future, as the Bill provides, companies will be able to apply to the courts to be relieved from the obligation to provide a copy of their register of members if it is not sought for a proper purpose, I fear it is inevitable that those who want members&#039; addresses for other purposes will look elsewhere and probably seek to get them from Companies House instead. We intend to use the power taken in Amendment No. 446 to prevent that.
</p>

<a name="60516-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>Subject to consultation, we propose that for private companies with a share capital, the prescribed details to be included in the annual return should exclude addresses of members. That information will still be available from the company, but only if it is sought for a proper purpose. For public companies, we propose that there be an exemption from the requirement for all members&#039; details to be included in the annual return if the prescribed information is provided for those who <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_200"></a>

(a)   a statement of capital, and


<br>
(b)   the particulars required by subsections (3) to (6) about the members of the company.

The return must conform to such requirements as may be prescribed for the purpose of enabling the entries relating to any given person to be easily found.


<br>
(4)   The return must also state&#151;


<br>
(a)   the number of shares of each class held by each member of the company at the date to which the return is made up,

(5)   If either of the two immediately preceding returns has given the full particulars required by subsections (3) and (4), the return need only give such particulars as relate&#151;


<br>
(a)   to persons ceasing to be or becoming members since the date of the last return, and


<br>
(b)   to shares transferred since that date.


<br>
(6)   Where the company has converted any of its shares into stock, the return must give the corresponding information in relation to that stock, stating the amount of stock instead of the number or nominal value of shares.&quot;


<br>

<br>
(c)   every other officer of the company who is in default.


<br>

<br>
(3)   The contravention continues until such time as an annual return made up to that return date is delivered by the company to the registrar.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_202"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 202</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

It follows an amendment he proposed in Committee to delete the reference to the rules governing substantial acquisitions of shares, the SARs, from the description of the proposed rule-making power to be provided to the Takeover Panel by Clause 625. We could not accept the amendment at that time, not because of any substantive difference of opinion between us but because the Takeover Panel was still in the process of considering the responses received to its own consultation on the relevance of the SARs. The panel announced the outcome of its deliberations on 21 April and the SARs will go from 20 May, so the reference to them in Clause 625 becomes redundant.

(   )   failed to comply with rules about documentation by virtue of section 635&quot;

<p><a name="st_214"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to move Amendment No. 464 and speak to Amendments Nos. 465, 468, 471, 472, 473 and 475, which concern Clauses 634 and 635. I must apologise to the House, as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_204"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 204</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Amendment No. 469 somehow got tabled in error. I do not think it should be in this group at all, and we will not be seeking to move it.
</p>

<a name="60516-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>This takes us to a proposal that we believe still looks suspiciously like gold-plating of the EU takeovers directive. We have just discussed this in Grand Committee, and the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_90"></a>&quot;The starting point is Article 17 of the takeovers directive, which requires member states to put in place sanctions which are &#039;effective, proportionate and dissuasive&#039;. That is to ensure the rules of the directive are complied with&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28/3/06; col. GC 304.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-22_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>The directive therefore requires that a failure to comply with the rules about bid documentation must be subject to sanctions of the kind that satisfy Article 17. The Government have so far taken the approach that only a criminal offence will do, stating that they do not believe the panel will otherwise have sufficient power to take effective action, in directive terms, against any such failure.
</p>

<a name="60516-22_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>The sanctions attributed to the panel, which the Government believe are insufficient for this purpose, are these: public and private censure or reporting of conduct to another regulatory body, as well as action to issue directions to those responsible to put the matter right. This list has overlooked a further power the panel has under the Bill that I believe would adequately satisfy the requirements of Article 17: the power to order a person to pay compensation under Clause 636. In conjunction with the sanctions I have just listed, that seems to be ample penalty to provide an adequate deterrent as required by Article 17 of the directive.
</p>

<a name="60516-22_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>There is another reason why we on these Benches say this is not an appropriate area for a criminal offence. The proposed offence would be for failing to comply with offer document rules. Those rules are made by the Takeover Panel itself. As we discussed at length in Grand Committee, the panel is now to become a statutory body, with all the associated powers that come with that status. However, it will retain much of its independence. We will have a situation where an independent body, subject to very little formal parliamentary scrutiny, will be able, by altering its rules, to create new forms of criminal offences. We wonder whether that is a desirable outcome.
</p>

<a name="60516-22_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>For those noble Lords who were not present in Grand Committee, I am not arguing for greater control of the panel. As I said then, the panel has been a great success, and we do not wish to clip its wings with unnecessary bureaucracy. We would therefore argue strongly against limiting the independence of the panel simply to permit a criminal offence for failure to meet the rules about bid documentation in order to comply&#151;or, in our view, to over-comply&#151;with the EU takeovers directive. Surely, the simpler and correct approach is to allow the panel to deal with such a breach by means of the sanctions under the Bill, which more than adequately meet the requirements of Article 17?

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 205</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60516-22_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>Since Grand Committee, we have carried out a little research into how other European states have implemented the directive. Our advisers tell us that in Ireland, for example, where they already have a statutory framework, when rules on offer document contents are breached it appears to be a civil liability. We are told that the same is true in Germany. If these states, which are subject to the same directive as this country, do not see the need to implement this as a criminal offence, there is no reason why the Government should feel so compelled. Therefore, in light of this new information, I beg to move Amendment No. 464, which I hope the Government will feel able to accept.

<p><a name="st_215"></a>
<a name="60516-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Patten </b>  : My Lords, one should be properly cautious when rising from one&#039;s place to intervene if one has not been present at a Grand Committee, where complex issues such as this one were discussed fully. However, I have spoken in other parts of your Lordships&#039; proceedings, and while I plead guilty to not having been present in Grand Committee when this issue was debated, I rise in strong support of what my noble friend Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts has just said. Governments of both political colours&#151;not only the present Government, but earlier Conservative Administrations&#151;have been accused, sometimes rightly, of going too far down the road of fulfilling what they see as the outcomes desired by an EU directive, or&#151;to use the excellent phrase of my noble friend&#151;of gold-plating.
</p>

<a name="60516-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>That is not desirable in this case. We now have far too many new potential criminal offences being introduced, hand over hand, in this country. I do not speak of the 43 criminal justice Acts we have seen in the last nine years. One should proceed very cautiously before bringing into law new potential criminal offences which may never be used, may frighten practitioners, and may lie unnoticed on the statute book. That is not good legislation. My noble friend has put his finger on it: we should leave it to the panel. If other European jurisdictions can manage perfectly well without going this far, why on earth should this Administration go to the lengths of gratuitously introducing new and unnecessary criminal offences?
</p>




<p><a name="st_216"></a>
<a name="60516-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, in introducing his amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, rightly identified the starting point in Grand Committee. The Government believe that the requirements of Article 17 of the takeovers directive will not be satisfied simply by relying on the sanctions which the panel has at its disposal and is likely to be prepared to use. The noble Lord referred to what is happening in Ireland and Germany. I do not have details of that, so I cannot respond specifically to what he says. I certainly do not have details of, for example, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_206"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 206</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the sanctions available to the pertinent bodies, or their practice in using them. There may be differences in practice that justify taking a different approach to the necessity of having a criminal offence.
</p>

<a name="60516-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>I shall briefly summarise the points I made in Grand Committee and then pick up those raised by the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord Patten. There has been detailed discussion of, and consultation on, this matter. It is not intended to prevent the panel exercising its own powers, but&#151;this is an important point, dealing with the issue of compensation, raised by the noble Lord&#151;my understanding is that the panel does not want to police breaches after the event. The panel operates, during the course of a bid, by calling somebody in, requiring them to change the terms of their document so as to comply with the rules, and so forth. That is why, in particular, the power to order compensation does not appear to be an adequate sanction. I can also envisage circumstances in which the power to order compensation would not, in itself, be adequate because it would be difficult to identify just what the compensation ought to be. Certainly, given the time involved, the panel would not want to police breaches after the event in this way.
</p>

<a name="60516-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>The second concern raised by the noble Lord was the possibility that the panel might, by changing the contents of the rules, enlarge the effect of a criminal offence. That theory is wrong because the offence relates to failures&#151;I shall return to the terms of those failures&#151;to comply with the rules about bid documentation. It identifies the relevant rules in Clause 635 by reference to the directive itself. &quot;Offer document&quot; means rules designated, or rules that give effect to Article 6.3 of the directive. &quot;Response document&quot; means a document required to be published by rules giving effect to Article 9.5 of that directive. The relevant documents, which are the subject matter on which a criminal offence can be founded, must meet the requirements of Articles 6 and 9 of the directive. No doubt, because these are directives, there is some scope for the precise content, but they still have to meet the requirements of Articles 6 and 9. They are limited by the boundaries of Articles 6 and 9, so it is not possible simply to extend them in that way.
</p>

<a name="60516-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>A further point I want to emphasise is that we have looked carefully at whether the scope and clarity of the offence is sufficient. When I come to government amendments relating to this clause, we want to refine those in light of comments made in Grand Committee. When that is done we should see two things. The first is an offence that is clearly defined. The second is a light-touch approach to a criminal offence. I say this because we have not focused on it before: breach of the only rule giving rise to an offence arises, as subsection (3) says, only where the person knows that the offer document did not comply or was reckless about compliance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_217"></a>
<a name="60516-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, could the noble and learned Lord foreshadow&#151;without firing his ammunition in respect of these later <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_207"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 207</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendments&#151;which amendments he is referring to when he speaks of refining the offence under this clause?
</p>




<p><a name="st_218"></a>
<a name="60516-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, we have discussed the persons subject to the offence, and we will come back in the amendments to the position of those who are directors of corporate bodies standing behind a bid. We debated this in Grand Committee. I emphasise that we have looked at that. I hope noble Lords will recognise that in this area, as in others, we have listened very carefully to what has been said by Members opposite, those on the Liberal Democrat Benches, and others who have participated. Where we have seen that there is a point, we have responded to it. We responded very substantially earlier today to the amendments I have been dealing with concerning auditors&#039; liability and directors&#039; duties. We have looked at this and seen that there is a need to make some refinements to those who are subject to it. As the Government responsible for implementing the directive, we take the view that unless we have an offence&#151;albeit a light-touch offence&#151;we will not be meeting the terms of the directive.
</p>

<a name="60516-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a> There are good reasons why the panel&#039;s powers would not be adequate if it was not prepared to exercise those powers after the event. That area needs to be met. Where the Government have taken the view that they need to do something to meet their international obligations, the House would be very slow indeed not to accept that, particularly given that, at the end of the day, the only person at risk would be somebody who knew that an offer document did not comply and was reckless as to whether it complied, but went ahead with it anyway.
</p>

<a name="60516-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patten, was concerned that this might frighten practitioners. Someone who knows that he is putting forward a document that is non-compliant or is reckless about doing so should, in a sense, be frightened. He ought to be doing it right. I am sure that those participating in this debate have been personally involved in offer documentation, as I have, and know the huge amount of attention that all practitioners pay to what is going on. Only someone who is really reckless or intent on breaking the rules will find themselves in breach of this provision.
</p>




<p><a name="st_219"></a>
<a name="60516-23_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Patten: </b>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General is quite right that people&#151;practitioners, or whoever they are&#151;should be fearful of the criminal law when it has been passed into statute. However, I genuinely seek education from him. I am self-evidently not a lawyer, but I know that words spoken by Ministers and reported in <i>Hansard&#151;</i>particularly those spoken by noble and learned Lords such as the Attorney-General&#151;can be carefully studied in future years. I have never heard the term &quot;light-touch offence&quot; before. I thought an offence was an offence was an offence. What does &quot;light touch&quot; mean in this context?
</p>




<p><a name="st_220"></a>
<a name="60516-23_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, I am happy to respond to that invitation. I meant that we could have said, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_208"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 208</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&quot;We need a criminal offence, so we will make it one that is committed not only where someone acts in a sharp, deliberate way to break the rules, or is reckless, but if someone breaks the rules through negligence&quot;. Someone could be careless and put forward an offer document which does not comply. We could even have said that people are guilty of criminal offences where there is no fault but they have broken the rule. It happens from time to time and we call those offences of strict liability. We could have done all those things; there are other ways in which this could have been a much more onerous criminal responsibility. That is what I meant by &quot;light touch&quot;. We have taken the view that, to meet our international obligations, we need to have something which provides the possibility of a criminal offence, but we have put it as narrowly as possible. That is the response to the accusation of gold-plating. Once upon a time, gold-plating used to be rather a good thing to do, but in this context it is not.
</p>

<p><a name="st_221"></a>
<a name="60516-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General is always very persuasive. I begin, as he ended, by talking about gold-plating. He said that there has been extensive consultation. He said that Clause 636, which deals with compensation, is not good enough because the panel will not use the power&#151;it does not want to. But the power exists.
</p>




<p><a name="st_222"></a>
<a name="60516-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, I also said that I could envisage cases in which the power to provide compensation would not meet the problem. There are certain requirements for the provision of information in which other people are interested, such as employees; the rules may require arrangements in relation to employees to be provided in an offer document. I am doubtful whether a power to provide compensation would meet a failure in that respect.
</p>




<p><a name="st_223"></a>
<a name="60516-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I understand that there were two barrels to that argument. One was that although the panel had the power, it would not want to use it. The noble and learned Lord said that we need not be concerned because the panel could not enlarge the offences. My concern was not about enlarging but altering them. As the nature of what is required in the offer document changes, so does the nature of the offence. In addition, my noble friend Lord Patten mentioned the issue of the light touch.
</p>

<a name="60516-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>We read very carefully what the noble and learned Lord said in Committee, which is why we tried to find out what other people were doing about this. We have been unable to find any other country that has found it necessary to introduce a criminal offence to cover this point. We on these Benches are very concerned about gold-plating. We admire what the panel has done; we do not wish to see it dragged any further into the criminal justice system. Its success in the past has been its light touch. We understand that it cannot continue to be a self-regulatory body because of the EU takeovers directive. However, I think that this is a step in the wrong direction and I wish to test the opinion of the House.

</p>

<a name="60516-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>In Committee the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord Sharman, proposed amendments in relation to the proposed bid documentation offence at Clause 635, which was the subject of the previous debate. Certain of those matters are being pursued further today. If I understood the purpose behind those amendments correctly, they sought both to provide greater certainty as regards those potentially liable for the bid documentation offence and to narrow the scope of such persons.
</p>

<a name="60516-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>As I foreshadowed in what I said in the previous debate, we have reflected further on the scope of the bid documentation offence in the light of those amendments and those concerns. We have also discussed the coverage of the bid documentation <br>&nbsp;<br>

offence with lawyers responsible for advising bidders on the preparation of offer and response documents. The present amendments result from those discussions and deliberations.
</p>

<a name="60516-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>Amendments Nos. 466, 470 and 474 seek to do two things. The first is to restrict liability for the offence in respect of offer documents to the bidder or any director, officer or member of the bidder who caused the bid document to be published. This has the important consequence of relieving employees and agents of the bidder from potential liability for the offence and the additional costs that might have arisen from this; for example, to professional advisers.
</p>

<a name="60516-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>Secondly, we have sought to clarify the intention behind the provision related to the liability of officers where the offence is committed by a corporate body. This aims to ensure that where, for instance, a corporate director is liable, then the directors of that corporate body can also be pursued. The intention has never been to make the directors of the corporate body strictly liable, which was a concern expressed in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60516-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>Amendment No. 467, which stands in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Sharman and Lord Razzall, proposes a different approach. It aims to link liability for the offence to the person responsible for the offer document in accordance with the rules of the Takeover Panel. We carefully examined this approach. I recognise that it has merits but we decided to pursue the formulation that we have taken as the panel rules do not provide absolute clarity as to the person responsible in all cases and there is an element of discretion available to the panel. For instance, the panel may consent to certain directors not being responsible in exceptional circumstances. We think that our solution produces a similar result to that proposed by this amendment in most cases, but has the advantage of greater certainty.
</p>

<a name="60516-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>I very much hope that noble Lords will agree that our amendments meet the concerns which have been expressed. I hope that they will find support. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving the amendment I shall speak also to Amendment No. 477. We return to a point on which, when we discussed it in Grand Committee, I received a slightly baffling response from the noble and learned Lord. The amendments that we proposed then, and indeed the amendments we propose now, replace what is currently in the Bill with the wording in the directive. The reason behind the change is the uncertainty of the words &quot;in value&quot;. When we pressed for an explanation of the meaning, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General replied:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95"></a>&quot;Regarding the specific question of the words &#039;in value&#039; in the clause, we think it is clear what they mean: they refer to the nominal value of shares, so to achieve the breakthrough threshold the bidder must reach 75 per cent of the nominal value of the company&#039;s voting shares&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28/3/2006; col. GC318.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>I could not understand that answer then. I said then, and I repeat now, that nominal value bears no relationship to market value. If adopted as the standard for this clause, it could provide a skewed result owing to the different nominal value attaching to different classes of shares. We could find that a very few people holding high nominal value shares with a low market value could effectively control the company, despite the other shareholders owning a far greater amount in market value simply because the nominal value allocated to their shares was low. I am sure that that cannot be right. It would mean that different voting weights would be attached to shares, which though having the same rights would have different nominal values. I hope that the noble and learned Lord has thought again on this question. I always give way on matters such as Foss v. Harbottle, but this is a practitioner City matter and I am sure that this cannot be the right way to approach it. Maybe we are at odds over nominal and real market values. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_233"></a>
<a name="60516-25_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, I recall the debate in Grand Committee and the reaction when I answered the question in the way that the noble Lord quoted. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_213"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 213</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I will try to explain where the difficulty lies. Article 11.4 of the takeover directive uses a concept unfamiliar to English company law in terms of its language; that is, it talks of the offeror holding 75 per cent or more of the capital carrying voting rights. It is the concept that the noble Lord wants to insert by way of amendment, but it is not in itself a concept that is presently familiar to the English companies market, if I may put it that way. So we have tried to use an expression that will be familiar to the English company market rather than using that phrase.
</p>

<a name="60516-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>If one is looking to see what is 75 per cent of the capital carrying voting rights, I stand by saying that in the majority of cases normally one would find that by looking at the nominal value of the shares and seeing whether they hold 75 per cent or more. Plainly in the case where we have only one class of share, no difficulty at all arises. In the situation where one has more than one class of share, no real difficulty may arise; there may be some difference in the market value of the shares at a particular stage but the voting rights may still appear to be broadly comparable to the nominal value.
</p>

<a name="60516-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>What will the court make of it? The words in the Bill do not say &quot;nominal value&quot;; they say, &quot;value&quot;. It has been left in that sense so that it will be for the court to interpret what is meant. I answered the question because I was asked and it is right that we should indicate what we think. How will the court interpret it? The court will need to interpret this provision in the same way as it would interpret other provisions in a statute where it is plain that the intention has been to implement a directive. So I have little doubt that they will look at the directive and say that in understanding it they need to understand that it is intended to implement the requirements of Article 11.4
</p>

<a name="60516-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>I doubt whether it will make much difference in many cases. There may be some cases&#151;this is where the concern may have arisen over what I said&#151;where the structure of the company is such that the court would say that if we are really looking at 75 per cent of capital carrying voting rights, it is not appropriate on this occasion just to look at the nominal value because the structure of the company is extraordinary: someone has 90 per cent of the nominal value for virtually nothing and the rest of the shareholders, who have only 10 per cent of the nominal value, have the real bulk of the company. I can see that one could have such a company and in those circumstances the court may say that 75 per cent of value in that context is to be interpreted in a different way. But in many cases&#151;perhaps the majority&#151;75 per cent in value of all the voting shares would be taken to mean the nominal value for the reasons that I have given.
</p>

<a name="60516-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>So it is not straightforward: we do not know what the European Court of Justice would make of capital carrying voting rights, or 75 per cent of those in any event. That could influence what the English court ultimately made of any of this. In most cases, whether the breakthrough provision is calculated on the basis of nominal or market value, the result would be exactly the same.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_214"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 214</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60516-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>The point is that the amendment proposed by the noble Lord does not add any greater clarity because it uses an expression that does not mean much in itself. The provision as we have it in the Bill will have to be interpreted against that background. So the noble Lord can feel reassured that when it comes to interpreting what is meant by value, what is going to matter is not what I have said about it but what the court makes of the clause against the background of the directive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_234"></a>
<a name="60516-25_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General for his considered response. I accept that capital carrying voting rights is not the wording that is familiar in English financial practice. I therefore accept that our amendments are deficient in that sense; they do not advance the arguments sufficiently. I am always reluctant to leave a situation where we could clarify matters beyond peradventure and say that the courts will sort that out. That may be helpful for lawyers but it is an unsatisfactory way of proceeding.
</p>

<a name="60516-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>I shall reflect on that, take some advice and consider whether inserting the word &quot;market&quot; might not sort the whole thing out. Dealing with the market value of the voting shares might be another way of tackling the matter and making it clear for ever that that is what we are about.

<p><a name="st_235"></a>
<a name="60516-26_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, of course I am content for the noble Lord to do that, but perhaps I may invite him to consider this. The problem with the suggestion is, first, whether one would then be against the meaning of the directive. Secondly, I can see real difficulties in identifying at any moment what is 75 per cent of the market value. Do you take the value of the shares on day 1 or on the Wednesday? The fact that a breakthrough has, has not or may have taken place can in itself affect the value of the shares, and during a bid there might be a considerable movement in the value of the shares. The noble Lord&#039;s suggestion would be difficult in practice, but I invite him to take that into account when he takes his advice.

directive are given effect to by chapter 2 of Part 22 of the Bill. The amendments are concerned with the types of &quot;securities&quot; falling within the scope of the directive.
</p>

<a name="60516-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>On its face, the takeovers directive is relatively explicit on this point. It states at Article 2 that &quot;securities&quot; means,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_97"></a>&quot;transferable securities carrying voting rights&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>That short definition cannot be expected to cover in detail a whole range of different security instruments that exist across the EU. We must work out what principles it lays down. For the purposes of the domestic implementing legislation, we talk of &quot;shares&quot; rather than &quot;securities&quot;, as we think that that is more natural in terms of existing companies legislation..
</p>

<a name="60516-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>So, we need to capture the concept of &quot;shares carrying voting rights&quot;. There is a long-standing argument as to whether that means voting rights in all circumstances, or whether it includes voting rights that arise only in exceptional circumstances. For example, with some &quot;preference shares&quot;, there will be a right to vote, but that will arise only when the dividend has not been paid. There will be other categories of shares that carry no voting rights, except on specific matters, such as any variation of the class rights relating to those shares.
</p>

<a name="60516-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>In the UK, different types of shares are not defined. Instead, the voting rights and the other rights attributable to the shares are generally prescribed, in the first instance at least, by the articles of association. The inevitable result is that there are many variations on the types of shares that can exist.
</p>

<a name="60516-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>By these amendments, we seek to cut the Gordian knot. They would provide that, in determining the breakthrough threshold and the mechanics of the operation of breakthrough, where the different interpretation has real practical effect, shares that do not normally carry rights to vote at general meetings will be excluded. We think that that drafting reflects the policy intent of the directive. It benefits from being absolutely clear whether a share is a voting share or not, at least in the vast majority of cases. In the most exceptional cases, that matter might have to be determined by the court; but we would have gone a long way to avoid the need for that. Parallel amendments on this matter are also proposed regarding Clauses 651 and 654.
</p>

<a name="60516-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>Perhaps I may conclude with two further observations. First, companies can help themselves. Breakthrough has not been imposed on UK companies and we have left companies considerable flexibility as to the structure of their articles where they choose to opt in to the breakthrough regime. Secondly, we understand that the majority of UK companies falling within the scope of the takeovers directive have only one class of share, which generally has voting rights. Such shares will be caught by the breakthrough provisions and by the definition that we propose. I beg to move.

&quot;(2A)   The court will have the power to sanction a compromise or arrangement under subsection (2) notwithstanding any defect in the constitution of any class, provided that the court is satisfied that such defect has not affected the fairness of the compromise or arrangement.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_245"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we return to a matter that we debated in Grand Committee; namely, the ability of the courts to exercise discretion in terms of sanctioning schemes of arrangements. The purpose of the amendment is to grant that discretion to the court even if the relevant classes have not beeen correctly constituted, provided that the fairness of the scheme is not affected in any way. The amendment also seeks to dispense with the requirement that a majority in number of the creditors or members must agree to a scheme of arrangement for it to be binding.
</p>

<a name="60516-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>The Law Society advised us that the amendment to Section 425 of the Companies Act on the lines recommended by the Company Law Review would enable the court to sanction a scheme of arrangement <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_217"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 217</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

notwithstanding a technical defect in the constitution of classes, provided that the defect would not affect the fairness of the arrangement. We took note of the comments made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, in Grand Committee, and the proposed new arrangement would allow the court to sanction the scheme only where the court was satisfied that the defect did not affect the fairness of the scheme&#151;that is, if it was only a technical defect.
</p>

<a name="60516-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>In addition, we are pressing for the removal of the requirement for the approval of a scheme by a majority in number of those voting, as well as three-quarters by value. The majority in number test is not, as far as I am aware, contained anywhere else in company law and there is no special reason why such protection should be required for schemes of arrangement, but not for other corporate transactions. Indeed, the majority in number, focusing on a majority of registered holders is an anachronism, now that most retail holders hold through the CREST nominees, where one registered holder may represent many thousands of beneficial owners. It is also open to abuse by shareholders who could subdivide their holding through a number of nominee companies. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_246"></a>
<a name="60516-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, as the noble Lord said, there are two parts to the amendment. The part that he has just referred to would dispense with the requirement that a majority in number of the creditors or members must vote in favour of a scheme for it to be binding. The noble Lord&#039;s amendment provides that it would be enough if three-quarters by value did so. The Company Law Review observed that that would mean that larger creditors and members could impose their will unfairly on smaller creditors and shareholders. Protection would be removed by this part of the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60516-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>It could be said, &quot;Well, we could rely upon the court&#039;s discretion to protect those members&quot;. That is not a satisfactory answer&#151;why should the court have a better view of the interests of those persons than they have themselves? So, in principle, I could not accept the amendment. The noble Lord tempts us by painting a picture of abuse taking place, with people splitting their shareholdings up into a series of nominee companies. It may be that he has evidence that that takes place; if so, it is not evidence that has reached me and I note that the noble Lord shakes his head&#151;so it seems that he does not have evidence of that, either. That theoretical possibility is not a good enough reason to do away with the protection which this provides.
</p>

<a name="60516-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>I turn now to the second part of the amendment. We have some doubts as to whether this is really necessary. As the noble Lord has made clear, the point is to allow the courts to approve a scheme of arrangement even if relevant classes have not been correctly constituted, provided&#151;and this is an important condition&#151;that the fairness of the scheme is not affected.
</p>

<a name="60516-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>Companies have been given quite a lot of guidance to make sure that the problem does not arise. The courts have issued a practice statement in 2002 <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_218"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 218</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reminding companies for example that, in case of doubt, they should take all reasonable steps to notify any person who may be affected by the scheme, and requiring them to identify any issues as to composition of classes at an early stage of the court procedure. Those steps should already prevent most of the problems of wasted time and effort that the noble Lord&#039;s amendments are targeted at. Having said that, we are not convinced that the amendment is necessary in practice, or that it would serve a useful purpose. But if the noble Lord will not press his amendment now we will discuss the question of the court&#039;s discretion further with interested parties to see if there are practical difficulties that such an amendment could address. That is as far as I can go in relation to that part of the amendment today.

These amendments relate to other enactments beyond the Companies Acts which confer functions on the registrar. Three of the amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 483E, 483F and 487G&#151;make no real change of substance but are designed to introduce a little more clarity. At the moment the provision of the functions of the registrar in Clause 682, at the start of Part 26, refers generally to &quot;other enactments&quot; but does not list those enactments. In Clause 739, at the end of this part of the Bill, a list is provided, but it is arguably unclear what the effect is of the list in respect of some individual provisions. It is also not entirely clear whether the Bill or the existing enactments should apply to matters already covered by existing enactments. The amendments clarify the position.

<a name="60516-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>Amendments Nos. 483G and 528 do, however, make a change of substance to one of those enactments&#151;the Limited Partnerships Act 1907. At the moment, enshrined in that Act is the provision that Companies House, when performing its functions, may only charge amounts varying from 2p to &#163;2. The effect is that it is uneconomic for the registrar to offer certain optional services in respect of Limited Partnerships to customers, even where they have a need and are more than willing to pay the legitimate costs of the service being provided; other, mandatory, services have to be provided at a loss. This is creating difficulties in practice. In removing the statutory caps, the amendments will allow Companies House to develop services to meet customer demand and to charge for them in the normal way under Clause 684 of the Bill.

</p>

<a name="60516-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>In looking at the drafting of these clauses, we have also unearthed a few small omissions and infelicities which the other amendments in this group correct. The Bill already includes provision in Clause 698 to ensure that public notice is given where certain documents are placed on the register. Amendment No. 487F ensures that similar notice must be given where such documents are removed; without this the story as seen by third parties could risk being misleading.

<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>Amendment No. 483L makes clear that the registrar need not give public notice before a company is actually incorporated.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_116"></a>Page 345, line 5, at end insert&#151;</p>

&quot;(   )   is a statutory auditor of a company,&quot;

<p><a name="st_267"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we now come to Clause 703, which concerns the allocation of unique identifiers. Amendment No. 484 would insert the statutory auditor into the list of people for whom the Secretary of State may make provision for the use of these identifiers.
</p>

<a name="60516-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>In Grand Committee, when I first raised this point, I said that it was something that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales was anxious about, but I am afraid that the reply given by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has done little to ease its nerves. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_117"></a>&quot;We do not think there is the same interest in finding a list of all the companies whose accounts have been audited by a particular firm. Even if there were, there is probably less scope for confusion between firms than for confusion between individuals with similar names&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28/3/06; col. GC 354.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>I am afraid that I think that that response in large measure misses the point that we were trying to make. Therefore, we have again tabled the amendment, which seeks to include in the Bill an enabling power to introduce unique identifiers for auditors in addition to directors. We acknowledge that unique identifiers for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_224"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 224</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

directors are to be introduced primarily to enable the registrar to distinguish between directors of a similar name, given that they can now opt to provide service addresses. However, we believe that these unique identifiers will also enable directors to track information filed about them on the record. If that is the case, in our assumption unique identifiers would also enable auditors to monitor the public record to pick up instances where they are falsely claimed to be the auditor of a company.
</p>

<a name="60516-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>The accountancy trade press claimed in September 2005 that it had been notified of more than 100 incidences of auditor identity where auditors&#039; names were erroneously used to legitimise bogus company accounts. Auditors will often become aware of such fraudulent filings only when approached by credit agencies to explain discrepancies in the accounts that they have allegedly audited; for example, where the accounts do not balance or subsidiaries do not exist. This could lead to damaged reputations for auditors and also to fraudulent filings going unnoticed, as it is currently not possible for auditors to check the register for filings in their name.
</p>

<a name="60516-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>We understand that in response to this problem Companies House has committed to improving its online filing security with electronic passwords and the introduction of PROOF&#151;a protected online filing service that aims to reduce the possibility of fraud&#151;in order to crack down on auditor identity theft, among other things. However, even if such systems were introduced for online filings by auditors, electronic security is not always able to stay one step ahead of the fraudsters. For example, we are told by the institute that it is aware of at least one case of a fraudulent record falsely claiming an individual as a director of a company that was filed using what is supposed to be secure electronic filing.
</p>

<a name="60516-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>According to the accountancy trade press, the Metropolitan Police have advised businesses not to rely on Companies House records when determining whether to issue goods on credit. We think that that is unacceptable, and so anything that we can do to improve the security of the register would be beneficial. Therefore, we argue that a system enabling auditors to see whether they have been fraudulently cited&#151;akin to &quot;Monitor&quot;, the monitoring system in place for companies, which results in an e-mail alert when filings are made&#151;would be beneficial. At this stage, we seek only an enabling power by this amendment, and we propose that a regulatory impact assessment should be conducted before implementation to ensure that the potential benefits outweigh the costs.
</p>

<a name="60516-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>That was rejected by the Government in Committee on the basis that they,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_118"></a>&quot;do not think that allocating a number to every registered audit firm would be particularly helpful. It is unlikely to make it any easier to root out false claims that a particular firm has audited a company&#039;s accounts. The idea is that unique identifiers will be available to the public; they will not be like some authentication code or password used in electronic communications&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28/3/06; col. GC 355-56.]</p>

</p>

<a name="60516-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>However, as I have already mentioned, improvements in the security of online filing will always be vulnerable to fraud and so such security systems alone will not solve this issue. We think that monitoring should therefore be available, in addition to improvements to such security systems, and so it would not matter that such unique identifiers were available to the public.
</p>

<a name="60516-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>If the Government decide that unique identifiers should not be allocated to auditors, as our amendment proposes, we would, as a fallback position, suggest that the registrar be obliged to maintain the legal name of the audit firm as a searchable field on the record. Any audit firm could then, if it so wished, search Companies House records to gain a complete list of audits credited to it on the record and could cross-check for any areas of concern. I emphasise that at this stage we seek only to provide the ability for the Secretary of State to set up a unique system of identifiers for auditors, perhaps at some date in the future. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_268"></a>
<a name="60516-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, Clause 703 provides that the Secretary of State may make regulations so that a unique identifier can be allocated to anyone who is a director of a company, or a secretary of a public company, or the UK representative of an overseas company. It will help the system for protecting directors&#039; home addresses and it will prevent third parties confusing different individuals with the same name or being confused by different names being used by a single director.
</p>

<a name="60516-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>We do not intend that unique identifiers should be allocated to statutory auditors for filing purposes; nor do we believe that it is justified. I listened carefully to the noble Lord&#039;s presentation on this matter. We are aware of the concern that the name of a registered audit firm might be fraudulently added to a company&#039;s accounts. Companies should not claim to have been audited by a particular firm if that is not the case. Such a false statement would be an offence, and we believe that this is a sufficient protection.
</p>

<a name="60516-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>Unlike in the case of directors&#039; names, the problem is not one of confusing people with the same name. While there are many John Smiths, different audit firms do not share the same name. So if a company claims that it has been audited by, say, KPMG, it should be fairly easy to demonstrate that it has not without needing a unique identification number.
</p>

<a name="60516-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>I understand that firms may also be concerned to detect when a company takes their name in vain. This would not require allocation of a unique identification number but, rather, a facility to search on the basis of the audit firm&#039;s name on the register at Companies House. Indeed, if it had a unique identification number and that search facility were available, I suspect that the firm would almost certainly search the number as well as the name, so I do not see that the number adds anything. This could involve considerable expense and we would need to explore whether there was a problem on a scale to justify that expense. In any case, it would certainly not require primary legislation.

<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>I appreciate that there is concern about companies falsely claiming to have been audited by certain audit firms but, for the reasons that I have set out, I do not think that allocating unique identifiers to audit firms would do anything to resolve the problem.

<a name="60516-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, and he has clearly thought about this issue. I have two things to say. First, this was only a proposal for enabling legislation; we were not suggesting that it should happen. It would just give the Secretary of State another arrow in his quiver, so to speak. I think that the Minister was moving towards the fallback position of encouraging Companies House to have the legal name of the audit firm as a searchable record. We felt that that was a good fallback position and probably less complicated, and possibly less expensive, than a unique identifier.
</p>

<a name="60516-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>It would be helpful if the Minister could do all that he can to assuage the concerns of the audit profession by encouraging Companies House to introduce that searchable field facility, which presumably can be done at relatively little cost, and that would probably solve the problem.

<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>During our debate last week about the new scheme for protecting directors&#039; residential addresses, my noble friend Lord Sainsbury explained that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_227"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 227</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government intended to lay an amendment that would provide a power to make regulations specifying circumstances in which a director&#039;s&#151;or indeed anyone&#039;s&#151;address may be removed from the public record. These amendments fulfil that promise.
</p>

<a name="60516-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>Under the new scheme introduced by our earlier amendments, a new director&#039;s home address will be protected. But there will continue to be an historic record with the home addresses of most of those who are directors when the Bill comes into force&#151;and indeed of those who have previously been directors.
</p>

<a name="60516-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>In the vast majority of cases, removing an address from the record held by Companies House would serve little purpose: once an address has been placed on the public record, it immediately becomes widely available through a myriad of secondary sources. What has once been published cannot be made secret. The genie cannot be put back in the bottle. Nevertheless, we do recognise that there may be circumstances in which the continued appearance of a person&#039;s address on the public record held by Companies House is undesirable, possibly because it puts those who live there at serious risk. In reality this is only likely if, for some reason, the address is not also easily available elsewhere from other sources. On the other hand, those at risk are not only directors. For example, former directors and the families of deceased directors may be equally at risk. Therefore the amendments provide power to specify who may apply for their address to be taken off the public record.
</p>

<a name="60516-30_para5"></a>

circumstances indeed for the registrar to remove material unless there has first been a court order to that effect.
</p>

<a name="60516-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>Our debate in Committee there was a good degree of consensus between us that a power for the registrar to remove material without court order could well be useful, but that if so there would need to be strict limits and controls built into it. Amendment No. 487E therefore introduces a power for the Secretary of State to make regulations to set out a regime on these lines.
</p>

<a name="60516-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>We have ensured that certain of the safeguards which were mentioned are set out in the primary legislation itself. For example, the new clause makes clear that the registrar must only remove information on application, and that the regulations will require the registrar to remove the material where the application is in order and there are no objections to it. In other words, we have minimised the scope for the registrar to exercise discretion or make judgments, particularly judgments between individuals with competing claims. If there is an objection, the remedy will be to apply to the court.
</p>

<a name="60516-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>But the clause does not attempt to set out all the new details of the new scheme. It is a power, and other elements of the system&#151;for example the matters covered in broad terms under subsection (2)&#151;will be set out in the secondary legislation. I can assure the House that there will be full and public consultation on the precise composition of the regulations before they are made.
</p>

<a name="60516-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>Finally, for completeness, I should mention Amendment No. 487B, which is consequential on the new scheme and ensures that an application under it does not in itself constitute a publishable document; and Amendment No. 487D, which removes what would now be a misleading statement in the Bill suggesting that the new non-court process did not exist.

<a name="amdtpar_1"></a>&quot;(2)   Such agreement may be valid for a maximum of twelve months.&quot;

<p><a name="st_287"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to rise to speak to Amendment No. 490 which concerns paragraph 9 of Part 4 of Schedule 6.
</p>

<a name="60516-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>Part 4 of Schedule 6 enables companies to communicate electronically with their shareholders where shareholders have given their consent. But there appears to be no time limit to the consent once given.
</p>

<a name="60516-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, made clear during our debates that the electronic communication provisions enable companies to save a considerable sum of money. However, there is also the potential for problems caused by the failure of an individual member to understand properly what he or she is being asked to accept, and then being deemed to have agreed under paragraph 10.
</p>

<a name="60516-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>There was some confusion when this amendment was tabled in Grand Committee. It was originally tabled with an amendment that made it read &quot;minimum&quot; instead of &quot;maximum&quot;. This was corrected before the Committee sat, but I fear too late for the changes to reach the Minister as his speaking note addressed the minimum rather than the maximum that we intended. The noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_133"></a>&quot;I do not see the value of requiring a minimum period of commitment to receiving company documents by means of a website. Why should a member who agrees to use the web not be able to change his mind?&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 30/3/06; col. GC 378.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>Absolutely: that is precisely the point. I am sorry that we caused confusion with our wrong tabling in the first place.
</p>

<a name="60516-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>We have therefore re-tabled this amendment for the same reasons that we did in Committee. The amendment seeks to cap any agreement between a company and a member to a maximum of 12 months. When this period expires the company would have to negotiate another agreement for the next year. We do not think that it is unreasonable to require companies to do this, given the savings they will make by using communication via a website in the event of member agreement. The main benefit from this will be to protect members who unwittingly agree to use the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_232"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 232</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

website for communication. They will then be given an opportunity to rescind their decision, while those who wish to continue with such an agreement can easily continue to do so. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_288"></a>
<a name="60516-31_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for tabling this amendment again so that I may now give him the right answer to address his concerns. When the noble Lord first laid his amendment at Grand Committee seeking to provide that agreements under paragraph 9 should be valid for a minimum of twelve months, we had thought the objective might be about providing a degree of certainty to businesses investing in web technology upgrades. However, the amendment clearly does the opposite in limiting the period of the agreement to a maximum of 12 months.
</p>

<a name="60516-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>I do not see the value in imposing a maximum period for agreements to receiving company documents by means of a website. This seems unduly burdensome&#151;a case of minor silver-plating rather than gold-plating, but nevertheless burdensome&#151;and an unnecessary hurdle when we are seeking to facilitate the use of electronic communications. The other point is that people are not locked into these agreements. If someone changes his or her mind, it is clear that he or she can withdraw at any time. In any event, members and debenture holders always have the right under Clause 762 to request that a document or information received otherwise than in hard copy form be sent to them in hard copy.
</p>

<a name="60516-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>Furthermore, a company must, under paragraph 13 of Schedule 6, notify an intended recipient of new documents posted on the website. If he has provided no e-mail address, then the company will, in effect, be obliged to send such notification in hard copy form by post, thus reminding the recipient of the website arrangement in place.
</p>

<a name="60516-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>We think that the communications clauses and schedules together provide adequate protection for members and other intended recipients who may not have easy access to the internet or to e-mail. I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord will not press his amendment.

I take at least half the blame, having got the wrong amendment down in the first place. I understand the wish we share to facilitate electronic communications as a means of saving money. That is a perfectly clear and sensible way to proceed. The noble Lord made a number of points&#151;for example, that a member can withdraw at any time and that powers exist under Clause 762. I understand that. Is it likely that those facts will be shown on the website? Ordinary shareholders coming to the website will not be aware of the privileges and powers that exist for them under Clause 762. It would be helpful if the website stated, &quot;If you want this in hard copy, you may apply for it&quot;. Is it part of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_42"></a><br>
&quot;REQUIREMENT OF AUTHENTICATION

<br>
(1)   This section applies in relation to the authentication of a document or information sent or supplied by a person to a company.


<br>
(2)   A document or information sent or supplied in hard copy form is sufficiently authenticated if it is signed by the person sending or supplying it.


<br>
(3)   A document or information sent or supplied in electronic form is sufficiently authenticated&#151;


<br>
(a)   if the identity of the sender is confirmed in a manner specified by the company, or


<br>
(b)   where no such manner has been specified by the company, if the communication contains or is accompanied by a statement of the identity of the sender and the company has no reason to doubt the truth of that statement.


<br>
(4)   Where a document or information is sent or supplied by one person on behalf of another, nothing in this section affects any provision of the company&#039;s articles under which the company may require reasonable evidence of the authority of the former to act on behalf of the latter.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_293"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 490A I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 490B and 490C. These amendments seek to address the concerns raised by the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord Sharman, in Grand Committee, relating to two important aspects of the company communications provisions of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60516-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>Amendment No. 490A deals with the authentication of documents by one person on another&#039;s behalf. It makes clear that companies can require proof of authority to act and, in doing so, puts beyond doubt that authentication of documents by one person on another&#039;s behalf is permitted. Amendment No. 490B deals with deemed delivery of website communications and makes additional provision for opting out of default rules about deemed delivery. Amendment No. 490C is a consequential amendment. Clause 765 is what currently deals with deemed delivery. We are <br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(a)   the document or information is sent by post (whether in hard copy or electronic form) to an address in the United Kingdom, and

(b)   the company is able to show that it was properly addressed, prepaid and posted,

(3)   Where&#151;


<br>
(a)   the document or information is sent or supplied by electronic means, and


<br>
(b)   the company is able to show that it was properly addressed,

it is deemed to have been received by the intended recipient 48 hours after it was sent.


<br>
(4)   Where the document or information is sent or supplied by means of a website, it is deemed to have been received by the intended recipient&#151;


<br>
(a)   when the material was first made available on the website, or


<br>
(b)   if later, when the recipient received (or is deemed to have received) notice of the fact that the material was available on the website.


<br>
(5)   In calculating a period of hours for the purposes of this section, no account shall be taken of any part of a day that is not a working day.


<br>
(6)   This section has effect subject to&#151;


<br>
(a)   any contrary provision of the Companies Acts;


<br>
(b)   in its application to documents or information sent or supplied by a company to its members, any contrary provision of the company&#039;s articles;

<p><a name="st_310"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 511A proposes a small amendment to paragraph 9 in Schedule 11.
</p>

<a name="60516-33_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a>In Grand Committee we debated the issue covered by this amendment; namely, the practical issues that arise in order that overseas audit experience may qualify as part of the requisite practical training for an auditor under Schedule 11. Paragraph 9 applies to all practical training, but I would like to tease out the significance of the paragraph by reference to overseas audit training. Put simply, paragraph 9 allows one of the UK recognised supervisory bodies to count overseas training by members of an overseas body if the UK body has approved them to carry out the training. In approving them, the UK body has to be satisfied, in the light of undertakings and the local supervision arrangements, that they will provide adequate training&#151;that is, the paragraph is predicated on approval before the provision of the training.

</p>

<a name="60516-33_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>adequate training, so approval may be granted in arrear.
</p>

<a name="60516-33_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a>The practical issue that this amendment addresses is that it is not always possible to recognise the training on an <i>ex ante</i> basis. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has said that it receives a small number of applications each year for the approval for individuals who find that they need to rely on the overseas component of their qualification period to satisfy the rules. At present, the institute cannot do so because it cannot approve such training <i>ex post</i>.
</p>

<a name="60516-33_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a>The amendment would not diminish the quality of training that an individual received before he was entitled to practise as an auditor, but it would make it easier for all relevant training to be validated. The alternative to this is a costly network of approved overseas training organisations set up by each RSB. I beg to move.

<a name="60516-33_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the eighth company law directive on auditing sets out clear requirements for practical training in Article 10. It requires that member states ensure that all training is carried out by persons,

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 238</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60516-33_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>This requirement is not new and reflects the practical training provisions of the 1984 eighth directive, which the 1989 Act implemented.
</p>

<a name="60516-33_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>Paragraph 9 of Schedule 11 reflects these requirements and, indeed, is a restatement of the provisions in the 1989 Act. It requires persons who wish to qualify as a statutory auditor to carry out at least three years&#039; practical training under supervision of persons approved by the body offering the qualification.
</p>

<a name="60516-33_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>In practice, these requirements are met through the recognised qualifying bodies&#151;those professional bodies that offer audit qualifications&#151;operating a system of approved training offices. This means that those firms which are hosting practical training experience for audit students have provided guarantees to the qualifying body on the standard of training and supervision being provided. That is important. The practical training requirement for auditors is a vital part of their professional development, providing them with a range and depth of technical experience as well as developing their technical, commercial and ethical awareness skills. It is vital to the quality of the future stock of UK auditors that the practical training that auditors receive is structured, supervised and up to date.
</p>

<a name="60516-33_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>In considering whether a firm is suitable to provide adequate training, a number of criteria are considered, including the firm-wide procedures, the number of audit clients, the number of statutory auditors in the firm, the provision of training records, the setting of competencies and the number of assessments carried out on individuals. Although this amendment may be aimed at alleviating a practical difficulty for a handful of individuals it is not, in practice, the small matter that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, indicated. It runs a coach and horses through the UK qualifying system and would allow the retrospective approval of both overseas and UK practical training. That would fundamentally undermine the framework I have just described, which exists to ensure the quality of UK audit qualifications.

</p>

<a name="60516-33_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>I find it difficult to see how retrospective approval would operate in assessing the adequacy of firms&#039; training and supervision arrangements, or their suitability for training individuals, since&#151;after a period of time has elapsed&#151;records may not have been kept, changes in audit clients will have taken place, firm-wide systems may have changed and staff will have left. That is likely to mean that adequate guarantees could not be assured, in the spirit of the directive. I understand the practical issue for those relatively few people operating overseas, but on balance this is not the right way to go. I urge the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

</p>




<p><a name="st_314"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 511AA I shall also speak to the three other amendments in this group. With these amendments we return to an area we discussed in Committee, namely the exciting area of the reciprocal authorisation of auditors. I thank the Minister for his letter of 25 April following our Committee debate.
</p>

<a name="60516-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>The amendments address whether the Secretary of State&#039;s powers of recognition of overseas qualifications under Clause 815&#151;which, we understand, would in practice be exercised by the Professional Oversight Board for Accountancy&#151;would have to be restricted either to reciprocal treatment for the professional qualification as a whole or to the ability to audit. I understand that Article 44 of the eighth directive requires the Secretary of State to have regard to reciprocity only in respect of registered foreign auditors, not foreign qualifications. Why then does Clause 815(4)(b) indicate that the Secretary of State has to be satisfied in respect of professional qualification reciprocity?
</p>

<a name="60516-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>Our amendments would ensure that the oversight board concerned itself with the reciprocal treatment of auditors, not the much bigger territory of professional qualifications. Behind this lies a desire by the Institute of Chartered Accountants&#151;and, doubtless, other relevant bodies&#151;to see more recognition of overseas qualifications, because that is the route to greater overseas recognition of UK auditors. The larger professional accountancy firms, not just the big four, send some of their partners to overseas territories and will receive overseas-trained partners into the UK. That is what global businesses do; audit firms are no exception. If we do not recognise overseas qualifications because we make the test too hard, our own auditors will be unable to practise overseas and we will have to deny practising rights to overseas auditors.
</p>

<a name="60516-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>Alongside that is the issue of transparency and the speed with which the approval process works. Amendment No. 511D&#151;to which the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, will speak in the next group&#151;could provide greater transparency through the use of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Yet speed will remain an issue, as I am advised that in the 17 years since the 1989 legislation was introduced those reciprocal recognition powers have been used only <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_240"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 240</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

twice. Only two overseas bodies have been approved. Will the Minister say something about the need to improve the recognition process?
</p>

<a name="60516-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>If Clause 815 is passed unamended, the fear is that the reciprocity formulation will delay matters even further. There is a universe of non-EU overseas auditor qualifications extending considerably beyond Canada and Australia, which have the two that have already been approved. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_315"></a>
<a name="60516-34_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sharman: </b>   My Lords, I rise to support the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment. It may interest the House to know that 11 years of my life have been spent practising overseas. That is difficult and almost impossible where there is no reciprocity. Some of my friends wonder how I ever managed to learn Dutch; you have to take tests in Dutch and Dutch law to get a licence in the Netherlands, because there is no reciprocity. That gives serious difficulty, as that language is almost impossible to learn&#151;yet it was unnecessary for me to have a knowledge of the Dutch language to do my work. I was dealing exclusively there with international businesses that worked the whole time in English; indeed, all their Dutch staff demanded that they did so. This issue of reciprocity is critical, yet it is not moving. There is stalemate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_316"></a>
<a name="60516-34_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, it may be helpful if I begin by explaining how Clause 815 works in practice. In doing so, I hope to address the concerns that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, have raised.
</p>

<a name="60516-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>The eighth company directive, on auditing, allows UK authorities to approve an auditor from a third country only if there is reciprocal approval in relation to auditors operating in that country. Clause 815 is drafted to meet that obligation and requires the Secretary of State to be satisfied as to the matters it sets out on the basis of whether there is comparable treatment.
</p>

<a name="60516-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>Clause 815 does not allow the Secretary of State to approve the qualifications of individual auditors from third countries on a case-by-case basis. It allows only the collective approval of qualifications. Under subsection (1)(a) he may collectively approve the qualifications of all auditors practising in a specified country, while under subsection (1)(b) he may collectively approve only specified qualifications held in the specified country. In either case, it is important to emphasise that subsection (3) requires the Secretary of State to be satisfied that the level of professional competence assured by foreign qualifications will be equivalent to that assured by UK audit qualifications.
</p>

<a name="60516-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_514"></a>Subsection (1)(b) is essential to the recognition of auditors who hold a specific professional qualification from a foreign country that meets our standards, but where&#151;this is particularly relevant for countries with a federal structure&#151;other qualifications recognised under law there do not meet our standards. I hope this explanation clarifies that subsection (1)(a) and (b) represents two limbs of the same power. Indeed, having the two limbs should help the process of reciprocity. The exercise of the power under either <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_241"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 241</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

limb needs to be compatible with the directive&#039;s requirements; the test of comparable treatment must thus apply to both limbs.
</p>

<a name="60516-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a>The amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, would impose a different test for the limb in subsection (1)(b) that would not meet the directive&#039;s requirements. Furthermore, that would produce the odd result that the Secretary of State must apply different tests when exercising the same power&#151;one if recognising all the qualifications in a country, but another if recognising only one particular qualification. I cannot see the logic in such a distinction.
</p>

<a name="60516-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>I have no data to hand on the specific issue of the speed at which reciprocity and recognition are going ahead, but in the light of the comments made it is certainly a matter that we will look into discussing urgently with officials, to try to understand what roadblocks there may be. I share the view that has been expressed from all Benches about their importance in a global marketplace, for I have spent time abroad in an accountancy firm myself&#151;although not as an auditor&#151;and understand the importance of having quality on a wide front.
</p>




<p><a name="st_317"></a>
<a name="60516-34_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. He said that my amendment would mean that subsection (1)(b) would not meet the directive&#039;s requirements. Either I have not understood what the Institute of Chartered Accountants has said to me, or it has not understood the requirements. Clearly I will need to clarify that, so I will do so and return to this at Third Reading if necessary. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_319"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 511D. The purpose behind these amendments is to instil a deal of transparency into how the major accounting firms do their work. The public oversight body and its subsidiary organs, which consider audit quality in firms, do not publish individual reports. A composite report is published annually, which deals with the industry overall. It is averaged, because it takes the larger firms, the smaller firms and the medium-sized firms. Although there is some segregation, it is not a particularly useful document.

effectiveness of the internal audit process. In so doing, it has been relatively easy for them to perform a review themselves or to go outside the body and commission a review from a third party. However, they have no means to access detailed information about the performance of their external auditors in the work of auditing. It is extremely important, from the point of view of the public interest, that such information be available. That is the purpose of Amendment No. 511D. The purpose of Amendment No. 511B is to create a level playing field for the work of the independent supervisor over the Comptroller and Auditor-General. I beg to move.

<a name="60516-35_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, I support the amendments, to which our names are attached. The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, has explained the specific reasons why it would be right for the Freedom of Information Act to apply to the public oversight board and, by extension, to the independent supervisor. There is also a wider reason, which is that when bodies are set up to carry out public functions, it is right and proper that the equivalent freedom of information requirements apply to them and are not avoided by public functions being transferred to bodies in the way set out in the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_321"></a>
<a name="60516-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the Professional Oversight Board is an operating body of the Financial Reporting Council and is currently responsible for exercising the Secretary of State&#039;s functions in relation to auditors delegated to it under the 1989 Act. The Government expect that the role of independent supervisor of the Comptroller and Auditor-General will also be carried out by the Professional Oversight Board. The oversight board is accountable&#151;and will report annually&#151;to the Secretary of State and, through him, to Parliament for the exercise of all functions that may be delegated to it under powers in this part and corresponding powers in existing legislation.
</p>

<a name="60516-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>As I said in Committee, the Government recognise that this is an important issue, to which I am willing to give careful consideration. However, the Bill should not determine the Professional Oversight Board&#039;s status under the Freedom of Information Act.
</p>

<a name="60516-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>The inclusion of the oversight board in the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act is an issue that requires careful consideration and public consultation, for a number of important reasons. As noble Lords have pointed out, the activities of the oversight board go beyond the scope of this part of the Bill and any delegation order under it. Specifically, the oversight board oversees the activity and publishes the annual report of the Audit Inspection Unit&#151;a new independent inspection unit that reports to the oversight board and which was set up following the Government&#039;s review of the regulatory regime of the accountancy profession in 2003.
</p>

<a name="60516-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>In Committee, the noble Baroness argued that those reports should be made public in the interests of transparency and decision-usefulness for audit committees. That is a subject worthy of debate and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_243"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 243</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I have listened carefully to the noble Baroness and to the noble Lord, Lord Sharman. However, there are also very good reasons why the steering group that oversaw the implementation of recommendations from the review of the regulatory regime of the accountancy profession felt that publication of the AIU&#039;s reports on individual audits or auditors would be detrimental to the inspection programme&#151;which is, after all, designed to improve firms&#039; practices and internal processes through constructive dialogue, rather than an adversarial approach&#151;and therefore not in the public interest. There are potentially significant drawbacks to extending the level of public reporting by the AIU to include reporting on individual firms and audits, and those drawbacks must be balanced against the calls for more transparency.

</p>

<a name="60516-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>We run the risk of reports becoming more legalistic, as the burden of proof required before matters can be made public would arguably increase. The inspection process would become more adversarial: focused on arguments about the finer points of what amounts to compliance, rather than a constructive dialogue focused on best practice. Ultimately there is a real risk that such an approach would drive the inspection regime towards a tick-box approach to compliance. That would be undesirable and could have a detrimental effect on both transparency and audit quality.
</p>

<a name="60516-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a>Furthermore, as a result, there is a risk that public reports might become anodyne and thus of little or no real value to audit committees. I guess that that is a bit like engagement letters, which we discussed the other night.

</p>

<a name="60516-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a>There is also the risk that audit firms will focus more on challenging points rather than focusing their efforts where we want them to, addressing underlying quality issues.
</p>

<a name="60516-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_528"></a>As I said, there is an important debate to be had on this, and the oversight board is currently reviewing its approach to publication, having regard to practices in other countries with a view to consulting more widely later this year. In any case, the amendments before us would not necessarily result in publication of individual reports. There are a number of exceptions under the Freedom of Information Act that would probably apply with respect to much of the information contained in AIU reports.
</p>

<a name="60516-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>As I said in Committee, the Government are currently building up evidence on how freedom of information has impacted on the bodies that meet the existing criteria, with a view to extending designation <br>&nbsp;<br>

to further bodies. We believe that that is the appropriate context in which to consider the position of the Professional Oversight Board with respect to inclusion within the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. That should, however, remain completely separate to the passage of the Bill. As I said, the oversight board is reviewing its approach to publication of AIU reports with a view to consulting more widely later this year.
</p>

<a name="60516-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a>I hope that, on the basis of what I have said, the noble Lord will feel able not to press the amendment. This is an important issue; there is a way to address it; but it is not the manner suggested by the amendments.

<p><a name="st_324"></a>
<a name="60516-35_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sharman: </b>   My Lords, I am quite willing to accept that the solution may not be as the amendments are framed. I was more than a little astonished by the Minister arguing that transparency, when it affects the detail of how an auditor is performing, is a bad thing. I believe that transparency is the only way in which any semblance of confidence can be restored, where it has been lost. We must face up to the fact that there have been significant questions about the quality of auditing in this country. The way to put it right is to be transparent about how good or bad it is. I will, in a moment, withdraw the amendment, but I ask that we look in some detail and with some urgency at how the purpose behind the amendments can be achieved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_325"></a>
<a name="60516-35_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, before the noble Lord withdraws the amendment, yes, we should look with some urgency at this. A process is under way already, but I am happy to engage in discussions outside the Chamber to see what more might be done. On the issue of transparency, I entirely agree with transparency for the profession as a whole and about thematic issues that face the profession. That is absolutely right. The question is the balance of transparency versus reports on individual firms and what that may entail. That issue needs particular consideration.

include requirements on accounts and audit. In Grand Committee, the Minister said that the order under Clause 822 was the right place for the accounts requirements rather than a special clause. We are inclined to agree with that, but we find it a little strange that, on this fundamental area of financial accountability, the Bill is completely silent. It is unusual to find a body being created without any explicit financial accountability arrangements. Paragraph (a) of my amendment states that an order under Clause 822 must include a requirement relating to the preparation and publication of financial statements.

I have already made a commitment, in the debate in Committee, to the effect that such requirements will be included in any order made under this clause. Clause 822(5) makes it clear that these requirements can be included in the order. I am happy to confirm that the Secretary of State will do so.

There appeared to be none. So we also tabled a clause stand part debate and received no clearer answer then.

<a name="60516-36_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I am rather conscious of the fact that on the previous occasion when we debated shareholders&#039; engagement, we were all saying exactly the reverse.

a voluntary scheme as opposed to the taking of powers.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_549"></a>Noble Lords are quite right that the clause does not specify exactly how the power would be exercised, and therefore, if it is exercised, what the costs would be. It is precisely to address these complexities that we are proposing a broad and flexible enabling power.
</p>

<a name="60516-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_550"></a>Taking a power of this scope and flexibility of course requires an assurance that it will be exercised proportionately and appropriately. We have given this assurance. We have been very clear that the exercise of the power will be subject to further consultation as well as a cost/benefit analysis. If the Government were to exercise the power, they would shape the provisions to make sure that the regime is underpinned by the commercially logical foundation identified and fully justified on the balance of costs and benefits.
</p>

<a name="60516-36_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_551"></a>Noble Lords also commented on the importance of allowing time to see whether the voluntary approach will continue to yield more disclosure. I absolutely agree with this. This is why we are introducing an enabling power. The approach we adopt will take the evolution of market practice into account. We would like to see best practice continue to drive this improvement on its own. As noble Lords correctly noted in Committee, there is a growing trend domestically and internationally towards disclosure of voting. The mere existence of the enabling power may encourage institutional investors to adopt best practice, but if some institutional investors are reticent, it is right to consider the use of this power to bring the laggards up to the level of the better performers.
</p>

<a name="60516-36_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_552"></a>Noble Lords also expressed concern that mandatory disclosure of voting information could result in the production of mechanistic disclosures, including,

<a name="60516-36_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_554"></a>The Government have said they would introduce a mandatory disclosure regime only where the benefits exceeded the costs. I can assure noble Lords that this analysis would consider the value of the information to be disclosed. The increasing trend towards voluntary disclosures suggests that more institutional investors recognise their clients&#039; right to this information and that its disclosure is of benefit to clients.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-36_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_557"></a>A key objective is enhancing shareholder engagement. A power to compel institutional investors to disclose to their end beneficiaries how they vote on their behalf is surely crucial to enhancing shareholder engagement, particularly if the institutional investors fail to provide appropriate levels of transparency on their own. I am sure noble Lords want institutional investors to be accountable both for governance decisions they make on behalf of end beneficiaries and for managing transparently the conflicts of interest to which these decisions might give rise.
</p>

<a name="60516-36_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_558"></a>If noble Lords believe that individual investors are entitled to know what is being done with the shares that they beneficially own, and that this disclosure is beneficial, then they should support this clause. Moreover, this clause should also be supported by those who argue for a voluntary disclosure regime. The Government are committed to examining this and, if it is the better solution, it will be preferred to a mandatory regime. The choice with this clause is not between voluntary and mandatory approaches, but whether the Government should have effective backup. In the event that the voluntary approach does not deliver, we would have no lever to address the problem. The commitment to consultation, rigorous cost/benefit analysis and affirmative approval of any regulations provides the assurance that any use of this power would be proportionate. I therefore hope that the noble Lord will agree to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_338"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 512A, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 512B, both of which amend Clause 866. They respond to very useful proposals put forward by the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord De Mauley, in Committee. I agreed to consider these as I thought the principles behind the proposals served positively to strengthen the clause. My officials have discussed the thinking further with the CBI and I hope the noble Lords will agree that the way we have drafted the amendments meets their points.

<a name="60516-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_562"></a>Amendment No. 512A makes it clear that information can be disclosed for the purpose of preliminary steps to enforcing rights and for alternative ways of resolving the dispute other than through commencing civil proceedings. For example, it can be used to enable use of information for investigation, the issuing of &quot;cease and desist&quot; letters to the person said to be committing a breach of intellectual property rights, or for an alternative dispute resolution procedure. There are benefits to both business and consumers in making it clear that information can be disclosed for such preliminary steps. For example, a holder of intellectual property rights might need information in relation to previous breaches by a trader to show a pattern of behaviour. A consumer might need information from a test report showing that a product is unsafe in pursuing a claim with a trader or through an ombudsman scheme.
</p>

<a name="60516-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_563"></a>Amendment No. 512B allows information disclosed under this clause to be used for all purposes covered by the clause. For example, this will make it unnecessary for an individual or business to go back to the public authority which disclosed the information to seek further permission if he intends to start proceedings. I beg to move.

&quot;CONTINUITY OF THE LAW

<br>
(1)   This section applies where any provision of this Act re-enacts (with or without modification) an enactment repealed by this Act.


<br>
(2)   The repeal and re-enactment does not affect the continuity of the law.


<br>
(3)   Anything done (including subordinate legislation made), or having effect as if done, under or for the purposes of the repealed provision that could have been done under or for the purposes of the corresponding provision of this Act, if in force or effective immediately before the commencement of that corresponding provision, has effect thereafter as if done under or for the purposes of that corresponding provision.


<br>
(4)   Any reference (express or implied) in this Act or any other enactment, instrument or document to a provision of this Act shall be construed (so far as the context permits) as including, as respects times, circumstances or purposes in relation to which the corresponding repealed provision had effect, a reference to that corresponding provision.


<br>
(5)   Any reference (express or implied) in any enactment, instrument or document to a repealed provision shall be construed (so far as the context permits), as respects times, circumstances and purposes in relation to which the corresponding provision of this Act has effect, as being or (according to the context) including a reference to the corresponding provision of this Act.


<br>
(6)   This section has effect subject to any specific transitional provision or saving contained in this Act.


<br>
(7)   References in this section to this Act include subordinate legislation made under this Act.


<br>
(8)   In this section &quot;subordinate legislation&quot; has the same meaning as in the Interpretation Act 1978 (c. 30).&quot;</p>

<a name="column_252"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 252</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


<p>
<a name="stpa_609"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment introduces a new clause to follow Clause 881. It seeks to include a provision to ensure that things done in reliance on these provisions in the Companies Act 1985, which are repealed and replaced by the Bill, will continue to be legally effective.
</p>

<a name="60516-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_610"></a>Articles of association, company resolutions and contracts are all likely to refer to provisions of the Companies Act or to rely for their effect on the way in which those provisions work. Except where we intend a change, those articles, resolutions and contracts should continue to have effect, not only with old references converted into new but also with their legal effect capable of continuing, despite verbal differences between the old and the new.
</p>

<a name="60516-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_611"></a>This new clause applies automatically in all cases in which it is capable of applying. It is in addition to any more specific transitional provisions which may be included in the commencement orders by use of the power in the preceding Clause 881. It does not purport to be wholly comprehensive, but where it does apply it will avoid the need for equivalent provision to be made by possibly more than one order.
</p>

<a name="60516-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_612"></a>The same amendment was brought forward in Grand Committee, but our debate was coloured there by what I suspect may have been slightly at crossed purposes. I hope, with the explanation I have provided today, we can agree the provision. I beg to move.
</p>


<p><a name="st_344"></a>
<a name="60516-38_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I am not quite as happy as the Minister thought I might be. What we are concerned about is the question of the meshing of this piece of legislation with what went before. The Law Society still has some concerns about it. I wonder if it would be possible for the Minister, the Bill team and Government to consider whether we could have a schedule to the Bill which would consist of a table identifying which provisions in the Bill correspond to provisions being repealed for the purposes of this clause.
</p>

<a name="60516-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_613"></a>There is certainly a concern which I explained on our last day in Committee about how these all mesh together. I said then that the new clause appears to apply only when existing provisions are re-enacted with or without modification. It does not appear to cover the situation where an existing provision is simply repealed without being re-enacted. I also think some of these concerns continue to persist in the world at large. We share the Government&#039;s view that we are trying to make company law comprehensible and accessible. Some practitioners and the Law Society feel that a schedule with a table would help bring the whole thing together. I wonder if the Minister could comment further on the possibility of some such arrangement being made available.
</p>




<p><a name="st_345"></a>
<a name="60516-38_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, there are two parts to this: the general bit and then the transitional arrangements to cover any cases where one needs to give specific instructions as to what the transition should be. I would be delighted to write to the noble Lord with a more specific answer to his suggestion and, if necessary, hold further technical discussions.

If the Law Society is having difficulty in seeing how all this fits together, I think there is an issue here that we could all usefully address in the interests of UK plc. I hope the Minister will be able to ask the Bill team to consider this and maybe talk to the Law Society and practitioners.

</p>

<a name="60516-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_618"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the draft National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 2006 must be made by Order in Council following approval of the draft order by both Houses of Parliament. Section 22 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 enables a function of a Minister of the Crown to be transferred to the National Assembly for Wales upon receipt of this approval. That is why this short and, I hope, uncontentious order is before the House today. The Wales Office has worked closely with all relevant departments: the Department for Communities and Local Government&#151;formerly the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;the Department for Education and Skills and of course the National Assembly for Wales. Policy on these issues has been agreed by all parties in the Assembly.

First, the most significant transfer to be effected by this order is the transfer to the Assembly of those fire safety functions, which at present remain with the UK Government. The case for this transfer has its genesis in the making of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, which is a reform of all the current fire safety law that is contained in more than 100 separate pieces of fire safety legislation. The main substance of the RRO comes into force on 1 October 2006. The main emphasis of the reform will be towards fire prevention and a regime of fire risk assessment by the person responsible for their non-domestic premises, to identify, mitigate or remove any risk from fire to persons in or around the premises. The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 came into force in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_254"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 254</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Wales in November 2004. Matters relating to fire and rescue authorities in Wales were conferred on the National Assembly for Wales by that Act. This transfer of functions order is consistent with that policy of devolution and will enable the National Assembly for Wales to act across the range of the regulatory reform order provisions; and thus give the National Assembly for Wales a comparable level of responsibility as will exist in England from 1 October 2006.
</p>

<a name="60516-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_620"></a>The other function included in this omnibus order is the transfer of powers under Section 1 of the Education (Fees and Awards) Act 1983. This section currently enables the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to make regulations that allow certain institutions to charge higher fees to those students who cannot demonstrate a connection with the UK than to those who can. This change will enable the Assembly to make regulations regarding the charging of fees at universities and further education establishments in relation to Wales. The functions under Section 2 of the 1983 Act were previously devolved to the Assembly in 1999 and make similar provision for post-compulsory education awards by local education authorities. This split in responsibilities has made it increasingly complex to draft regulations under the 1983 Act, with some elements being made by the Assembly and others by the Secretary of State. Given the devolution of student support policy to the Assembly from the 2006&#150;07 academic year, it is no longer appropriate for these powers to remain with the Secretary of State. The transfer will facilitate the creation of future policy and improve accountability for both the Assembly and the DfES. I commend the order to the House and I beg to move.

<a name="60516-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, we are grateful to the Minister for presenting this order and explaining its purposes with such care. We are familiar with transfer of function orders in this House and this one appears to be as uncontroversial as the Minister claims. However, there are one or two questions that arise.
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_622"></a>The transfer of functions under Section 1 of the Education (Fees and Awards) Act 1983 is sensible, since policy responsibility for student support has, as the Minister said, been transferred to the National Assembly, along with the other functions available under the 1983 Act. It is, therefore, no longer appropriate for the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to retain the power under Section 1 to make regulations regarding the charging of higher fees to students in higher and further education who do not have the requisite connections with the United Kingdom. I assume that we are talking here about foreign students only, coming here from overseas for their final years of education, but I require an assurance that this is the case. There has been talk in Wales of charging different fees to students whose homes are in Wales and students from outside Wales, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_255"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 255</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

including England and Scotland. Could Section 1 be used to impose such differential rates either on its own or in tandem with Section 2 of the 1983 Act?
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_623"></a>As I understand it, top-up fees are to be introduced at Welsh institutions as from 2007&#150;08. Students normally resident in Wales will get an Assembly grant of &#163;1,800 annually towards their increased fees. English and Scottish students in Wales will not have such grants, nor will Welsh students attending English or Scottish universities. Is it the intention of the Assembly Government

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_625"></a>in the words of the Explanatory Notes&#151;to charge fees on this basis? Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position once and for all. He made certain things clear in his opening statement, but further clarification would be helpful.
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_626"></a>As to the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order and the transfer of all functions under that very substantial order to the National Assembly, this is clearly a necessary consequence of the devolution of responsibility for the fire and rescue services that took place in November 2004. Where does that responsibility now lie in the Assembly and the Assembly Government? What is the title of the department? I ask because fire safety is very important and a number of significant powers will be transferred&#151;for example, the power to make regulations about fire precautions, the power to authorise persons as the enforcing authority for certain non-domestic premises, the power to issue guidance to enforcing authorities, and the power to determine disputes.
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_627"></a>As the Minister said, fire safety law has been updated and reformed in recent years. The fire safety order is a part of that reform and it is important that it is properly implemented. The emphasis, as I understand it, is on fire prevention in the workplace and, under the order, the responsible person for each premise will be required to carry out an assessment of the risk of fire and take steps to reduce or remove the risk.
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_628"></a>All this spells careful control and supervision, especially in the early stages. What provision has been made at the Assembly or within the Assembly Government to carry out these functions adequately? I know that the National Assembly has been consulted on the order and has agreed to a modification of function&#151;we are told this on page 5 of the 118-page document&#151;and it would be good to know that preparations for receipt of these functions and their implementation are well in hand.
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_629"></a>I understand that the Assembly is currently considering a fire and rescue services charging order to enable the authorities to charge for the services they provide. These may include the removal of floodwater, rescuing people from lift cabins and giving advice on safety in premises where a trade, business or other undertaking is carried on. I shall say no more on that issue because I believe the order is still subject to discussion and not yet finalised. If the Minister could <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_256"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 256</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

tell us the latest state of play in the Assembly Government in regard to this transfer of function, we would be very grateful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_350"></a>
<a name="60516-39_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   My Lords, on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Benches I welcome the order and the strengthening of the powers and authority of the National Assembly for Wales. We know there may be some teething troubles&#151;possibly with the education awards and so on&#151;but it will be good at the end of the first year of operations to look at the report to see where changes have to be made. Certainly, this is a step forward in the direction of evolution, not revolution.
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_630"></a>My main concern about the fire safety regulations is that we are advised that 11 guides are to be available in regard to the kinds of non-domestic premises that will be covered by the regulations. I will not read them all but they include offices and shops, factories and warehouses, sleeping accommodation&#151;I wonder what that covers&#151;residential care premises, educational premises and so on. But there does not seem to be any reference at all to houses in multiple occupation, hotels and guest houses. I come from a very notable hotel area and it would be good to know that they will be covered and included in the regulations.
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_631"></a>Will any advice be given to the various fire services as to where they should locate certain equipment? In Llandudno, we used to have one of those high-rise turntable ladders; I am sure that is the wrong term. Some of our hotels are six and seven storeys high&#151;the equivalent of the Manhattan skyline in north Wales&#151;and we need to be able to reach people who are trapped in the topmost rooms of these buildings. This has happened a number of times, once only in the past year, and I would be grateful if the Minister could assure me that the various fire service ladders and so on will be located where the need is greatest. With that question, I again give a general welcome to the order on behalf of these Benches.
</p>




<p><a name="st_351"></a>
<a name="60516-39_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Roberts of Conwy and Lord Roberts of Llandudno, for their general support in welcoming these orders and for their questions.
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_632"></a>In response to the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, the transfer of the education function deals solely with powers enabling the drafting of regulations governing institutions charging higher fees for foreign students. It does not cover students from, or who can demonstrate a connection with, the UK. The Education (Fees and Awards) Act 1983 does not provide powers to set fee levels for students from the UK. The making of regulations that govern variable top-up fees, grants and loans are the subject of different legislation not before the House today, and are already devolved.
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_633"></a>To clarify the issue of student fees in Wales, however, under the Higher Education Act 2004 the Assembly Government will be making regulations that cover the arrangements for the 2007&#150;08 academic <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_257"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 257</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

year. Those regulations will enable students ordinarily resident in Wales and studying there to receive a fee remission grant of up to &#163;1,800 towards university fees of a maximum &#163;3,000. This has the effect of keeping the level of fees that Welsh-domiciled students have to find at &#163;1,200, which is the current level of fixed fees in 2006&#150;07. UK students from outside Wales studying at Welsh institutions and Welsh students studying outside Wales will not receive the grant. Cross-party support was given to this policy decision made by Members of the National Assembly for Wales in June 2005.
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_634"></a>The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 devolved to the National Assembly for Wales various powers in relation to fire and rescue authorities in Wales. Policy in this area is administered by the fire and rescue services branch of the Assembly Government&#039;s Social Justice and Regeneration Department. This department falls within the portfolio of the Minister for Social Justice and Regeneration, Mrs Edwina Hart AM. However, it should be noted that any relevant subordinate legislation in this area can only be made by the National Assembly for Wales itself.
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_635"></a>The Minister for Social Justice and Regeneration has established an advisory structure comprising representatives of fire and rescue authorities serving FRS personnel, communities, business and others to help inform FRS policy development in the round. In addition, the Assembly Government provide both revenue and capital funding for the service in Wales.
</p>

<a name="60516-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_636"></a>In response to the two points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, I can confirm that hotels and guesthouses are included under the sleeping accommodation guide. In the matter of guidance on the location of aerial ladders for tall buildings, the Welsh Assembly Government published guidance on risk reduction planning, <i>Fire and Rescue Service Risk Reduction Plan&#151;Wales a Safer Country</i>, on 21 March 2006. The guidance assists fire and rescue authorities in reducing risk while placing citizens, communities and stakeholders centre stage in the development of the FRA&#039;s agenda. While the guidance does not contain specific advice on the location of aerial appliances, it does provide a holistic approach to the management of service delivery, including the location and provision of fire resources. Fire and rescue authorities place resources such as aerial appliances where their chief fire officers determine as an operational matter where there is a high risk to life. I commend this order to the House.

<p><a name="st_352"></a>
<a name="60516-40_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner) </b>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 26 April be approved [<i>25th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_258"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 258</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60516-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_638"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this order for pre-consolidation is made under Sections 36 and 38 of the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002. Those provisions enable the Secretary of State to make by order amendments to legislation relating to the health service in England and Wales which facilitate, or are otherwise desirable in connection with, the consolidation of NHS law.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_639"></a>The order allows minor technical changes to the law prior to its consolidation. It affects the National Health Service Act 1977 and other health service legislation. The 1977 Act itself consolidated prior health legislation. There followed numerous statutory changes that have made applying the law a more complex task which calls for consolidation. For example, my noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath pointed out in 2002 that the 1977 Act had been amended by 57 further statutes.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_640"></a>The department intends to introduce three Bills in June to consolidate NHS law in England and Wales: the National Health Service Bill (England), the National Health Service Bill (Wales) and the National Health Service (Consequential Provisions) Bill. The three Bills have been prepared by the Law Commission, and represent many years&#039; hard work by the draftsmen at the commission. I am extremely grateful for their work.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_641"></a>I am very pleased that the parliamentary stages are underway, with this pre-consolidation order being the first stage of the process. The provisions of the pre-consolidation order are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Furthermore, we have had nothing but supportive feedback from stakeholders within our 12-week consultation period. The order makes minor amendments to the National Health Service Act and other health service legislation. The amendments can be broadly categorised as: desirable to clarify the legislation or remove an element of ambiguity from it; necessary to remedy missed consequential provisions; incorporating modifications; dealing with local health boards in Wales; removing certain requirements for Treasury consent before certain payments can be made; remunerating practitioners; and repealing provisions which are either spent or are unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_642"></a>The order is not therefore the most exciting of reads. None the less, I will try and give a flavour of the order. The Explanatory Memorandum gives a detailed explanation of each of the provisions in Schedule 1. I hope this has been of assistance. The order enables consolidation to remove ambiguity. One example of this is Schedule 1(2), which amends Section 3 of the National Health Service Act 1977. In a legal dispute of July last year, the Court of Appeal, on intervention by the Department of Health, reversed a court decision to narrowly construe the term &quot;facilities.&quot; The order amends Section 3 to more clearly reflect the finding of the court in that case.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_643"></a>The order also aims to correct a number of missed consequential amendments. The first example concerns the NHS and Community Care Act 1990 and the Health and Social Care Act 2003. A large part of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_259"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 259</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

order incorporates provisions in relation to local pharmaceutical services. The National Health Service Local Pharmaceutical Services Regulations 2006 recently made a number of modifications to the 1977 Act. The order incorporates these modifications into the 1977 Act, thereby making the legislation more accessible.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_644"></a>This brings me to the amendments necessary because of the powers of the National Assembly for Wales. The Assembly has directed local health boards to exercise some of its functions that were transferred to the Assembly on the abolition of health authorities in Wales in April 2003. The consolidation reflects the effect of these functions regulations by substituting references to local health boards for references to health authorities in all relevant sections under the 1977 Act. The order clarifies these arrangements accordingly. Another group of amendments concerns Treasury consent provisions. The order removes the requirement for Treasury consent for certain payments which may be made by the Secretary of State. This is in line with Treasury policy that such <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_260"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column 260</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consent should be reviewed and repealed where appropriate. The Treasury has agreed these amendments.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_645"></a>I should make special reference to the largest amendment. Schedule 1(19) inserts Sections 43A and 43B into the 1977 Act. The consolidation will be more comprehensible if it is possible to reproduce these sections in a simple form, and this amendment, together with the consequential repeals, will enable this. Furthermore, by amending other legislation, the order will provide for a less complex consolidation exercise. For example, the Ministry of Health Act 1919 is spent and is therefore repealed. This avoids the need to reproduce a spent enactment in the consolidation. In summary, the order is an important step in the consolidation of our NHS legislation. I beg to move.

<a name="60516-40_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Byford </b>   rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Water Resources (Abstraction and Impounding) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/641) [<i>30th Report from the Merits Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_2"></a>The noble Baroness said: I welcome the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, to his new ministerial post. If we raise issues today that have not come directly to him by now, I shall be more than happy that he should come back to me later.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_0"></a>The Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee spent two pages of its 30th Report on the subject of these regulations. Its main concern is the changes to the advertising requirements for those seeking permission to abstract or impound water. As the matter stands, an applicant must advertise in the <i>London Gazette</i> and on two occasions in a local paper. These regulations would move the responsibility from the applicant to the Environment Agency, drop the <i>London Gazette</i> requirement, reduce local advertising to one occasion and add a requirement to publish the details on the agency&#039;s website.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_1"></a>The committee&#039;s doubts were that the changes might result in lower exposure and lessen public awareness of the applications. Were that to lead to a fall in representations by the public, it fears that the agency&#039;s objective of minimising damage to the environment may be compromised. It comments that Defra has not supplied any evidence that its website is a superior method of communicating information to a public accustomed to obtaining information from its local paper. We agree with those reservations and believe that in rural areas many more people will read their local paper from cover to cover than will perhaps sign on to any website, far less so to one run by Defra&#151;I say that with humility&#151;as they might not think that they should look there.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_2"></a>However, a more obscure question occupies us. As things stand, the duty to advertise lies with the applicant. If that duty is not discharged, the application may be refused or approval rescinded. Once the duty lies with the Environment Agency, what will be the result if it is not carried out? Will any <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC54"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC54</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

approval be countermanded? Will any expense by the applicant, based on an approval, be reclaimable from the Environment Agency, and will the applicant be able to sue the Environment Agency for negligence? The regulations appear to be silent on the subject, which is particularly important in relation to the applications made by the Environment Agency for its own purposes. We feel there should be a requirement to tie proof of advertising to the approval documentation.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_3"></a>I should like to direct the Minister&#039;s attention to a matter of detail. Under Regulation 6(7) an advertisement should not contain information,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_0"></a>&quot;that is not to be included in a register by virtue of . . . Section 191B (exclusion from registers of certain confidential information)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_4"></a>Where the application relates to a national park or the broads, Regulation 9(3) excludes from the notice,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_1"></a>&quot;any information which appears to the Agency to be information that is commercially confidential&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_5"></a>Are those two the same thing? If so, should they not be controlled by the same wording? If they are not the same wording or not the same thing, where is the difference? Reading through it, I could not clarify that.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_6"></a> The committee&#039;s report also said that there were 39 responses to the consultation, of which seven were from respondents representing agriculture. What were the main concerns of those agriculture respondents? Does the instrument that we are debating overcome their fears? In addition, after the recent announcement of drought orders, what consideration or balance will the Environment Agency give to the needs of the farming community for irrigation to ensure that their crops survive? I understand that there have been orders banning hosepipes and the cleaning of cars, and so on, which I can understand. However, unfortunately, much agriculture&#151;especially horticulture and growing vegetables&#151;is very reliant on water. Interestingly enough, the draft order has been granted to Sutton and East Surrey Water, but I understand that applications have also been made from water companies in East Anglia, where a lot of such crops are grown.
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_7"></a> The explanatory RIA said that 1,200 applications were made each year, one-third of which are no longer are necessary as they fall below the minimum registration amount of 20 cubic metres, for which we are grateful. We debated that when we took the Water Bill through, and we were glad that we persuaded the Government to exclude those applicants. But that leaves some 939 applicants, of whom some 469 get some dispensation. Can we have clarification on who is getting what?
</p>

<a name="60516-40_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_8"></a> I understand, too, that no charge will be made for the information put out on the Environment Agency website, which is good to have. But I should like clarification on whether newspaper costs will be recovered from the applicant. We are told that the sums will be of a modest charge to cover the administrative costs. Does that mean the total cost or the costs just for advertising? Again, that was not made clear.

<p><a name="gc_st_3"></a>
<a name="60516-41_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I formally welcome the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, to his new position. I am delighted that we shall be working together&#151;or in opposition, as it may be. I am very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, for giving me the opportunity to explore a couple of the issues that we discussed last week in the debate on the water framework directive, replied to by the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington of Ribbleton, who is present today. This debate is on the same theme: public awareness. The Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee&#039;s point that the public would be less aware as a result of this method was absolutely right.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_11"></a>Is the Minister happy that Defra as a whole is being fairly consistent with the requirements to advertise, whether on its website or in newspapers? For example, I draw his attention to those requirements as they went through the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, when we had many debates about whether advertising should happen on websites or in newspapers. I wondered whether Defra had a consistent policy on that.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_12"></a>Secondly, there is obviously a lot more concern about licences to extract, given the drought situation. I have noticed in a number of papers in my region of the south-west that in the past few months there has been an exponential growth in advertisements from private developers offering to drill bore holes for people. Obviously, many of those bore holes will fall into the <i>de minimus</i> category of not needing a licence. However, if there is going to be enormous encouragement of that sector, it begs the question whether applicants for larger scale bore holes, who therefore need to advertise, are being particularly disadvantaged. All their neighbours could take advantage of the ability to abstract without a licence and then write in and object to their larger neighbour who now wishes to abstract also. There are some difficulties there. The impoundment issue raises far fewer questions.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_4"></a>
<a name="60516-41_spnew1"></a><b> Lord King of Bridgwater: </b>   My interest is in precisely the point that the noble Baroness raised at the end. I understand that this facilitates the making of smaller abstractions at precisely the wrong time. There is some evidence&#151;which has been advertised on television and radio&#151;that the way to respond to the hosepipe ban and other preventions of abstraction is to put in your own bore hole, which can be done below the <i>de minimus</i> level. I appreciate that this matter does not entirely fall within the orders before this Grand Committee, but the Minister might like to comment on the point. There is an illusion that the water on your <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC56"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC56</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

property is somehow peculiar to you and does not affect anyone else, but we know of plenty of illustrations where bore holes have dried up springs 10 miles away. The impact on possible river flow and damage to the environment could be substantial.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_5"></a>
<a name="60516-41_spmin0"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  Has Defra taken notice of and learnt the lessons of what happened in Scotland when SEPA first began talking about licensing? The first suggestion was that any application for a new abstraction licence would cost &#163;2,944 and there would be a minimum subsistence charge of &#163;446 per annum&#151;enough to put off anybody wanting to grow fruit or vegetables from starting up a business. That works against the idea that we should grow our produce as close as possible to the market and not have to import it from the other end of the world. It is important that, when the costs and charges are considered, a balance is struck about what is an economic amount.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_6"></a>
<a name="60516-41_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Rooker): </b>  I am most grateful for the contributions, particularly my warm welcome to my new responsibilities. I will do my best. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord King, about drought. It is not necessarily part of this order, but if I can answer any specifics today I will do so. If I cannot, I will do so as quickly as possible by other means because they are wholly reasonable points to make.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_13"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, the regulations do not stand alone. They are part of an integrated system, about which I am sure she knows more than I do, for water resources management, under the Water Resources Act 1991. The regulations we are dealing with have been designed to mesh with the revised licensing regime, as it was amended by the Water Act 2003. The regulations, together with the changes made in the Water Act 2003, repeal four sets of regulations, meaning it is &quot;one in and four out&quot;. That has got to help. Those repealed regulations and the system before we overhauled it generally date from the 1960s, so they have been around a while and largely prevent the use of modern and more cost-effective IT-based solutions by the agency. So overall, under the new regime, costs to both applicants and the agency should decrease. In the fullness of time, I hope that I will be able to supply figures to back up that bold claim.
<a name="gc_time_0"></a>
<a name="60516-41_time0"></a><h5>3.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60516-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_14"></a>I turn now to the detail, particularly the two main issues raised by the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee regarding the regulations as they apply to advertising of applications for abstraction: first, giving the Environment Agency discretion whether to advertise applications, and, secondly, the use of the internet and reduced local advertising combined to reduce the potential for applications objecting to new abstraction licences being granted.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_15"></a>I hope that I can wholly reassure Members of the Committee. The primary legislation retains a presumption to advertise, subject to the limited <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC57"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC57</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

exemptions or discretion as prescribed in the regulations. The requirement to publish a notice, once, in a local newspaper has been retained in recognition that not everyone has access to the internet. Access to the internet, however, has greatly increased and advertising in successive weeks in a local newspaper would add significantly to the costs. Retention of local newspaper advertising will be in conjunction with a notice on the Environment Agency&#039;s website, not Defra&#039;s website. I notice the slightly negative touch about Defra&#039;s website, but that does not apply because it is the Environment Agency&#039;s website. It provides a satisfactory means of drawing proposals to the attention of those most likely to be affected. I understand that the notice will be on the website for 30 days. If I am wrong about that, I will be corrected. For people who are interested, and the network of people involved, that is much better perhaps than it being buried away in a public notice in newspapers. I am not saying that that is not important, as it is; nevertheless, modern technology has given far more access to information about what is going on to more people. The notice will be on the website for a considerable period.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_16"></a>In addition, the new simplified regime reduces the potential for errors in the advertising process that arose because of the difficulty in co-ordinating publication in a variety of newspapers. Under the old regime, advertising was in the <i>London Gazette</i> and on two occasions in local newspapers. As I have mentioned, the agency will have discretion to advertise, and its internal guidance, which is available to anyone on request, makes a presumption that applications will be advertised unless it is safe to exercise discretion. The exceptions where advertising can be dispensed with will be limited to cases where the proposed activity will have no appreciable effect on the environment, any licensed abstraction or any abstraction to which the restriction on abstraction does not apply&#151;in other words, an abstraction that does not require a licence.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_17"></a>Under the new regulations there are three areas where advertising will not be required: where national security might be compromised, renewal of a time-limited abstraction licence on the same terms, and applications that seek only to add a time limit to an existing permanent licence. Exempting advertising on national security grounds means we can now end Crown exemption from abstraction licensing, without risking national security, which was not possible under the old regime. Renewal on the same terms increases certainty for the applicant. Exposing the renewal of time-limited licences on the same terms to public scrutiny or, in many cases, further public scrutiny, would present additional uncertainty for the licence holder and the prospect of permanent trial by jury&#151;double jeopardy. Any problems that might affect the possible renewal of a licence should be well known to the Environment Agency at that juncture and advertising would add little. Adding a time limit to an existing permanent licence will assist the conversion of permanent licences and will enable the review of such licences and ultimately support the sustainable use of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC58"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

water resources. A requirement to advertise in these circumstances would simply discourage the voluntary conversion of permanent licences.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_18"></a>It is also to be noted that the Environment Agency has operated a form of advertising discretion for certain categories of licence application since it was first introduced under the Water Act 1989. To date, no major problems have arisen. Degrees of exemption or discretion already operate in similar regulatory regimes. Indeed, the discretion in these regulations is largely derived from Regulation 4 of the Control of Pollution (Applications, Appeals and Registers) Regulations (SI 1996/2971), also operated by the Environment Agency.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_19"></a>I have some notes which I hope will satisfy noble Lords on some of the issues they have raised. On the noble Baroness&#039;s question about the wording of Regulation 6(7) as opposed to Regulation 9(3), Regulation 6(7) refers to the notice of application to be published by the agency but Regulation 9(3) refers to a different notice: that to be given by the agency to the national park to inform it that an application for abstraction or empowerment has been made. The agency must still notify the national park even if no advertising notice is required, so the difference in words reflects a difference in situation.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_20"></a>The noble Baroness asked how we would ensure that agriculture gets its water under drought orders. Obviously there must be an aim to balance the needs of the environment, public supply and other abstractions, including agriculture. I am absolutely certain that the Environment Agency and Defra fully appreciate the careful but massive use of, and need for, water by the agriculture industry, particularly in horticulture, as the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, points out. I am not saying that there will be no problems, but we have an acute shortage of water&#151;everyone can see the photographs of the reservoirs in the papers. The problem with the bore holes is that we cannot get photographs of what is down there. I accept what the noble Lord, Lord King, said: it is highly possible for a bore hole to affect a spring several miles away. It is not true that personal bore holes, if I can put it that way, take the water only from under the ground of the person who has made one. That is not the way of the world.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_21"></a>There is, of course, no charge for using the agency website. The figure I have for one advert in a local newspaper is about &#163;150 to &#163;300, which strikes me as an enormous sum. Then again, I have not placed a personal or block advert&#151;advertising surgeries, for example&#151;in a newspaper for some years. I have an estimate for the advertising administrative charge of about &#163;100, so the total cost ranges from &#163;250 to &#163;400 depending on the cost of local newspapers. That is a net saving under the new regime, estimated to range from a minimum of &#163;167 to about &#163;317 per application. There is thought to be an overall saving here; time will obviously tell.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_22"></a>On the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, the large-scale proposals are unlikely to pass the test for advertising dispensation. Each case, however, must be judged on its merits.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60516-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_23"></a>I have an advance correction of my own speech. The notice will remain on the website for 28 days, rather than 30 days. I regret that error, which was done from memory, yesterday.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_24"></a>The noble Baroness also asked me about safeguards existing if applications are not advertised. The agency is liable, under Section 60 of the 1991 Act, to pay compensation if it grants a new licence causing derogation of a protective right to abstract water without the consent of the holder. That is still the case: the agency remains liable.
</p>

<a name="60516-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_25"></a>The question asked in some detail by the noble Lord, Lord King, has escaped my crack team here. I therefore make the time-honoured promise to write to noble Lords on this important point. It is highly topical. People out there are concerned, with the first drought orders being issued.

<p><a name="gc_st_7"></a>
<a name="60516-42_spnew0"></a><b> Lord King of Bridgwater: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. I failed to welcome him, and it occurred to me to ask whether he is following in the footsteps of his former colleague from Birmingham, Denis Howell, who became the Minister for drought. That proved to be the solution, because shortly thereafter he became the Minister for floods.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_8"></a>
<a name="60516-42_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   That is true. I saw a photograph in one of the newspapers this morning of my former, late, colleague. To us, he was always a football referee&#151;not that I do football&#151;but he was &quot;Mr Birmingham&quot; for many years. We do not have people the size of Denis these days, but in 1976&#151;if memory serves me&#151;I had been in the House just a couple of years and the rainmaker was appointed. I am not the drought Minister, despite everything else I have gathered in the past week, but we have to make good use of our water resources. We are much more tuned in to that now than we were 30 years ago. We now realise that we have gradually been draining the planet and we are now taking much more care because these issues will come up. Notwithstanding the recent weather, we were warned last winter that this summer would be exceptionally dry, and as a consequence extra care will be needed about water.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_9"></a>
<a name="60516-42_spmin0"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  The Minister explained the charges, but do they apply to existing extractions that have to be re-licensed or to new licences?

<a name="60516-42_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Gangmasters Licensing (Exclusions) Regulations 2006</h3>



<p><a name="gc_st_12"></a>
<a name="60516-42_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Byford </b>   rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Gangmasters Licensing (Exclusions) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/658) [<i>30th Report from the Merits Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_13"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to the Gangmasters (Appeals) Regulations 2006 and the Gangmasters (Licensing Conditions) Rules 2006 because most of my points are general, although some are detailed. In its 30th Report, the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee noted its concern at the delay in bringing the new licensing system into force. I am also strongly concerned. When this matter was raised in a Private Member&#039;s Bill, introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, if my memory serves me correctly, some noble Lords wished to debate it in Committee but we were told that if we did so, it would not be possible to push the Bill through in time for it to be enacted. That was more than a year ago, and here we are looking at something that will not, in some cases, happen until 2007. I find that worrying. It beggars belief that portions of the regulations that follow from the Morecambe Bay disaster will not operate until April 2007. That disaster was the wellspring from which the Gangmasters Licensing Authority was generated in 2004.
</p>

<a name="60516-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_28"></a>On 13 March this year, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, published a Written Statement foreshadowing the laying of the regulations that we are debating. That Statement surprised me on a couple of counts: first, he defined the boundaries as being not the supply of workers who are normally domiciled overseas, but simply the supply of labour for the agriculture and shellfish industries. Does that mean that these regulations could apply to someone who is UK-born and has always lived here? I thought that these regulations were to deal with people coming from overseas to take part in agriculture and horticulture as they historically have. I cannot see clarification on that in the regulations.

</p>

<a name="60516-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_29"></a>The Gangmasters Licensing (Exclusions) Regulations define the seasonal agricultural workers scheme. I declare an interest as president of Concordia, one of the organisations that for the past 40 years has brought seasonal workers from overseas, many of whom, the Minister will be interested to hear, were agricultural students in their own countries in their own right, and one of whom went on to become the agriculture Minister in his own country. So we did do some good.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_14"></a>
<a name="60516-42_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Actually there is another one: me.

<a name="60516-42_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   The Minister is telling me something that I did not know because I thought he <br>&nbsp;<br>

was English-based; there we are. It is a very good organisation. It has been going through fairly difficult times regarding the future of the scheme, as has the National Farmers&#039; Union with its similar scheme. I had assumed that the regulations were confined to SAWS operators and not to internal placement of people employed in the agricultural industry. I seek clarification on that.
</p>

<a name="60516-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_30"></a>I was somewhat surprised to read of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_2"></a>&quot;the early introduction of licensing for labour providers operating in the farming and fresh produce supply chain . . . More time is needed to finalise the licensing arrangements to apply to shellfish gathering&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_31"></a>Why? I cannot understand why it has taken so long, or what the hold-up is. Why did Defra not concentrate first on shellfish and that type of operation? That was where the maximum danger existed for seasonal workers.
</p>

<a name="60516-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_32"></a>I will try to go through the regulations in a sequence. I have one or two questions. First, in the exemptions under Paragraph 13 of the schedule to SI 2006/658, does,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_3"></a>&quot;on the day the supply is made&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_33"></a>mean &quot;on each day that the particular worker works for that farmer&quot;, or does it mean, &quot;on the first day of that particular supply contract&quot;? I was not clear on it.
</p>

<a name="60516-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_34"></a>Paragraph 14 refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_4"></a>&quot;supply or use . . . before 1st October 2006&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_35"></a>and Paragraph 15 goes on to say,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_5"></a>&quot;On and after 1st October&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_36"></a>However, the Minister stated that it was anticipated that it would become an offence for a labour user to use an unlicensed gangmaster in December. We expect the labour provider and labour users offences to be introduced in the shellfish gathering sector from April 2007. In Paragraph 15 the exemption relates to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_6"></a>&quot;On and after 1st October&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_37"></a>That implies a change from the current practice. Again, I hope that the Minister might be able to explain what that change is and why that bit is in that statutory instrument.
</p>

<a name="60516-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_38"></a>S.I. 2006/660 lays down licensing conditions. This is a nitty-gritty point, for which I apologise. On the first page, in Rule 2(2)(a), there might be a typo. Instead of, &quot;)who has&quot; should it be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_7"></a>&quot;which has control of it)&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_39"></a>which follows the same format as the next sub-paragraph? That is a minor technical point. On another technical point, is there a typo in Rule 7(1), which refers to &quot;a licences&quot;?
</p>

<a name="60516-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_40"></a>In Rule 8, if the fees for application inspections are to be scaled, why are they not in the same ratio as for the licence? What does an application inspection cover, and on what basis is the minimum charge &#163;1,600? It would surely easily cover three days plus expenses, and even a VAT inspection of a small business does not take that long.
</p>

<a name="60516-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_41"></a>What is the intention of paragraph 6 of the schedule, as it seems at odds with paragraphs 8, 10(b) and 15(b)(ii)? That is a particular issue I wish to raise <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC62"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC62</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with the Minister. In paragraph 14, what is meant by the word &quot;unsuitable&quot;? Is this statutory instrument sufficient protection for a licence holder to end the supply of a worker without fear of having to face court action, particularly if the cessation of the supply costs the labour user money?
</p>

<a name="60516-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_42"></a>Under paragraph 19, why should the licence holder hold a record of the date of birth of the labourer if he is under 22 years old? I am puzzled by that; it seems very strange. I wonder whether under 22 years is when a person might still be considered a student. It seems unusual to have that in a statutory instrument. Finally, under paragraph 22, it is strange that records have to be held for only one year. In most legislation relating to farming&#151;for example, concerning vets or, as in our case, farmers&#151;we have to hold records for up to seven years. Do the Government feel that holding records for one year will be sufficient should it be necessary to refer to earlier dates?
</p>

<a name="60516-42_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_43"></a>In asking these questions, the NFU has recognised, as do I, the need for the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act, which we welcome. I hope that the Minister will not think that I do not welcome it. It is extremely important. We know that we need to have proper regulation of gangmasters. We have become increasingly concerned over reports of illegal activities concerning gangmasters for many years.
</p>

<a name="60516-42_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_44"></a>The very wide-ranging scope of the Act made it important, for example, that a number of exclusions from the requirement for licensing were made for the farm-to-farm short-term supply labour. Again, we debated that during the passage of the Act, when I was very grateful that the Minister recognised the need for farmers to be able to exchange short-term supply of labour on farms.
</p>

<a name="60516-42_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_45"></a>Further delays to the introduction of licensing were caused by the protracted discussions with the Government on whether to exclude from licensing any labour supplied for secondary processing&#151;packaging and processing plants where fruit, vegetables and meat are cut, packed or turned into ready meals&#151;as opposed to the farms where they were grown. The NFU welcomed Jim Knight&#039;s announcement on 13 March that licensing will apply to all labour providers supplying permanent, temporary and contracted labour to businesses in agriculture, horticulture, food packaging and processing industries. I know that there was a great debate between Defra and, I think, the DTI at one stage on how that should be viewed. If my memory serves me correctly, the Minister will recall some of those from his earlier time at MAFF, as it was then.
</p>

<a name="60516-42_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_46"></a>We welcome these statutory instruments. The things that we want to raise with the Minister are slightly nitty-gritty, but we need to have them clarified properly. Most importantly, we want to make sure that rogue gangmasters cannot find any way to beat the system, because we do not want to see that. Clearly, there is a need for a publicity campaign to make sure that gangmasters and those who employ labourers supplied by them are very clear on their needs and requirements, and the restrictions placed on them. I beg to move.

<a name="60516-43_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I strongly welcome the Minister here today. We have worked together across the Table many times. It is strange to think of Denis Howell; I am sure he would have enjoyed the cup final in Cardiff last Saturday. It was a sunny day, and I must tell the Minister, a Birmingham man, that all the reservoirs are full as well. The supply of water in Birmingham this summer looks okay to me.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_48"></a>However, there are issues with these regulations, and I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, for giving us the opportunity to discuss some of them. I, like her, find it strange that it has taken almost two years to get the regulations into place. There is some justification, however, in that they must get it right. Whether it could have been got right sooner is another question. Workers are, of course, still picking cockles in Morecombe Bay&#151;legally, I hope&#151;under supervision.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_49"></a>Is the Minister now satisfied by the progress of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority? Who is its chair? I should know, but I do not. How many members does it have? When we debated the Bill we agreed on a figure, which escapes me for the moment. I am sure the membership will be in line with that, but I am intrigued to know. How many gangmasters have been licensed since the launch of licensing on 6 April? Or are we waiting for this statutory instrument to go through here first before any gangmasters are licensed? I suspect that the process has started already.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_50"></a>On licensing conditions, what checks and balances exist on seasonal imported labour? Are papers in order, for example? Are the gangmasters checking them out, or are inspections taking place to ensure that they are all here legally? Obviously, we welcome the imposition of this important legislation, and congratulate the Government on bringing it in. However, I would like to know more about these points.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_51"></a>In Herefordshire, which neighbours my area, there has been much discussion about accommodation for seasonal workers. I presume that that is inspected and up to standard, as far as possible. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, mentioned some of the discussions. It is perfectly acceptable, for example, that it will take six months from 6 April for gangmasters to apply for a licence, given that we are a couple of years on anyway. That process will take some time, and I am hopeful that that target will be met.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_52"></a> There is some concern that publicity for these changes is not sufficiently adequate. Is the Minister satisfied that Defra and the Gangmasters Licensing Authority have between them adequate resources for an effective publicity campaign in sufficient time for the regulations to be clearly understood?

<a name="60516-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_53"></a>The Gangmasters (Appeals) Regulations refer to an appointed person in charge of a tribunal. We learn that the hearing will be an oral one. I am sure that the Minister cannot answer this question precisely, but what sort of timescale are we thinking of? It will be important to determine appeals quickly. Given that there are references to the need for that in the regulations, how will they be expedited on time? Obviously, speed is crucial. When crops, fruit or vegetables are ready they need to be harvested at optimum quality.

</p>

<a name="60516-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_54"></a>The other matter that we should discuss is the exclusion regulations. I praise the flexibility outlined in page 3 of the Explanatory Memorandum on the exclusions regulations, which allow agricultural contractors to be involved and excluded. There is another important issue concerning agricultural students supplied by an educational establishment. I worked in Lincolnshire one summer when I was a student, and I certainly felt exploited, gathering potatoes in thunderstorms and rain to try to get them to Manchester within four hours. Things like that go on. I welcome these regulations and the flexibility contained in part of them.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_55"></a>There is another issue in which I am particularly interested: the gathering of shellfish. Paragraph 7.7 of the Explanatory Memorandum gives a precise definition:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_8"></a>&quot;Paragraph 15 makes it clear that after 1st October 2006 the gathering of shellfish will be brought within the scope of the licensing scheme with the exception of workers employed directly to gather shellfish from a fishing vessel and workers employed to gather shellfish by diving&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_56"></a>Noble Lords who know the Gower peninsula will appreciate the importance of cockles to its economy. My grandmother took me there long ago to Penclawdd, which is famous for cockles. Quite a lot of local people gather cockles, almost as of right, from one generation to another. How are they incorporated? There is specific reference to people who have fishing vessels, but some of those people are land based and also work in the food processing and packaging sector on dry land, away from the inlets. There are important issues for local economies. Without more ado, those are my comments on the three statutory instruments.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_17"></a>
<a name="60516-43_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I agree with my noble friend Lady Byford and the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, that these regulations are desperately needed and will greatly improve the law. Members of the Grand Committee will know that I have been involved in horticulture all my working life. I started self-employment in horticulture as a sole trader. Many of the gangmasters we are talking about in these regulations, whether involved in shellfish picking, horticulture or farming, will be sole traders. Rule 3(1) provides that a gangmaster&#039;s licence will be granted only to a business. In law, does the word &quot;business&quot; cover the operations of a sole trader? If not, the good <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC65"></a>

gangmasters and those who employ the services of a gangmaster could be unfairly disadvantaged. One would not want that to happen.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_18"></a>
<a name="60516-43_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Rooker): </b>  I will do my best to answer the last question, which is wholly reasonable. I am grateful for the contributions of noble Lords. One of them took me back more than 40 years. I was a young tool-making apprentice in Birmingham in 1960 when I saw an advert in the paper: &quot;Holiday with a difference: fruit picking in Scotland&quot;. It was at Letham Grange, near Arbroath. I picked the biggest raspberries I had ever seen in my life. I was a Brummie: I thought they were strawberries! Concordia organised that employment. There were only three or four Brits there. The other 60-odd were from all over the place. I was so keen on it that I went back the following year. It just shows you that there may be two ex-Concordia fruit pickers who have ended up as Ministers.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_57"></a>The issue of regulation of gangmasters goes back a long time. In 1997, my maiden speech on the Front Bench, two weeks after being appointed, was to answer Richard Body&#039;s Adjournment Debate on behalf of my noble friend Lord Donoughue, literally within a couple of weeks of the general election. The process started from then to try to do something about gangmasters. The problems are well understood by noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_58"></a>The set piece that I have will cover most of the points that have been raised, and for those that are not included, I will refer to the detailed notes. It is true that many gangmasters operate respectable and legitimate businesses, but many do not. The licensing arrangements are important. They will ensure that workers are treated fairly and they will protect some 600,000 workers from exploitation. They will of course protect the interests of legitimate businesses so that they are not undercut by the cowboys.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_59"></a>The rules and regulations that we have been debating today complete the second stage of the process. With the completion of this element of the regulatory framework, the Gangmasters Licensing Authority was able to commence licensing operations on 6 April, and I will give the latest figure on that. In its 30th report, the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee criticised the time that it had taken to establish the gangmasters licensing arrangements, as the noble Baroness said. Royal Assent to the Act was received on 8 July 2004. The authority commenced work on 1 April 2005 and has been working hard since to bring the licensing scheme into operation. There was initial consultation on the Gangmasters Licensing (Exclusions) Regulations in February 2005, and consultation on the Gangmasters (Appeals) Regulations in March 2005. A second consultation on the Gangmasters Licensing (Exclusions) Regulations took place in October 2005, when the authority also consulted on its licence standards.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_60"></a>Although it has been time-consuming, and I fully accept the arguments about delay, the consultations were necessary to ensure that the rules and regulations <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC66"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC66</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

delivered a robust scheme that is called for by the stakeholders and one that everyone understands. That is important. Consultation was also necessary to ensure that the evidence supported the application of the licensing throughout the food chain. That process has taken longer than we had hoped when early predictions on the timetable were made. On the other hand, it is complex, but we did not sit back and wait for consultation to end. Steps were taken during this period to prepare labour providers for the introduction of licensing. As an interim measure, we worked closely with the Ethical Trading Initiative Temporary Labour Working Group to adapt its voluntary code of practice as a business development tool. Defra funded that work, and the labour providers who volunteered for an audit were able to use the feedback to make their business ready for licensing. Some 400 labour providers have used that facility.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_61"></a>The Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee made specific reference to the delay in introducing licensing in the shellfish-gathering sector, which the noble Baroness also referred to. Here the licensing will apply both to the supply and the use of labour, which are two very different concepts&#151;it is different from agriculture, where only the supply of labour is licensed. The Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee&#039;s concerns are understandable, but the authority needs more time to adapt its licence conditions to the specific circumstances of the shellfish gathering sector. In developing its initial licensing standards proposals, the authority was able to draw on more than two years of work done by the Temporary Labour Working Group, which developed a code of practice for labour providers operating in the fresh produce supply chain. That gave the authority a head start in the farming and food processing sectors. The authority had no prior work to draw on in relation to shellfish gathering; it was new. We did not have that background.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_62"></a>The initial consultation on licence standards confirmed that shellfish-gathering requires a different approach from farming on land. As a result, finalising the licensing standards to apply to shellfish gathering will require more time; this work is in hand. A number of workshops involving industry interests have been held, and detailed proposals for shellfish licensing standards will be published shortly. We are keen to ensure that licensing is introduced as quickly as possible. There is no merit or gain for the Government in delaying this. Consequently, the regulations make it clear that licensing will apply to the supply and use of labour to hand-gather shellfish from 1 October 2006.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_63"></a>A number of further steps need to be taken over the coming months to finalise the licensing arrangements. If the application process goes smoothly, we plan to make it an offence for a gangmaster to operate without a licence with effect from 1 October 2006. At the same time, regulations will be made, or guidance issued, setting out the steps a labour user must take to ensure that a gangmaster whom he or she engages has a licence. As I have said, we will commence licensing in the shellfish sector from 1 October. It is anticipated that it will become an offence for a labour user to use <br>&nbsp;<br>

an unlicensed gangmaster in December of this year. We expect that the labour-provider and labour-user offences will be introduced in the shellfish-gathering sector from April 2007. There is a gap between the requirement to be licensed and the offences being committed, which is wholly reasonable in the circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60516-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_64"></a>I have mentioned the industry&#039;s need for a flexible labour supply. Indeed, I have some personal experience of that&#151;I was on strike for the second year I was there, by the way.

<a name="60516-44_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   That is not allowed in this place.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_20"></a>
<a name="60516-44_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   No, I am not striking on this. The Committee will agree, however, that flexibility should not be provided at the expense of the workers. That is the point. Licensing will oblige gangmasters to operate their business in an ethical and legal manner. It will also create a clear distinction between legal and illegal operators. These arrangements provide the ability to ensure that those gangmasters who try to operate without a licence can indeed be prevented from doing so, so that there is no place for unlicensed gangmasters in the future. We have come a long way from the kick-off of the Bill in 2004 and since Richard Body&#039;s debate&#151;I have not reread it&#151;in which he gave some horrifying examples of abuses by gangmasters.
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_65"></a>At the latest date for which I have figures, 81 licences have been issued and there have been 295 applications. The licensing authority is to be congratulated on working from a standing start. Concerns have been expressed about the late start for shellfishing. I am certain that they are genuine, and that Members of the Committee are not seeking to criticise the licensing arrangements. I hope that I have given a satisfactory explanation of that delay.
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_66"></a>I will address some of the detailed points raised. Does the word &quot;business&quot; cover sole traders? Yes. I do not need to say more than that. On the resources available to ensure adequate publicity, Defra is funding the licensing authority&#039;s set-up costs, and has made provision for publicity in the budget. On the appointed person hearing, the regulations prescribe a timetable for appeals. An expedited procedure applies when a decision has immediate effect, and an appeal must be lodged within 20 working days. The aim is to determine an appeal within 35 days, where the decision has immediate effect.
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_67"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, asked why records must be kept for one year under paragraph 22. It is a requirement of the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003. The relevant part of these regulations is contained in the schedule to the Gangmasters (Licensing Conditions) Rules as they apply to gangmasters. So that already operates elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_68"></a>Accommodation for workers is covered in the licensing standards, and checks are made to ensure that workers are not overcharged. That is the greatest rip-off in some other sectors.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_69"></a>The chair of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority is Mr Paul Whitehouse, and there are 29 board members. Paul Whitehouse was a police chief constable and is a man of considerable experience, and we wish him and his colleagues well.
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_70"></a>What does the application inspection charge cover, and how is it calculated? The application inspection fee covers the cost of a visit to the labour provider&#039;s business and interviews of the workers supplied, which is normally estimated to take two days.
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_71"></a>The noble Baroness asked why the age specified was 22 rather than 21, and I wondered about that myself; but 22 is used because that is the age at which the national minimum wage applies.
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_72"></a>The licensing scheme applies both to UK-based labour providers and to labour providers based overseas, so no distinction is made on the basis of a worker&#039;s nationality&#151;I will get confirmation on that. That was among the noble Baroness&#039;s opening points&#151;it was only that that reminded me that I had done it, indeed for Concordia. Paragraph 13 of the schedule to the Gangmasters Licensing (Exclusions) Regulations applies to the first day when the worker is employed and does not restrict the agency from supplying a second worker on the next day.

<a name="60516-44_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I am grateful for that response, but does that mean that that is the only occasion&#151;that it is a first and a one-off?

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_25"></a>
<a name="60516-44_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   It applies to everybody; no distinction is made, otherwise there would be a loophole for massive exploitation. Obviously, gangmasters must be licensed anyway, so we hope that there will only be good gangmasters and that they will not exploit people. But the regulations must cover everybody; you cannot send people out to work under different conditions just because they are of different nationalities. They have to work as a team, as well.
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_73"></a>I was asked why we did not do the shellfish regulations first. It was hoped that one set of licensing regulation conditions could fit both farming and shellfish gathering, but on consultation that proved not to be the case. We pushed ahead with farming so that we avoided delaying licensing any more than was necessary. I shall come back to any points that I have not covered&#151;especially the point about paragraph 13 of the schedule that the noble Baroness asked me about.

<p><a name="gc_st_31"></a>
<a name="60516-44_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Hanham </b>   rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Housing (Interim Management Orders) (Prescribed Circumstances) (England) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/369) [<i>26th Report from the Merits Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_32"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak to all the housing orders together. They are the second tranche of orders that were introduced by secondary legislation on 6 April and arise from the Housing Act 2004. I do not have an enormous amount to say on the orders, but I have some questions, which is why I have prayed against them. It would be helpful to those who are involved in private housing management to have answers to the questions that they have put to me. I fully understand the imperatives that have brought these regulations about, and I believe that much will be achieved if they are handled with a reasonably light touch within the parameters laid down.
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_80"></a>There are two elements in the orders before us. The first is intervention by the local authority when there are concerns about the antisocial behaviour of an occupier or the occupiers of a privately managed property. That is the Housing (Interim Management Orders) (Prescribed Circumstances) (England) Order 2006. This order applies when the landlord is deemed not to take sufficient action to deal with antisocial behaviour. In principle, as I indicated during the passage of the Housing Act 2004, we understand that concerns can arise from the actions of &quot;neighbours from hell&quot;. But it would be helpful if the Minister could indicate the parameters that define antisocial behaviour and when it might be deemed appropriate for a local authority to make an interim management order. Different grades of problems arise from neighbours and I wonder what would be required for a local authority to intervene. Would it be an enormous number of complaints from nearby residents or the destruction of property? It would be helpful to know.
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_81"></a>The other area covered in the orders is the licensing of houses in multiple occupation. Those trying to implement the orders have considerable anxieties. I have been briefed by the British Property Federation and the National Landlords Association. The first problem relates to the amount of time that has been allowed&#151;or not allowed&#151;between the publication of the regulations and their implementation. As part of the Government&#039;s regulation rules, there is a minimum period of three months between a regulation being published and coming into force. In the case of the three orders today, they came into effect on 6 April, with local authorities gaining their enforcement powers on 6 July.
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_82"></a>As the Minister will know, the three-month delay is meant to help small businesses&#151;in this case, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC71"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC71</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

landlords&#151;have a full three months in which to familiarise themselves with the new law and submit their license applications. However, because all the regulations were published very late landlords are not getting the full benefit of the implementation period, as most local authorities have yet to provide the specifics for implementation at local level. It is clear from information that has been obtained that few local authorities are, in fact, ready for the implementation of the scheme and the issue of licenses. How does the Minister believe implementation is to take place against a constrained timescale such as this? Further, there is the question of the costs of licences, which have been left to individual local authorities to assess, but which anecdotal evidence suggests could be as much as &#163;500 for a three-storey, five-bedroom property, which is not large in the context of houses in multiple occupancy. Does the Minister believe that there is a level that is becoming apparent as a licence charge?
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_83"></a>Many landlords are also concerned with what they see as excessive requirements in relation to amenity standards, in particular the number of bathrooms that have to be provided, and the requirements for wash hand basins in bedrooms in shared houses. In many instances it is impractical to provide them, in terms of plumbing and reasonable cost. The Government&#039;s table for the interpretation of these standards, which had to be issued to clarify the somewhat ill-drafted miscellaneous provisions regulations seems to indicate that the provision required is significantly beyond that required in normal private accommodation. Will the Minister comment on that, and on the requirements for the testing of electrical supply, which appear to be far more onerous than under previous circumstances when the testing of gas and water was introduced?
</p>

<a name="60516-44_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_84"></a>However, the main problem is a statutory instrument that does not appear to have appeared, relating to Section 257 of the Act. Regulations were due to have been published in draft at the end of January, but have still not appeared, and they are now not due until mid-June, but will still be coming into force on 6 July. That is quite unsatisfactory as it breaches two of the Government&#039;s own regulatory rules: the 12-week implementation period for new regulations and the obligation, which was to be implemented from the beginning of this year, to introduce regulations on only one of two common commencement dates, in April and October, except in exceptional circumstances, which clearly these are not. The Minister may not be in a position to make any commitment on this today, but it would be helpful if the commencement date for the regulations that are yet to be published could be moved to October, with a subsequent delay in local authorities being given their enforcement powers to that date also. I beg to move.

<a name="60516-45_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   I welcome these orders and regulations, and think that my Liberal Democrat colleagues would do the same. It is some time since we discussed them in the Housing Bill. Indeed, we spent many a long day discussing the issues with the Minister who was taking the previous orders. We went into it in some detail, although not without controversy. There are higher standards for landlords, and I appreciate that some of the matters will be difficult. I understand that it has taken the ODPM&#151;now the DCLG, if I have that right&#151;rather a long time to deal with this; partly, I suppose, because there has been quite detailed consultation. Because I am now a member of the Merits and Statutory Instruments Committee, I know that some notice was taken of issues raised by landlords and others. Nevertheless, it is unfortunate that it could not have been expedited rather more speedily.
</p>

<a name="60516-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_86"></a> Personally, it has practically been 20 years since I got involved in these issues as a new councillor in Southampton, went out with the environmental health officer to see some of these properties and realised what some of these problems are, particularly for people living in properties with poor repair and management. In parts of Southampton we had young mothers with babies living in this type of accommodation. Children were not learning to walk at the right age; there were all sorts of problems. It was interesting that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, mentioned the difficulty of getting washbasins everywhere. Having inspected these properties, I think it is pretty vital. People are living cheek by jowl, and hygiene is important. Hotels manage to have washbasins, or some sort of plumbing, in every room. It is not too much to expect.
</p>

<a name="60516-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_87"></a>The other problem is not just the people living in them, but problems for other houses in the surrounding area, where gardens, rubbish and disrepair affect everyone living in the neighbourhood. The fact that huge amounts of public money, in the form of housing benefit, have been paid for rather substandard accommodation has appalled me over the years. I raised this issue with Nick Raynsford in another place in 1995. I had high hopes that we would get this all done a lot quicker when he became Minister. Nevertheless, we are here now. I was pleased to visit an area in Newcastle during the local elections, with Liberal Democrat colleagues who are thinking of using these regulations and orders in a particular area.
</p>

<a name="60516-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_88"></a>I have one or two questions reflecting what the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said. What information does the Minister have on the level of interest in these measures from local authorities? What measures will be put in place to monitor progress? The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has raised issues that people have been concerned about. It is only right that we look at how matters turn out and whether some of our fears are real, and to help spread best practice where we find it, enabling local authorities to deal with problems if someone else has found a good way to remedy them.

</p>

<a name="60516-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_89"></a>During the passage of the Bill, I had hoped that the scope of properties subject to these regulations would be rather wider. I argued rather forcibly for that, and was grateful to Shelter for the huge amount of evidence which it provided. The Government can be assured that Shelter will monitor the progress of the licensing of houses in multiple occupation. Even if the Government is not doing its research, others out there will.
</p>

<a name="60516-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_90"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, raised how the orders have been dealt with by what was the ODPM, now the DCLG. We raised this issue on the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. We investigated how different departments deal with secondary legislation. For someone who has spent most of the past 13 years doing primary legislation in both Houses, it has been quite interesting. I did not think that it would be as interesting as it turned out to be. Perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, might like to look at that report to see what we said. We will be getting a detailed response from DCLG on what we said on that committee; we have had an interim report. I hope that the new Minister in another place will take heed of what we said and enable the DCLG to improve its performance in this area.
</p>

<a name="60516-45_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_91"></a>As I said at the beginning, however, I welcome these measures and hope that they will bring about the improvements we all want to see in this type of accommodation; not least that we will not be paying lots of money for rather inferior accommodation in the future.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_34"></a>
<a name="60516-45_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government  (Baroness Andrews): </b>  I am very grateful to the noble Baronesses for the hard work that they put in through the passage of the legislation, which I was not involved in. As with many instances when dealing with housing legislation, I know that I am in the hands of a great deal of expertise on the other side. We have come to the point now where we are dealing with implementation, and that gives us some pleasure, even if some of the things that the noble Baronesses, Lady Maddock and Lady Hanham, would have liked to have seen were not successful. I welcome the support that they have given the statutory instruments in general.
</p>

<a name="60516-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_92"></a>Both noble Baronesses know well the pressures on people living in houses in multiple occupation, how important they are as a source of accommodation and how they have always housed the most vulnerable. I take the experience of 20 years of seeing the sorts of states that people live in in those houses, in saying that it is a good thing that we have now moved to provide through regulation a national licensing scheme to include those controllers.
</p>

<a name="60516-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_93"></a>It might be worth explaining why we have five statutory instruments here instead of bundling them up into one. We felt that it was important to keep the matters dealt with in the three orders separate, because they deal with issues arising in three separate parts of the Act; Parts 2, 3 and 4. We wanted to avoid any confusion arising between what was required in relation to mandatory licensing when prescribing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC74"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC74</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which types of HMO would be subject to mandatory licensing on the one hand, and which properties could not be subject to selective licensing on the other. We also felt that the question of when to make a special interim management order had very little to do with the rest of the issues, so that was dealt with separately. We also decided that the management requirements should stand alone, because they deal with a specific set of requirements. They apply to all HMOs too, as opposed to just those that are required to be licensed. Therefore, they should not have been buried among the others. That is why we are bringing forward five provisions today.
</p>

<a name="60516-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_94"></a>The common questions asked by both noble Baronesses essentially were about preparedness, and I will start with that in describing what we are doing. I take the point about the three months, but we are where we are. I will go into a bit of detail about what we have tried to do to get local authorities up to speed, including local authorities that have had registration schemes and those that have not, which are starting from a different base entirely. It is important that we get them up to speed as much as possible. It is a challenge; there is no doubt about that. We have given high priority to putting in place a comprehensive training programme for all local authorities. We funded the Improvement and Development Agency&#151;the IDeA&#151;to train all local housing authorities in the details of implementing the licensing provisions. They are seeing more than 900 delegates from 336 local authorities in training. In addition, 800 delegates have attended an extensive programme of events across England on their role in licensing. We have also been trying to deliver a cultural change in attitude towards the problems. It is not simply a technical process; it will be about looking strategically at what they are now able to do and sharing ideas for joint working.
</p>

<a name="60516-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_95"></a>The Local Government Association has produced, in consultation with authorities and the landlord organisations, a licensing fees toolkit, which is suitable for use by all types of local authority. That has been endorsed by the IDeA, CIPFA and the Department for Communities and Local Government. For landlords and tenants, we have a paid publicity campaign in newspapers and on the radio, which is raising awareness. It began in early March and will run to the end of June. We had 200,000 hits on the dedicated website in the first two weeks, and lots of inquiries are coming in from local authorities, landlords and tenants&#039; organisations. We have set up a telephone helpline and an email address to respond to licensing inquiries. We are getting inquiries from the public and from the range of stakeholders. We had 750 email inquiries by the end of April, and they have been responded to. The feedback suggests that stakeholders are taking these opportunities on board. That is what we have tried to do. As the programme unfolds, the department and local authorities will be on the alert for anything else that we can do in the interim.
</p>

<a name="60516-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_96"></a>Matching that is the question about monitoring, which is equally important. We know the scale of the changes and we are committed to ensuring that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC75"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC75</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

measures that we are introducing should work in a very practical way. They are new, so we must monitor their effectiveness and practicability in helping to raise standards. We have commissioned the Building Research Establishment to monitor licensing and its impact upon the private rented sector, but we have also commissioned the Local Authorities Coordinating Office on Regulatory Services to provide advice to authorities on the practical application of licensing and other measures in the Act, including developing best practices. So we are trying not simply to share best practice but to aim at consistency between local authorities.
</p>

<a name="60516-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_97"></a>All that will inform a review of all aspects of the new licensing regime within the next three years, and if we conclude on the basis of evidence that changes are needed, we shall look at what needs to be done. The process of review was made clear during debate on the Bill, and we are now engaged with that process&#151;and I think that this is the right time to do that.
</p>

<a name="60516-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_98"></a>The other question that links in with this debate is the scope of the definition of what should be mandatory. I do not really want to revisit what must have been hours of debate&#151;and very well argued, I am sure; but I shall repeat briefly what must have been the argument and what remains the argument, which leads us to the question of amenities. It is essentially a question of how we protect the most vulnerable and make the best use of our resources. The choice is to spread thinly and widen the definition or to arrive at a definition of mandatory licensing that picks out the big houses with the most tenants and, therefore, the most vulnerable people.
</p>

<p><a name="gc_st_35"></a>
<a name="60516-46_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Maddock: </b>   Could the Minister indicate whether, if the regime is successful and works well, after a while the Government will consider widening it to some of the properties that we know are also a problem and also house vulnerable people?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_36"></a>
<a name="60516-46_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   We have discretionary scope for additional licensing, and selective licensing that can also be applied under specific circumstances. So it is not as if we were simply looking at one regime. In the monitoring process we shall consider whether there are things that we have missed, along with looking at the effectiveness of what we are doing. We drew the line at houses of three stories occupied by five persons. The noble Baroness referred to the consultation, and a great deal of discussion went into making that the distinction, because these are the highest risk HMOs across the field of raising standards and pose the greatest management challenges.
</p>

<a name="60516-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_99"></a>In that context, perhaps I could talk briefly about the question that was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about amenities and the landlord. I am sure that she knows, in the context of the debate on washbasins, bathrooms and hygienic facilities, there were two sorts of arguments being put&#151;either that the original definition of the requirement, that it should apply to all HMOs, should be maintained, or that it should be restricted to a smaller number that met the licensing standards. What happened in the interval <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC76"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC76</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

between 2004 and 2005 and the release of the consultation document was that, having started off with the notion that the regime should apply, as the previous guidance did, to all HMOs, we agreed after discussion and consultation that it was better applied to those houses that were licensable and had five or more tenants in them. We narrowed the scope so that it was consistent with the guidance. That was done because we believed that larger houses with larger numbers of people were the ones where there was the greatest pressure on resources&#151;bathrooms, toilets and washbasins&#151;and therefore by bringing shared houses within the scope of HMOs, as we have done in that definition, we are providing what we need where we need it.
<a name="gc_time_3"></a>
<a name="60516-46_time0"></a><h5>5 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60516-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_100"></a>The counter-argument is that it is still draconian for the landlord. We have narrowed the scope and made clear that local authorities will have discretion to allow landlords time to make the changes. Licences will not be withheld because landlords cannot put a washbasin in in the next fortnight. We are allowing a considerable time for landlords to make the necessary adjustments. As a housing Minister, I have seen the speed of construction and the way that bathrooms seem to be able to be modified and changed quite quickly these days. There is a range of new equipment that goes into bathrooms of different sizes. Providing those amenities is less onerous than it might have been some years ago. The requirement is proportionate because there is scope for the landlord to make the adjustments with the support of the local authority.
</p>

<a name="60516-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_101"></a>The other questions asked by the noble Baroness were about the cost of licences and about Section 257. We decided local authorities should be left to decide the cost of licences. We did that, for example, with high hedges, because it is a local issue, but I am not going to be drawn into high hedges. Evidence suggests that there is wide variation, so I cannot tell the noble Baroness what the average cost will be. In the regulatory impact assessment, we suggested that it would be about &#163;500. The cost in some local authorities will be lower and in others, it will be higher and we will watch that. It is important to bear in mind that those costs have to be applied to the costs of the licence and are not to be used for anything else. The fees are supposed to cover the costs undertaken by the local authority. They are to do a particular job as judged best by the local authority, but we will watch them.
</p>

<a name="60516-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_102"></a>I shall return to the other point about antisocial behaviour, but HMOs are still included in registration schemes made by local authorities under Section 257 of the 1985 Act. A further set of regulations that deal specifically with them will be made. I take the point about the timing. We aim to make the regulations in July so that they will be in force in October. The problem is, as the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said, that they have been a long time in delivery, and we do not want to delay if we can possibly avoid it. There has been consultation on this.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_37"></a>
<a name="60516-46_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   The other point is that, unlike the other regulations, there has been no draft of these <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC77"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC77</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proposals. There may have been consultation, but there have been no draft regulations, so nobody has had the opportunity to see formally what is coming up. There is that aspect as well as the fact that it will not be long before implementation. I wonder whether that date can be put back.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_38"></a>
<a name="60516-46_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   I certainly take the point that the noble Baroness is making. I will confer with my officials about that. As I said, we have consulted and will continue to consult with stakeholders.
</p>

<a name="60516-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_103"></a>I have some news from the front. My officials have just handed me a note.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_104"></a>Apparently, there will be draft regulations, so we will be able to let you have copies of those.
</p>

<a name="60516-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_105"></a>In terms of antisocial behaviour, the discretion is set out in the Act itself in relation to the interim management orders. Antisocial behaviour has to be significant and persistent. On that basis, we would not expect intermittent, casual behaviour. It has to be identifiable. ASBOs have become a more familiar part of the armoury against social disorder. Local authorities are getting more used to assessing levels of antisocial behaviour and determining the proportionate response, so there is a growing experience there. We are expecting that local authorities will draw on that and take a reasonable approach. However, they also have a clear set of criteria against which actions can be justified. They will have to be justified, because the residential property tribunal will be involved in determining issues of selective licensing. There has obviously got to be a careful and not a frivolous approach to this. Essentially, we are looking at putting in place the definition &quot;persistent and significant&quot;. Again, monitoring will pick up any inconsistent behaviour.
</p>

<a name="60516-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_106"></a>I have answered all the points that have been raised. I am very grateful for the work of the noble Baronesses over the years to see this into legislation. It is a careful set of regulatory requirements which will make a difference, particularly to vulnerable people. We look forward to seeing changes in living standards and expectations as a result.

</p>

<a name="60516-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_116"></a>This order puts into effect EU legislation on the regulation of railways. I have four questions to put to the Minister. First, the EU legislation allows metros, light railways and tramways to be excluded, but this order includes them. Why was the decision taken to include metros, light rail and tramways when they did not have to be?
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_117"></a>Secondly, should community railways be included? They are supposed to be as simple as possible. They often hang by a single financial thread. They should not be burdened by extra regulation. The order demands that they appoint a qualified engineer described in the order as a &quot;competent person&quot; who would have to be independent, insured and paid. Why is the 150-year experience of Her Majesty&#039;s Railway Inspectorate being discarded?
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_118"></a>My third question concerns the case of private railways, those for infrastructure trains only and heritage railways, which are both limited to 25 miles per hour. Heritage railways are clearly regarded more as tourism assets than as transport assets. Why are they being included? The EU legislation allows an indefinite derogation for such railways, but the order limits the derogation to two years. Why is that? Why do they not continue to seek guidance from the railway inspectorate as they have been doing in the past?
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_119"></a>Finally, on the subject of interoperability, only those lines that are seriously European-network connectable should be required to pay for modifications to meet the standards for the Trans-European Network. If they are not likely to be connectable, should they have to pay for interoperability standards?
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_120"></a>I conclude with a plea that we keep regulation of the railways, particularly minor railways, as simple as possible.

committee of the Heritage Railway Association. My particular concern with this order relates to heritage railways.
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_122"></a>As the noble Earl said, a derogation of two years is proposed by the Government in these regulations, but it is extraordinary that there is not a permanent derogation, because the new arrangements are not intended to apply to those sorts of railways. Heritage railways are an important part of our nation&#039;s tourist industry: 105 heritage railways are open to the public; they have 413 miles of track and 5.2 million passengers and 7 million visitors each year. They are a significant element of the tourist industry and it is counterproductive and unfair for them to be burdened with unnecessary regulations, particularly as they are confined to a maximum line speed of 25mph. I hope that my noble friend will be able to provide some comfort on this.

<p><a name="gc_st_51"></a>
<a name="60516-47_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   I declare an interest as chairman of a rail freight group, although I have not come to talk about rail freight this evening. I spent yesterday at the British Embassy in Berlin, hosting an event organised to demonstrate the success of the British railways structure. The chairman of Network Rail and the chairman of the Office of Rail Regulation were there and there was a large audience from politics and industry. A point made by various speakers was that not only is the accident rate on the railways down, but the rate of accident reduction has increased. The accident rate has gone down faster since privatisation. That is one of the things that people sometimes forget. Everybody thinks that because of privatisation and split responsibility accident rates have gone up. That is not what has happened: they have gone down.
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_123"></a>We had a good story, but this is an element of it that I do not feel proud of. It is now six weeks since responsibility for railway safety was transferred from the Health and Safety Executive to the Office of Rail Regulation. It seems to me that handing over responsibility to the Office of Rail Regulation was a poisoned chalice of a going-away present. The number of staff that the ORR has exemplifies that. It has 130 staff working on economic regulation and more than 200 working on safety. The only comfort is that I am told that there are not enough seats for 200 people, so it may be that the chairman and his staff are thinking of reducing the number because it is out of balance. I know that we have to comply with the safety standards that have come out of the European Commission. It is right that we should, but it has to be proportionate.
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_124"></a>When I read the draft regulations and the Explanatory Memorandum that goes with them, I sense jobsworth. To give the Committee one or two examples, paragraph 7.21 of the Explanatory Memorandum relates to what my noble friend Lord Faulkner and the noble Earl said about heritage railways:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_9"></a>&quot;Verification services&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="60516-47_para11"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_10"></a>&quot;would be charged at commercial rates, and this was known . . . when the Safety Regulations were developed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="column_GC81"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC81</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60516-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_126"></a>The fact that that was known does not mean that that was right.


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_11"></a>&quot;The cost will need to be worked into future plans for expansion of heritage networks, as is the norm for most business&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_127"></a>The memorandum does not state that there is a need for them, just that they must be done. I agree with my noble friend that a lot of people will stop doing things on heritage railways.
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_128"></a>Then we get on to paragraph 7.26:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_12"></a>&quot;The regulation of railways is always a major issue of interest to the public&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-47_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_129"></a>In the context of the viewpoint of the Health and Safety Executive, it is a major interest because it wants it to be. It gives it more credibility and more things to do and justifies more staff and more money to spend. The safety rate has come down. The train protection and warning system has had a major effect. The reference ,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_13"></a>&quot;a major issue of interest to the public&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-47_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_130"></a>is about jobsworths.
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_131"></a>Moving on to the section on purpose and intended effects, public inquiry recommendations are one of the reasons for including the existing framework driven by European requirements. I hope that public inquiries as they happened before are a thing of the past because we now have the Rail Accident Investigation Branch. It seems to be a kind of virility symbol that each inquiry has to produce more recommendations however sensible or stupid they are. Then there is a check on how many have been implemented and for what.
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_132"></a>My last example relates to risks. Paragraph 2 of the regulatory impact assessment states that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_14"></a>&quot;Major incidents are rare, but where they occur they have a large impact on individuals, society and the national economy arising directly from the deaths and injuries sustained as well as from physical disruption of the railway and indirectly by undermining public confidence in the operation of a key part of the national infrastructure&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60516-47_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_133"></a>I have heard many people talk about this, but there is no evidence to support that statement. Hatfield was a terrible accident, but it did not stop people using the railways: they went straight back on to them. This is again part of the safety mafia who hype things up for the sake of their own jobs.
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_134"></a>In the end, we have to accept these regulations now because it is too late and we need to comply with the European regulations. However, what I hope my noble friend will take away from this and one or two other debates is that, having got these regulations, let us try to cut them down and simplify them. We do not have any such regulations for roads and we certainly do not have them for the maritime industry. There is no evidence that they are required any longer if something much simpler could be produced.
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_135"></a>The noble Earl talked about interoperability and how far it should extend. For passenger lines it clearly does not need to go to the Kyle of Lochalsh&#151;I do not imagine that he is suggesting that there should be a through train from Paris to the Kyle of Lochalsh every other day. However, it is important for freight because <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC82"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC82</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

freight needs interoperable wagons and lines. The more different standards there are throughout Europe the worse things become.
</p>

<a name="60516-47_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_136"></a>Yes, we are having these regulations and yes, we need them, but I trust, hope and pray that we are not superimposing them on top of existing UK regulations so that we will have two types of regulations to comply with. I look forward to my noble friend&#039;s comments.

<p><a name="gc_st_52"></a>
<a name="60516-48_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. I am even grateful to my noble friend Lord Berkeley, although I am going to disagree with some of his comments. I am particularly grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, who stepped in for the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, who is irreplaceable in these debates. Nevertheless, the noble Earl directed some sharp questions which I will seek to respond to in a moment. We all miss the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, on such an occasion as this.
</p>

<a name="60516-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_137"></a>As the Committee will recognise, the primary purpose of the Railway and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006 is to transpose into British legislation the bulk of the European rail safety directive. I hear what my noble friends and the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, suggested: that things are going somewhat too far. Of course, we in Britain pride ourselves on the safety record of our railways. I pray that in aid against the main contention that my noble friend Lord Berkeley advanced when he asked why, in this age when railway safety is improving and when we have such devices as TPWS, we need to implement in full the European directive. The answers are first that we are obliged to and, secondly, I do not think that we are so perfectly secure about all our railways systems that we do not attach great importance to improvements with regard to safety. This is an opportunity for reinforcing that position.
</p>

<a name="60516-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_138"></a>I hear my noble friend Lord Berkeley suggesting that in certain cases that may be inappropriate; he is right. If the rail system is not to be interoperable with Europe, it does not have to comply. Where it might&#151;and the interests that he represents, as he will recognise only too clearly, have got a distinct element of interoperability over a vast range of their activities as far as freight is concerned&#151;we need to take the directive very seriously.
</p>

<a name="60516-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_139"></a>I hear what my noble friend Lord Faulkner said about heritage railways, and what he said broadened out into the areas of light rail as well. The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, also raised the point about their concerns that they should be included in the framework. My noble friend Lord Faulkner was generous enough to recognise that we have exemptions until 2010, following discussions with the department and operators. We intend during the interim period that the Office of Rail Regulation will work with the heritage and light rail sectors, the insurance industry and other interested parties to resolve remaining concerns, which generally revolve around the question of insurance for the operation of the railways. In the event that no sustainable method of applying safety verification can be developed in time, the Office of Rail <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC83</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Regulation will consider revisiting the options on how best to address the issue. I take on board my noble friend&#039;s anxieties and those of the noble Earl, but we need to address the question of insurance. We need to have a solution for light railways and particularly for heritage railways. We have got time to work on this, and we intend to work with the sector to obtain decent and appropriate solutions.
</p>

<a name="60516-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_140"></a>The noble Earl referred to community railways, but that sector has not presented to us any concerns about the regulations. We are only too happy to meet that sector and to work with it, because we recognise how important and distinctive the contribution of that sector is. Where it is functionally isolated, there is no difficulty in making the same provisions for community railways as for heritage and light railways, but the noble Earl will recognise that community railways have quite a broad perspective, and they vary quite significantly. He will recognise that one community railway operates solely on the Isle of Wight, and therefore it has an obvious exclusion element to it in terms of the way in which that railway works. We are sensitive to those concerns, and we want to encourage community railways, so we will work with them to ensure that their interests are safeguarded with regard to the regulations.
</p>

<a name="60516-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_141"></a>I make no real bones about the significance of the regulations. My noble friend Lord Berkeley said that railway safety is improving all the time, and there is a record to be proud of. But he knows the shock to the nation when things go wrong on the railway. I hear what he says that it sometimes is a very unfair comparison when you see many times more people killed in cars every day than you see killed on the railway in a year, and yet railway accidents create such dramatic response from the nation. That is in the nature of the news, and it is in the nature of the railway. That does not alter the fact that we all recognise that an event such as Hatfield has significant implications for the railway.
</p>

<a name="60516-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_142"></a>There is no way in which any responsible government can react to this situation except to seek to guarantee that the railway is as safe as possible. Where weaknesses are identified&#151;particularly those which emerged from the Hatfield crash and the public inquiry chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Cullen, into the Ladbroke Road crash from which we learnt a great deal&#151;it behoves us, of course, to address them at the appropriate opportunity.
<a name="gc_time_5"></a>
<a name="60516-48_time0"></a><h5>5.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60516-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_143"></a>We are looking to the European rail safety directive to adopt a common Europe-wide approach to rail safety. It gives us the opportunity to emphasise how committed we are to rail safety and to take action accordingly. I accept the reservations. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, would probably have been even more persistent than the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, in itemising why such exceptions should be considered. I give the noble Earl and, through him, the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC84"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column GC84</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

assurance that we will operate these regulations in consultation with those parts of the railway system which do not fit readily and straightforwardly with inter-operability with Europe and the requirement of those standards.
</p>

<a name="60516-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_144"></a>We look on these regulations as the basis for the significant position on safety that we need. We are obliged to fulfil those requirements. We also have the will to do so because rail safety is a major priority for the Government, particularly because of the points made by my noble friend Lord Berkeley. The country seems to reel from the shock of any significant problem on the railway in a way which it does not do with almost any other transport system, with the possible exception of aviation. By the same token, the aviation industry is prone to say at times that it is governed by safety regulations which guarantee that the myriads of flights which occur&#151;increasing every year&#151;are carried on in perfect safety. But when anything goes wrong, of course, it is the stuff of drama. That is the nature of both air and rail travel. We just have to respond to that.
</p>

<a name="60516-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_145"></a> I am grateful for this short debate. We miss the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and his inimitable style. He will not be satisfied with my reply, but had he been here he would have been even less satisfied with it because he would have sought to persist through illustration just why he was concerned about these regulations. However, we think that they are to the advantage of running a rail system safely. A safe rail system is by far the best form of public transport that we can offer the nation, and we should take pride in that.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_53"></a>
<a name="60516-48_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Mar and Kellie:</b>  There is no doubt that my noble friend Lord Bradshaw would have had much more to say at this moment than I do. First, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, for his support and the stress that he put on the effects of this on heritage railways. I think that I picked up from him that there are 105, which is an impressive record. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, for his support, particularly for pointing out that the number of accidents has gone down since 1994 or, presumably, since almost the start of railways, which cannot be a bad thing.
</p>

<a name="60516-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_146"></a>The Minister clearly recognised my noble friend Lord Bradshaw&#039;s monumental experience and expertise. I sit at his feet, probably underneath the soles, as an assistant spokesman. Of course, it is difficult to challenge safety. One should not challenge it, but should just ask whether it is being doled out in the wrong way. There is no doubt that unfortunately there are 300 accidents on average on the railway each year. There are 200 suicides and 100 genuinely accidental deaths, of which, on average, six are passengers. That is 300 too many, but it is a very good record by comparison with the 12 a day on the road network. During yesterday&#039;s Unstarred Question, I heard that more than 3,000 people are killed each month in the United States on the road network. That equates to a 9/11 each month, which goes unrecorded. But we are not discussing road safety in this order.

<a name="60516-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_147"></a>The Minister recognised the difficulties that these regulations may have for the minor railways. I was pleased to hear him say that the Office of Rail Regulation would review this issue during the next two years. If community railways have not raised the issue, I wonder whether they feel browbeaten by the inevitability of legislation, but that is for me to ponder on. Finally, I am extremely glad to hear the noble Lord&#039;s reply, which will be devoured with interest.

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="60516-49_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Gareth Thomas) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>I am today announcing an allocation of &#163;24 million for the climate change adaptation in Africa research and development programme. DfID is supporting this programme in partnership with the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada. We anticipate that other donors will lend support as the programme becomes established.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The total budget, combining contributions from DfID and IDRC, will be up to &#163;31.5 million. The programme will seek to identify ways in which communities, organisations and Governments in poor countries across Africa can adapt to the impacts of climate change. Climate change will impact on the poorest hardest and is likely to impair growth and poverty reduction efforts. The poor will have to cope with more droughts, more extreme temperatures and sudden and intense rainfall causing greater food and water insecurity, loss of income, higher death rates and more prevalent diseases.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>The programme will, first, provide support to African-led research in this area; secondly, help those vulnerable to climate change to learn from actual cases of climate adaptation; thirdly, help develop the capacity of African scientists and organisations to adapt to climate change; and, fourthly, establish a network of international scientists who will provide guidance, mentoring and supervisory inputs in response to requests from African researchers.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>DfID is allocating a total of &#163;24 million over five years to fund the new programme, starting in the financial year 2006&#150;07. Funding for the first two financial years&#151;&#163;9 million&#151;is part of the total &#163;255 million that DfID announced for all research in these two financial years.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>The UK economy faces a major challenge: our indigenous gas supplies are in decline and we are moving towards increasing import dependence on gas. To manage this change, new gas supply infrastructure is needed to increase Great Britain&#039;s capacity to import, store and transport gas efficiently. A regulatory environment that enables the development of timely and appropriately sited infrastructure projects is therefore vital.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The need for increased gas supply infrastructure and a regulatory environment to allow such infrastructure to be delivered to the market in a timely fashion was set out by the Government in the Energy White Paper of 2003 <sup>2</sup> : <i>Our Energy Future&#151;creating a low carbon economy</i>. It identified four challenges, one of which was securing the reliability of energy supplies. This remains integral to an energy policy that meets the needs and expectations of all energy consumers. It is being considered as part of the DTI&#039;s energy review <sup>3</sup>  in the context of the measures that are required to develop the GB market framework for delivering reliable energy supplies. It is clear that any weakness in infrastructure could push up gas prices, or result in interruptions to supply, with harmful consequences for both UK markets and UK consumers.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>The decline in our indigenous supplies has serious implications for our gas import infrastructure, storage and domestic transportation needs. The Government welcome all solutions which could help address this need and favour no particular route. The market is responding to this challenge, with actual and planned investment in gas import infrastructure, storage and related transportation of some &#163;10 billion over 2005&#150;10. The projects have the potential to make a real difference to our gas supply infrastructure; by 2010, our storage capacity could more than double and our import infrastructure is planned to more than triple.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>Ultimately, as my honourable friend the Minister for Energy noted to the House last year, failure to help facilitate such infrastructure will, immediately or over time, create difficulties in balancing supply and demand, reducing the reliability of our energy supply arrangements, with potentially disastrous consequences for the local, regional and national communities and economies.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS9"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column WS9</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60516-49_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>To meet this challenge we require a regulatory environment that enables the development of timely and appropriately sited new gas supply infrastructure projects. The current consents regime is only now starting to deal with a new tranche of gas supply infrastructure projects; we must consider how avoidable delays can be prevented in the future to ensure that these projects, and those that follow them, can commission on time if approved. This means a planning consent regime that offers more clarity for developers about processes and timescales, thereby contributing to a lower overall level of risk for developers.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>Our focus must therefore be on reducing the regulatory barriers to maximising gas supply, a view shared by the Trade and Industry Committee, and in line with this Government&#039;s focus on better regulation. We are looking to achieve this through a number of measures, as set out by my right honourable friend the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in a parliamentary debate on security of supply earlier this year. The measures will cover:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>legislation (when parliamentary time permits) to establish an offshore regime to enable innovative projects to go forward&#151;gas storage in salt caverns offshore, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) import projects with offshore unloading;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>a review of the onshore consents regimes, aiming towards simplification and streamlining of procedures, in co-ordination with the energy review, and with the Barker review of land use planning into the planning and land use system; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>measures to improve public understanding of the need for additional gas supply infrastructure projects, including onshore projects, and to promote best practice among project sponsors when applying for regulatory consents.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60516-49_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>This Statement forms an integral part of the third action, and my department is actively progressing the other measures.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>This Government believe that allowing the free operation of a competitive GB market, within an appropriate regulatory framework overseen by an independent regulator, is the most efficient way to ensure security of gas supply. Government policy establishes broad objectives, which are supported by light touch regulation. The private sector then takes commercial decisions to develop the infrastructure that can maintain and improve the reliability of energy supplies. This Government warmly welcome the potential diversity of solutions that the market is seeking to deliver. Both onshore and offshore, large and small solutions are required to meet our needs.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>The storage of gas onshore and offshore is possible only in certain geological structures, which are present in a limited number of locations in Great Britain. Such salt formations must have a certain minimum thickness in order to store gas.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>Gas is now also stored in some depleted oil and gas fields. Only one field is currently in operation but there are several others at different stages of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS10"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column WS10</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

development. These provide &quot;ready made&quot; storage structures with seals that have proven to be secure for millions of years. The nature of these structures is well known from the data collected during their development. An additional benefit is that storage in oil-bearing reservoirs can increase the amount of oil ultimately extracted from them. However, the reservoir characteristics needed for storage can be different from those needed to develop the field and not all onshore fields will be suitable for gas storage. Local planning officers should take this into consideration when making or preparing advice on planning consents.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The DTI recognises the importance of local democracy in the decision-making process, and the significant contribution that local involvement makes to the quality of decision-making. The views of all stakeholders must be taken into account. But if we are to maintain a rigorous planning system, it must also enable decisions to be taken in reasonable time. A balance must be struck between meeting the concerns of local authorities and those they represent, and the national need for infrastructure that will provide us with secure energy supplies9.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>As my honourable friend the Minister for Energy set out to the House last year10, the provision of energy infrastructure is part of a delivery system that provides an essential national service. Business and homes in the UK require a reliable supply of energy free from disruption and interruption. New energy infrastructure projects may not always appear to convey any particular local benefit but they provide crucial national benefits, which all localities share. In particular, projects add to the reliability of national energy supply, from which every user of the system benefits.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>Against the background of the clear national need for new gas storage infrastructure, it is important that developers, where they are not already doing so, start an early dialogue with planning authorities to ensure that appropriate policies are included in regional spatial strategies and local development frameworks. Where developments need to come forward ahead of changes to local planning policy, it will be vital for developers to begin an early dialogue with local planning authorities, and the community more generally, about their proposals. It will be important to ensure that the environmental impacts of their proposals are better understood, and that the national need for these developments is fully taken into account by local planning authorities when making their decisions regarding planning consents.
</p>

<a name="60516-49_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>In summary, we need timely and appropriately sited gas supply infrastructure to be delivered by the market, because:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>Great Britain is becoming increasingly dependent on gas imports, and requires new gas supply infrastructure to help ensure security of supply;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a>new projects enable extra supply and storage options if they proceed without avoidable delays;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a>there are limited locations currently suitable for much-needed gas storage projects;

<a name="60516-50_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Energy: Winter Supply</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="60516-50_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Alistair Darling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><i>Introduction</i>
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>It has been a tight winter for energy supply, and this has led to high energy prices. The energy market had taken steps to prepare for the winter, and Government worked closely with Ofgem and National Grid to ensure that all possible actions were taken to secure energy supplies. Looking ahead to next winter, I am announcing today the creation of a Business Energy Forum to look at strategic energy issues. Looking beyond next winter, I am depositing in the House a parliamentary statement of need for additional gas supply infrastructure. This sets out the economic case for taking action on planning to enable our strong energy market to deliver.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><i>Outturn for Winter 2005&#150;06</i>
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>The gas market for winter 2005&#150;06 was tighter than the previous winter. Gas supplies were maintained, but increased gas prices arising from the tight supply-demand balance were a major issue for industry as well as for domestic users. A fire at the Rough gas storage facility on 16 February 2006 led to the facility being taken out of operation, and heightened concerns about supply during the final stages of the winter. There was one gas balancing alert, on 13 March 2006, which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS12"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column WS12</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

followed the loss of the Rough storage facility, but no forcible interruptions due to supply-demand constraints. Adequate supplies of gas and electricity were successfully maintained on every day this winter.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>The market had responded to projected increased demand, with additional import infrastructure at the Isle of Grain LNG terminal, the expansion of the Interconnector import capacity, and a new storage facility, Humbly Grove. All these began operation at the start of the winter. DTI played a proactive role, working with developers and regulators to smooth the path for these developments. The Government encouraged offshore producers to be ready to maximise their production capacity in the winter, and supplies of gas direct from the offshore fields held up well throughout the winter.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>There was significant demand-side response from the electricity-generating sector. In terms of baseload generation, there was switching from gas to coal. In addition, there was some switching from gas to distillate fuel. The level of coal-fired generation was more significant than had been expected, and this clearly has implications for carbon emissions and climate change. Accordingly, the experience gained here will be taken into account by the Government&#039;s energy review.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>Other energy-intensive users also reduced demand significantly in response to high prices. The Government also worked to increase the awareness of energy intensive users of the importance of demand-side response, and had facilitated switching from gas to other fuels for power generators and other users, by working with the Environment Agency to ensure that this could be accommodated within the regulatory regime.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>Price signals would have been expected to be sufficient to incentivise full use of new import facilities. There was, however, under-utilisation of this capacity, despite strong price signals to the market, particularly early in the winter. Lower than anticipated delivery of gas from continental European sources through the Interconnector led to further increases in price. Ofgem has estimated that this cost UK consumers up to &#163;1.5 billion this year over the winter. The Government are looking into how to resolve this, supporting Ofgem and the European Commission&#039;s investigations. The Government also continue to push hard for liberalisation of the European market, including, in particular, transparency of gas stocks and movements throughout the EU.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>Throughout the winter, the Government worked closely with National Grid and Ofgem to communicate information on the gas market to Parliament, industry and the public, in particular on price. The Government recognise the difficulties faced by industrial users, particularly energy intensive energy users, and also domestic users.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>For domestic users, the Government have increased funding for tackling fuel poverty by approximately &#163;300 million over the 2005&#150;08 period. The Government&#039;s main way of tackling fuel poverty in vulnerable households in England is Warmfront. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS13"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column WS13</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Similar schemes&#151;Warm Deal, the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, and the Warm Homes Scheme&#151;also operate Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland respectively. These provide heating and insulation measures to vulnerable households. To help those on low-incomes, the Government have committed themselves to continued winter fuel payments for the duration of this Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><i>Outlook for Winter 2006&#150;07</i>
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>National Grid&#039;s draft winter consultation document, published today, indicates the supply-demand balance for gas next winter is expected again to be tight. Only a modest increase in demand is anticipated. Production of gas from the UK continental shelf, although lower than last winter, will continue to be by far the most important source of supply to the UK. Over the medium term, it will continue to contribute significantly to meeting UK demand. The balance of demand will need to be met through imports and release of gas from storage.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>The market is delivering further new import infrastructure that is due to come on line next winter. This includes the completion of the Langeled Pipeline from Norway and the further expansion of the Belgian interconnector. There are also plans for the Balgzand-Bacton pipeline from the Netherlands to be in place this winter, and the new Excelerate LNG ship import facility in Teesside has recently been announced. In addition, the Humbly Grove storage facility should have had the opportunity to fill up with gas over this summer, unlike last year. The Government are monitoring carefully progress on restoring operations at the Rough storage facility.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a>The availability of adequate import infrastructure is only one aspect of supply. The Government remain committed to the liberalised market as the means of delivering security of supply. Interactions between the UK and other markets are growing, and the Government will be working to ensure that imports through the Interconnector and imports of LNG respond to demand from the UK. We will be meeting key companies over coming months, as we did last winter, to emphasise the importance to the UK of maximising gas supply in the winter. We will continue our efforts with Ofgem and the European Commission to push for greater transparency and liberalisation in Continental European markets.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a>Electricity generation is expected to be similar to last winter, with around one-third of electricity generation capacity gas-fired. Last winter showed, however, that during periods of high gas demand, coal generation becomes significant as the base load generator, and some gas-fired generators switch from gas to distillate as an alternative fuel. The Government will be working to ensure that reliability of alternative power generation capacity is enhanced, and to ensure that the environmental regulatory regime allows flexibility for power generators to switch from gas to alternative fuels if necessary.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a>The Government are taking early action to ensure that security of supply is assured during the coming winter, and to ensure that the impacts of a tight <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS14"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column WS14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

demand-supply balance are mitigated. The Government recognise that all participants in the market have a role to play, including the gas supply industry, including producers, transporters and suppliers, users including industry, power generators and other energy intensive users, and regulatory bodies.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a>The Government are working to ensure that the best possible information on supply and demand forecasting is available to the industry. An important part of this includes working closely with National Grid, which is producing its winter consultation document, to be published by Ofgem today. The Government are also reviewing energy emergency arrangements, as part of proper contingency and emergency planning, consulting industry and other interested parties. The Government will be working closely with CBI, Ofgem, National Grid, producers, shippers, suppliers and industrial users to ensure that all possible preparations are made for next winter, that these are effectively co-ordinated, and communicated.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a>I am therefore announcing today the creation of a business energy forum. This will be a high-level group jointly chaired by my honourable friend, Malcolm Wicks, and Richard Lambert, director-general designate of the CBI. The group will provide a forum for discussion of a broad range of strategic energy issues, with a focus on security of supply next winter. Its members will include representatives from industry bodies, including the Engineering Employers Federation, the Energy Intensive Users Group, and the Chemical Industries Association, gas producers and shippers, electricity generators and suppliers and representatives of other user groups.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a>Looking beyond next winter, there is further significant investment in gas supply infrastructure planned. The need for additional infrastructure, and a regulatory environment to allow such infrastructure to be delivered to the market in a timely fashion remains a priority for this Government. That is why today I am also depositing in the House a parliamentary statement of need for additional gas supply infrastructure, which sets out the economic case for our growing need for more infrastructure, and clarifies the governmental policy context for planning and consent decisions on gas supply infrastructure projects.
</p>

<a name="60516-50_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a>The lessons of last winter are being taken into account. In the light of last winter&#039;s experience, gas supplies should be able to meet daily demand, although concerns remain about high prices. The Government remain committed to ensuring that the UK&#039;s strong energy market has the opportunity to operate effectively next winter and in the years to come.

<a name="60516-51_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a>The provision for the government indemnity scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions.

<p><a name="wms_st_7"></a>
<a name="60516-51_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Tom Watson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60516-51_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a>I would like to place on record my appreciation for the important work being done by Professor Simon Wessely and his colleagues at King&#039;s College, London, on the health of personnel who have served on Operation TELIC. Today, two papers by his team have been published in the <i>Lancet </i>summarising the initial findings of a study which the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Lewis Moonie, announced on 7 May 2003 (<i>Official Report</i>, House of Commons, col. 34WS).
</p>

<a name="60516-51_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a>The first paper, <i>The Health of UK Military Personnel who deployed to the 2003 Iraq War</i>, concludes that the vast majority of personnel who deployed have not so far experienced a statistically significant worse health outcome compared to those who did not deploy. However, the study has found that a small but measurable number of reservists (when compared either with regulars who did deploy or reservists who did not deploy) are showing some increased health effects as a result of deployment&#151;particularly for common mental disorders (such as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS17"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column WS17</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

anxiety, depression and stress), post-traumatic stress disorder and fatigue. It remains the case, though, that the reported rates of indicators of common mental ill-health for both reservists and regulars are broadly of the same order as found in the general UK population.
</p>

<a name="60516-51_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a>Professor Wessely&#039;s second paper, <i>Is there an Iraq War syndrome?</i>, analyses the patterns of illness reported by UK service personnel following deployment on Operation TELIC and compares them with those seen after the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict. He concludes that there is no sign of a repeated pattern of the illnesses, often referred to as Gulf War syndrome, reported widely after the latter.
</p>

<a name="60516-51_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a>The MoD takes the health of service personnel, both regulars and reservists, very seriously indeed and clearly this study is an important piece of work which will help us perform our duty of care to our personnel and their families. Although funded by MoD the study is independent. I welcome the conclusions published today and I am sure that they will be welcomed by the men and women who have been serving in Iraq. Clearly, it is very reassuring to know that the overwhelming majority of service personnel are returning to the UK physically and mentally well after service on Operation TELIC. The MoD&#039;s implementation of health lessons learned during Operation Granby has undoubtedly contributed to this. It is obviously especially important that we act on the key finding from the study in respect of the mental health of reservists. This is an area that we have already been monitoring closely and looking at possible solutions. I am, therefore, pleased to announce today a package of support for these particular service people.
</p>

<a name="60516-51_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a>We already offer a comprehensive physical and mental healthcare service to mobilised reservists. I will introduce later this year an enhanced post-operational mental healthcare programme for recently demobilised reservists. The programme will offer a mental health assessment, conducted by appropriately qualified members of the Defence Medical Services (DMS). This will be available to any member of the reserve forces who has been demobilised since January 2003 following deployment on any operation overseas and who has a concern about their mental health as a result. If individuals are then assessed as having a mental health problem that is categorised primarily as post-traumatic stress disorder or a related traumatic adjustment disorder, and that is directly related to their operational deployment and of a nature that can be treated within the resources of the DMS, they will be offered out-patient treatment by the DMS.
</p>

<a name="60516-51_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a>If the assessment identifies cases that fall outside the parameters set out above, such as complex multi-disorder diagnoses or acute cases requiring in-patient care, the DMS will refer them&#151;with our assessment results&#151;on to the appropriate NHS providers in order to assist their access to NHS treatment, as well as encouraging contact with the relevant welfare organisations to ensure follow-up.
</p>

<a name="60516-51_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a>I will make a further announcement in a few months to confirm the details of the service that will be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS18"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column WS18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provided, including the location(s) at which the assessments will be provided, and the date on which the service will commence.
</p>

<a name="60516-51_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a>This scheme will complement work we have in hand to improve the understanding of military mental health issues in general across the NHS, and ensure that the necessary services are available for veterans of whatever age suffering from mental illness. This work involves health departments, the NHS providers and the charitable sector, and I hope to announce details on the outcome of this work later this year when it is completed.
</p>

<a name="60516-51_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a>Given the current findings of Professor Wessely&#039;s work, and his view that it would be premature to conclude that there has been no health effect as a. result of deployment to Iraq, my department is considering carefully the recommendation that further follow-up research is required. I understand that Professor Wessely plans to publish further results in due course.

<a name="60516-52_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Terrorism: Rail and Underground Passenger Screening</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_8"></a>
<a name="60516-52_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60516-52_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a>We announced in November last year that the Department for Transport will be undertaking a small number of trials at stations on London&#039;s surface and underground rail networks, to test the effectiveness of passenger screening equipment in an operational environment.
</p>

<a name="60516-52_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a>The first trial took place on the platforms for the Heathrow Express at Paddington station over a four-week period during January and February of this year. The data from the trial have been analysed and will be included in the final trial report.
</p>

<a name="60516-52_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a>The next phase of the project will be held at stations on the London Underground and will test equipment that can detect traces of explosives on passengers and their belongings.
</p>

<a name="60516-52_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a>Following consultation with London Underground, the British Transport Police and other stakeholders, Canary Wharf and Greenford have been chosen to host the next series of trials.
</p>

<a name="60516-52_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a>The trial at Canary Wharf will begin on Wednesday 17 May and will also run for a period of around four weeks. The trial will test the use of a document scanner, a finger scanner and a cabin baggage X-ray machine. Each day a small number of randomly selected passengers will be invited to take part, although any participation will be entirely voluntary. There will be minimal disturbance to the station&#039;s operations and the flow of passengers throughout the day will not be affected.
</p>

<a name="60516-52_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a>Once the trial at Canary Wharf trial has been completed, a similar trial at Greenford station will begin in which equipment that can analyse explosive <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS19"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column WS19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

traces on clothing and bags using swabbing and air samples will be tested.
</p>

<a name="60516-52_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a>Furthermore, in conjunction with the British Transport Police, we shall be trialling the use of explosives-sniffing dogs at a main London station and a major regional station, also for a limited period.
</p>

<a name="60516-52_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a>The sole purpose of these trials that we are undertaking is purely to test their application in a genuine rail environment. They are not direct measures to enhance security at these stations. No decisions have been taken on the future use of this equipment, all the data and feedback we can gain during the tests are merely to help inform any future judgments.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS20"></a>

<b>16 May 2006 : Column WS20</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60516-52_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a>The UK&#039;s railway system is a network made up of 2,500 stations and 11,000 miles of track. It carries 1 billion passengers a year. The British public understand that a closed security system on a rail network of this size is unworkable.
</p>

<a name="60516-52_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a>However we must still aim to cut down the risks as much as possible, while still allowing people to go about their day-to-day business.
</p>

<a name="60516-52_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a>No single security measure is either foolproof or capable of mitigating every threat so we need to keep a range of measures available. It is therefore important that we not only consider both existing and emerging technologies but that we subject them to vigorous tests in a mix of authentic environments to see just how effectively they can contribute towards keeping our networks as safe and efficient as possible.

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="60516w01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The Licensing Act 2003 and the associated statutory guidance are founded on four key objectives: the prevention of crime and disorder, public safety, the prevention of public nuisance and the protection of children.
</p>

<a name="60516w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>The guidance to licensing authorities is therefore not an appropriate vehicle for the promotion of public health issues and cannot make mandatory provisions about signage in this regard.

<a name="60516w01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The review of the guidance issued under Section 182 of the Licensing Act 2003 will not consider the issue of adding a supplement to the licence fee in order to fund local authority costs for any campaigns designed to reduce the impact of alcohol abuse. That is because changes to the fees regime could not be effected through amendments to the guidance. Primary legislation would be required to widen the coverage of fees beyond recovering licensing authority costs for administration, enforcement and inspection. The Government have no plans to make such a change.
