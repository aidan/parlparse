In May 2008, we produced guidance for schools on tackling bullying involving children with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>

Is she, however, aware that Mencap has seen no reason to revise its findings on the prevalence of this appalling scourge? Is not bullying and brutality against such vulnerable disabled children on this scale deeply shaming both of its perpetrators and of the educational environments in which it thrives; and will she now ask Ofsted urgently to undertake a full review of its incidence, school by school, and name those still in default even of their legal duty to publish a disability equality scheme?</p>

He has decades of experience of raising awareness of disability concerns, and this issue in particular. I reassure him that we take this matter extremely seriously and appreciate that Mencap does not feel ready to revise its findings. We will work with Mencap and others, and, as my noble friend suggested, are already talking to Ofsted about the potential to extend its review of SEN, which was committed to in the <I>Children&#146;s Plan</I>, to include precisely this issue.</p>

In September 2008, we made a commitment to put a statutory duty on schools to record incidents of bullying. Of course, the noble Lord is suggesting that the records of those incidents should reflect the cause. We will consult very shortly on the nature of that guideline and, in particular, will consult organisations such as Mencap and other members of the disability lobby.</p>

Looking at how incidents involving bullying can be defused is all part of that issue. The noble Baroness raises a very important concern.</p>

I shall come back to my noble friend or discuss this with her further. I am sure my noble friend shares my concern that all children should be able to learn in an environment where they are free from any form of bullying, whatever the strange rationale for it might be.</p>

It sounds as though the Government are now pursuing a positive policy of encouraging all children to offer help and support rather than indulge in bullying. Can the Minister reassure us that that really is happening across schools and that there are very good examples, such as that provided by the Nurture Group Network, of schemes encouraging pupils, from nursery onwards?</p>

As I understand it, they are likely to increase. What steps are the Government taking to reduce those numbers and when will we be in a position to see whether those measures are working? In parenthesis, I listened to the Prime Minister at Question Time this morning. Although he showed a proper degree of regard for the welfare of the unemployed, he had very little, if anything, to say about actual measures to reduce the numbers of unemployed.</p>

Of course, these figures are disappointing and, of course, the Government take them very seriously. We know there has been an intensification of the global financial crisis&#151;the latest data, in particular from the US, demonstrate that&#151;which impacts on economies around the world, including in the UK, but as a Government we have a choice; to do nothing, sit back, wring our hands and wait for the market to address it, or to be active. That is what we have been. I take noble Lords back through October in terms of what we have done in banking recapitalisations, support for the banking industry, the DIUS redundancy support package, the extra support for small firms, the Pre-Budget Report and the fiscal stimulus, the homeowner mortgage support scheme, changes to the credit guarantee scheme, new apprentices, the job summit announcement and more. We have active labour market policies.</p>

We are faced with an Opposition who are basically a do-nothing Government on this issue. Let us contrast it with the historical position. The employment level at its worst in 1992-93 under the noble Lord&#146;s Government was 25 million; it is now 4 million higher, despite recent reductions. The unemployment level at that time was more than 3 million, and we are now 1.1 million below that. Our record is strong, but there is much still to do.</p>

Deflation has arrived, with retail prices falling by 2.5 per cent over the past three months. After these dire unemployment figures, when are the Government going to do something to get money into the pockets of people who really need it, and who will spend it, starting with a good rise in the basic state pension?</p>

In relation to the banking sector, we started by recapitalising it to make sure it had a strong capital base, and other measures have flowed since, in particular those announced on 19 January, to try to get liquidity flowing through the banks. It is important that we do that. Noble Lords on this side, my noble friend Lord Myners in particular, have been heavily engaged in doing just that.</p>

The final point he made is right. We believe in proactive labour-market policies. We are going to come through this difficult time at some stage, and when we do, we need to make sure that people are in a position to be able to take advantage of the upturn when it can be achieved.

When is the &#147;do something&#148; going to have an effect? Last October, they gave &#163;38 billion to the banks; this week they have given &#163;500 billion to the banks. When is that &#163;538 billion likely to lead to a reduction in unemployment? Will it be this year? Are the Government really facing up to the reality?

That is why the Government believe that safeguarding children is one of our highest priorities. It is also why we also believe that helping children to stay safe is the responsibility of all of us. I would advise anyone who has a concern about the safety of a child, whether or not they may be privately fostered, to contact their local authority and, in the case of private fostering, to make sure that they report their concerns to the private fostering unit.</p>

We are all grateful to the Minister for his care and attention on this extremely difficult issue. Having said that, the fact that the Minister felt it desirable to have that briefing and that so many Members of your Lordships&#146; House attended demonstrates the importance of achieving clarity on the issue to which Amendment No. 31 refers.</p>

<a name="90121-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09012149000073"></a>The purpose of this amendment to Clause 2(2) is to ensure really effective consistency and co-ordination between the MMO and the devolved Administrations. Where such an Administration are delivering activities within the UK marine area, there is currently no effective requirement in the Bill for the MMO to co-ordinate with it. Clearly, it is extremely important to ensure that an ecosystem approach to marine resource management is effective. On these Benches, we believe&#151;and Committee Members on other Benches may perhaps agree&#151;that it is necessary urgently to address this general objective for the MMO.</p>

<a name="90121-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09012149000074"></a>It is clear that marine activities are not restricted to any political borders, least of all in the seas around our islands. The management regime must therefore reflect that. We believe that the marine environment must be seen to be dealt with holistically; cross-border areas will, therefore, have to be managed effectively.

<p><a name="09012149000192"></a>It is not, in our view, sufficient to leave that to further secondary legislation or to guidance and instruction following thereafter. It also seems to me extremely important to go one step beyond the Joint Committee, by considering the relationship with the Northern Ireland Administration&#151;another point raised at yesterday&#146;s briefing&#151;and, indeed, that of the Republic of Ireland.

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09012149000076"></a>While Clause 2 seeks to ensure a &#147;consistent and co-ordinated&#148; approach to marine management within the MMO area, there remains a gap, given the need for the MMO to co-operate with the activities of equivalent bodies in the various Administrations outwith its area. If the MMO is to be the strategic delivery body for the UK marine area that we all hope and intend, it should clearly be obliged to co-operate with devolved equivalents through a Memorandum of Understanding, and to reach co-ordinated decisions for areas with a mix of reserved and devolved functions.</p>

<a name="90121-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09012149000077"></a>There are probably several options to meet that requirement. The Minister might be able to indicate which option is preferred, but there clearly has to be one and it cannot be left in the air. The effective purpose of this amendment is to require the Bill to indicate the Government&#146;s preferred option. There could be a joint body, for example, or a series of joint bodies or regional fora, following how this problem was faced in the JNCC model for UK conservation bodies as set out in Part 2 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. That involved the establishment of a joint body or bodies with distinct functions to advise on matters of common concern.</p>

<a name="90121-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09012149000078"></a>The Joint Committee on the draft Marine Bill adopted that approach. Paragraph 201 of its report suggested that,</p>
<ul><a name="09012149000208"></a>&#147;the Government consider cooperative approaches towards the Irish Sea, similar to those of existing regional seas commissions, involving the devolved administrations (and the Governments of Ireland and the Isle of Man) to work together collectively to produce agreement on the coordination of spatial planning, fisheries and nature protection ... in the Irish Sea, the Solway Firth and Bristol Channel&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012149000193"></a>Any brief look at the maps produced by the Minister and his team yesterday will obviously demonstrate the need for that co-operative and co-ordinated approach. We cannot wave maps around to any good effect in your Lordships&#146; House&#151;<I>Hansard</I> does not record it&#151;but all those Members who took advantage of yesterday&#146;s briefing will agree that that approach is clearly extremely important, and I therefore hope that the Government will give further consideration to the recommendations of the Joint Committee. Another way would of course be to impose a specific duty on the MMO and devolved

Whether that would work or whether it is better to seek some form of specific mechanism is a matter on which Members of the Committee will hope to hear from the Minister. In the mean time, I beg to move Amendment 31.</p>

In doing so, perhaps I may echo the sentiments of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, about the difficulties we have with business taking place in the Moses Room at the same time. We hope that we will hear before too long from the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, because we always value his contribution.</p>

<a name="90121-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09012149000080"></a>Once again, the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and my noble friend have tabled amendments that appear to seek to address much the same concerns. They are an effort to assign a little more meaning to the rather airy hope that the Marine Management Organisation will act in a way that is &#147;consistent and co-ordinated&#148;, as it is put in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90121-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09012149000081"></a>The MMO&#146;s area of responsibility is not an isolated and hermetically sealed area of water where policies can be implemented in laboratory conditions. On our first day in Committee, my noble friend Lord Kingsland argued powerfully that the marine environment should be seen as an ecosystem and that decisions should be made with full awareness of the consequences not only for the environment in the immediate area but potentially for that in remoter areas as well. The MMO must therefore take note of the effect of its decisions not only in areas within its remit but in those outside its boundaries. Similarly, it will have to be aware of decisions taken in nearby areas by other organisations.</p>

<a name="90121-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09012149000082"></a>Amendment 42 would therefore ensure proper consultation, rather along the lines that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, was talking about, with bodies that have similar responsibilities in areas likely to affect the MMO&#146;s area. Such bodies could be devolved Administrations, land-based organisations or international bodies.</p>

<a name="90121-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09012149000083"></a>Amendment 65 goes a little further into the devolution of performing functions under the MMO and seeks to ensure that a formal arrangement is made with the relevant bodies to ensure that difficult decisions are handled appropriately and effectively. It is all too easy for an area to be overexploited by one organisation and for the cost of repair to fall on another. The amendments would prevent that. I have no doubt that various agreements could be drawn up without Amendment 65. The Bill contains several measures in Clause 15&#151;for example, to ensure that the agreement is publicly available&#151;that would be of benefit to any Memorandum of Understanding. I hope that the Minister will consider establishing to a much greater extent interactions between the MMO and the enormous variety of relevant bodies that will be critical to its work.</p>

Perhaps I may probe in particular whether the Government expect the MMO to collaborate and co-operate at a practical level with organisations that have responsibility for the heritage&#151;the cultural heritage, if you like&#151;of the sea, particularly with English Heritage?</p>

The amendment would give some teeth to the general objective on page 2 of the Bill, especially where bodies and legislatures are coterminous, so that there is no doubt about the status of agreed co-operation between them. Hence, the MMO&#146;s co-operation with bodies that have the same functions in the UK would be the subject of memoranda of understanding&#151;I think particularly of agreements struck between the Welsh Assembly Government and the MMO. The nature and detail of what was contained in the agreement to co-operate in certain circumstances would then be quite clear.</p>

<a name="90121-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09012149000086"></a>I am thinking in terms of what may occur in the Irish Sea, the Severn Estuary or on the north Wales coast if both the Welsh Assembly Government and the MMO were involved. The same may, of course, apply with the other devolved Administrations, and I am sure there will be comments on that. Where Wales is concerned, it may be appropriate to secure, as we heard yesterday, a fair and equal marine boundary between Wales and the Republic of Ireland. It would prove beneficial in a UK context in stabilising, for example, offshore fishermen in the Irish Sea. A Memorandum of Understanding there would be extremely helpful.</p>

<a name="90121-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09012149000087"></a>With regard to the Conservative Amendments 42 and 65, Amendment 42 refers to the MMO only having to consult with any relevant body with functions in adjacent areas. No agreement would be struck, only consultation. Amendment 65 refers to an agreement and as such is more acceptable. But a Memorandum of Understanding, as in Amendment 31, is by far the best outcome. It would ratify an agreement and produce an important reference document.</p>

I ask the Minister, for the record, whether the Government are contemplating publishing maps of that kind as part of the Bill when finally it becomes an Act. It would help legislators and those who have to operate this legislation. Whatever the Government do about formalising the means of consultation, the motto should be as simple as possible. It is going to be a very difficult job for the devolved Administrations, the MMO and others to operate this. To leave it completely informal probably will not work. Something will have to happen but the least complicated way will be the right way. I hope that is what the Government will use as their watchword.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09012149000089"></a>I am increasingly worried about how this Bill, which seemed on the face of it to be a good idea, is going to operate. It is an example of the problems of devolution. We all want devolution to work as smoothly as possible but this is an example of what happens when functions overlap between the various bodies. It is going to be very difficult indeed, so it will be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say about these amendments.</p>

For that reason, perhaps more than any other, the importance of &#147;co-operation&#148;, which is the word mentioned in the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Tyler, is vital.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09012149000091"></a>I declare an interest as a member of the Commission on Scottish Devolution. I chair within that commission a small task group looking at intergovernmental and inter-parliamentary relationships. In our first report we highlight the need for improved relationships and better understandings where there is cross-border activity. Obviously, as has already been said by my noble friend Lord Tyler, when dealing with the marine environment, you can put boundaries on a map but it does not necessarily affect what will happen at sea. There are clearly interactions in different parts of the marine environment and therefore, again, co-operation is vital. If the Minister was minded to accept this amendment or if a similar amendment was brought forward, in the interests of comity it would be important when the Scottish Government bring legislation before the Scottish Parliament, as they indicated they intend to do, that a similar duty of co-operation is placed on Marine Scotland. It is important that we get that mature relationship between the various bodies that will have responsibility.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09012149000092"></a>I note that in their response to the Joint Committee report, which was referred to by my noble friend Lord Tyler, the Government suggested that the British-Irish Council might be an appropriate forum. I see some advantages in that in as much as it brings together the Administrations not only Scotland, the United Kingdom and Wales, but those of the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, not to mention Jersey and Guernsey. However, in a previous incarnation, I took part in a number of meetings of the British-Irish Council and unless it has materially changed in the past two and a half years, I do not get the impression that that body could get down to the kind of detail that would be required in dealing with this. Therefore, I very much support the thrust of what my noble friend Lord Tyler and indeed the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, said about co-operation and I hope that the Minister will be able to say something in response about the importance of that and how it might be embodied in the Bill.</p>

He made what I thought would be a cameo appearance. Alas, it was all too short. I reiterate again&#151;although I did not think I received much positive response from those usual channels who were present at the time&#151;that I sympathise with noble Lords on this matter. Indeed, I attended the debate on local government two days ago only to listen to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, being concerned about the Government trying to be too explicit about what should be done at local level. Alas, he is not here to argue that point as we debate an important group of amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09012149000094"></a>I appreciate the thanks given to my officials for the maps that were produced yesterday. I echo noble Lords&#146; thoughts that this is rather complex. As we went through the maps yesterday, the complexity became ever more apparent. The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, spoke about publishing the maps with the Bill. I am not sure about publishing them as part of the Bill because I suspect that that would involve some legal niceties. I take her point, but I disagree with her pessimism about the Bill. I will certainly make sure that when, as we hope, this Bill becomes an Act, such maps will be made available to the people who actually have to operate and understand the new system. That was a fair point to make.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09012149000095"></a>Of course, I accept the general proposition put forward that inevitably, given the interrelationship between UK Government&#146;s responsibilities, the devolved Administrations&#146; responsibilities and the Executive devolvement of authority, the fact that there are different sets of arrangements in different parts of the Bill is very important. All those who will be involved in ensuring that this Bill when enacted works in practice need to co-operate together. The question is whether the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, is the right one. A more fundamental question is that raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, about whether you need a formal arrangement, and, if you do, can it be kept simple as possible? It is not easy to answer that. I say right at the beginning that I will be reflecting on this debate between now and Report.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09012149000096"></a>I will take a little time to describe the philosophy that we see underpinning the need for co-operation. Certainly, we see a range of formal and informal arrangements, depending in part on the nature of the organisations concerned, the potential impact of their remit on the MMO&#146;s activities and the complexity of the interdependence of their respective roles and responsibilities.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09012149000097"></a>On the question of a memorandum of understanding, in some cases that will be entirely appropriate, but the organisations may not wish to have one. We think that the most appropriate form of arrangement in each case will be decided through mutual discussion and agreement. Any decisions to be taken on behalf of the MMO will be a matter for its board in due course.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09012149000098"></a>I want to reassure noble Lords that we plan to make more information available later this year as we continue to work on the transition from existing systems to the new body. The noble Duke seeks to include provision in Clause 2 to require the MMO to consult any relevant body with functions in the areas adjacent to, affecting or near the MMO&#146;s area. I want to make it clear that, in the objectives set for the MMO, normal good practice on consultation will apply. This is already the case in relation to the existing Marine and Fisheries Agency whose functions will be subsumed by the MMO, and we will continue to expect consultation to take place with relevant bodies in adjacent areas as necessary. I am yet to be convinced that we have to make that a statutory part of the MMO&#146;s duties, though I am listening to the debate today. We want the MMO to develop strong and effective engagement with its key delivery partners as well as with the full

As an example, the MMO will be required to consult relevant bodies when making licensing decisions.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09012149000099"></a>We plan to engage with stakeholders&#151;if I can use that wretched term&#151;including relevant regional and local bodies in the marine planning process. It is obviously vital that regulators, coastal communities and a range of individual organisations with an interest in the marine and coastal environment are all to be involved in developing marine plans. Those organisations need to work together to facilitate that process and to make it transparent. The MMO will publish a Statement, known as a Statement of Public Participation, when beginning to develop each plan, setting out how stakeholders will be involved at each stage. This will include consideration of the nature of the coastal community and marine users affected in each plan area.</p>

That shows that it is often unnecessary to lay it down in statute because, in the main, organisations behave in a sensible way. Any sensible organisation in the marine area will understand that, in order for there to be a coherent approach to all the matters encompassed by this Bill, people should work together. One of the debates is on the question: how far does one need to make it explicit and, if one does, would the fears of the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, be realised? It could lead to complicated arrangements which would defeat the object of the exercise.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09012149000102"></a>I understand the questions that have been raised about the devolved Administrations. The maps we looked at yesterday clearly illustrate some of the complexities. The devolved Administrations will be carrying out functions in adjacent areas; for example, through bodies that they establish, such as Marine Scotland. In the case of the Welsh Assembly Government, their intention is not to set up a separate organisation but to undertake the work through the good offices of officials within the Assembly. I gather that might also be the conclusion of the Northern Ireland Executive. The reason why there are technical issues here is that it would not be normal practice for a delivery body of one Administration&#151;the MMO, for instance&#151;to enter into a formal agreement with another Administration. Rather, it will be for the Governments to decide between them how the delivery bodies might need to work together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09012149000103"></a>On this point, there is very good news. The work in pre-legislation was very helpful in encouraging the Government and devolved Administrations to come together. During the discussions, we promulgated the idea of setting up ways in which to work through a concordat between us to deliver agreements on joined-up marine planning. I believe that across policies in the  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1680"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1680</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bill we, as Ministers, will need to work with colleagues in other Administrations to ensure joined-up ways of working, which can then be turned into guidance or direction to the MMO for delivery in the areas for which we have responsibility. It would be perfectly possible for the devolved Administrations to do the same in relation to their officials, if their officials are responsible, or to any agencies that they so establish.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09012149000104"></a>I do not think that that sort of concordat approach between the UK Government and the other Administrations is without merits. There is a great deal to be said for it, and it does not mean to say that there will not be close collaboration between the Administrations. That will clearly need to be continued. In Clause 26(2), the Bill already allows for the devolved Administrations in Northern Ireland and Wales to ask the MMO to take on functions on their behalf and provides for the MMO to charge for such services.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09012149000105"></a>My initial conclusion is that, while I accept that there is a strong argument for doing everything we can to ensure that close collaboration takes place between all the partners who have to make it work, there are some practical issues about placing duties on the MMO to reach memorandums of understanding with officials in another Administration or, indeed, with agencies set up by another Administration. I recognise that noble Lords need to be convinced that this will work together and that we have the collaborative arrangements and machinery in hand. On that basis, I hope noble Lords will accept that I shall go away and consider what further work needs to be done, although they also need to know that I am sceptical about establishing very formal agreements, for the reasons I have stated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09012149000107"></a>We have had a lot of talk about consultation, concordats and co-operation. There is one aspect of this that worries me. The bodies responsible are going to deal with stocks of value, such as fish. As the Minister said, in referring to Clause 26, they will also deal with charging. I should tell the Committee of my own bitter experience as chairman of the National Rivers Authority, when we were responsible for looking after the salmon coming into the Solway Firth. Eventually, if they survived, they entered Scottish waters. Most of them did enter Scottish waters and most of them were caught in Scottish rivers. We in the National Rivers Authority, south of the border, incurred very considerable charges and decided that we must seek to recover them from Scotland. There was nearly a war. I cannot describe the anger and the fury that was created. A former colleague in another place, later a Member of this House, now sadly no longer with us, led a violent campaign against the iniquity of the National Rivers Authority in thinking that it could charge the Scots for those services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09012149000108"></a>I mention that experience to indicate that such subjects may be extremely difficult and delicate; not always to be sorted out by consultation. I hope that when the Minister gives further thought to the matter he will give particular thought to the problem of

When the noble Lord talked about the angst of Scottish fishermen and fee increases it took me back to the early 1970s when we in Birmingham had to start paying for the water that came from Wales, the supply line for which, the noble Lord will know, we had built some years before. That is a sensitive area. Looking at the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, I wish that I had not gone there. I understand his point and I put the point back to him that unless the UK Government and the devolved Administrations work together, there could be problems for those affected by the Bill&#146;s provisions. That is not in doubt. The question is whether establishing some complicated duties that would have to be considered in relation to the devolution settlement will prove to be extremely tricky.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09012149000111"></a>I am heartened by the meeting that took place in the summer between Ministers in the UK Government and the devolved Administrations, which led to the joint statement of determination to work together. As I have said, this is not the last word. I am anxious about putting in the Bill complicated machinery, but I understand the point about the need for us to ensure that co-operation takes place.</p>

It has been helpful, not least in the way in which the Minister responded. There is one aspect to which the Minister may like to respond now, to which my noble friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness referred. What is unusual about this legislation is that it has been developed in parallel with similar legislation in the Scottish Parliament, and therefore it would be possible for that reciprocity not effectively to be given expression in the two pieces of legislation because they are simply coming together. It would be possible, for example, in the Bill that I understand is to be placed before the Scottish Parliament that Marine Scotland may have put in place some sort of mechanism that does not match anything in the UK legislation.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09012149000113"></a>I wonder whether, in reflecting on that matter&#151;if he does not have an instant reflection&#151;the Minister could give specific expression to it, because it is unusual. Consultation goes so far, but when a legislative process is taking place in two different places at the same time, it seems that the potential for confusion is considerable.</p>

Secondly, I will of course ask my officials to look into it further to see what further information can be gathered about developments in Scotland.

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09012149000116"></a>I shall not go up the salmon rivers of Scotland but I do want to be reassured on whether a concordat is sufficient. The Minister has already gone a long way to doing so, but I hope he will give it further thought. It is at the crux of this. Yes, it is normal practice. Yes, we understand that conversation is taking place all the time&#151;no doubt dialogues are always happening behind the scenes. However, it is important that those of us who are responsible for looking at the detail of UK legislation are properly reassured that that legislation is sufficiently robust when it comes to the difficult problems that may well arise.</p>

I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, will speak to the amendment, because we on these Benches and she share anxiety on the point. We believe that the so-called Sandford principle, which was so important to those of us involved in the national parks, should be seen as a possible model for the Bill.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09012149000120"></a>The amendment sets out a number of general objectives that would strengthen the MMO&#146;s objective base. The evidence we have received so far from a large number of NGOs has been to the effect that they are concerned that the current provision is too weak and needs strengthening. The amendment therefore sets out a number of specific objectives, from (a) to (d), whereby we seek to adapt the list incorporated in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 and give it a marine tinge. We are taking Parliament&#146;s previous decision on these matters and adapting it appropriately to the marine environment. The list includes,</p>
<ul><a name="09012149000209"></a>&#147;promoting marine conservation and protecting and enhancing biodiversity and habitats ... conserving and enhancing the marine landscape including the seabed and geological features ... promoting the study, understanding and enjoyment of the marine environment ... undertaking research and providing information and advice to the Secretary of State and other public bodies, and generally on all aspects of the UK marine area and the social and economic uses which take place in it&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012149000194"></a>It is a simple read-across from the previous legislation, and it is important to include it.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09012149000121"></a>I should underline that we have also made reference in a separate new subsection&#151;I hope the Minister accepts that it covers a lacuna in the Bill&#151;to the general objective to,</p>
<ul><a name="09012149000210"></a>&#147;work closely with coastal communities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012149000122"></a>That will have an important resonance when the Bill reaches the other place. Members of the Committee who have represented a coastal community, as I have, will recognise that it is critically important that these objectives are accepted and owned by those who live along our coasts. If coastal communities feel that this policy is being imposed on them and the MMO&#146;s objectives do not sufficiently recognise these communities&#146; role in developing the policy, then the policy will fail. In developing the MMO&#146;s role it is extremely important that we take with us the population of those communities as well as those whose livelihoods depend on the sea.</p>

<a name="90121-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09012149000123"></a>This is a bit of a portmanteau amendment which adopts some important objectives from previous legislation. But it also addresses the issue of involving coastal communities in the development of these policy objectives. I hope the Minister will respond specifically on that. I beg to move.</p>

It is a significant omission which should be corrected.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90121-0004.htm"/>


<a name="90121-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09012149000125"></a>On our first day in Committee the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, made it clear that we should not worry because, in addition to the more vague objectives in the Bill, the Marine Management Organisation would have to operate within the new marine policy statement and the guidance given by the Secretary of State. We believe that that is not enough. The Joint Committee report states that by failing to define &#147;sustainable development&#148; the Bill,</p>
<ul><a name="09012149000211"></a>&#147;leaves undefined a core ethos, by which it proposes that the marine environment be managed&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09012149000126"></a>and that this &#147;creates uncertainty&#148;. This group of amendments therefore seeks to define the MMO&#146;s functions more clearly and precisely. Amendment 32 is similar to mine but I prefer my drafting as it provides a wider range of more specific duties to which the MMO must have regard.</p>

<a name="90121-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09012149000127"></a>We on these Benches envisage the MMO as the organisation to resolve the inevitable conflicts between groups with different concerns, not as one more lobby group itself. As Amendment 33 makes clear, the MMO will have a huge variety of concerns, functions and objectives. The list, of course, is not exhaustive, and even the desirability of some of the items listed is open to debate. But the list still indicates and serves to show the balance that the MMO must strike in its activities.</p>

<a name="90121-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09012149000128"></a>However, all the items are relevant to sustainable development, and many are specifically mentioned in the Bill. Some&#151;such as paragraphs (b) and (g)&#151;focus on the conservation element. Other criteria make it clear that our marine environment is a dynamic resource that is capable of providing food, energy and recreation. Others highlight promises that the Government have made and targets which they themselves have set. All the criteria are important; the question of which is the most important is impossible to answer.</p>

<a name="90121-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09012149000129"></a>The MMO must be capable of making decisions about the marine environment despite these conflicting concerns. It would be counterproductive for these decisions to be second-guessed and continually challenged by the more narrowly focused lobby groups and stakeholders involved. I should be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s views on this and to hear a fuller explanation of how the MMO will be expected to weigh the different interests in which it will be engaged.</p>

At the moment, this issue feels a bit like a circus act where you have two horses, with a foot on each, but the horses are diverging rather rapidly. We are in the middle of the debate about the general objective of the Marine Management Organisation. We debated it to some extent at the previous Committee sitting and we are debating it now, and I hope that we can persuade the Minister that there is sufficient unrest for there to need to be a radical review of the general purpose before Report.</p>

<a name="90121-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09012149000131"></a>There is a range of views. At one end is the even-handed view that all the purposes listed in Amendments 32 and 33 need to be weighed up by the MMO in reaching

<a name="90121-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09012149000132"></a>With that in mind, having promoted the Sandford principle during our previous day in Committee, I put my name to the definition of the natural environment in Amendment 179. It clarifies what I consider to be an extremely important and basic objective of the Marine Management Organisation. We should press the Minister to take note of the very real unrest that I think exists on all sides of the Committee about the flabby nature of the current objective as stated in the Bill and to come back with something which, although it may not go as far as I want, certainly goes further than the Bill does in its current flabby way.</p>

However, it is a long way from the view that there should be &#147;no development here&#148;, about which he is so apprehensive. In fact, it is a tie-breaker principle that says that the national parks have a series of objectives&#151;I think that there are three or four&#151;the first of which is nature conservation and landscape protection. The others relate to access, recreation, education and economic development. It says that the aim of the national park system should be to deliver all those objectives but, if push comes to shove and at the end of the day there is a landscape or natural environment issue that is not a run-of-the-mill resource but an important national resource, that should take precedence if there is no way of finding a solution that combines all the objectives. Therefore, it really is a principle of last resort and not a &#147;don&#146;t come here&#148; proposition, which we do not want to see in the marine environment. The marine environment is incredibly important for a whole variety of social, environmental and economic purposes, and we want to see the Marine Management Organisation focus on those in such a way that they are all delivered. However, we have to give it a bit of help by saying that, if it gets absolutely stuck and cannot find a way of doing all of them, ultimately one must have pre-eminence. Alas, the noble Duke has given the Minister adequate and valuable time to stop being outraged at the word &#147;flabby&#148;&#151;I was hoping that he might explode on that.</p>

All the amendments helpfully open up the discussion and enable the Minister to clarify what the Government envisage will happen under the new structure created by the Bill. First, I apologise to the House for not being able to speak at Second Reading. I would have wished to have covered some of the same ground so excellently covered by the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, in her remarks at Second Reading about heritage. Other noble Lords also spoke valuably on that topic&#151;my noble friend Lord Davies of Coity and the noble Lord, Lord Tyler&#151;and, of course, my noble friend the Minister said that he looked forward to debating the heritage issues which arise under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09012149000139"></a>On too many occasions in the past, we have missed our legislative opportunity. My understanding is&#151;this is buried in our heritage of legislation&#151;that in the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 the Government and Parliament simply forgot to equip English Heritage or its predecessor body with a competence in underwater archaeology, so we had to stumble along with a very inadequate provision. I tried to remedy that when I was a Minister in DCMS in bringing forward the Culture and Recreation Bill in 2000. It was based on much consultation, a complete consensus between various professional bodies and institutes which were interested and between the political parties. Sadly, as we ran up against the buffers of the 2001 election, the party opposite, the Conservative Opposition, was unwilling to give the legislation a fair wind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09012149000140"></a>I was cross, at the time, but I shall give them the benefit of the doubt; perhaps they were right to say that one should never wave through legislation and

At all events, we were unable to get it on the statute book at that time. Happily, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, took up the cause in a Private Member&#146;s Bill which became the National Heritage Act 2002, which put on the statute book some of the relevant provisions which had been in the Culture and Recreation Bill.</p>

<a name="90121-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09012149000141"></a>The upshot is that under existing legislation, English Heritage is empowered to use resources to protect and conserve submerged marine monuments. It makes recommendations about the designation of shipwreck sites and areas around them of historic and archaeological importance and it administers licences granted by the Secretary of State. This is enormously important in relation to our national history identity and culture. It is part of our island story&#151;if I may use the phrase&#151;and of our history as a seafaring people. That still applies in the age of air travel, the Channel Tunnel, globalisation and digital communication, no less than it did before. Our maritime heritage is massively important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09012149000142"></a>Amendment 33 rightly requires the MMO to have regard, among other matters, to heritage and marine archaeology. When the Minister winds up, will he explain rather more fully how he envisages that the existing powers and duties of English Heritage will fit into the new structure that the Bill creates and whether those powers will be enhanced or extended? To give a small, practical instance, on which I think the noble Baroness touched in her Second Reading speech, English Heritage does not collect information or advise on historic environment issues in areas beyond the territorial limits of the UK territorial sea. However, the MMO would need to have such information. Who will be empowered, and who will have a duty, to collect that information? What can we expect in the MMO&#146;s statement of public participation about the division of labour and the complementarity of the responsibilities of, for instance, English Heritage and the MMO? My noble friend observed that sensible people and sensible organisations work together willingly enough, and that is true, but sometimes it is not very easy for them. It depends on the terms of reference set for them by legislation and by their department&#146;s policy and on whether they have the budgets to carry out the work. Can my noble friend assure us that Defra and DCMS are truly shoulder to shoulder in relation to underwater archaeology and the historic maritime heritage and will operate their policies coherently?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09012149000143"></a>Among the major functions of the MMO will be the planning function. That will take place within the context of a marine policy statement. We understand that the marine policy statement will be a statement of policy for the Government as a whole. But can my noble friend give me the reassurance I seek in relation to the maritime heritage? Will sustainable development in marine planning terms explicitly include sustaining the cultural heritage as well as the natural heritage? Will the licensing duties to protect the environment protect the marine historic environment? Will marine conservation zones take account of existing designations in conserving the marine historic environment? Is that what Defra contemplates as well as the DCMS? If so, how will it work, and who will do what? I do not expect the Minister to be able to answer all these

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09012149000144"></a>These are simply some of the issues that are implicit in this helpful Amendment 33. I do not know whether the Government wish to accept it, or something like it. I have noticed that Governments are always rather resistant to what they call catalogues, but the Committee expects the provisions of this legislation to be considerably more precise, indicative and concrete than they appear to be at the moment. I would not dream of using the same language as the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, in any animadversions I might offer on the drafting of the Bill. We will be able to return in greater detail&#151;indeed, in greater elaboration&#151;to these issues in subsequent amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, to which I have had the pleasure of adding my name. For now, it would be helpful if the Minister would look forward and give us an initial account of his thinking in this regard.</p>

<p><a name="09012149000195"></a>I appreciate that the main thrust of the Bill, and perhaps its original objective, was the conservation of the natural environment as well to deal with fisheries and other practical issues affecting our coastline. However, in the absence of a heritage protection Bill, which had been widely anticipated, this has to be the vehicle for our concerns. As the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, and others have said, in this and previous debates, it is in the interests of co-ordinated thinking and joined-up government that we should think now of other interested parties and agencies that could be involved in the role of the MMO, and indeed, in subsequent parts of the Bill, in relation to the MPS and MCZs. We seek to deal on a holistic basis with all the interests affected by the Bill and to ensure that it deals with everything that affects our coastline and our history as a maritime nation.</p>

However, it would be helpful to have a general reaction from the Minister. He replied in a positive way to the remarks I made at Second Reading and said that I had made a very important point. I am glad that he responded to the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, on the previous set of amendments. I have already tabled amendments, with the support of other noble Lords from around the Committee, and we will be able to debate these matters in more detail. I suspect it will be necessary to table other amendments as well. In the mean time, I reiterate that I support my noble friend, particularly on Amendment 33, which I believe paves the way for these other amendments. I hope that the Government will accept the spirit of the amendments and indeed their detail as well.</p>

I accept that Amendment 33 has merits, too. Both attempt further to define and spell out what the MMO should be about. Amendment 32 draws strength&#151;I congratulate my noble friends on drawing the parallel&#151;from the NERC Act, because some time was spent by the Government and their team, and members of both Houses, in drawing out what the objectives should be. Terrestrial and marine objectives are very similar. They both concern the natural environment and the environmental, social and economic considerations that we have mentioned.</p>

<a name="90121-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09012149000148"></a>I will concentrate on what my noble friends have included in the requirement to work closely with coastal communities. When we talk about social and economic factors, these communities stand to gain or lose the most from whatever happens in the marine areas directly adjacent to them. For years, they have been the guardians of the environment; they have gone out and done the beach cleaning. They are the ones who are most aware of what has happened with the sea off their coasts. They are out in their small boats, thinking about the dolphins and reporting any incidents. They have a lot at stake. I agree with the Minister about the awful word &#147;stakeholder&#148;, but those coastal communities are front-line stakeholders. For that reason, they deserve a particular mention in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90121-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09012149000149"></a>There seems to be a dichotomy in Amendment 179. Perhaps the noble Lords who have tabled it, in particular, the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old scone, would like to comment. The natural environment is defined as a number of things with which I would not disagree. However, the amendment ends with the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09012149000213"></a>&#147;and natural resources they provide&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012149000196"></a>Surely, with aggregates, for example, there might be a conflict because the natural environment&#151;if we mean the seabed&#151;might be the very thing that would be damaged by the other thing that is also defined; namely, the aggregates that might be extracted from it. The amendment might be stronger if those words were deleted.</p>

I found myself in a similar position because I had to attend a funeral on that day. I should very much have liked to have made my more generalised comments at that time, which would have given me a better platform on which to take part in Committee. That said, I note that under this clause the MMO has a duty to control, co-ordinate, regulate and manage. In that sense, the MMO is intended by the Government to be an enabling organisation, a facilitating organisation and a regulating organisation. In summary, those are its duties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09012149000151"></a>I like these amendments because they put a more direct onus of responsibility on the MMO to carry out more specific duties, which cover an immense range of interests and responsibilities, during its lifetime. Under Amendment 32 it is called on to promote various activities, such as,</p>
<ul><a name="09012149000214"></a>&#147;marine conservation ... enhancing the marine landscape ... promoting the study ... and enjoyment of the marine environment&#148;,</ul>

<p><a name="09012149000197"></a>and &#147;undertaking research&#148;. Under Amendment 33, there is an even wider range of activities which the MMO has to bear in mind. The debate on the previous group of amendments clearly brought out some of the complexities that will arise when the MMO tries to co-ordinate its activities with other interested organisations and authorities, not to say Governments.</p>

<a name="90121-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09012149000152"></a>Amendment 33, tabled by my noble friend, is very interesting. The range of activities and interests that the MMO would have a duty to concern itself with are clearly spelt out. These duties feature in quite a number of later amendments and some will require a lot of authoritative input by the MMO. My one regret, which I have stated before, is that an imperative is not placed on the MMO to carry out what I have always regarded and thought to be the primary objective of the Government: the establishment of marine conservation zones to protect marine life.</p>

<a name="90121-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09012149000153"></a>I had the opportunity, as did other Members of the Committee, to be present at a short talk given by Professor Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation biology at the University of York. He is an extremely able individual and, perhaps I may say without being patronising towards him, I thought he gave a most impressive performance. During the Summer Recess I took the opportunity to read his book <I>The Unnatural History of the Sea</I>, which covers 1,000 years of man&#146;s exploitation of marine life. It is a horrible story, utterly horrendous. I thought that the prime motor behind the Government bringing in this Bill was to ensure that, first and foremost, animal life in our seas would no longer be exploited without regard to its sustainability and ability to recover from the fishing operations and other activities which mankind imposes on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09012149000154"></a>I thought that the main purpose of the Bill was to establish a network of conservation areas around our country. I now have grave doubts that that is so. As all these other curious bits and pieces are brought in, the MMO seems to be swimming around lost in this great wide ocean of conflicting interests, which it is somehow going to have to meet, engage with, control, regulate and manage. I hope the Minister will be able to give me some reassurance. If not, I suspect that we will have to come back and find some formula along the lines of the amendments moved.</p>

I will talk a little about Amendment 32, with which I am, again, extremely sympathetic. As a professional geologist and, at times, a marine geologist, I am a little bothered by the concept, in paragraph (b) of the new subsection in Amendment 32, of enhancing seabed and geological features, particularly geological features. I am not sure quite how one would do that or, indeed, whether one ought to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09012149000156"></a>Putting that aside, I turn to proposed paragraph (d). Had the Minister been able to be a little more accommodating on the role of science in this organisation on our first day in Committee, I do not think I would have spoken to this. However, this gives us an opportunity  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1691"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1691</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to pursue this a little further. We should recognise that, wholly laudably, the Government have, in a series of appointments&#151;both within and outside this House&#151;recognised the importance of professional expertise. In his replies on the first day, the Minister repeated that science and professional expertise are not particularly more important than other competencies, simply because access to the best advice would be available. That really is not enough.</p>

<a name="90121-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09012149000157"></a>The very minimum that this organisation must have is the in-house scientific capability to be an intelligent customer. If we do not have that, we are really lost. Although I certainly would not go as far as the full wording of proposed paragraph (d), which would turn this into a full-blown research organisation with significant overlaps with the NERC, there must be some in-house research capability because this is how one maintains professional competence and expertise. I would simply like the Minister to reflect on this. I believe, as I think many noble Lords do, that science has a special role in this organisation, which somehow has to be recognised. It may not have to be recognised in the Bill but it must be recognised in the way that appointments are made. Frankly, if this organisation does not have significant internal scientific competence, it simply will not amount to anything.</p>

I am attracted by paragraph (e), on &#147;heritage and marine archaeology&#148;, of the proposed new subsection. Living on the east coast of England I am extremely aware of the number of predators who come from hundreds of miles away to dig offshore for historic remnants, including remnants of the Spanish Armada, which was finally wrecked on that coast. These activities are largely uncontrolled at the moment. Although the breadth of interests covered in the Bill is alarming, I hope that this one will not be omitted from consideration.</p>

That was the expression I used and I still think it is true. Clause 2(1)(b) states that the objective is,</p>
<ul><a name="09012149000215"></a>&#147;making a contribution to the achievement of sustainable development&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09012149000198"></a>and the Bill requires greater definition than it has at this stage. Any list would raise difficulties because it would be either too long or not include matters that people would like included. However, it is extremely important. The Committee has reflected the importance of getting the general objectives right&#151;clearly that is the hub of the Bill&#151;and if the Marine Management Organisation objectives are not achieved through our discussions on the Bill, we will have failed to produce the kind of Bill that the Government and the Committee wish to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09012149000161"></a>It will involve a difficult balance between commercial activities and protecting the marine environment and, as other noble Lords have said, archaeological remnants. However, Amendment 33, to which I incline slightly more than the Liberal Democrat Amendment 32, specifies certain aspects that we believe need considering in the overall thrust of responsibilities. If the Minister cannot accept the amendments as they are&#151;I suspect he probably will not be able to&#151;I hope that he will at least think about coming back with something on Report which will strengthen what is currently in the Bill. I think the Minister is aware that there are gaps and that it is a question of how we fill those gaps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09012149000163"></a>I am sure that our desire to get the Bill right has been reflected around the Committee today, as it was earlier. It is the only opportunity that we will have for a Bill of this calibre, and the general objectives have to be right. There are gaps in it and we need to fill those gaps.

The fact that the Government did not like that particularly has inevitably led to the kind of discussion we have been having over the past 40 or so minutes. It points out some of the difficulties that the MMO will have in balancing all these different interest groups. I believe there should be some strengthening of the duty of the MMO. Quite how the Government can achieve that, I do not know. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, who said that &#147;balance&#148; is the crucial word, and the MMO will have to maintain a balance between all the conflicting interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09012149000165"></a>We had the same arguments when discussing the Bill that created Natural England, where the Sandford principle again raised its head.

However, I recognise that there are other admirable objectives that the MMO ought to pursue. I agree, therefore, with the draftsmen of both Amendments 32 and 33. Now, which parts of those amendments ought to be in the objective category and which ought to be in the &#147;have regard&#148; category might be the topic of some inter-party discussion between Committee and Report, so that we can present the Minister on Report with what the House would widely regard as the ideal solution.

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09012149000167"></a>I have a wider concern about Clause 2. It seeks to do too many things in one clause, most obviously, to add guidance to a clause headed &#147;General objective&#148;. The Secretary of State will, presumably, draft that guidance on the basis of the general objective. However, if the Government are going to insist on that objective being as vague as the Bill has it at present, the Secretary of State will have far too wide a discretion in deciding what should and should not be in the guidance. I believe that the Bill ought to constrain the Secretary of State&#146;s discretion to a much greater degree than it does at the moment.</p>

<a name="90121-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09012149000168"></a>If we glance at Clause 2(1), we see only two general objectives. Indeed, the Bill does not go on to tell us which particular objectives should follow the general ones, so these are the only objectives in the Bill. The first requires the MMO to act,</p>
<ul><a name="09012149000216"></a>&#147;in a manner which is consistent and co-ordinated&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012149000199"></a>One wonders why that expression appears as a general objective at all. Surely, it applies automatically to any organisation that acts with respect to anything. Why should one be concerned about the MMO&#146;s consistency and co-ordination when, as far as I am aware, that expression appears in no other Bill that has passed through your Lordships&#146; House in recent years?</p>

<a name="90121-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09012149000169"></a>I wholly concur with what the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, said about the second paragraph, Clause 2(1)(b). Why do the Government not agree with the Joint Committee about the reference to ecosystems? They are obliged to adopt that approach anyway, under European legislation to which they have now signed up. They have no room for manoeuvre, for example, on ecosystems. Why are they not prepared to own up to that in the Bill? It would at least have the advantage of compelling the Secretary of State, in his guidance, to unpack in greater detail what obligations the MMO will have on ecosystems.</p>

<a name="90121-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09012149000170"></a>I respectfully suggest to the Minister that two things ought to happen to Clause 2 between now and Report. First, Amendments 32 and 33 ought to inform the Government&#146;s thinking, in particular on what should be added to the objectives clause and what should then be had &#147;regard to&#148;. Secondly, the guidance parts of Clause 2 ought to be taken out and put in a separate clause.</p>

When the first major round of wind-generation propositions came forward, it was interesting that, out of more than 30&#151;perhaps even 40&#151;of them, only two were objected to on the grounds of nature conservation. In both those cases, the development eventually went ahead in a slightly different location by a process of negotiation. Unless

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09012149000178"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, that I hope his summary of my comments was not accurate. If it was, that is not what I meant to convey. I was arguing that there are difficulties, as there are with this system, in simply singling out a particular expertise. I hope, given my support for the science base in this country, he will accept that I believe that evidence from scientists will play a major part in the Government&#146;s role in the development of the marine policy statement and in the work of the Marine Management Organisation. I accept that there is a debate about whether that should be expressed in the Bill, but that is a second-order issue.</p>

If I might seek to summarise the point that the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, was making today, it is that without science there would not be any point in the MMO. Without the science in relation to biodiversity, there would be no MMO. That is why science, in the respectful submission of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, and in mine, has a position in the hierarchy of objectives right at the top. Everything else, whatever its degree of importance, is an also-ran. Accurate science, which measures biodiversity and therefore limits everything else that can be done or proved by the MMO, is the key to understanding the mechanism that ought to drive this new and very welcome institution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09012149000181"></a>We debated last week the merits of defining sustainable development in the Bill. I know the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, and other noble Lords find the words&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09012149000217"></a>&#147;making a contribution to the achievement of sustainable development&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09012149000200"></a>not as strong as they would wish, although those words have featured in several Bills in recent years. As I said last week, we think that &#147;making a contribution&#148; is the right wording, but obviously we will discuss that over the next few weeks.</p>

<a name="90121-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09012149000182"></a>The amendments that we are debating today are in one way seeking to deal with whether there should be a definition. We are concerned about having two types of definition in an evolving concept. It is interesting that since last week my officials have identified 73 statutes and more than 400 EU instruments in which sustainable development is used but not defined, as there is currently no legally binding definition. There is a problem for the courts in attempting to interpret what the legislation actually means. That issue also needs to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09012149000183"></a>Although the noble Baroness, Lady Young, described this part of the Bill as flabby, it is not for want of us wishing to be clear about the important role of the MMO, but there are some real drafting issues that need to be confronted. Part of it is because the MMO is not a single-sector organisation or one that should deliver one pillar of sustainable development above another. It is there to hold a balance, under the guidance that the Secretary of State will issue and working within the constraint of the marine policy statement. We cannot run away from the architecture, which asks the MMO to make judgments and balances.</p>

<a name="90121-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09012149000184"></a>While I have no doubt that the matters in Amendment 33 are very important, noble Lords have to confront the problem with lists, which is that the amendment inevitably limits the matters that the MMO must take into account to those in the list, potentially excluding others. Amendment 32 goes beyond matters that the MMO needs to consider in exercising its general objective, for example by adding the promotion of,</p>
<ul><a name="09012149000218"></a>&#147;the study, understanding and enjoyment of the marine environment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012149000201"></a>Again, we see the same problem. In our discussions, to which I very much look forward, we have to come to a practical solution that is acceptable for the legislation, but that none the less, as I fully understand, gives the comfort that noble Lords want on the role of the Marine Management Organisation. I do not think this is going to be easy, but the Government are certainly very willing to do what they can in discussion with noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90121-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09012149000185"></a>What of the Sandford principle, which has been debated and is particularly relevant to Amendment 179? My understanding is that the best summary is that, where two purposes cannot be reconciled by skilful management, conservation should come first. It is used in the management of protected landscapes in the UK. I do not know whether that is a helpful description. One of the objections to putting in the Bill the definition of the natural environment that the noble Baroness puts forward in that amendment is the same as the objection to defining sustainable development. The concept of the natural environment evolves over time. One has to be very wary of putting a definition in primary legislation, where it will be fixed for many years. We have to recognise that marine Bills do not come along very often. That is one of the reasons why we will need flexibility in this Bill as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09012149000186"></a>On the question of marine heritage and the questions that my noble friend Lord Howarth, the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, and the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, raised at Second Reading, my understanding is that the MMO will work with English Heritage, as the Government&#146;s statutory adviser on the historic environment, on licensing and marine planning activities. The MMO will need to take account of both the marine heritage landscape and historic sites in developing marine plans and when determining licences. The MMO will look to English heritage for advice on the historic environment; for example, wrecks in the UK territorial sea adjacent to England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09012149000187"></a>It is likely that a memorandum of understanding would be helpful in formalising the relationship between the two bodies to cover issues such as data sharing and the relationship between Marine and Coastal Access Bill licences and the system of licensing under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. I recognise that amendments will be coming but I hope this will give noble Lords a sense that some thought has been given to this matter and to the need to make the arrangements work.</p>

What he said is encouraging. Can he give the Committee an assurance&#151;or if he is not yet able to give an assurance, whether he will consider this&#151;that the provisions of this legislation will be entirely consistent with the provisions that we look forward to seeing in the heritage protection Bill. This Bill is in draft and perhaps the relevant clauses are not fully formulated. I press my noble friend a little on this because we found when we examined the Planning Bill in the previous session that there was not complete consistency between the provisions of the Planning Bill and the provisions of the draft heritage protection Bill. It is important to be confident that the Government are at one with themselves and that Defra and DCMS are working so closely together that there is not so much as a hairline crack of difference between them.</p>

He knows I will not do that. As to whether government departments are working well together on Bills and draft Bills, the answer is in the affirmative as ever. However, I will ensure that the message that is implicit in what he says is listened to carefully and that the relevant departments are informed of his remarks.</p>

<a name="90121-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09012149000190"></a>In conclusion, this has been a helpful debate. The Government believe that the words &#147;contributing to sustainable development&#148; place sustainable development at the core of the work of the Marine Management Organisation. The balance to be administered, managed, licensed and regulated is the balance that is inherent within sustainable development. We understand that noble Lords feel that Clause 2 is not right at the moment and that it does not capture the critical importance of the role of the Marine Management Organisation. However, there are difficulties in getting it right and meeting some of the points noble Lords have raised. Although I suspect it will be some time before we reach that stage on Report, given our current state of progress, I hope noble Lords will accept that the Government are willing to discuss these matters with noble Lords over the next few weeks and to see whether we can find a way through.</p>

<a name="90121-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09012158000002"></a>The noble Baroness is absolutely right that there is no definition of &#147;sustainable development&#148;. I have already said that we think there are real problems in placing a definition in this Bill but that the Government have, along with the devolved Administrations, adopted five key principles that must be respected for a policy to be considered sustainable: to live within environmental limits; achieve a just society; and to do so by means of a sustainable economy, good governance and sound science.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09012158000004"></a>I am pleased that the Minister has found the debate helpful. I know that he is seeking consensus&#151;and he has certainly found it around the Committee this afternoon. All he needs to do is to come and join it. I hope that our discussions lead in that direction and that he is brave enough to seize this opportunity. We have described Clause 2 as &#147;woolly&#148; and, on one occasion, &#147;flabby&#148;. We all know what we mean&#151;it does not really say what we feel it should say. I make no apology for the list in my amendment; we could soon add something to it to take account of any other matter considered relevant. The list only serves to show just what is missing from Clause 2.</p>

I am not sure whether it is courageous to do so&#151;and one always worries about that at the Dispatch Box&#151;but I accept that Clause 2 as it appears does not convey the critical role of the MMO, as noble Lords would wish. All I ask the noble Lord to accept is that it is a real challenge to come up with a sensible clause that does not involve the problem of lists. Noble Lords may feel that that is one of the Government&#146;s negative responses to these matters, but there is genuine concern that what you omit from a list is in some ways excluded or downgraded. Given the need for this legislation to last for many years to come, one has to be very careful about that.</p>

He said what he thought Clause 2 should do&#151;unfortunately, I was not quick enough to write it all down, but I am looking forward to reading it in <I>Hansard</I>. The Minister illustrated the scope that the Bill should have. It should have such wording as would alleviate many of our concerns that the Bill does not demonstrate sufficiently in this important clause the purpose of the legislation and the background against which the MMO should be taking these important decisions. I welcome the opportunity, which the Minister has indicated to us, to talk to him along with other noble Lords about the important issues raised in the debate.</p>

I have always been a consensual politician. It is a delight to have been the lightning conductor for consensus this afternoon. I am sure that when the Minister is given an opportunity to reflect he will join us. Some critical comments have been made about the present Clause 2: that the MMO general objectives are flabby and woolly.

That is where I would like to point out the difference between Amendments 32 and 33. The reason why my noble friends and I supported Amendment 32 is that it is solidly based on a specific requirement passed by this House two and a half years ago when we were setting out the general purpose of Natural England. We were not overtly specific. We were not being so definitive that we might circumscribe the role of the MMO. We were giving out exactly the same sort of general objectives as this Parliament decided, as recently as that, for the terrestrial comparable organisation. That is why I have a slight preference for our amendment against Amendment 33.</p>

I am sure that given goodwill and encouragement from the Minister we could find a way of bringing them together in a way that would make them comprehensive. Our amendment has one advantage in that it is a little more open-ended regarding the natural changes to which the Minister has referred that are going to take place. It is not so specific that in two or three years we may want to change those objectives, which may be a fault in Amendment 33. However, there is a more general point. I am not a lawyer, let alone a constitutional lawyer, but I take an interest in these things. When Parliament has decided as recently as two and half years ago that a list of this sort is an appropriate way to put a set of objectives in an Act, that should be taken as guidance on how we approach this particular legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09012158000014"></a>The other reason that I feel strongly that simply accepting Amendment 33 and discarding Amendment 32 would be a mistake is that Amendment 32 makes reference to coastal communities, to which other Members of the Committee have referred. It was specific in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, which created Natural England; it refers to &#147;working with local communities&#148;. If it could be in that Act, for a terrestrial body with these environmental objectives, surely it should also be there for those concerned with the marine environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09012158000020"></a>The Bill reads as overly restrictive to &#147;that area&#148; on page 2, line 16.

Not only must &#147;that area&#148; be considered, but also,</p>
<ul><a name="09012158000089"></a>&#147;the UK marine area or an adjacent area of sea or land&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012158000069"></a>Without that, the clause would be dangerously restrictive. These adjacent areas could, for example, include the area around the Isle of Man, which we were looking at on the maps yesterday, as well as the Scottish inshore area. On a wider international scale, they could be areas under the control of the Republic of Ireland or the French Government, which are so close to the UK&#146;s marine zone that they could be very easily affected by what goes on within that zone and vice versa. Inevitably, this is a probing amendment. I hope that it is very straightforward. It seems important that this principle should be established at this stage and, therefore, I am pleased to move the amendment.</p>

However, surely it is obvious that there is something missing. In order to have a fully consistent and co-ordinated approach, it is important that it is made clear that the consequences of any action must be taken into account not just in respect of other parts of the marine area, but also on any adjacent area of sea or land.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09012158000022"></a>Without this proviso, are we not in danger of subordinating land or sea outside the UK marine area? While it is important that the right decisions are made in terms of anything covered by the MMO&#146;s power, it is perhaps just as important to take into account any damage, or indeed benefit, which may occur as a result of this on an adjacent area. Does the

Will he explain to us how the MMO would carry out its duties without taking into account the effect on the other areas?</p>

<a name="09012158000023"></a><b><a name="90121-0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09012158000112"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, has suggested that this was a drafting amendment; I winced a little at that, although it is certainly different from the one we have just debated. He went on to say that it is a probing amendment to see where the Government stand on these issues. It is to that dimension that I will respond, particularly as it has been reinforced by the remarks of the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09012158000024"></a>It is clear that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, would require the MMO to consider the impact of its activities beyond the areas in which it has any function, or perhaps even any influence. I confirm that the intention of the Bill is to ensure that the MMO manages, regulates and controls activities in the marine environment in a consistent and co-ordinated way. As my noble friend Lord Hunt set out a few moments ago, it will be operating within the framework of a marine planning system, which includes a number of requirements to consider at the planning stage the likely impact of any proposed plan, not only on adjacent areas but also any area which may be affected by the proposal.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09012158000025"></a>For example, Schedule 6, which needs to be considered in this context, requires that marine plan authorities notify adjacent plan authorities, both marine and terrestrial, when they start planning and then take reasonable steps to secure compatibility with any adjacent plans. The schedule also contains a separate requirement that marine plan authorities have regard to the effect which any proposal for inclusion in a plan is likely to have on any related area. In this context, &#147;related&#148; includes any adjacent area of sea or land, as well as any areas that may be affected by the proposal, whether directly adjacent or not.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09012158000026"></a>This context is significantly wider than the one envisaged in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. We recognise that at the planning stage other areas&#151;not even adjacent areas&#151;may be affected, and the MMO will need to take that into account.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09012158000027"></a>When carrying out its planning functions, the MMO will also need to comply with the European Union directive on the strategic environmental assessment of plans and programmes. The assessment directive requires, for example, any adjacent member state to be consulted if a proposed marine plan is likely to have significant effects on its environment. We can all envisage circumstances in which that might be the case. These requirements therefore ensure that the impacts of different activities on the environment and each other are considered at the planning stage, rather than as individual decisions are made. I maintain that this is a more coherent and effective way of dealing with the issues.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09012158000028"></a>The MMO will be operating for the United Kingdom Government in English waters, and in UK waters except where the devolved Administrations have those functions. It will make its decisions in accordance with marine plans, which will have been developed having regard to the impacts of the proposals on adjacent or related areas at sea and on land. Co-ordination between

I note that subsequent amendments to later parts of the Bill will give the Government a chance to expand on how we intend to achieve this.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09012158000029"></a>A key aim&#151;indeed, the basis&#151;of the Bill is to move our marine management from a case-by-case consideration of individual projects and impacts to a forward-looking and strategic approach. The provisions in Clause 2 supplement this framework by requiring the Marine Management Organisation to apply that co-ordinated approach within its own operations.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09012158000030"></a>I listened with the greatest care to our prolonged debate on the inadequacies of Clause 2, and I appreciate that my noble friend will think further on those matters. However, the crucial issue of co-ordination is being fleshed out in the response to this amendment. It involves a rather wider dimension than the noble Lord suggested when moving the amendment, so I hope that credit will be given to the Government for thinking strategically, as that is at the heart of the Bill. Clause 2 offers that certainty.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09012158000031"></a>I hope that my explanation has established that the Government are fully apprised of the concerns articulated by the noble Lord and that we have a structure that enables us to take into account dimensions even wider than those that he put forward when advocating the amendment. I hope that he will be reassured in that respect and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

My first reaction is that it all sounds excellent but it is not in this part of the clause at the moment. There is currently no reference to assessing the impact on adjacent areas. That was the burden of what he said and it seems to me incredibly important. The clause specifically deals with the &#147;consistent and co-ordinated&#148; approach in so far as it applies to the MMO area. That area is referred to twice in this subsection. The Minister&#146;s explanation sounded pretty good but between now and Report I shall have to look very carefully at whether it is here in this clause.

Amendment 52 introduces a timeframe for the guidance which the Secretary of State is required to issue to the MMO under Clause 2(3). Rather than leaving the timescale open, it requires that guidance  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1704"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1704</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should be issued within one year of the MMO being established and the guidance should then be reviewed at unspecified intervals.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09012158000034"></a>The Bill is particularly vague and undefined at points where it is necessary to have clarity. Without the amendment, the Secretary of State is required under subsection (3) to give the MMO guidance on how it should contribute to sustainable development; but there is no specification about when that guidance should be delivered. Without precise arrangements, the Secretary of State might not publish the guidance for years; and under the Bill there would be no way of calling him to account. Without the necessary guidance, the contribution made by the MMO to sustainable development would, sadly, be diminished.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09012158000035"></a>Last week, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, made it clear that we should be reassured that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="09012158000082"></a>&#147;In addition to its duties laid down in the Bill, the MMO will operate in accordance with the new marine policy statement ... [and] guidance by the Secretary of State&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/1/09; col. 1100.]</p>

<p><a name="09012158000070"></a>Does the Minister agree that he has, therefore, underlined the importance of the speedy production of that guidance? Perhaps he will tell us what timeframe he envisaged for its publication. There should be provision for review. The MMO, following old, out-of-date guidance, risks being ineffective at best and damaging at worst. Will he tell us how he thinks a review process, as yet not written into the legislation, will work? I beg to move.</p>

As those who have been in local authorities will know, it is common practice that local authorities always have to have regard to guidance given by Whitehall and Ministers. There seems to be no obligation on the MMO to have regard to, let alone consider carefully and implement, the guidance given here. There seems to be a discrepancy&#151;a divergence from common practice in local authorities&#151;regarding this agency of central government. It is important that we get clearer advice from the Minister on precisely how the MMO is supposed to treat the guidance it may be given; hence the amendment. Like the Conservative Front Bench, we seek a clear exposition from the Minister on how the guidance is to be given, on what timescale, and how it is to be treated by the MMO.</p>

We do not believe that it is necessary to legislate for a deadline for the Secretary of State to issue such guidance. That is a level of detail inappropriate for primary legislation. It is clearly in the Government&#146;s interest to make sure that the MMO delivers their policy objectives effectively. Our firm intention is to issue guidance to the Marine Management Organisation on the day that it commences its activities. Moreover, I can reassure noble Lords that we will review and if necessary amend the guidance at appropriate points; for example, on publication or review of the marine policy statement, on publication or review of marine plans, or as our understanding of sustainable development evolves.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09012158000040"></a>Amendment 53 imposes a requirement that the Marine Management Organisation must have regard to the guidance issued to it by the Secretary of State under Clause 2(3). I refer the noble Lord to Clause 36. It makes clear that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09012158000083"></a>&#147;The MMO must have regard to any guidance given to it by the Secretary of State&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012158000071"></a>That includes the guidance to be issued to the MMO by the Secretary of State, under Clause 2, on how it is to achieve its general objective. Clause 2(4) provides that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09012158000084"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State must consult the MMO before giving any guidance&#148;;</p>

<p><a name="09012158000072"></a>and Clause 2(5) provides that he,</p>
<ul><a name="09012158000090"></a>&#147;must take into consideration ... the functions of the MMO, and ... the resources available, or likely to be available, to the MMO&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90121-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09012158000041"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked an interesting question about the guidance given under Clause 2, which relates to the duty in the general objective in that clause. Clause 2(3) makes it clear that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09012158000085"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State is to give the MMO guidance as to the manner in which the MMO is to seek to secure that the contribution to the achievement of sustainable development mentioned in subsection (1)(b) is made&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012158000073"></a>He also referred to Clause 35, which relates to the directions that the Secretary of State may give in respect of any of the Marine Management Organisation&#146;s functions, and to the marine policy statement.</p>

<a name="90121-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09012158000042"></a>We believe that the Bill&#146;s provisions are part of a consistent thread that goes from the sustainable development principles, via the high-level objectives and marine policy statement, through to their application by the Marine Management Organisation in individual decision-making. As I indicated, the Marine Management Organisation will be issued with guidance on how it is to achieve its general objectives. The organisation will clearly be required to operate within the constraints of the marine policy statement, a subject we will come to in the debate on Part 3. The power of direction under Clause 35 makes it clear that the Secretary of State may give the Marine Management Organisation,</p>
<ul><a name="09012158000091"></a>&#147;general or specific directions with respect to the exercise of any of the MMO&#146;s functions&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="09012158000075"></a>then the MMO cannot operate until that guidance is given. That seems to be an odd way round.

Amendment 58 is a probing amendment to clarify what appears to be an unusual limitation in the amendment to the Wildlife and Countryside Act. Clause 40 identifies the &#147;UK marine area&#148; to be from the mean high water spring tide. However, new subsection (12)(a), to be inserted into Section 16 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act under Clause 10(2), limits the MMO&#146;s remit in circumstances to only the mean low water mark. Will the Minister give us a clearer idea of when this restricted definition will be used and why it is not appropriate to keep the same high water boundary in all circumstances? I know very well the Holbeach Marsh coastline where the difference between high water and low water can be several miles. It is very hard to define. Boundaries can be quite important, particularly when dealing with an area of wildlife habitat importance such as the marshlands of the Wash and the north Norfolk coast. I hope that it will be possible to make sure that the Bill does not leave fuzzy edges to these boundaries.</p>

I will speak at greater length when I move my amendments. He has identified a real problem because there are at least two definitions in the Bill. The Minister may say that one definition applies to wildlife and the other applies to planning areas. The planning area definition concerns me more because the interface in planning just on those margins will need greater definition. The noble Lord is right that definitions of exactly what constitutes &#147;sea&#148; throughout the Bill will create confusion, especially where different bodies have different powers potentially over the same areas or perhaps a disputed area. As sea levels rise, the mean high water level will change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09012158000052"></a>I was talking to my local estuary forum, the Taw Torridge Estuary Forum, where all the organisations with any interest in the estuary come together, whether it be recreational, wildlife or the local authority. The chairman told me that one of the biggest problems with this Bill is in what is defined and where we decide finally that the powers should begin and end. If they are at high water, that leaves an immense place, as the noble Lord, Lord Holbeach, has just identified. All of us who have seen &#147;Shakespeare in Love&#148; will have seen that beach at the end of the film.</p>

During the passage of the Bill, it would be very useful&#151;I am sure that the Minister will do it now&#151;for the Government to define their thinking exactly on the points between the lowest tide, the highest tide and the average tide, and what that means in terms of the wildlife habitats, for this part of the Bill, and the definition in planning terms for other purposes. It is where those definitions lie that the greatest pressures will come, whether they concern recreation, shell fishing or wildlife conservation&#151;the crunch issues. The tensions that have to be balanced will often appear in that zone, which is why it is important that we are aware of exactly what we are saying when we define it.</p>

I am glad that the noble Lord has indicated that this is a probing amendment because I have to suggest that it would be quite disastrous were it to be passed. The effect of the amendment would be to remove the definitions of the English inshore region and the restricted inshore region from the provision to be inserted in the Wildlife and Countryside Act.</p>

But, of course, he is seeking to ensure that the Government know clearly the nature of the definition, on which I hope to reassure him. We intend to convey to the MMO licensing functions clearly defined, but not as broad as they would be if this amendment were to be carried, which would destroy the essential definitions.</p>

That is the definition that we seek in every change to this Bill when we seek to amend the Wildlife and Countryside Act. If we did not amend that Act at all and this amendment were carried, and if our position on this clause&#151;that is, our proposal to amend the wildlife Act&#151;were withdrawn, the MMO would have no restrictions on its geographical area as regards licences.</p>

Indeed, it is the Government&#146;s purpose, as far as one can gather from the Minister, that those areas of intertidal margins will, for wildlife and conservation purposes, still be considered the responsibility of Natural England, not the Marine Management Organisation. I do not know whether we totally agree with the Government on that matter. It is the cause of some concern that there may be mixed responsibilities in the management of these intertidal areas. I certainly hope that between now and Report stage the Government will consider the ambiguity that this might lead to. While I beg leave to withdraw the amendment today, I hope we will have an opportunity to debate this more fully.</p>

As the Bill stands, this relationship is, at best, woolly. I am afraid that &#147;woolly&#148; is what I have written here again. We have heard &#147;flabby&#148; and &#147;fuzzy&#148;; certainly this relationship is unclear. There is no mention of this relationship in the Planning Act, so these two pieces of legislation travel in parallel, yet never seem to join up.</p>

<a name="90121-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09012158000060"></a>The Planning Act 2008 gives the IPC the power to determine nationally significant infrastructure projects offshore, offshore energy over 100 megawatts and larger harbours. In Committee on the Planning Act, my noble friend Lord Taylor argued that this was inappropriate as it placed the IPC above the MMO in the pecking order when it comes to these projects. The setting up of the MMO was welcomed by nearly everyone. The Environment Agency said that the MMO would be, and I use the phrase again:</p>
<ul><a name="09012158000094"></a>&#147;the champion of the seas&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1710"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1710</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09012158000061"></a>This phrase was echoed by the Marine and Fisheries Agency, among others. Last week this idea of the MMO being champion of the seas was rather pooh-poohed by the Minister. He said that the phrase likened the MMO to a grandiose pressure group. I would argue that he has missed the mood of its proponents. I take the phrase to mean that the MMO will be the leading authority for all marine projects.</p>

<a name="90121-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09012158000062"></a>However, will it be the marine authority? I believe that its authority will be undermined by the four&#151;and there may be others&#151;exemptions from MMO control; namely, oil and gas installations, which were regulated by BERR and are now regulated by the DECC; large renewable energy installations and major ports, which will be regulated by the IPC; shipping, which will be regulated by the Marine and Coastguard Agency; and the marine conservation zones in Part 5 of the Bill, which will be designated by &#147;the appropriate authority&#148;. I believe that Natural England, and not the MMO, is vying for this position. What role will the MMO have? As it stands, it certainly will not have overall authority.</p>

<a name="90121-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09012158000063"></a>There are at least six Whitehall departments and a plethora of government agencies and non-government organisations involved in the marine environment. Each has its own agenda. It should be the MMO&#146;s role to take an overview of the impact of human activity on the marine environment and, indeed, the cumulative effects of this activity. Under the EU marine strategy framework directive, which I believe was the directive that my noble friend Lord Kingsland referred to earlier, member states are required to deliver good environmental status, or GES, by applying,</p>
<ul><a name="09012158000095"></a>&#147;an ecosystem-based approach to the management of human activities, ensuring that the collective pressure of such activities is kept within levels compatible with the achievement of good environmental status&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012158000077"></a>The MMO is the ideal organisation to ensure compliance with this directive but, as the Bill stands, it does not have the necessary authority, especially where the IPC is concerned. The MMO, as things stand, cannot say no, or that what is proposed is too harmful to the marine environment, or that the cumulative effect will be too damaging. It is the straw that breaks the camel&#146;s back.</p>

<a name="90121-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09012158000064"></a>Our amendments amend the Planning Act so that the MMO becomes the sole planning authority in the marine environment by removing the power of the IPC to determine offshore generating stations. That is not to say that applicants should not apply to the IPC for planning permission, but the IPC would then make a recommendation to the MMO for a final decision once the MMO has ascertained the effect, or cumulative effect, of the application on the ecosystem.</p>

<a name="90121-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09012158000065"></a>I realise that this is only one way of skinning the cat. If the IPC is to retain control over larger projects, it is essential that the MMO is a statutory adviser. This still begs the question of what happens if the IPC ignores the advice of the MMO because, let us say, the economic advantages outweigh the environmental concerns. The Minister has already said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09012158000096"></a>&#147;inevitably many tensions will come to the fore in the work of the MMO board&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/1/09; cols. 1061-62.]</ul>

<p><a name="09012158000066"></a>These tensions will be inevitable. We saw this last week when, in balancing the economic good against the environmental concern, a decision was made in favour of a third runway at Heathrow. In the marine environment, both sides are building up their arguments for and against the Severn barrage. With this in mind, I had some sympathy with Amendment 28A once I had heard the arguments put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, last week. She referred to her amendment again today but emphasised that it was a mechanism of last resort.</p>

<a name="90121-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09012158000067"></a>We all understand the need for offshore infrastructures and this could be made quite plain in the marine policy statement and the guidance to be given to the MMO, and indeed in any memorandum of understanding. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, while trying to clarify the relationship of the IPC and the MMO, said in Committee on the Planning Bill that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09012158000088"></a>&#147;The MMO can add additional conditions to an order granting development consent if new information comes to light and can even revoke consent if necessary&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/10/08; col. 694.]</p>

<p><a name="09012158000078"></a>This is, of course, welcome as it implies that the MMO after all will have the ultimate say on large marine developments. I hope that the Minister will stand by that statement. Perhaps something to that effect could be written into the Bill to clarify the situation. I welcome therefore the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Coity, Amendment 63, which seeks to give the MMO the power of veto.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09012158000068"></a>We on these Benches believe that the MMO should be the ultimate marine authority&#151;the champion of the seas; the leading authority&#151;and that it should have the teeth it needs. I beg to move.</p>

I regret that the clause is so modestly titled even if it is for bureaucratic reasons. We need to debate, first, as the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, outlined, the definition of the relationship between the IPC and the MMO. The Joint Committee was clear on that issue and recommended that the Government should revisit the dual body regulatory infrastructure for offshore energy installations because it recognised that the current situation is unsatisfactory.</p>

The IPC would then surely be in the planning seat for infrastructure projects and the MMO would have to  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1712"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1712</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>balance many other issues. I am looking forward to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Coity, because, in the context of what the Minister said, it will be particularly interesting to consider whether the MMO should have the power of veto.</p>

<a name="90121-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09012187000005"></a>On the question of whether the MMO should be able to approve or not approve a generating station, the Government have decided on 100 megawatts of generation as an understandable splitting point. The difficulty with that can be exemplified by the evidence given to the Joint Committee by Mr Carcas on behalf of Pelamis Wave Power. It is particularly appropriate that the British Wind Energy Association has an exhibition in the atrium at the moment which exemplifies the different kinds of marine energy&#151;tidal energy, wave energy and so on. Mr Carcas&#146;s evidence on behalf of Pelamis, at page 94 of Volume II of the evidence, was that wave energy,</p>
<ul><a name="09012187000159"></a>&#147;is essentially stored concentrated wind energy ... we occupy about four to five times less area for an equivalent rated project compared to offshore wind&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012187000006"></a>That is important in this context because it might be more appropriate to have a definition based on the size of the sea area taken than on the amount of energy generated. It might be much more difficult for shipping, navigation, marine conservation areas and so on to define a generating plant by the amount of power generated than by the area of sea it occupies. The Government have taken an easy definition at the moment but I am not sure that it is the most appropriate one. We need to debate the issue fully.</p>

<a name="90121-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09012187000007"></a>The amendment also suggests that the inclusion of an extension is a difficult concept. A generating station may consist of one element&#151;for example, a wave machine&#151;but it may be connected to other generating stations through a collecting station. The wave hub off Cornwell, for example, is the collecting station for many generating stations. How does that sit with the definition? Is each generating station a separate, small consideration that can come under the MMO, or do they all get added together? I shall be interested in the Minister&#146;s definition of &#147;extension&#148;. How many extensions can there be before their development becomes a nationally significant infrastructure project? There are many issues to debate.</p>

<a name="90121-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09012187000008"></a>We must also debate at greater length the land-sea interface because the Bill does not satisfactorily consider the relationship between a large generating station at sea and the effect it may have on land. The Government created the IPC partly in reaction to the fact that the operation of the Thames Estuary wind farm was held up because the onshore transmission station could not be constructed as the local district council had objected to it for rather too long. The land-sea interface is important. What role will the IPC have as the projects come onto land and what role will the local authority play in resolving what can sometimes be rather large planning issues?</p>

<a name="90121-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09012187000009"></a>As another example, we are looking at the Atlantic array wind farm in the Bristol Channel, just north of Lundy, which will have requirements with big knock-on effects. On land, it will need construction bases, all

Surely, those will need to be resolved by the local council, not by the IPC. At the moment the Bill leaves those questions rather unresolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09012187000011"></a>Since that time, various things have taken place. In particular, Section 32 of the Electricity Act was devolved to Scotland, giving it power over renewable energies and the connection of electricity from renewable resources. Various other parts of Section 32 were devolved, but something that still puzzles me is that I have seen no sign of the devolution of Section 36, which concerns consent for the construction of electricity generating stations. That would be useful to know, as up to now people have considered only renewable energy generating stations in the renewable energy area adjacent to Scotland. However, it is quite conceivable that someone with a gas platform might decide to generate electricity that would not be renewable. Would that, then, come under a devolved power or under the Marine Management Organisation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09012187000013"></a>My concerns are primarily about the conflicts that could arise between the need for conservation and protection of the natural marine environment and the Government&#146;s policy on renewable energy sources. At Second Reading, I cited the Severn barrage, which has already been mentioned. That is a real example of where such conflict will undoubtedly arise should the project be on the Government&#146;s shortlist for renewable energy projects, which I understand will be announced in a few weeks.</p>

<a name="90121-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09012187000014"></a>There is a wealth of evidence from expert national and international environmental organisations, such as the RSPB and the WWF, clearly indicating that a barrage across the Severn estuary would result in damage to the marine environment that would be nothing short of catastrophic. Such damage would be permanent, as the marine environment would never, ever recover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09012187000015"></a>If the Government proceed with a Severn barrage, the measures that are in place to mitigate the environmental impact cannot possibly be honoured. For example, more than 2,000 square hectares of alternative wetlands would have to be found to compensate for the area lost to the project. Where do the Government think they are going to find that extent of wetland? Surely, if the provisions of the Bill are to be meaningful and deliverable, there must be a mechanism for the Marine Management Organisation to prevent such a project going ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09012187000016"></a>That brings me to the purpose of my proposed new clause, which would give the Marine Management Organisation the power to veto any decisions made by virtue of Parts 6 and 7 of the Planning Act 2008, or orders made under Section 3 of the Transport and Works Act 1992, if it regards such a development as likely in any circumstances irrevocably to damage the environment, potentially damage human health, and/or interfere with the legitimate rights of users of the sea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09012187000017"></a>We must be forensic in examining the conflicts surrounding the Severn barrage. I recognise that the Government, with the support of the environmental movement, have committed themselves to take action on the threats posed by global warming. I recognise that the Government have to find renewable energy sources, while at the same time recognising the need to conserve our environment and heritage&#151;a difficult balancing act, anyone would agree. Yet this Bill, which is widely welcomed, must send a message that conservation must remain a fundamental pillar of our environmental policy. There can be no getting away from that basic principle.</p>

<a name="90121-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09012187000018"></a>As conscientious parliamentarians, then, we cannot allow a situation to develop where one government department promotes legislation seeking to protect the environment while another actively considers a project that would destroy an entire ecosystem. I hope the Government are able to take my points on board, and even if they feel unable to accept the new clause, I would look for some clear assurance that the inevitable conflicts between conservation and the energy needs of the nation can be rectified without the environment being sacrificed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09012187000019"></a>In conclusion, I was heartened by the numerous views expressed from all parts of the Committee on its first day regarding the importance of the powers of the Marine Management Organisation. Those views have also been expressed today. My amendment therefore seeks to give the MMO the teeth required to fulfil its environmental responsibilities. It is not my intention to divide the Committee on this amendment, but I hope that the Government will seriously consider it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09012187000021"></a>I want to move on to a different issue, which was raised at the end of her speech by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. I always find her title extremely complicated to remember, and I apologise. We heard from my noble friend Lord Cathcart of a number of complicated relationships, particularly those involving the IPC and the MMO. I want to refer to another relationship, which has not yet been referred to specifically, arising from the Electricity Act 1989. The clause with which we are dealing takes us to Section 36 of that Act and transfers responsibility from the Secretary of State to the MMO, but Section 37 deals with transmission lines, for which responsibility remains with the Secretary of State. Indeed, Schedule 8 to the Electricity Act, which imposes on both sections, and therefore on both the MMO and the Secretary of State, the duty to take account of the natural countryside and the environment, is applicable in both cases.</p>

<a name="90121-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09012187000022"></a>I shall take an example other than that of the Severn barrage to illustrate why we need clarification. A project has been proposed&#151;which, unlike the Severn barrage, I favour&#151;to place generating apparatus in the fast currents between St David&#146;s Head and Ramsey Island. It is the kind of scheme that has a lot to be said for it. The generators will be essentially underwater and invisible, and will not do significant damage to the marine environment&#151;although it is clear that that has to be looked at by the MMO with the greatest possible care. If one is going to have such a generating station approved or disapproved of by the MMO, the power cables that will feed the electricity will have to cross the whole of Pembrokeshire and the Pembrokeshire national park.</p>

<a name="90121-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09012187000023"></a>I am familiar with the countryside involved&#151;I was the Member of Parliament there for many years and lived at St David&#146;s for a time. It is clearly an area of extreme sensitivity. It may be possible to place the generating cables, or perhaps a section of them, underground to avoid severe damage to one of the most beautiful parts of the national park and what will be a key part of the coastal footpath which goes around the whole of the Pembrokeshire coast. However, the relationship between the decisions of the MMO and the Secretary of State are worth considering, because the MMO could decide that the scheme in the water is thoroughly to be approved of and the Secretary of State could come to a different conclusion about the effect on the natural environment and the beautiful countryside and so on under the duties imposed on him by the Electricity Act.</p>

<a name="90121-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09012187000024"></a>I am sure that these matters can be resolved, but it is worth drawing attention to another complication on which we need clarification. The Government need to explain how the relationship is to be managed and what consultation they envisage between the Secretary of State, taking his decision about the transmission lines and the other onshore facilities that may be required&#151;indeed, the major construction works that may be involved in the heart of a sensitive national park&#151;and the MMO, taking its decisions on the sea. The two cannot be separated; they are inevitably

We cannot just brush the whole thing aside. I am afraid that all I am doing is drawing attention to yet another complication and relationship which the Government need to clarify before we decide what to do at a later stage of the Bill.</p>

However, I am a little ashamed of the amendment now that I have heard the debate so far. Having been at the rabid end of the debate on Clause 2, I appear to be at the reasonable end of the debate on this issue, which feels deeply uncomfortable. I commend the position of the noble Lord, Lord Davies, on this issue. Ideally, the MMO will be the centre for marine expertise; it will be an independent body; it will have huge experience across a range of activities in the marine environment; but, strangely enough, it will not be the licensing body for all marine activities, because some of them will fall under the purview of the Infrastructure Planning Commission. On mature reflection as a result of this debate, which I presume is the purpose of debates in your Lordships' House, I have been persuaded that the MMO, as the planning and licensing body with that huge marine experience, ought logically to license all marine projects. I had lost hope that we could ever persuade the Government that that could ever be the case, because the Planning Act has only recently become law and it seemed strange to be going back and writing out the script so soon after its ink was dry. However, I have been persuaded that perhaps we should.</p>

<a name="90121-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09012187000026"></a>My amendment was indeed flabby, because it said, &#147;If we can&#146;t persuade the Government to do that, there need to be two safeguards in the circumstances where the Infrastructure Planning Commission is the licensing or decision-making body&#148;. The two safeguards were, first, that the MMO must be a statutory adviser to the Infrastructure Planning Commission in these circumstances, but, secondly, in reverse, that the IPC should seek and take account of advice from the MMO.</p>

<a name="90121-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09012187000027"></a>The Government&#146;s response to a similar recommendation by the Joint Committee on the draft Bill indicated that they expected the MMO to be a statutory consultee for offshore, nationally significant infrastructure projects, and that the Department of Communities and Local Government would consult on that as part of the secondary legislation package following the Planning Act.</p>

I am glad that I have done so, because a number of issues have come up in the last few minutes to which I would like very much to respond.</p>

<a name="90121-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09012187000030"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, I know Pembrokeshire Coast National Park very well from being involved in national parks over many years. However, precisely the same situation could arise with Exmoor National Park, which I know even better. I would venture to say that there are some great coastlines outwith the national park designation, such as the coastline of Cornwall, which deserve all the protection that the designation gives. The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, was absolutely right that, for all those sensitive coastlines, what happens offshore can have a major impact onshore. That strengthens the argument that this should not be left to the overall strategic views, which may be unsympathetic to precise, local environmental issues, that will necessarily be the role of the IPC. In those circumstances, having decided that we are going to set up a new organisation with very specific requirements regarding the marine and coastal environment, surely the MMO must take precedence.</p>

<a name="90121-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09012187000031"></a>Why and how we can give effect to that in the Bill is perhaps a secondary issue. There are a number of options in this group of amendments. I do not entirely follow the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Coity, about the Severn estuary because there may be options for renewable energy generation that are nothing like as damaging as the barrage. The barrage seems the least attractive proposition for the Government. Nevertheless his point is well made. If the decision is going to be, in the end, a matter of some national strategic significance in planning terms under the Planning Act, then I fear that the environmental issues will be secondary and not taken sufficiently well into account. That may mean that the wrong option is adopted. In contrast to the noble Baroness, Lady Young, I do not think that we should be mealy-mouthed about the necessity to look again at the Planning Act. It is very recent, but we were not debating the marine environment at that time because we knew we were going to be getting legislation of this sort. So I thought her initial instinct was right.</p>

Otherwise we can never take a new view in light of new circumstances. The Government have now produced a detailed rationale for this Bill. We did not have that in front of us at that time. I listened to the Minister, as I always do, and I am a reasonable man, as is he, but I do not think it is a conclusive argument. The Planning Act 2008 set up a new system but it was primarily concerned with what was going to happen on land, not offshore. It would be inappropriate in the light of all the new information, and not least the discussions that have taken place in this House, to regard that as so settled that we cannot look at it again. That is why a number of amendments from different sides of the Committee demand clarification about the interrelationship between the IPC and the MMO. If it was all settled under the Planning Act, there would be no need for this debate, but it is evident from the contributions on all sides of the Committee that it is not as settled as all that. That is why I hope the Minister will be able to indicate precisely, within the marine policies and the guidance given by the Secretary of State and the other Administrations that are part of this complex network, how the MMO is going to approach these issues.</p>

<a name="90121-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09012187000034"></a>There is a strong case for taking out the section in this Bill which leaves to the IPC the rather artificial designation of &#147;generating stations&#148;. My noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer indicated that the definition is at least questionable, if not even weaker than that. I hope the Minister will not be so apparently reluctant to look at this issue. It seems to me and to many other Members of your Lordships&#146; House that the way in which the MMO and the IPC interrelate, where there is a sensitive area and where a major development proposition is on the table, is going to be crucial to success. All those who have campaigned for this legislation for many years will take this as the litmus test. If the IPC looks as if it can push hard for a proposition that does major damage to the marine environment, there will be many disappointed people who have high expectations of this Bill.</p>

I have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Coity, said. In that debate the IPC was not even on the horizon. I am not going to refer to the detail of the debate&#151;it is on the record and can be read&#151;but there was a great deal of support for conserving the situation in the Severn estuary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09012187000036"></a>My noble friend Lord Tyler has begged the question what would have happened if we had had the Marine Bill before we had the Planning Bill. I guess that we would be having a totally different debate because we would have given the MMO primary planning powers. But that is not the situation. In this debate we are trying to redress the powers given to the IPC, which appear to be going to subsume any meaningful influence the MMO might have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09012187000037"></a>I agree, too, with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, about alternative production of electricity, particularly in sensitive areas around the

The issues raised tonight need careful consideration. The priority should surely be given to conservation. The damage that can be done by some of the proposals on the table would be catastrophic. We must remember that some of these areas have European conservation protection and the IPC will have great difficulty, if things are left as they are, overturning such designations. The problem for the Government is that they have been set huge targets for renewable energy production. The IPC has been the Trojan horse in the Planning Act to try to ensure that these targets are met, but the other serious considerations expressed tonight must not be ignored.</p>

I want to follow up on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor&#151;sorry, Lord Tyler; I get confused myself&#151;and the Minister&#146;s response to that. We did indeed have a number of debates on the relationship between the IPC and the MMO during the Planning Bill. I led on those matters in those debates. We were in a difficult position because the MMO did not exist; indeed the legislation to create it had not been laid before the House. So I appreciated the Minister&#146;s position, but in order to get me to withdraw an amendment about the veto of the MMO, he said the following:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09012187000162"></a>&#147;The MMO can add additional conditions to an order granting development consent if new information comes to light and can even revoke consents if necessary&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/10/08; col. 694.]</p>

<p><a name="09012187000153"></a>I hope the Minister is not going to resile from that position because it appears to give the MMO the power to veto an order if it feels that the information which it possesses makes it unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09012187000040"></a>One of my great concerns with this Bill has been over the role of the Marine Management Organisation and its interaction with the Infrastructure Planning Commission. As it stands, the Marine Management Organisation will be responsible for renewable energy installations of up to 100 megawatts, and the Infrastructure Planning Commission will be responsible for nationally significant infrastructure projects, defined in the Planning Act 2008 as installations of greater than 100 megawatts. It is unclear to me which of these bodies will have the overriding power to approve projects. I fear that they are destined to clash over the provision of planning consent, as we have already heard this evening. For example, which document will take precedence in the final decision process, the Infrastructure Planning Commission&#146;s national policy statement or the Marine Management Organisation&#146;s marine policy statement?  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1720"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1720</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>In my view, the Marine Management Organisation could take on full responsibility for approving all renewable energy installations within the UK marine area, which this amendment would provide for. Removing the provision that allows for nationally significant infrastructure projects to be exempt from the remit of the Marine Management Organisation enables the Marine Management Organisation to have overriding authority on all renewable energy installations within the UK marine area.</p>

I believe this amendment enables that to happen and I give it my full support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09012187000043"></a>I shall turn briefly to the Severn barrage, which has cropped up. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, was absolutely right. We must not necessarily think of a fixed barrage. There are all sorts of different ways we can cover this. I think we all agree that there is a huge amount of potential energy in the massive tides that flow in and out of the Bristol Channel every day. For instance, in the shallower parts we could have normal wind farms and in some of the deeper parts, excluding the shipping channels, inverted windmills that operate under water. There are many different ways to look at this.</p>

<a name="90121-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09012187000045"></a>Clearly, the Planning Act 2008 responded to the need for an improved system for delivering nationally significant infrastructure. We think it will help us to respond to some of the really pressing needs, including the long-term challenge of climate change for one and security of energy and water supplies for another. The aim of the Planning Act was to introduce a new single consent regime for nationally significant infrastructure, under which there will be improved accountability, with a clear distinction between policy setting and decision taking, with decisions on nationally significant infrastructure proposals made by an independent Infrastructure Planning Commission within the policy framework set by Ministers, with the IPC having to give detailed reasons for its decisions, with improved public consultation on the draft national policy statements at the pre-application stage, and with the examinations stage being easier for the public to engage with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09012187000046"></a>The Infrastructure Planning Commission is central to those reforms. It will consider nationally significant infrastructure projects and take decisions on them. The aim is to improve the speed and efficiency of the way we deal with infrastructure projects from application to decision, in contrast with problems that we have seen in the past, and an end-to-end approach to these major projects, which we believe will deliver faster and more efficient decisions.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09012187000047"></a>Clearly, the IPC has a very important role to play. It will consist of experts in a range of fields, including community engagement, planning, local government and the environment. For the first time it will bring together every part of the process that a nationally significant infrastructure project needs to go through. We believe it will lead to better decision making. Going back to the point that I made earlier, decisions will be taken by an independent body of people with broad expertise. They will see all the evidence and hear all the representations themselves. At the heart of the system is the principle that responsibility for policy making, which rightly should be for Ministers, should be separated from the process of taking decisions on specific applications within the framework. So the aim is to have greater clarity and transparency and for the accountability for the discharge of those distinct roles to be much clearer.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09012187000048"></a>I shall now deal with the relationship that we envisage between the Infrastructure Planning Commission and the Marine Management Organisation and the interaction between the national policy statement and the marine policy statement. As well as various types of onshore infrastructure, the IPC will be responsible for issuing development consents for large offshore projects such as renewable energy installations over 100 megawatts and larger harbours. The MMO, as the specialist marine licensing authority, will license development projects in the marine area below the IPC threshold, including offshore renewable energy installations of 100 megawatts or less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09012187000049"></a>The very legitimate question has been raised tonight of how the role of the MMO integrates with that position. In responding to the challenge of the noble Lords, Lord Taylor and Lord Tyler, I will reiterate the points that I made during the debate on the IPC. The MMO will be consulted on IPC marine decisions. It will provide its marine expertise and advise on conditions to be included in any IPC consents. This will be an important factor when the IPC is considering any application affecting the marine area. Details of how the IPC will receive advice from the MMO will be covered in guidance on the Planning Act. I also understand that a Memorandum of Understanding is likely to be agreed to formalise this relationship and it may well cover areas such as data sharing.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09012187000050"></a>Marine enforcement officers will use enforcement powers in this Bill to monitor and enforce marine licences from the MMO and deemed marine licences granted by the IPC. As part of its enforcement role, the MMO will be able to add conditions to these consents as new information comes to light and even revoke them if necessary. I am very happy to repeat what I said during the passage of the Planning Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09012187000051"></a>To answer the question of why we propose this structure, it is simply that the scale, complexity and nature of nationally significant infrastructure and the number of people affected pose a number of unique challenges to any regulatory system&#151;challenges which the old planning regime is widely acknowledged to have failed to overcome consistently.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09012187000052"></a>The Planning Act establishes a process specifically designed to tackle these challenges. Projects that are not nationally significant will be dealt with by the relevant local system. In the marine area, this will be the marine licensing under the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, which will be a simplification of the existing marine licensing regime. It will be flexible enough to accommodate a range of project sizes, from the smallest jetty right up to the threshold of &#147;nationally significant&#148;. For these smaller developments, we envisage this being a more appropriate route for developers than if they applied to the IPC.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09012187000053"></a>I know that noble Lords were worried during debates on the Planning Act about what they saw as possible tension between the different agendas of various departments. Key to that is the relationship between the national planning statement, the marine policy statement and the marine plans. I assure noble Lords that UK Government departments are absolutely committed to working together to ensure consistency between national policy statements and the marine policy statement. I gave a commitment to this effect at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09012187000054"></a>One of my departments, Defra, is working closely with other government departments, including the other department that I have responsibility for, the Department for Energy and Climate Change. When I say it is our intention to ensure consistency, I am therefore speaking for both those departments and the Government as a whole. Defra will be working very closely with DECC and with other government departments in the development of the national planning statements to ensure that marine policy interests and objectives are incorporated. Equally, other government departments will be closely involved in the work that will assist us to develop the marine policy statement.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09012187000055"></a>I know that there are debates about the threshold, so perhaps I may come to the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. We debated this in the Planning Act as well. There is a distinction between the threshold for onshore projects, which is 50 megawatts, and offshore projects. In the Planning Act we set the threshold for onshore projects at 50 megawatts to match provision in Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. We proposed a threshold of 100 megawatts for offshore projects because they tend to be larger and have a less significant impact on people than those on land. We thought it sensible to set the threshold of what constitutes &#147;nationally significant&#148; in the offshore region at a higher threshold compared with onshore projects. If I remember rightly, we had a number of amendments that proposed a much lower threshold. However, that is the position as to the threshold. I will come on to the second point, as to whether a hub approach comes within the definition of one project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09012187000056"></a>During the period when the MMO is being set up, and if a national policy statement is in place&#151;for instance, if there is a national policy statement on renewables or in the marine area&#151;before the marine policy statement is agreed, we will ensure that the Government&#146;s marine policies and objectives will be reflected in decisions of the IPC because of the Government&#146;s role in relation to the national policy statements. The MPS and the national policy statement will provide a tool for authorities making decisions and a framework for achieving sustainable marine development. We will ensure that consistency is sought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09012187000057"></a>I come to the specifics of the noble Earl&#146;s amendments, and I will also respond to the other points raised in the debate so far. One part of Amendment 59 would reword Clause 12(3)(a), altering the geographical area in which the MMO can exercise licensing functions under Section 36 of the Electricity Act to the UK marine area. Section 36 of the Electricity Act requires that consent is obtained for the construction of certain generating stations in a &#147;relevant place&#148;. &#147;Relevant place&#148; means Great Britain, the territorial sea adjacent to Great Britain or &#147;renewable energy zone&#148;. That is different from the UK marine area in two ways. First, it generally excludes waters adjacent to Northern Ireland, whereas these are included in the definition of the UK marine area. Secondly, the renewable energy zone extends to a maximum of only 200 nautical miles offshore. The UK marine area, on the other hand, extends to the edge of the UK sector of the continental shelf, which in some cases, off the north-west coast of Scotland and the south-west coast of England, can extend up to 120 miles further out to sea than the renewable energy zone. The renewable energy zone was designated by order under the Energy Act 2004 and covers that area of sea beyond the territorial sea that the UK can exploit in connection with the production of energy from water or winds under the UN Convention on the Law of Sea. The amendment would therefore increase the jurisdiction of Section 36 of the Electricity Act to a geographical area beyond which we have rights to exploit renewable energy under international law. I am happy to write to noble Lords with more information.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09012187000058"></a>The other part of Amendment 59 would delete Clause 12(3)(b) in its entirety, as would Amendment 60, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. I will cover that amendment at the same time. Deleting Clause 12(3) on its own would have no practical effect. Section 33(1)(h) of the Planning Act 2008 determines that Section 36 of the Electricity Act is not needed for any installation subject to a development consent from the IPC. All Clause 12(3) provides is further transparency that the MMO will be licensing only those offshore renewable energy installations not subject to the requirement for a development consent from the IPC.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09012187000059"></a>An additional effect of Amendment 61 is that it removes the Secretary of State&#146;s power to add new offshore projects into the IPC&#146;s remit. We had extensive debates on the matter during passage of the Planning Act, when, at Committee and Report stages, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee&#151;who unfortunately cannot be with us now&#151;tabled amendments on it. The power  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1724"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1724</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in Section 43 of the Planning Act provides flexibility to add to or vary the list of projects defined as nationally significant, and thus to be considered by the IPC, because we wanted to have the flexibility to deal with any new, emerging technology. Especially in marine technology, there are other areas where we will need flexibility in the future. That is why we included that provision.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09012187000060"></a>Amendment 62 would allow the MMO to designate safety zones under Section 95 of the Energy Act 2004 around all offshore renewable energy developments regardless of their size. Currently it is restricted to those offshore renewable energy installations not classified as nationally significant infrastructure projects by the Planning Act 2008. I suspect that that is a consequential amendment with the intention of extending the safety zone functions of the MMO to cover all offshore renewable energy installations in the event that the amendments we are considering were accepted. I certainly agree that the two functions should be aligned to the same installations.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09012187000061"></a>I come to the question of my noble friend&#146;s amendment on the power of veto. I have stressed the close relationship that will need to be established between the IPC and the MMO and the involvement that the MMO will have in development consent decisions taken by the IPC in the marine area. We believe that to give a power of veto would undermine this relationship, effectively putting the IPC behind the MMO in the hierarchy of decision-making. I understand that that is probably the intent of those noble Lords who have spoken in favour of it. The Government would oppose that, because we think that putting the IPC behind the MMO in such a hierarchy undermines the whole construct of the Planning Act and the expertise and understanding that the IPC will develop of large infrastructure projects.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09012187000062"></a>As I said during the passage of the Planning Act, the MMO will have an enormous expertise of its own, which will come to the fore, will be constructive and will contribute to ensure sustainable development in the marine environment. We believe that the relationship between the two organisations is the best way in which to achieve this in a manner that does not undermine either organisation but increases business certainty, which is very important.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09012187000063"></a>I realise that time is moving on, but I shall say a little more about the relationship between national planning statements and marine policy statements, as it is an absolutely critical point of the argument. I remind noble Lords that Section 10 of the Planning Act places a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that national planning statements are drawn up with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development. The Government have made it clear already that the national policy statement will integrate our objectives for infrastructure with our strategic environmental, social and economic policy objectives, including our climate change objectives, to help us to deliver sustainable development.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09012187000064"></a>The appraisal of sustainability that Ministers must carry out for each national policy statement is central to that. It will form a robust assessment framework that will apply to all statements to ensure that environmental, social and economic objectives are  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1725"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1725</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>properly factored into their development. It will involve an iterative process of collecting information and evidence, defining realistic alternatives, identifying sustainability impacts and effects and developing mitigation measures. It will be fully integrated with the wider national policy statement preparation process, involving statutory consultees during key stages. When necessary, the draft national policy statement will be revised in light of the appraisal of sustainability. The IPC must take its decisions in accordance with the relevant national policy statement and have regard to the marine policy statement. Sustainable development considerations will therefore be properly reflected.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09012187000065"></a>I turn to a number of other points that have been raised. The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, asked about oil and gas licensing offshore decisions.</p>

He is obviously not going to take the amendment on its own. We have reached the provisions dealing with devolution, but I have yet to find the measure in which Section 36 of the Electricity Act was devolved to Scotland. It is relevant whether the MMO might have to oversee the construction of generating stations that were not renewable energy generating stations within the renewable energy zone. But maybe the Minister would like to write to me on that.</p>

<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="09012187000069"></a><b><a name="90121-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09012187000218"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> That is a very kind invitation and all noble Lords will probably be relieved if I take the noble Duke up on it.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09012187000070"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, raised an important matter about how different planning consents fit together. He referred to Section 37 of the Electricity Act, on transmission rights, which relates to overhead transmission cables staying with the Secretary of State. As they are almost exclusively land based, we did not think it necessary or appropriate for the MMO to deal with them. That was not really his point, however. The point was that there are a number of different organisations that might be involved in a project relating to development on both sea and land. I fully accept that his point is that we must ensure a consistency of approach.</p>

I just want confirmation, so that there is no misunderstanding, that that Act did not alter the responsibility of the Secretary of State under the Electricity Act and that the Secretary of State is still responsible for transmission lines. I wanted to make sure that that was not taken over by the IPC and was a separate responsibility.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09012187000073"></a>I come to the question of the Transport and Works Act, which again was raised by my noble friend. In fact, Welsh Ministers used it once, in 2004, to consent to a major offshore generating station on their territorial waters. It has been used by the Secretary of State four times for similarly sized projects, most recently in 2004. I understand that the procedure remains a suitable route for consenting to such developments, because of its ability to declare safety zones and compulsory purchase land for onshore elements of the projects. However, in practice, since modernisation of the Section 36 consenting regime, the TWA route has not been used for major offshore stations. As the consenting function under the TWA has been devolved to Welsh Ministers, any power of veto by the MMO over Welsh ministerial decisions would mean that, contrary to agreed government policy, this provision would not be in accordance with existing devolution settlements.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09012187000074"></a>Amendment 71 seeks to place a duty on the MMO to provide advice to the IPC and to amend the Planning Act 2008 to place a reciprocal duty on the IPC to seek and take account of advice from the MMO. I have already mentioned that a co-operative relationship between the two organisations will be key to achieving the Bill&#146;s objectives. Details of how the IPC will receive advice from the MMO are to be covered in guidance to the Planning Act. A memorandum of understanding has also been envisaged to formalise this advice-giving relationship, which could also cover other areas such as data sharing. Clause 56 places a duty on the IPC to have regard to the marine policy statement and relevant marine plans. We have already given clear assurances during the passage of the Planning Act and in the comments I have just made that we intend to prescribe the MMO as a statutory consultee and interested party under the new IPC regime. We believe that those are the guarantees of the MMO&#146;s close involvement when nationally significant infrastructure projects are being developed by promoters and examined by the IPC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09012187000075"></a>I turn to the other amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, on the question of whether the generating station licensable by the Marine Management Organisation is connected to the hub. If stations generating over 100 megawatts are connected to a hub, under her amendment they would fall to the Marine Management Organisation.</p>

<a name="90121-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09012187000076"></a>It is a probing amendment. Our view is that a group of generating stations linked to a hub would be classified as a single development. There are no hubs currently in existing offshore, although the Department of Energy and Climate Change consented to a wave hub project off the Cornish coast in 2007 which, when built, will enable four or five arrays of wave devices to produce up to 30 megawatts of electricity to be connected to the mainland by way of a single cable. This was treated as a single development, so any generating station subsequently connected to that hub would classify as an extension of that development.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1727"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1727</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09012187000077"></a>Section 15 of the Planning Act is clear on the thresholds that apply in these cases. A development is considered to be subject to development consent if after construction or extension it has a generating capacity in excess of 100 megawatts. A current position with the particular wave hub project off the Cornish coast is that it counts as a single application, but it is below the threshold. Under the new circumstances it would fall to the MMO for consent, but if it were to be extended, and an extension or a series of extensions raised it in excess of 100 megawatts, that would change the position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09012187000078"></a>I apologise for speaking at such length, but it was important to set the Government&#146;s view as to how the two organisations will relate together. I assure Members of the Committee that the last thing we want is a conflict between the two organisations. We wish to have consistency. The references to sustainability is one way in which we will have that, but we are determined to make this provision work. We believe that the IPC should be responsible for projects that are classified as nationally significant, but we want to make the provision work effectively.</p>

I congratulate him on obtaining consensus in the Committee because most Members felt that there must be some sort of mechanism when the cumulative effects of the human activity are so great that it is damaging to the ecosystem.

It seems to me that in this ceasefire that we have perhaps even greater dangers. The danger is that we revert to doing little or nothing, with even more devastating consequences. There was international outcry over what happened two years ago in Lebanon. Then attention moved on and other crises became front-page news. How can we sustain international attention?</p>

<a name="90121-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09012187000085"></a>We have seen the dreadful pictures of what has happened in Gaza. The population had nowhere to run. They could not escape its borders. Even UN buildings where some took refuge received hits. Nowhere was safe. I have just been sent the pictures from the UN school: the white phosphorus raining down, the damaged classrooms, the two little brothers dead. Were these not civilians? Was it not obvious that there would be large numbers of civilian casualties in such a crowded area? Did the Government of Israel think that what they were doing was unwatched, unrecorded, even proportionate to their own experience of violence? Have we let the Israeli Government feel that they are not accountable?</p>

<a name="90121-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09012187000086"></a>These pictures, and many far worse, have been going around the region and the world. The speed and spread of information is new. We will all have received e-mails ranging from the moderate to the extreme. My son, setting up a discussion on the conflict on Facebook, found that within hours 80 friends of friends had joined from as far afield as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Pakistan&#151;within a day. We know that this conflict has long had its radicalising effect. The effect of this can now grow exponentially through the internet. We all know how this conflict is already used and, of course, abused in countries right across the region. We know that it is cited in our own communities. Therefore, if we did not know it before, we should know it now: unless the international community actively takes forward a just solution to this conflict, the world will become an even more dangerous place.</p>

<a name="90121-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09012187000087"></a>I welcome the brave statements by Jewish leaders, including my noble friend Lady Neuberger, in an open letter to the Government of Israel, saying that they write,</p>
<ul><a name="09012187000173"></a>&#147;as profound and passionate supporters of Israel&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09012187000154"></a>but that the actions of the Government of Israel threaten to destabilise the region and to undermine international support. We have surely reached a point of enormous danger to Israel; that, in its greater military strength, it has meted out such evident injustice to its would-be neighbours that there will be such a reaction that its own future will be undermined. Its window of opportunity to find a settlement is surely small and depends on the position of the United States, not only in terms of its support but also on how long the US is the only superpower.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09012187000088"></a>I can remember when Fatah was not to be supported or negotiated with. But the warnings came that this played into the hands of those who are more radical. Indeed, Hamas was elected in Gaza, and 40 of its MPs were immediately imprisoned by the Israelis. Right now, we hear how no negotiations should occur with

Note the viewpoint of Sir Jeremy Greenstock on the &#147;Today&#148; programme on 12 January in relation to Hamas:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="09012187000168"></a>&#147;This is a regime about which a lot of inaccurate statements are made, particularly by the Israeli and Washington Governments. It is not beholden to Iran ... They are not trying to set up a Taliban-style Government in Gaza ... They are not intent on the destruction of Israel; that is a rhetorical statement of resistance&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012187000155"></a>I am sure that we will hear this evening how Israel should not have to put up with rockets being fired into its territories. Indeed it should not. But also hear what Sir Jeremy Greenstock says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="09012187000169"></a>&#147;The tragedy about what is happening is that the cessation of rocket fire on Israel would have been possible if Israel had lived up to its obligations under the June ceasefire to open the crossings&#148;.</p>

<a name="90121-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09012187000089"></a>It was of course said that the conflict in Northern Ireland would never be solved; it had lasted 400 years. However, it is amazing what change was brought about with economic progress, north and south, and engaging with all parties. You look at Gaza and the West Bank. How can families get on with their lives in a crushed economy? Olive groves and vegetable gardens are simply sliced through by the wall. Farmers are cut off from their land by settlers&#146; roads that may not be used by Palestinians. There are checkpoints everywhere. Water is taken by the settlements, which are green and fertile, surrounded by the arid dryness of the Palestinian lands. The current situation in Gaza cannot be separated from the challenges in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.</p>

<a name="90121-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09012187000090"></a>Let us look at what has happened. Over 1,300 Palestinians have been killed. Of these, 412 were children. Thirteen Israelis have died, including three civilians and 10 soldiers, four of whom were killed by friendly fire. The BBC reports that 400,000 Gazans are currently without access to running water, while over 50,000 have been made homeless. It has been estimated that more than 4,000 buildings were demolished during the fighting and that it will cost more than $2 billion to repair the damage. Proportionate?</p>

<a name="90121-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09012187000091"></a>At least three United Nations schools have been targeted, including one where 40 people were killed. Israel has been accused of committing war crimes and breaking international humanitarian law by the ICRC and Amnesty International. The international community clearly has to hold both parties accountable for human rights violations.</p>

<a name="90121-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09012187000092"></a>Now we hear that efforts to relieve the problems are being hindered by limited access. There surely must be immediate and unrestricted humanitarian access for goods and people. Even more important is complete and even-handed international engagement in the area. To date, the quartet has failed adequately to address the causes of the conflict or successfully pursue peace. Trying to split Hamas and Fatah has been disastrous. The Palestinians need to speak with one voice. All parties should be brought into the negotiations, just as Sinn Fein, as the political wing of the IRA, was brought in. Preconditions which seem designed to thwart negotiations must be set aside. Countries in the region need to be brought in. But when Israel attacks Gaza, how can the Arab leaders answer to their own populations?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09012187000093"></a>Gaza was in a terrible humanitarian state prior to this latest attack. It has been set back further. Hamas has, if anything, probably been strengthened, Fatah weakened. Is that what was intended?</p>

<a name="90121-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09012187000094"></a>We should surely urge the UK Government to work with other EU partners such as the French to move negotiations further forward, bringing in Hamas, at least through intermediaries; to use EU economic sanctions if need be to encourage the Israeli Government to lift the blockades and enable people to move through the Palestinian territories; to enable commerce and trade, and the development of political discussion; to engage with moderates on both sides; and to show that the path of dialogue and moderation produces results. In the end, the security and prosperity of both the Palestinians and the Israelis will only result from them viewing each other as neighbours with common aims and interests, working to ensure that their children and their grandchildren have a brighter and more prosperous future than currently seems on the horizon for either side.</p>

I also welcome the announcement by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia of $1 billion to help to rebuild the Gaza strip. Would the Minister agree with me that progress in the Middle East peace process depends on more such practical participation by Arab countries? Perhaps he could assure us that Her Majesty&#146;s Government are doing all that they can to encourage humanitarian aid from Arab countries as a first step in their increased practical involvement in the peace process. If that kind of aid and involvement had been made available in 1948 at the beginning of the wretched situation of 250,000 Palestinian refugees being herded into Gaza, then part of Egypt, their now 1.5 million descendents would surely not have been so dependent on the UNRA for food and maintenance, as they are today.</p>

Like others, I am concerned about Hamas too, but I have been appalled at the callous and disproportionate targeting of civilians in Gaza. The attacks on the UN and the terrible loss of Doctor Izeldeen Abuelaish&#146;s family could hardly be called self-defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09012187000100"></a>I feel personally the destruction of the Near East Council of Churches clinic that I visited a few years ago. It was an essential service for Palestinian families in Gaza. The idea that Hamas should be hiding there is preposterous. It was just a monstrous crime. War crime seems too polite a phrase for a country which is supposedly democratic and concerned for the rule of law. The rule of war is more like it. Israel has again lost support throughout the world and among many of its own citizens and friends in this country.</p>

<a name="90121-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09012187000101"></a>It has flagrantly betrayed the second concept of the Balfour declaration, namely, the respect for minorities. Palestinians will soon no longer be a minority. They are a people with an equal right to life, whether in one state or two. Of course, Israel has a right to defend herself and Hamas must stop firing rockets, but that is not the way to stop them. Hamas is a popular movement and an elected party; it will never be bombed out of existence. The people have no alternative to Hamas, and this conflict can only be settled by dialogue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09012187000102"></a>Surely our own Government can do more than simply condemn the action, send money and call for investigations.

It is working to provide water to 60,000 to 80,000 people and supply food aid; but the ongoing 19-month blockade is severely hampering the efforts, not only of Oxfam, but of all international agencies trying to bring assistance to the 1.5 million people of Gaza.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09012187000106"></a>Despite the commitments made on 19 January by the Israeli Prime Minster&#146;s spokesman, Mark Regev, that Israel would provide supplies,</p>

<p><a name="09012187000156"></a>Oxfam&#146;s experience is that this is just not yet happening. The UN reported on 18 January that only 97.5 truckloads entered the Kerem Shalom crossing. But Israel continues to refuse fully to open the critical Karni commercial crossing, which, Oxfam understands, has a capacity of up to 1000 truckloads a day, if fully operational. Kerem Shalom is not mechanised and is therefore a slow and costly way&#151;the handling charge is some $1000 per truckload&#151;to move supplies into Gaza. Israel has opened a small grain conveyor at Karni, which provided the equivalent of 38 truckloads; however, according to the UN on 19 January, it has failed to repair a second conveyor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09012187000107"></a>Israel is still obstructing NGO access to Gaza with only two, both medical, there at the last count.

We must act fast. Every day&#146;s delay causes yet more suffering and undermines the prospect of an enduring ceasefire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09012187000117"></a>It is now clear that the humanitarian cost cannot be solved in the long term without addressing the political cost of the conflict. A clear political process is now needed, with possible fresh elections, as the Minister indicated earlier this week. I therefore ask him: if we have fresh elections and Hamas puts up candidates and is successful, will we maintain the policy of no dialogue with that group?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09012187000118"></a>A strong case has been made for stopping rockets being launched into Israel. This is now being achieved. Can the Minister assure the House that opening the crossings will involve not just one or two crossings but a lifting of the blockade, giving unfettered access to Gaza? Without that, the cost in humanitarian terms will only get worse.</p>

I add my thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, for pointing out that the Government have given substantial aid. I am glad to see that but the danger is that, in giving aid, we may simply be bringing flowers to the funeral. It is welcome but it goes nowhere near the nature of the real problem.</p>

<a name="90121-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09012187000121"></a>At present, the biggest donor of aid to Israel is the United States of America; the biggest export market for Israel is the EU; and the money given to help the Palestinian Authority to survive comes from the EU. Quite simply, this means that the weapons and tools to create a better situation are in the hands of the United States and the European Union&#151;two members of the quartet. Therefore, my question to the Minister is very simple: has the time not come when we should make our aid conditional on at least the recognition of the rule of law and basic human rights legislation? Should we not now say that further acts that are in breach of the rule of law cannot be accepted by those who donate to one side or the other, whether it be aid or humanitarian assistance?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09012187000122"></a>Perhaps I may put it very bluntly. We know perfectly well that at present the international community, which so far has escaped without much criticism in this short debate, has in its hands the ability to change the situation dramatically on both sides&#151;Palestinian and Israeli. The Minister has presented in the most humane and understanding way the case for doing something about the disastrous situation in Gaza that will be lasting and not simply temporary. It is in our hands and we have the capacity to bring it about.</p>

Moses did not turn up to rescue the children of Palestine as he was caught up in the bureaucratic red tape and the veto of the United States. The UN is too weak and the European leaders were pathetic in Jerusalem.

There were 22 days of cold-blooded murder of 1,300 Palestinians, including hundreds of children, and injuring more than 5,000, with 26,000 buildings either damaged or destroyed. Can the Minister say&#151;this has already been asked&#151;whether Her Majesty&#146;s Government will support a UN-led investigation into the apparent illegal use of white phosphorous and uranium against children and therefore urge the ICC to indict the Israeli Prime Minister and others for war crimes?

I therefore wish to be unambiguous when I talk about opening the crossings from Gaza into Israel. An international peacekeeping force should check the Gaza population and the goods going out of Gaza, and it is Israel&#146;s right to protect the safety and security of those coming into Israel.

The increase in humanitarian aid by our Government is very welcome. We must recognise that as a result of this conflict, Hamas terrorists deeply exacerbated the misery of the people of Gaza. They stored weapons in public buildings; they fired rockets from within the civilian population; and they set traps in civilian institutions. In particular, their use of their civilians as human shields is absolutely disgraceful and demonstrates a complete disregard for and systematic violation of international humanitarian law by which, regrettably, as a non-state actor, they are not bound.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09012187000130"></a>The Israeli defence forces were operating in an extraordinarily difficult environment. Just a few weeks ago, I was in southern Israel when bombs were dropping. Each time I had 15 seconds to get down into a shelter, and that was before this war began. There came a time when the Israelis found that they could no longer agree with their own population being stormed in that way. It is absolutely plain that, by firing over 8,500 rockets into Israel over eight years, Hamas bears direct responsibility for causing this war, for the sad humanitarian situation that they now face, and for costing the lives of so many of its people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09012187000133"></a>One thing that causes Israel to be doubtful about the support of the international community is that, as history has shown again and again, allegations are made and then reported in the media in very colourful terms, but when those allegations are subsequently found not to be based on the truth it receives no publicity at all. That undermines the ability of the international community to bring pressure to bear on Israel in the way that it should. I am rather disappointed this evening to find that the same thing is happening again in this House. One will not get progress in that

Hundreds are dead, and thousands more are injured, orphaned or homeless&#151;in many cases, all three. Those who still have homes are often sleeping in the cold because windows have been blown out. According to UNICEF&#151;I declare an interest as a trustee of UNICEF UK&#151;many children are displaying severe anxiety, bed wetting, loss of appetite and general malaise.

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09012187000135"></a>Life was hard in Gaza before 27 December. The blockades had caused fuel shortages, shutting down the only power station, and there was a chronic shortage of clean water. But children were still turned out clean and fresh to go to school. Education is important to Palestinians. Eyad el-Sarraj, in a moving article in the <I>Herald Tribune</I>, describes how when an unknown fanatical Islamist group accused the American International School of promoting western culture and assaulted the principal, the whole community of Gaza came to the support of the school, making it clear that education is the path to development and nation building. But today there is significant damage to many of Gaza's schools and great loss of equipment and books. The resumption of education is a vital priority to help put back some normal rhythm into the life of these traumatised children. An important part of re-establishing the rhythm of life for all ordinary people in Gaza must be to give them hope of a better future, with proper access to goods and services.</p>

We have been waiting six months simply to get four small children's walking frames through, so what hope do we have in Gaza unless the decencies of normal life are observed? Israel has a right to live and to raise its children in peace and prosperity, but so, too, do the proud people of Palestine.</p>

The brazen cynicism of the attacks is also unacceptable. Is anyone convinced that the timing of these attacks is coincidental&#151;that they just happen to have occurred in the last three weeks of the Bush Administration, an Administration who have given Israel a blank cheque for eight years?

As each day passed by, the rockets would fly further; they would become more accurate and their effect would be more deadly. There would be sirens constantly wailing, and children would be running for cover. Life would be coming to a total standstill. What if those rockets were being fired from the cover of mosques, blocks of flats, schools or hospitals? What would we do? How would we respond? How would we get the balance right?

After 1918, anger, hatred and a determination to make them suffer as we had brought about the collapse of the German economy and German society. Out of that grew a much more embittered Germany and the Nazi movement, a movement from which came the Holocaust. We learnt that lesson. After 1945 we went in with food and helped to rebuild Germany despite our anger and hatred of everything that happened in the Second World War. Out of that has grown a peaceful Germany in a peaceful and democratic Europe. That is a hard comparison that the Israelis now have to think about.

<p><a name="09012187000157"></a>This is an impossible situation. The head of UNRWA has declared:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="09012187000171"></a>&#147;Hungry, unhealthy, angry communities do not make good partners for peace&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012187000158"></a>Like other noble Lords, I look forward to hearing the Minister tell the House what the Government are doing to step up humanitarian relief to Gaza. I hope that he will be able to provide fuller and happier information in the debate in this House next week.</p>

I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, for obtaining this debate. We will obviously have to return to this at greater length next week, and I therefore apologise to noble Lords who feel that I do not fully answer their points tonight.</p>

<a name="90121-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09012194000002"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, said, we are here primarily to discuss the humanitarian situation. In that sense, the fact that Israel halted its military operations last Saturday night and that on Sunday Hamas stopped its rocket fire is, in its way, a glimmer of good news because after 22 days of terrifying violence and tragic loss of life, the people of Gaza have finally been able to emerge on to the streets and be reunited with friends and family. I will come to the huge humanitarian tasks that lie ahead.</p>

<a name="90121-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09012194000003"></a>To hear the anger expressed from all sides of the House tonight about what has taken place gives us all pause for thought. All of us in this House recognise and accept that Israel is an astonishing creation. It is a democratic country built around values of liberty and freedom and the experience of a people who suffered centuries of persecution. However, that is what makes us all so saddened to see what has happened in Gaza in recent weeks. Of course, there is a right of self-protection. We have made that point repeatedly from all sides of this House. The rockets launched against Israeli civilians are never justified, but when 1,300 Palestinians have died against the 13 Israelis who have lost their lives, we are forced again to think: is this proportionate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09012194000004"></a>Noble Lords asked whether there will be international investigations and whether the UK Government will support them. I agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, that we must make sure that the facts are established. We must move beyond the reiteration of newspaper reports to establish once and for all what did or did not happen. We will support fully the efforts to establish independent international investigation of this.</p>

<a name="90121-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09012194000005"></a>It was particularly poignant for me to see the UN Secretary-General speaking from Gaza yesterday. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="09012194000094"></a>&#147;It is particularly significant for me as Secretary-General of the United Nations to stand in front of this bombed site of the United Nations ... compound. I am just appalled. I am not able to describe how I am feeling, having seen this site of the bombing of the United Nations compound ... I have protested many times, and am today protesting in the strongest terms, and am condemning it. I have asked for a full investigation and to make those responsible people accountable&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012194000089"></a>Her Majesty's Government support fully the demand of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for a full investigation of what has happened.</p>

<a name="90121-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09012194000006"></a>The use of white phosphorus has been condemned in another place by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary. We want to understand exactly how it was used. As I have said before, in certain cases, it is a legitimate weapon of war used to create a smokescreen to allow troops to advance. However, it appears to have been used in very different ways here to burn and maim civilians. If that is established, it is clearly a breach of the rules of war and must be exposed as such.</p>

<a name="90121-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09012194000007"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, reminded us that this debate is on the humanitarian situation. I hope that noble Lords will allow me to brief them on what is going on. As has been said, 400,000 people are living without water. Even before the current military operation, 80 per cent of drinking water in Gaza did not meet international standards for human consumption. Since 17 January, UNRWA has been able to resume deliveries of diesel, but fuel remains in very short supply. Most of Gaza&#146;s mills and bakeries, on which so many depend for their daily bread, are no longer operating. In many areas, sewage has spilled onto the streets.</p>

<a name="90121-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09012194000008"></a>Movement is now possible between the north and south of Gaza, but the destruction of critical infrastructure continues to make it particularly difficult to get supplies to those who need them most. As I have reported to this House, DfID has pledged nearly &#163;27 million since the conflict started. An additional &#163;20 million pledge, as part of that, was made earlier this week. The &#163;27 million includes &#163;4 million to the ICRC to help it save lives and provide medical treatment to the injured. A total of &#163;4 million will go to UNRWA for the provision of basic fuel and food supplies, including cash assistance for to up to 2,500 families. The sum of &#163;1 million has gone to the World Food Programme to co-ordinate relief items. A further &#163;1 million will go to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which will enable local UN humanitarian co-ordinators to allocate funds quickly and flexibly to emerging priorities, and also to make moneys available to NGOs and other organisations with staff on the ground, to meet emergency humanitarian needs.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09012194000009"></a>Along with my noble friend Lady Ramsay, we welcome the pledge from Saudi Arabia of $1 billion towards reconstruction. I also commend the different NGO groups active on the ground. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester referred to the different religious NGOs&#151;Christian, Muslim and Jewish&#151;that are trying to distribute relief. My noble friend Lord Judd referred to the role of Oxfam. We know that many British and international NGOs are working there in a heroic and important way.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09012194000010"></a>The UN today began a full needs assessment. We hope that this can be completed soon, so that we will all know what more is needed. As a number of noble Lords have said, access is critical to successful humanitarian relief. I was asked by my noble friend Lord Judd whether the Prime Minister raised this issue with Mr Olmert in Jerusalem at the weekend. I assure him that at the meeting on Sunday, the Prime Minister raised the issue of border restrictions and called for them to be eased. Tonight, our Foreign Secretary and other EU Foreign Ministers are meeting the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mrs Livni. They will reiterate our calls for easing those border restrictions and opening the crossing points.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09012194000011"></a>Karni is the largest crossing point, best configured to cope with large-scale flows of goods in either direction. We are particularly focused on making sure that this vital artery of humanitarian relief is open, and that aid can flow. In order to meet Israel&#146;s requirement that arms do not also flow through these border points, we must make sure that humanitarian access is secured along with assurances that it is humanitarian goods that are being transported. We believe that the 2005 movement and access agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority provides the framework for that. We will work with Egypt to establish security on its border. If necessary, we will look at extending the EU border assistance mission at the Rafah crossing, to provide European support for monitoring other crossing points beyond Rafah.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09012194000012"></a>As has been expressed so strongly in the House, a humanitarian sticking plaster may stop the bleeding, but it will not heal the wounds of Gaza. Nor will it provide long-term security to the citizens of those towns in Israel. That can come only from a robust political settlement. For that, we must move beyond the simple restoration of infrastructure to address the political sources of this conflict. The ceasefire is the first step, as UN Security Council Resolution 1860 made clear. However, we must go beyond this. Israel must withdraw its troops from Gaza, and they must not go back in. Hamas must put a final end to the rocket fire, as the noble Lord, Lord Steinberg, and others, said. We must also move forward on removing unexploded ordnance. An initial survey of that is starting this week.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09012194000013"></a>We must make sure also that the longer-term political progress to which we will return next week is followed up; that there is indeed a united Palestinian Government, able to deal with both Israel and the international community on issues of peace and development. The question was asked why European leaders went to Jerusalem last weekend. Let me point out that they also went to Sharm el-Sheikh. There was a determination  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1744"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1744</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that Europe must play a role, not just as a provider of assistance, but because we are generous donors, and because&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said&#151;Europe is a major market for Israel&#146;s exports. We must make our voice heard for a solution which provides for decency and fairness, and for a solution which respects the needs of both communities. Last year, my honourable friend the Foreign Secretary argued, for example, for stopping the import into Europe, or at least labelling the import into Europe, of goods made in illegal settlements. We are very conscious of these trade levers and must find ways to use them.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09012194000014"></a>To conclude, Britain, British NGOs, the United Nations agencies and the European Community organisations that we support will all play a major role in the humanitarian reconstruction of Gaza. But that is not enough. In this House, we all agree that humanitarianism can succeed only if the political roots of this terrible tragedy are also resolved once and for all.</p>

This is a simple probing amendment to raise a concern about any possible territorial conflict in this clause. I had a quick exchange with the Minister at an earlier stage on the negotiations under the CFP. It would be reassuring to hear again what he was able to tell me in a more or less off-the-cuff answer, but it was, presumably, exactly the right answer.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09012194000016"></a>The Explanatory Notes for this part of the Bill suggest that the Marine Management Organisation might be authorised to perform marine functions under the common fisheries policy. Does the Minister have a clear view of what functions can neatly be given to the MMO and are not likely to cause any confusion with the devolved settlements? Are there others which will require to be exercised over the whole of the designated fishery zone of the United Kingdom? Are any marine functions likely to be retained in the devolved area? Does the Minister anticipate that any possible confusions can be avoided? I beg to move.</p>

I want to emphasise that Clause 14 enables the Secretary of State to authorise the MMO to  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1745"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1745</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>perform any of his marine functions. This authorisation can be in relation to the UK marine area or parts of that area. The authorisation can apply generally or in specific cases.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09012194000018"></a>The amendment would&#151;I understand from the noble Duke&#146;s speech that this is a probing amendment&#151;remove the provision that the authorisation given to the MMO to perform these marine functions could relate to all or part of the UK marine area. This would restrict the flexibility we seek for the Secretary of State to make appropriate authorisations. It is important that we retain the flexibility to respond as necessary as there may be circumstances where we would want to specify in which part of the marine area the MMO is to exercise the relevant function, or there may be existing bodies in certain areas&#151;which certainly, it goes without saying, would include devolved powers&#151;carrying out functions, and the Secretary of State would not wish for the MMO to duplicate the arrangements already in place. I hope that that reassures the noble Duke in some respects.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09012194000019"></a>Perhaps it would assist if we were clear what sorts of functions will be included in the types of agreements that we envisage. This would include work currently undertaken by the Marine and Fisheries Agency under the common fisheries policy&#151;the licensing of fisheries vessels, the managing of fisheries quotas, the managing of fleet capacity and the managing of European grants schemes&#151;or under EU regulations which are directly applicable in the United Kingdom. In the future, the MMO may need to take on new functions, such as a role of competent authority under the marine strategy framework directive, which we anticipate to have significant implications for the United Kingdom, and future marine regulations and directives which emanate from Brussels.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09012194000020"></a>I would emphasise this point by way of reassurance: such a system was set up under Part 8 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2008 and it works well. This clause seeks to provide a means by which Ministers can delegate these future marine functions to the MMO where appropriate. The amendment would, of course, significantly restrict our options in responding to future needs, which we cannot, at present, identify in all cases. I hope, therefore, that the noble Duke will feel that he has been sufficiently reassured to be able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The first amendment is intended to probe whether the MMO will always be on the front foot. I suggest that the words &#147;vice versa&#148; would give the other eligible bodies the chance to enter into an agreement with the MMO. In other words, they might be proactive. The Bill as drafted suggests that the MMO is always the proactive body, leaving the other eligible bodies in the position of reacting to it. I would like the Minister to comment on whether he envisages an equal relationship between these various agencies, bodies and organisations, or whether the MMO will always be in the more proactive position, as Clause 15 suggests.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09012194000025"></a>I have tabled Amendment 65A because I would like the Minister&#146;s reassurance that the Environment Agency will remain the competent authority for the water framework directive. This is because of the issue of water quality in estuaries and just off the coast. This is obviously the jurisdiction of the MMO but, as the Bill is drafted, it is the jurisdiction of the MMO up to the highest high tide inland, which could be 16 or 20 miles inland. I want to know that the EA will remain the competent body because the water in those places is so affected by what happens on land that the run-off from land into rivers, estuaries and the sea should obviously stay within the competence of the Environment Agency. I would not like there to be any confusion on that. Even when it affects something that either the MMO or IFCAs may have responsibility for, it should be unequivocally the agency that remains responsible for water quality.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09012194000026"></a>I give one example that might be useful. I recently visited IGER in North Wyke, where some interesting work was being done on water quality, as affected by cattle dung on fields and the small organisms in it which then run off into freshwater&#151;such as streams and rivers&#151;and go downriver into the area where shellfish are raised. Obviously shellfish will not be under the EA&#146;s jurisdiction but the water quality should be. The effect that could be implemented by farming those fields differently, perhaps by creating bigger borders between the river bank and the farmed area of the field, will make a difference. It is, in some ways, quite a leap of imagination for people to think that practising a different agricultural regime 20 miles inland will affect shellfish beds, but that is the case.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09012194000027"></a>Much work is already under way in this area. We have had previous debates on the water framework directive, one of which I memorably introduced. There was so little interest that there were, I think, three speakers altogether. I am not expecting a lot more interest today, but water quality and the way in which the water framework directive enables this country to up its game is an important issue. As I have explained through the shellfish example, the knock-on effects are enormous, both environmentally and economically&#151;and, indeed, socially, as anyone who bathes in estuary areas or off the coast can tell you. It is an important issue.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09012194000028"></a>I look forward to the time when our water everywhere is of excellent quality. That is the reason I have raised the issue. I beg to move.</p>

I am pleased that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, has brought forward an amendment which would enable an eligible body to allow the MMO to carry out any of its functions. If the functions are statutory, this would appear to be entirely rational. We also welcome the idea of the MMO working closely together with eligible bodies which have been defined in the Bill. The range of expertise contained in the selection of bodies would be of considerable help to each other. The Government have set great stock by bodies working together within a framework of understanding and co-operation. This would appear to be another area where this should be encouraged.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09012194000031"></a>We should also&#151;although perhaps more guardedly&#151;welcome the noble Baroness&#146;s Amendment 65A and its focus on the water framework directive. The importance of the amendment lies in its desire to avoid ambiguity. Clarity can only be a good thing. Nevertheless we will be interested in the Minister&#146;s reply as we are keen to learn what he thinks of the amendment.</p>

So although I am absolutely sure the noble Lord was in all good faith assuring us that the Environment Agency would be the competent authority for the water framework directive, nevertheless there are things within the remit of the Infrastructure Planning Commission that will have big impacts on water quality and will prevent the Environment Agency ensuring that this country fulfils the requirements of the water framework directive.</p>

I am not suggesting for one moment that the Environment Agency has an easy role in fulfilling the ambition I was seeking to share with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. She introduced her amendment by saying that she was concerned about water quality, and so we all should be. I wanted to indicate that the Bill will not interfere with the Environment Agency&#146;s responsibilities or powers in those terms. As for the putative clash between members of the Davies family in your Lordships&#146; House, the noble Baroness will have to postpone that position until another day when the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Coity, is present to challenge me.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09012194000036"></a>On the earlier Amendment 64A, I emphasise that the purpose of Clause 15 is to enable the MMO, with the approval of the Secretary of State, to make agreements with any bodies listed in Clause 16, authorising them to undertake functions on the MMO&#146;s behalf. If they are doing that, then of course it is likely that the MMO&#151;I am not quite sure of the precise phrase the noble Baroness used&#151;will be the prime mover or initiator of the discussions, but that will be on the basis of co-operation and agreement. Those bodies include the Environment Agency, Natural England, local fisheries committees and the harbour authorities. This clause will enable the MMO to make arrangements for the most effective discharge of its functions, as those bodies may be better placed than it to carry out a function in a particular area. Nothing too malign should be read into the fact that the MMO may be taking the initiative.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09012194000037"></a>Let me show an example where it would be entirely proper for the MMO to do so. Under this Bill, the MMO is taking over the issuing of licences under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970. We have chosen this illustration with some care, as the noble Baroness will appreciate. While seals are primarily marine mammals, there are a few applications each year relating to seals in fresh waters. Since the MMO does not operate beyond the tidal reach, such applications will need to be dealt with by Natural England. That is the boundary issue we discussed on an earlier amendment.</p>

<a name="90121-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09012194000038"></a>The function will therefore need to be transferred to that body by the MMO using the flexible arrangements that we are seeking to create in Clause 15. The MMO would be the initiator, but I am sure the noble Baroness will recognise that as an entirely constructive way to use those powers. I hope that her probing amendment has called forth a response that satisfies her enough to withdraw it.</p>

As we have discussed, the MMO has responsibility for tidal waters as far as high tide. If the freshwater mussel, for example, was living at the extremity of that high water reach and the MMO was doing something that required action to preserve that area, but Natural England wanted the MMO to act to preserve the freshwater mussel, it would be good for them to be able to initiate exactly the same agreement that the Minister quoted for seals. However, as the Bill is drafted it seems that only the MMO is initiating agreements. I can see where the Minister is coming from, but as the Bill leaves only the MMO being proactive, I might return to it on Report.</p>

To an extent, it countervails the position in my illustration regarding the seals&#151;a pretty good one, I thought. Yet as far as her mussels are concerned, nothing stops Natural England making representations for the good of the environment and the protection of the mussels. The MMO has the ability to enter into an agreement in a memorandum of understanding or another contractual arrangement. By presenting an opportunity for the MMO to enter these agreements and take the initiative, we are creating a constructive power for it. We are not inhibiting the powers of others to make their case that effective action is necessary because they have identified an issue and it would be helpful if collaborative action took place. It would scarcely provide a basis for the co-operation and collaboration in the MMO&#146;s functions, which is envisaged throughout the Bill, if it were not responsive when others identified other issues.</p>

<a name="90121-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09012194000043"></a>We heard about the MMO&#146;s relationship with the Environment Agency in the previous debate. Yet again, there are areas of overlap. We have spoken a little already about the potential overlap between marine and coastal authorities. Examples of this abound when you consider the Environment Agency. Duties relating to freshwater fish stocks are, as the Explanatory Notes highlight, the responsibility of the Environment Agency. These are considerable areas of responsibility and authority, and there are many reasons why they should continue to be administered by that body. But the case is not so clear with Natural England, which is predominantly involved with conservation on the land. The Explanatory Notes can muster only the example of,</p>
<ul><a name="09012194000102"></a>&#147;a few applications each year relating to seals in freshwater&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09012194000090"></a>indeed, the Minister talked about seals&#151;as an area that might properly be passed over. Is the Minister really of the opinion that consistency and co-ordination are best served by having the huge majority of licences relating to seals handled by the MMO and a few handled by Natural England? It would surely be much more efficient for the MMO to take on responsibility for those few freshwater licenses.</p>

<a name="90121-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09012194000044"></a>The Bill appears to be structured in a way that rigorously defines and limits the MMO&#146;s responsibilities while remaining deliberately vague, although &#147;flexible&#148; is the word preferred by the Benches opposite, when it comes to other organisations. As a result, Natural England seems to be taking the opportunity to engage in mission creep, extending its own remit into areas much better suited for the MMO. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_211"></a>
<a name="09012194000045"></a><b><a name="90121-0013.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09012194000208"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me if I say that the amendment is rather unhelpful and that I hope that he will reconsider it. The Bill matters a great deal to an awful lot of people in this country because of its emphasis on access. Natural England has responsibilities as the delivery agent for access in this context. Furthermore, because of its role, Natural England seems particularly well placed to bring together matters concerning conservation in the marine environment and conservation on land. My own view is that it could play a constructive part in certain partnerships in fulfilling these responsibilities and ensuring that the social qualitative dimensions of the Bill are well implemented.</p>

<a name="90121-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09012194000046"></a>If we are to give Natural England the fair weather it deserves in its initial years, it is a pity to start paring back on the part it can play at the beginning of its operations rather than encouraging it to fulfil its obligations wherever these may be appropriate. I am quite concerned about the implications of this amendment and have absolutely no doubts that the Government have got the drafting right. I just hope that the noble Lord will find it possible to look at this again and perhaps have discussions with Ministers but certainly consider withdrawing it.</p>

I look forward to his future attendance at our debates on this Bill. e made a relevant point. I will come on to explain the Natural England role, but I want to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that he should not see this as  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1751"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1751</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mission creep. We see these arrangements as being sensible to ensure that the relationship between the various bodies is as effective as possible.</p>

<a name="90121-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09012194000048"></a>It is clear from all our debates in the two days of Committee that the MMO will need to work with a number of other organisations carrying out activities related to the marine area, including Natural England. The MMO and Natural England have different, albeit overlapping, remits. It will be important for them to co-operate in delivering their respective functions. The MMO will take advice from Natural England as a statutory nature conservation body in discharging its functions. For example, Natural England will provide input to marine and coastal access licensing decisions in the same way as it currently advises the Marine and Fisheries Agency. So there is no change essentially from the current position.</p>

<a name="90121-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09012194000049"></a>We think it likely that there will be a memorandum of understanding, with regular reviews, between the MMO and Natural England to formalise their working arrangements, as would be normal practice between two non-departmental public bodies in the same country. The MoU is likely to cover issues such as species licensing at the land/sea boundary, data-sharing between the two bodies, socioeconomic considerations for the selection of marine conservation zones and the management of those zones.</p>

<a name="90121-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09012194000050"></a>In addition, the MMO will take on some regulatory responsibilities that were formerly exercised by Natural England in the marine area. At the risk of repeating what my noble friend said, these include the power to grant licences in certain circumstances, under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and to issue licences in the inshore region, under the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c,) Regulations 1994, and in the offshore region, under the Offshore Marine Conservation (Natural Habitats. &amp;c,) Regulations 2007, which implement the EU Habitats and Wild Birds Directives, to which Clauses 9 and 10 refer.</p>

<a name="90121-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09012194000051"></a>As we have heard, another example is the licensing of seals under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970. This function is currently exercised by Natural England but is being transferred to the MMO under this Bill, given that seals are marine animals and the majority of these licences are needed in the marine environment. On the few occasions each year where it is necessary to kill or take a seal in fresh waters because it has ventured inland and is causing problems or is injured or distressed, the MMO would look to Natural England to undertake this as the MMO does not operate beyond the tidal reach. Amendment 66 would not allow the MMO the flexibility to do that.</p>

<a name="90121-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09012194000052"></a>I hope that I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that this is essentially a tidying-up exercise; it is not mission creep. We expect the MMO to carry out its own functions, but there will be circumstances in which it makes more sense for functions to be carried out on its behalf, for example where the appropriate expertise is shared with other bodies or for reasons of limitation or geographical remit. Listing a body in Clause 16 makes it possible for the MMO to enter into agreements with that body, but I want to make it clear   


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1752"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column 1752</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that such agreements will be made only when necessary and appropriate and with the Secretary of State&#146;s approval, which is another safeguard against mission creep, if that were to come in evidence. I also want to make it clear that such agreements do not remove the responsibility of the MMO for the relevant functions. The MMO will remain accountable to the Secretary of State and to Parliament for the delivery of the functions, on which it will have to make an annual report to Parliament.</p>

<a name="90121-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09012194000053"></a>We see this as a sensible implementation of legislative provisions by the relevant delivery organisations working in collaborative partnership. We want to retain flexibility in this regard and we think that Natural England is clearly one body that it would be appropriate for the MMO to enter into agreement with to deliver functions on its behalf. The respective remits of the MMO and Natural England are very different. Natural England has a largely advisory role relating to nature conservation. While it plays an important role in nature conservation and will need to work very closely with the MMO on certain matters, there is absolutely no intention to transfer functions wholesale from the MMO to Natural England. The noble Lord said that this was a probing amendment and I hope that I have reassured him.</p>

<p><a name="st_213"></a>
<a name="09012194000054"></a><b><a name="90121-0013.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09012194000210"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> I thank the Minister for that reply, the nature of which shows that this has been an important discussion. I am reassured that the Minister sees the role of the MMO as central, even if it is engaged in the activities of Natural England in both an advisory and a practical way. I hope that I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Judd, whose intervention I welcome because it has made it a real discussion on this important area. We should not underestimate the huge opportunities that exist for Natural England on the mainland. It has no shortage of things that it can be doing.</p>

<a name="90121-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09012194000055"></a>Natural England can speak for itself, but we have to speak for the MMO because it is not there yet and we need to make sure that it is properly enshrined in the legislation. If we want it to be a proper and effective conservation body, we have to make sure that the conservation role is central to its activities. We must not let it get sidelined from this area of activities. It needs a balance in its skill base and its science. We have heard a lot about science today but I think that the MMO is going to have to be very much a science-based organisation. A lot is going to rest on Memoranda of Understanding throughout the Bill. We know in reality that Parliament will not be discussing those Memoranda of Understanding, but I hope that we will at any rate have the opportunity of scrutinising the outcomes properly.</p>

I do not suggest that this is the only way in which it is monitored, but the annual report that has to be laid before Parliament will of course be one way in which parliamentarians will be able to observe the progress of the MMO and its relationship with the various organisations that it will have to deal with.</p>

<p><a name="09012194000091"></a>As we are well aware, the power of delegation is very significant and it is very important that any delegated task is not compromised.

We produced slightly different versions but the amendments are effectively identical. They seek to do something very simple and specific but worthwhile: ensuring that the MMO satisfies itself that any eligible body to which it is seeking to give appropriate responsibilities has the appropriate skills and experience to ensure that that function is carried out properly. It is very straightforward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09012194000065"></a>Similar quality control may be needed in Clause 53, on delegation of marine planning functions to unspecified public bodies. The same principle applies. At this stage, however, all we are trying to do is to ensure that the Government fully recognise the need for this requirement to be placed on the MMO.</p>

The core of the earlier debates that we have had about the objective emphasised the importance of biodiversity and the ecosystem methodology that the MMO will apply to confront the various issues that it will have to, when it is an established institution. Can we be confident that the same objectives will be applied by the organisations to which these powers are, potentially, delegated?</p>

One has to be clear, too, that in the end it is the MMO that is accountable to the Secretary of State and, through him or her, to Parliament, for ensuring that these functions are carried out properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09012194000068"></a>I have listened with great interest. It is always difficult to draw the balance between micromanagement, on one hand, and wishing to ensure that the bodies that we legislate for do the right thing, on the other. I wonder whether noble Lords are not going down the micromanagement route a little too far. Of course, I understand&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, underpinned the point&#151;the desire to ensure that the body to which a delegation is made carries the job out effectively and, of course, within the principles that govern the MMO. However, the bodies listed in Clause 16 are those that carry out marine functions, or will do so as a result of the Bill, with which the MMO will need to co-operate. They include the Environment Agency, Natural England, the sea fisheries committees as a transitional measure, and harbour authorities, all of which have recognised expertise and authority in their respective fields. Inshore fisheries and conservation authorities are also on the list, as they will replace the fisheries committees when the Bill is enacted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09012194000069"></a>Another safeguard to which I referred in the previous group is that the MMO can enter into agreements only with the approval of the Secretary of State. The agreement for others to deliver MMO functions on its behalf does not remove its responsibility for those functions. There are also restrictions in the Bill on the type of body that can be added to the list in Clause 16. They require that the Secretary of State is satisfied that at least one purpose or function of the body concerned must be a marine function. I find it difficult to envisage circumstances in which the MMO would enter into agreement with organisations that did not have the expertise to undertake the relevant functions, or which the Secretary of State would condone on that basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09012194000070"></a>Some noble Lords seem quite content to give the MMO a veto on planning consents, placing it higher in the hierarchy than the IPC. On the other hand, they are not prepared to trust it in relation to these delegations. In this case, we should surely be able to trust the MMO, given the construct of the Bill.</p>

The amendment focuses not on the MMO but on the Secretary of State, ensuring that he performs that function and does not add to the list anyone who does not have a proper marine function.</p>

A minute ago the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, was talking about not micromanaging. By including subsection (4), the Government are really trying to micromanage what local authorities can and cannot do. Subsection (4), which I would like to amend, talks about the fact that joint committees, between two or more local authorities, may not have the powers that the Bill might otherwise provide.</p>

<a name="90121-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09012194000074"></a>I remember how much the Government do not like joint committees between two or more local authorities, because we talked about it extensively in the Local Government Act 2000. They have many reasons why they do not like this arrangement. They prefer the direct executive arrangement and think that that is more accountable. Nevertheless the flexibility still exists to allow smaller councils to have committees and joint committees. There can be no reason why that should not happen, particularly when estuary areas often form the division between two local authority areas. Rivers were often the boundary between different areas, and council boundaries were often along lines drawn by geography. There are often different local authorities on each side of a river. In practical terms, having joint committees makes absolute sense. It will be interesting to hear why the Minister believes that that is not acceptable if local authorities themselves can come up at a local level with a good arrangement whereby they have a joint committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09012194000075"></a>Surely it is fiddling in micromanagement to say exactly what should be decided at a local level. The heading for Chapter 3, which is where this clause lies, actually says:</p>
<ul><a name="09012194000104"></a>&#147;&#147;Flexible administrative arrangements involving the MMO&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012194000076"></a>Subsection (4) is not very flexible, even if local authorities should come together to say that this is what should happen on their two joint sides of a river and they would like to have a joint committee with these powers. The Government would exclude that. Perhaps the Minister has a watertight reason for leaving subsection (4) in. I cannot imagine what it might be. I await an answer. I beg to move.</p>

We support the great effects of flexibility and cannot understand why the Government rejected joint committees of two or more local authorities. Perhaps the Minister can explain the reasons behind this blanket rejection. Surely if the circumstances are applicable, it must be correct to allow functions to be carried out by, or to be delegated to those who may be part of, a joint committee of two or more local authorities, as was so ably expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller.

I assume that this is a probing amendment but if it is not&#151;I thought that the previous amendment was probing until we went to a Division&#151;I wish to point out one thing about it; namely, it would have absolutely no practical effect if it were agreed. It would remove part of the provision whereby a local authority exercising the power of a harbour authority may use various usual powers of internal delegation&#151;whether full council or executive, as applicable&#151;to perform a particular function, as specified in regulations made under Section 13 of the Local Government Act 2000.</p>

However, I am seeking to defend the position in the Bill. I stress that that wording is in the Bill because we wish to emphasise that we are talking about one authority, which is a harbour authority. The noble Baroness introduced the concept of estuary authorities, which I do not deny are very important, but they are not harbour authorities and therefore do not relate to the situation that we seek to confront here.</p>

<a name="90121-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09012194000083"></a>As we discussed earlier, Clause 15 enables the MMO, with the approval of the Secretary of State, to make agreements with the eligible bodies listed in Clause 16 to carry out functions on the MMO&#146;s behalf. I hasten to add the obvious point that we are creating the MMO to carry out its own functions; we expect it largely to carry them out and there is no intention of transferring functions wholesale to others. The point of the Bill is to create the MMO with the powers that it needs. However, as we indicated in earlier debates, there will be occasions when, for reasons of resources, expertise or geographical remit, another body is better placed to perform a function on the MMO&#146;s behalf. We seek to create a degree of flexibility, and the list of bodies includes harbour authorities.</p>

<a name="90121-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09012194000084"></a>Clause 20 makes additional provision in relation to any agreement with a harbour authority where that harbour authority is also a local authority. Under the Local Government Act 2000 and subordinate legislation, each function of a principal local authority&#151;and, by heavens, I appreciate that I may be in great danger of seeking to teach several noble Lords how to suck eggs, when they have deep expertise in this area&#151;is administered either directly by the full council or through executive arrangements, depending on the function. The full council or executive&#151;as applicable&#151;of that authority may use various usual powers of delegation, for example to its committees or to the officers of that authority, to perform the function.</p>

<p><a name="09012194000093"></a>It refers to a committee of the harbour authority. Clause 20 allows delegation only to committees of the same authority. I emphasise that although Clause 15 gives the MMO the ability to enter into agreements with the bodies listed in Clause 16, it may do so only with the approval of the Secretary of State. The fact that a body is included in the list in Clause 16 does not mean that the MMO will inevitably delegate functions to it. I hasten to add that the purpose of the clause is to deal with the issue of the harbour authority and its proper right of delegation, not to raise the issue which the noble Baroness raised about more than one authority being involved, because that is not the power which is envisaged; nor does the deletion of subsection (4) materially affect that position.</p>

Yet 15 years ago, they were virtually unknown and they certainly played very little part. I know that the Minister recognises that, because she went to some length in her response on Monday to stress the important role that these partnerships play.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000005"></a>The partnerships are relatively recent developments and they are still little understood by local people&#151;the public. Indeed, I suspect that most members of the public do not even know of their existence, let alone of the very important work that they do. I fear that that   


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC108"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may be true of a number of councillors as well. An even more recent development arising through these partnerships is the local area agreements and much more recently there have been the multi-area agreements, which again are playing an increasingly important part in the work of local economic development and so on. My noble friend and I therefore feel that the fact that they are not specifically referred to in this part of the Bill is an important omission.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000006"></a>I know from the clues that we had on Monday that the Minister is likely to say that these partnerships are intended to be included under what is already in the Bill and that reference to them will be included in the guidance that will be forthcoming. I am sure that all of that is right. However, these partnership boards now play a greater role in their own right than any of the constituent members of the boards. Although the local authority may well describe the functions and arrangements of the local police service or the local health service, that is not the same thing as talking about the role of the local strategic partnership board, for example, never mind the other boards that are rather less well known.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000007"></a>The purpose of the amendment is not simply to rely on guidance&#151;guidance is just guidance&#151;but explicitly to put in the Bill our recognition that partnership working and the partnership boards, to which all local authorities now belong, are extremely important to the democratic life of every area of the country. The complexity of the boards and the fact that often they do not meet in public, or certainly not with the same degree of public understanding, make it more important that their functions, operation and arrangements are explained in a way that I suspect does not happen now in many areas.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000008"></a>I believe that this is the most necessary aspect of what this part of the Bill seeks to achieve. Most people think that they understand local authorities; even if they do not fully understand them, at least they are aware of their existence and have some idea of what they do. However, I suspect that the very existence of many of these partnership boards is not known, let alone understood. The Minister may not concede this point today&#151;I am not that optimistic&#151;but I hope that she will agree to think more seriously about how we address these very important partnership arrangements as we consider the Bill.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000009"></a>Amendment 27 is self-explanatory. It would simply add the words &#147;(if any)&#148;, to recognise that some of the bodies that are listed do not have democratic arrangements&#151;that is a simple statement of fact&#151;and by their nature never will have. The amendment proposes a simple addition to the Bill that recognises a reality.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000010"></a>Amendment 29 would allow a principal local authority not to have to duplicate work that may be and probably is already being done by a number of the connected authorities. If those authorities are already explaining their functions and their democratic arrangements, as many of them do, a simple reference to that fact from the principal local authority should be sufficient, to avoid the necessity of repeating the whole lot again. The amendment would make that explicit. I beg to move.</p>

I hope that the Minister will be able to take on board his constructive criticism.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000012"></a>Amendment 27 would add a rather scathing caveat in relation to the democratic arrangements of connected authorities. The noble Lord is right to point out that these connected authorities may not have any democratic arrangements, which would make it difficult for the principal authority to promote those arrangements as democratic. I can think of only one justification for the provision, which is, as I suggested before, that the Minister would like the undemocratic nature of these unelected and unaccountable bodies to be fully exposed. If that is not the case, the duty in Clause 2 is nothing more than words. It allows the Government to claim that they are promoting democracy when they are doing nothing very much at all.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000013"></a>Amendment 29 is a sensible consideration. If the connected authorities are already promoting understanding of their functions and arrangements, there is little point in that work being duplicated by a principal authority.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000014"></a>I hope that the Minister will accept that many, if not all, of the amendments today are an attempt to sort out the legislation into a workable and meaningful form. I hope that she will be able to take the Bill away and consider these provisions in that positive light.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000015"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09012162000117"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> This is the first of four important groups of amendments that seek to make alterations in relation to the list of connected authorities. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, suggests in Amendment 24 that we include partnerships and other joint working arrangements in the range of information to be provided about connected authorities. He also proposes in Amendment 27 that local authorities should provide information on democratic arrangements only where they exist and in Amendment 29 that local authorities should take into account the existing efforts of these bodies to promote themselves and their democratic arrangements.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000016"></a>Here is an opportunity to explain briefly and to put on the record what we seek to do in Clause 2, which is to require local authorities to provide information about the functions and democratic arrangements of connected authorities that provide or shape public services in the area. By connected authorities, we mean the police, health, schools, FE colleges and fire and rescue services, among others&#151;all services that are designed and developed in close partnership with the local authorities, even if the local authorities are not finally responsible or accountable for them. They are all services that would benefit from closer engagement with and wider representation from local people.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000017"></a>I pay tribute to the role that the noble Lord has played on LSPs and CDRPs. He also rightly talked about the multi-area agreements. Having observed at close quarters the work of LSPs, I know that they are quite complex bodies. I have seen several of them.  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC110"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Indeed, I made a point of monitoring some of their work on local area agreements. They are often very large, are chaired by different sorts of people and make critical decisions about priorities in their local area. They can be quite elusive. We are absolutely right to take partnership seriously because we want local people to be involved in shaping services.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000018"></a>We have thought hard about what should be on the list of connected authorities and about the task that we are asking of them. I underline the fact that we explained to all the representatives of the bodies named what we are seeking to do. They have been very supportive of the proposal. The bodies on the list, whether we are talking about PCTs or the fire service, know that their work is more effective when it is better understood and when it is supported locally. They are therefore very keen to work with us on this. I also stress that the list does not limit the bodies with which a local authority may choose to work. It is also important to say that that list of public bodies is not the same as the list of those bodies that are subject to the duty to co-operate in LAAs. That is deliberate; indeed, it is why they are called connected authorities. They are the bodies with democratic arrangements that involve local people or their representatives.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000019"></a>I thought that the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, was slightly misleading about what we have taken as our defining point. We included a primary care trust because it delivers services to its local communities and takes decisions, but we did not include organisations such as Arts Council England because it is a national body with a regional presence, although it works with and advises local authorities. Above all&#151;noble Lords surely support me in this&#151;we want this duty to be appropriate and not to give local authorities a long list of every public organisation that has an interest in their area. That would be overly burdensome. We have discussed all the arrangements in the list with the Local Government Association, and the list has its support.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000020"></a>Amendment 29 implies that these organisations have their own requirements to produce information on their governance processes. That is right, but the organisations exist across a wide spectrum of places and deliver to very different standards and expectations. It is not always clear how people can find out about some of the services that they receive. How many people know, for example, how to become a school governor or a member of a foundation trust? We are trying to encourage a sensible approach to collecting the information.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000021"></a>Yes, we have committed to use guidance, because that is the proportionate and proper approach. The list in the Bill ensures that we will require local authorities to provide understanding of the connected authorities and their democratic arrangements only where that is relevant to the local authority. If the body has no relevance to the area, we do not expect them to do this. We would not expect any authorities outside East Anglia to provide information about the Broads Authority, for example.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000022"></a>We trust local authorities to take a sensible approach but there is a very important caveat to which I shall come back time and again as we debate these clauses.   


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Nothing in this duty restricts local authorities to these bodies alone. If they want to go further and apply this duty to other bodies, they are at liberty to do so.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000023"></a>This is new territory for local government and its partners. As I say, that is why we are looking to provide exemplification in statutory guidance. We will work with local government representatives and the connected authorities to ensure that we get the pitch, tone and scope of all that right.</p>
<h5><a name="09012162000108"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000024"></a>We also recognise that we may need to review the list of connected authorities under Clause 2(6) to ensure that it stays relevant and appropriate. That is why we are seeking a power for the Secretary of State to amend the list&#151;we shall come to that on a later amendment&#151;but only after appropriate consultation with local government and the bodies concerned.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000025"></a>Amendment 24 is important. We discussed elements of it when we discussed Amendment 5 in a previous group. We value enormously the role of partnerships and their critical role in shaping public services and amplifying the local voice, not least because so many agencies from the voluntary sector are represented. Where a partnership consists of a local authority and public bodies that are on the connected authorities list, the requirement to provide information about the functions and democratic arrangements of the council and connected authorities will ensure that information about the partnership will also be covered. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, anticipated my response. It will be covered and we will make that clear in guidance.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000026"></a>We recognise that these are important issues. They are part of an evolving local landscape. There are problems about definition, but I shall think about the argument that the noble Lord put forward and ask officials to wrestle further with this. I cannot make any commitments because this is a difficult legal area, but I shall take the matter away and think about its implications and how best we might approach it. However, I cannot make any promises because I genuinely do not know whether the approach that is suggested is achievable.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000027"></a>As regards Amendment 27, I reiterate what I have said. I appreciate the intent but the bodies on the list of connected authorities all have some form of democratic arrangement based on our broad definition. As I have made clear, we expect local authorities to interpret these duties intelligently.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000028"></a>Amendment 29 proposes that local authorities may consider the extent to which a connected authority promotes understanding of these matters. There is a reasonable challenge here to prevent duplication. For example, foundation hospitals take seriously the duty to provide information about themselves. We want local authorities to create a single point of contact and we want to encourage joint working. We want to bring different people into these bodies, which serve a diverse public. Therefore, putting information in one place opens up opportunities to people that they may not have at the moment. We shall use guidance to promote a sensible and pragmatic approach. I hope that, on that basis, the Committee will be satisfied that we have met most of these possibilities.</p>

I cannot agree that all these bodies have democratic arrangements. Where is the democratic arrangement in a primary care trust? I do not see it. As regards the argument that local strategic partnerships are distant from local authorities, nothing could be further from the truth. The local strategic partnership in Berwick produces plans which are then adopted by the council. Indeed, since these partnerships have been set up, it has become clear that unless you have extremely close working between local councils and local strategic partnerships, things do not work. The noble Baroness is right in the sense that the partnerships do not have very good democratic processes. In fact, I was absolutely appalled that an election to our local strategic partnership in Berwick was carried out through the local paper and people could be nominated to be chair of it through that means. Therefore, she is right in that respect. However, my noble friend has a good point and I hope that the Minister and her department will look carefully at the definition that they have given this afternoon, which I do not think holds water.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000030"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09012162000119"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am happy to write a detailed letter explaining the democratic arrangements as they are interpreted for each of the bodies set out in subsection (2). For example, strategic health authorities, which manage the local NHS, are a key link between the Department of Health and the rest of the local health arrangements. They work with local authorities&#146; overview and scrutiny committees and thus have a democratic link with them. Since April 2003, SHAs have been obliged to consult O&amp;S committees. The DoH asked that SHAs be included along with PCTs, and we have responded to that request. PCTs have trust boards&#151;</p>

I would ask this: why should not this information be available to local people and why should local people not be able to put themselves forward? The noble Baroness has already said that some local authority arrangements, such as with PCTs, are in fact not sufficient or working well. I am equally at a loss to understand why the party opposite is hostile to our efforts in trying to open up opportunities for local people to take part. It is no good the noble Baroness shaking her head, because we need this on the record. As I have said, I am happy to write a detailed letter explaining how these arrangements work and should be improved.</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC113"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>centres on the fact that we do not understand the hierarchy. For that reason, I ask the noble Baroness to look at this again.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000034"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09012162000123"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I have made two commitments. I will write to the noble Baroness and copy to all interested parties an explanation of the democratic arrangements as we interpret them in relation to the bodies that we have identified, along with the criteria that we have used. I will also consider again the partnership issue and see whether we can deal with it in some other way.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000035"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09012162000124"></a>Lord Tope:</b> I thank the Minister for that reply, although at times I think that we were a little at cross purposes. We are not hostile to these arrangements. Indeed, we welcome greater understanding of all these arrangements&#151;that is the motivation behind the amendments.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000036"></a>I am surprised, to be frank, that what I thought was the mildest amendment in the group, which seeks only to add the words &#147;(if any)&#148;, has created the most heat. Whether one likes it or not, it is a given that a number of the bodies listed simply do not have democratic arrangements in the sense that I would understand the phrase. Whether they should or should not have them can be debated another time, but in my opinion they do not. All that this tiny amendment sought to do was to recognise the reality, whether one likes it or not. I do not know why it has created so much heat. I am grateful to the Minister for her offer and I look forward with enormous interest to hearing about the democratic arrangements for each of the bodies in the list.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000037"></a>Before the noble Baroness writes, perhaps I may ask her to start with a definition of her understanding of what &#147;democratic arrangements&#148; means. I have to say that appointment by the Secretary of State, whether that is right or wrong, is not what I understand to be a democratic arrangement, certainly in relation to local democracy. We are talking about a Bill to promote local democracy. Whether this is the right way to do it is not the point; the point is that we cannot see how an appointment made by the Secretary of State is part of the local democratic process. However, we can pursue that argument another time.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000038"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for her commitment to look at partnerships in her response to our main amendment. Amendment 24 addresses an important issue and I was concerned when she almost compared a primary care trust with the Arts Council. There is no comparison at all. Primary care trusts and the other bodies listed in the clause are to varying extent statutory bodies. The Arts Council, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and the entire range of voluntary bodies play an enormously important part in the local community and often in its democratic arrangements. I accept that it is not entirely appropriate to specify them in the Bill and I do not think that I suggested that they should be.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000039"></a>I have concentrated primarily on local strategic partnerships and CDRPs but there are many others; I did not attempt to list them all. The point that I am trying to make is that in a Bill that seeks to promote  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC114"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>local understanding of how democracy works and the wider role of governance, as distinct from government, in a local area&#151;an objective that we fully support, although we have doubts about how this is being done&#151;the role of these partnerships and the purpose and achievements of local area agreements and, even more, of multi-area agreements are enormously important. I suggest, and I do not think anyone would deny it, that they are probably least understood by the public and many of the participants, including many local councillors. That is partly because these partnerships are fairly new, partly because they are complex and partly because, rightly or wrongly, they tend not to be much in the public eye&#151;the local media do not understand them any more than anyone else does, and tend not to report them.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000040"></a>I am sure that the Minister will think seriously about this: if anything needs better promotion and better understanding with regard to local democracy and local governance, it is the role of these partnerships and the agreements that go with them. For the time being, I rest my case that this is an important matter to be listed specifically and separately in Section 2(1), as suggested in the amendment. In anticipation, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The reason for doing that is that &#147;persons&#148; are legal persons: they are corporate bodies, individuals or whatever. For all the reasons that my noble friends have just been talking about with regard to partnerships, which are sometimes not legal persons although sometimes they are, &#147;person&#148; seems to be an inappropriate term. We want to replace it with a neutral term and &#147;body&#148; was the best that I could come up with. If the Government have a better one, that is fine.</p>

Perhaps the Government can look at that as well. Some of the bodies that we would like to see included as connected authorities are

<p><a name="09012162000044"></a>The Minister, when she was describing what connected authorities are, on the previous group of amendments, said that they are those local organisations&#151;she did not use that word&#151;that have arrangements for involvement and deliver local services. It is our submission that there are a large number of bodies that have arrangements for involvement and, whether or not they technically deliver services, in practice, in the real world, they certainly make important decisions that affect the delivery of services. They may not be the people who go out and empty the bins&#151;if we can talk about that again&#151;but they are certainly people who have a real influence on what happens locally, which is what matters.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000045"></a>I shall digress slightly and talk about a partnership of which I am a member&#151;I declare an interest. It is the Whitefield Regeneration Partnership, which had the privilege of a visit by the Minister last spring. She came to look at everything that we had not yet managed to do and things that we were hoping to do; things are moving slowly. The partnership is chaired with great distinction by my noble friend Lord Shutt of Greetland. That partnership has no powers to do anything, but it meets usually once a month. It consists of a series of partners, including the local authority, Pendle Borough Council, the other local authority, Lancashire County Council, important providers of funding, such as English Partnerships, and a number of heritage bodies. It covers a rather interesting area, where there is an attempt to regenerate an old 19th-century industrial area and terraced streets in a heritage-based way&#151;a sort of mini-Saltaire, I suppose. There are also a number of other bodies. It includes local residents, representatives of local businesses and probably quite a few others that I have forgotten about. A number of other bodies that are not members come along to take part in the meetings and contribute to what happens.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000046"></a>In practice, the powers for a great deal of what the partnership does&#151;such as for declaring a compulsory purchase order on an area of land, for, we hope, changing the pattern of the local streets, for traffic calming and for deciding on the materials and the nature of the local streets and so on&#151;are by and large held by the two concerned local authorities: the district council and the county council. Some of them are not. Some of the powers are held by the funding bodies, because they decide what they will fund and what they will not fund. English Partnerships, in its previous incarnation, played a very important role in deciding what can and cannot happen. It has used some of its powers to provide funds for some of the schemes in the area.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000047"></a>The point that I am making is this: the partnership itself is not a corporate body and cannot go out and do anything, but it is the partnership that makes the decisions about what happens in the area. Therefore, it is wrong not to include the Whitefield Regeneration Partnership in a map of who makes decisions in the area and how decisions are made, as well as in relation

The partnership has a local community forum in which all the local residents can be involved. Some of those residents come to the partnership meetings representing the forum. That kind of partnership is absolutely crucial to what we are talking about. If you are making a list of bodies in Pendle, my area, it is essential that the body should be included, and yet there is no requirement in the Bill that that body should be included.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000048"></a>The Minister may say, as she said on the previous amendment, that if local authorities or connected authorities are on a partnership, the provisions of the Bill will apply to the partnership. However, there is nothing to say that the authority has to say what the Whitefield partnership does, how it works, who the members are or how they have been appointed, other than those who relate directly to the council. We do not understand why the Government are so reluctant to put these pervasive partnerships, which have burgeoned in recent years, into legislation. There seems to be a total reluctance to do that. Are there legal reasons why it cannot be done? The Minister has said that she will take this away and look at it, so I shall say no more about it.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000049"></a>My amendment would simply change the word that describes the organisations in this list from &#147;person&#148; to &#147;body&#148;, which would allow non-legal persons to be listed. I do not want to go on at great length again about local strategic partnerships but, if you cannot put them into the Bill, these provisions are meaningless. You have to put them in if you are going to have these lists. I may not be proposing the right word, but you need a word to describe them. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000050"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09012162000127"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> There were recurring themes in the noble Lord&#146;s contribution on the definition of partnerships, which points to the fact that it is difficult to define some legal terms, certainly partnerships. I will say no more, because my noble friend has agreed to look again at the important issue of the definition of partnerships.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000051"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s Amendments 31, 42, 49, 50, 52 and 53 would change the references to &#147;person&#148; or &#147;persons&#148; to &#147;body&#148; or &#147;bodies&#148;. As he said, he wants to ensure that all the connected authorities in Clause 2 are covered, particularly the partnerships. However, the term &#147;person&#148; or &#147;persons&#148; is defined in the Interpretation Act 1978 and includes a natural person, or an artificial person such as a body corporate, and, most important, an unincorporated body, which would include local authority partnerships. The term &#147;person&#148; encompasses a broader range of legal entities than the proposed &#147;body&#148; or &#147;bodies&#148;. Specifically, &#147;person&#148; would include the chief officer of police, whereas &#147;body&#148; would not, and would be at least as apt to include partnerships.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000052"></a>There is a precedent throughout related legislation to the use of the term &#147;person&#148;. In particular, I draw the noble Lord&#146;s attention to Section 104 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, which refers to persons in the list of partner authorities. He also commented on the use of the word &#147;authority&#148; in relation to the connected authorities in Clause 2. They are referred to as connected authorities because

It is simply a convenient term designed to sound less legislative than &#147;connected persons&#148;. I hope that that clarification will go some way towards reassuring the noble Lord, and I ask him to withdraw his amendment.</p>

That is the problem with someone doing this who is not a lawyer, unlike the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, who comes up with legal points that are all very valid. What you call these things is not the substantive issue; the substantive issue is whether it is possible to include in the schemes a sensible description of local governance. If the word &#147;person&#148; allows that and this is on the record, I am happy. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I was trying to work out the thinking of the people who drew up the lists. List 2 is merely set up by the first item in list 1, so I do not understand the difference. Perhaps the Government did not want the list to be too long; I do not know. It is not clear why the lists are exactly as they are. It is very clear why some of the bodies or persons in the lists are included. It is clear why the local authorities, parish councils and the Broads Authority are there. A series of amendments in this group and the next group but one probes why some bodies are included and why some are not. I hope that the Minister will take the amendments in the spirit in which they were tabled; they are an attempt to understand why the lists are there and to obtain a commitment, which she has already given, to come back with a letter about all these issues explaining what the democratic arrangements are and why the lists are there. That would be useful and, as my noble friend said earlier, interesting, because we do not quite understand these lists.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000058"></a>Amendment 32 proposes the inclusion in the list of the joint board or joint committee of which the council is a member. In a sense, joint boards and joint committees are a bit old-fashioned; nowadays, they are called partnerships. Nevertheless, they are joint boards and joint committees and it is not clear why they are not included as a category. If a joint board or joint committee merely consists of local authorities, which is the traditional kind of joint board or joint committee, the Minister will tell us that the local authorities will have this duty and, therefore, they will have it collectively.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000059"></a>However, saying why each individual is represented on the list, and how they are related, is different from saying what that body does and how it functions as a body in its own right. One example that I can think of is Elevate, the housing market renewal partnership in east Lancashire, or Pennine Lancashire, as we are told to call it. This body started off as a traditional partnership but is now a company. It has a board that, deplorably, consists merely of officer representation from each council, and a wider managing committee that consists of the leaders of the councils as well. That is traditionally described as a joint board. It is certainly a joint body. It is a corporate body in its own right and it is very important, because it disburses a lot of government funding&#151;some &#163;50 million to &#163;60 million a year&#151;in east Lancashire. In doing that, it has a considerable influence over the policies of the five councils&#151;one unitary and four districts&#151;which receive this money and carry out housing regeneration and housing market renewal schemes on its and central government&#146;s behalf.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000060"></a>However, the district councils are not just given the money; they get it on the basis of complex negotiated agreements to policies coming from the centre to the joint body, Elevate, and in turn from that body to the districts. If you do not agree with what the body is saying, you have to argue your point in negotiations. Elevate is an important public body that takes decisions which influence the way in which a lot of public money is spent, so it ought to be on the list relating to how governance works in Pennine Lancashire. On the basis of what is set out here, it is not clear that it would be.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000061"></a>Those of us involved in local issues could come up with hundreds of examples such as this. It is important that all these things are included. Our concern is that, by being so prescriptive in the list in the Bill, the Government are excluding everything else. The Minister might say that this does not have to happen, but in practice it will. An onerous duty is being put on councils to produce and propagate this information, so a lot of them will do the minimum; they will do what they have to do to comply with the legislation.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000062"></a>Amendment 33 probes how the functions of the Homes and Communities Agency fit in with bodies that have arrangements for involvement in and the delivery of local services. I am not sure how HaCA, as people are rather dismally starting to refer to it, fits in.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000063"></a>Amendments 35 and 56 are slightly teasing in nature because they refer to academy schools and seek to put them on the same footing as,</p>

<p><a name="09012162000099"></a>We all know that academies are not maintained schools and do not have any democratic arrangements, but there seem to be some other bodies here that do not have them either. However, if we are referring to the system of publicly funded school governance in an area, why are they missed out? That is the question that the Government have to be asked. I beg to move.</p>

<ul><a name="09012162000105"></a>&#147;the ... governing body of a further education institution&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012162000100"></a>I have tabled the amendment after being approached by the Association of Colleges, which has expressed its concern about this provision. I share that concern, but I want to raise a wider point, because it could apply to any of the bodies listed in this clause that are not controlled by the local authority.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000065"></a>Further education colleges were detached from local authority control by the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, which also established college governing bodies. In the past 15 years, colleges have worked as independent, autonomous, incorporated institutions. I am sure that the noble Baroness will agree that self-governance has worked for these colleges and should be preserved. Part of this autonomy means that colleges are themselves responsible for selecting and appointing new governors to existing governing bodies, which always include representatives from the local community, local businesses, parents, staff and students.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000066"></a>In Clause 1(1), the Bill places a new duty on local authorities to promote understanding of the functions and democratic arrangements of public bodies and of,</p>
<ul><a name="09012162000106"></a>&#147;how members of the public can take part in those democratic arrangements and what is involved in taking part&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000067"></a>I touched on this in an earlier amendment, but how do the Government define &#147;democratic arrangements&#148; in relation to further education colleges and, indeed, to all the bodies included in Clause 2?</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000068"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that the children, skills and learning Bill to be introduced during this parliamentary Session will propose a new role for local authorities in funding education and training for 16 to 18 year-olds. However, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Department for Children, Schools and Families have stressed that colleges will remain autonomous and not come under the direct control of local authorities. Therefore, I would appreciate clarification from the Minister on what activities the Government expect a local authority to perform when promoting understanding of the democratic arrangements of colleges and the other connected authorities. Will the duty in reality amount to not very much at all, as I have suggested?</p>

<p><a name="09012162000069"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09012162000134"></a>Lord Tope:</b> The debate so far has exposed the difficulties of being prescriptive.

I speak specifically to Amendment 41 standing in my name and that of my noble friend, which would add regional development  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC120"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>agencies to the ever growing list. However, if the noble Baroness has her way, perhaps it will be a slightly reduced list. I look forward to hearing the answer to the probing questions asked by my noble friend Lord Greaves, because we are trying to get at what determines what is, or is not, on the list. I should have thought that understanding how an academy school functions&#151;to take the example already mentioned&#151;and what its democratic arrangements are, however they are defined, is at least as important in those areas that have them as understanding the role of maintained schools, which is probably better known, as maintained schools are not so new as academy schools. Therefore, why not include that requirement?</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000070"></a>I was our party&#146;s education spokesperson during the 1990s and had a long and good association with the Association of Colleges&#151;indeed, I was president of its charitable trust for a while&#151;and I have every sympathy with what it says. I lived through the period of incorporation when colleges moved away from local authorities and I well understand all the sentiments and emotions in that regard. That process ended some years ago, but in the context of the Bill I do not see why colleges should be excluded, given all the others that are included. I understand why the AoC is concerned about that and I am sure that other bodies have similar concerns for similar reasons. The problem with the list is how you make it all-encompassing, whom you include and whom you leave out. From our point of view, the answer is fairly simple: do not have the list in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000071"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09012162000135"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> All I can say is that if we did not have a list in the first place, we would certainly spend a long time discussing why we did not have one and what should be on such a list. However, I take the point raised in all the questions that have been asked. Members of the Committee are right to ask them and I am sorry if I exhibited an unusual burst of bad temper when responding to previous amendments. I shall try to be nicer in this response.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000072"></a>I was asked why there are two lists. That question is worth asking and I hope that noble Lords will understand the answer. The first list, in paragraphs (b) to (i) of Clause 2(2), comprises essentially the universal bodies which exist in respect of every area. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, rightly said that the second list was generated by the first. The second list is produced by Clause 2(2)(a). That makes it clear that bodies in the second list are included only where they exist in respect of the local area. For example, not every area has a parish council, so that applies only to a principal council that has one or more parishes in the area. The lists are related but they need to be included to cover both the universal and the specific instances.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000073"></a>The noble Lord asked me why the lists are as they are. That was a very interesting debate. I do not want to reiterate everything that I said in the previous debate. However, in conjunction with the LGA and the connected authorities, we tried to ensure that we took the 2007 Act and the duty to involve people as our starting point. Indeed, we spent a lot of time debating the list set out in that legislation by considering who would cover the main services that are designed and developed in close partnership with local authorities  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC121"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and those services that would benefit from closer engagement with and wider representation from local people. There was already evidence that democratic arrangements could be expanded by people being more widely represented and thus able to wield more influence. While I shall not go back to the principal debate, this is all about increasing the ability of local people to get involved in and be more broadly represented on bodies, so that they can become more influential in shaping and improving services. We thought hard about the lists.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000074"></a>The noble Lord mentioned Elevate as an example. He is quite right to say that that body has an enormous influence on the future of his area. The arrangements in place in other housing market renewal partnerships are fundamental to what areas will look like in future years. Elevate comes within the notion of partnership and is another example of the complexity of the issue. I hope that noble Lords are not cynical about this because, when we prompt them to do so through guidance, local authorities will be able to include in the range of bodies covered by this duty those that are not specifically set out in the Bill. They will differ around the country because, although we have nine HMR areas, in other parts of the country there are different sorts of partnerships working in different ways. The problem with lists, as the noble Lord, Lord Tope, has said, is that we can become involved in an exercise of &#147;granulation&#148;&#151;or whatever the word is&#151;because local authorities and local circumstances differ. Therefore, we have to be careful in our approach.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000075"></a>All public bodies have been included and, as I have said, we have sought to ensure that they are connected authorities which have links with the democratic arrangements of local authorities that involve local people or their representatives&#151;of course, that covers FE colleges. That is the principle that we are following.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000076"></a>The amendments in this group are mainly prompts for debate, but some suggest removing bodies from the list of connected authorities, while others seek additions. I shall address Amendment 33 first. During the passage of the Bill last year, we had wonderfully thorough debates about the Homes and Communities Agency. It has been included in the list to raise the profile of its work and its significant powers to affect the supply and quality of social housing and thus the feel of local neighbourhoods. We want to ensure that local people know how the agency works and learn about its processes in relation to local authorities. There is joint working through investment programmes and the planning of the provision of housing. Putting this duty on the agency&#151;one that it has itself sought and which local authorities have supported because it is such an important influence on the future shape of a local area&#151;provides the means by which local communities can seek information on the governance, budget and decision-making arrangements of the agency in its work in their area. We expect the HCA to work closely with local communities; indeed, the chief executive, Bob Kerslake, has often spoken about how he wants to relate to local communities and the role that he sees for the agency in that form of conversation. We trust local authorities to take a sensible approach.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000077"></a>I turn now to further education and the important questions raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi. As she said, the governing bodies of these institutions include community representatives. In the main, FE colleges take students from their local areas and the fundamental point once again is that we want these bodies to be as widely representative of their communities as possible. That starts with asking people whether they understand the arrangements for how representatives are selected to serve on these bodies and know what opportunities exist for them to become involved. We hope that we have a definition of democratic arrangements that is restricted to those that involve local people but which is broad enough to cover formal and informal engagement.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000079"></a>When we come to the academy schools, I understand the intention of noble Lord. I am perfectly prepared to respond to as much teasing as possible. These are certainly educational institutions and they have governing bodies. From the very beginning, they were constructed with a different status and constitution. They are independently managed, state-funded schools. Their executive leadership is not with a public body but with a private sponsor. We have had this debate about academies since they were set up; indeed, we have had it in relation to many different pieces of legislation. As such, and in line with that general approach, we are not putting academies in the Bill, because it would be inconsistent to do so. Again, it is up to local authorities. If they want to work with academies and explore their arrangements for representation and the way in which local people might be able to get more involved in governance, they are free to do so.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000080"></a>On the regional development agencies&#151;I am in danger of repeating myself&#151;we have tried to put in bodies that are of direct relevance to local bodies, without having an unwieldy list of regional bodies, because of the burden. Again, if local authorities want to work with the RDAs in this sense, when they have high investment in local regeneration projects, there is absolutely no reason why they should not do so. In fact, when we discuss the duty to involve and the way in which that will be extended to RDAs and other bodies, there is another argument for treating them slightly differently.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000081"></a>Again, we should trust local authorities to involve and include the people whom they think are most relevant in terms of their area and whether they fit the criteria. If more people knew how these authorities worked&#151;how their governance worked&#151;they would want to get involved and one would have more diverse representation and closer connection with what the local community looks and feels like.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000082"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09012162000136"></a>Lord Tope:</b> I want to return to the issue of academy schools, which I have not thought about much before. I am aware that it is being raised simply as an example.  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC123"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>However, if the purpose of the Bill is to promote better understanding among local people, surely it should apply to academy schools&#151;a relatively new and not yet very well understood concept. Why is this not to be explained? The Minister has talked about this and other examples and has said several times that nothing in the Bill prevents a local authority from doing this if it so wishes. The reality is that good local authorities are probably already doing most of what is in the Bill; as I said on Second Reading, most of this legislation is primarily intended for less good local authorities. I am being very polite. It is for those local authorities that are not as good as we would wish. We are perhaps already in a situation where a good local authority with an academy school may be doing these things. Surely the purpose of the Bill is to encourage those less good authorities to be doing them as well. If that is the case, why are academy schools not on the list?</p>

<p><a name="09012162000083"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09012162000137"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I support the noble Lord, Lord Tope, in that. I declare an interest as patron of the Essex academies trust. Some areas of Essex&#151;for example, Witham&#151;are going to have only two secondary schools, which are going to be academies. Therefore, it would be ridiculous for the local authority not to provide information about those academies to parents. Obviously, we are involved in academies. The more we talk about this, the sillier it seems. We perhaps need to rethink it. This should be about services that are provided to the public, because where there are FE colleges or academies, they are not always provided by the local authority. It needs a little rethinking, because there could be total confusion. I support the academies point.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000084"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09012162000138"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> In a way, the noble Lord makes my point for me, because there is nothing to stop local authorities&#151;it would be ridiculous, as he said&#151;in their determination to have as wide a spread of representation in local education as possible. Academies are there as part of the pattern of local education. I can only repeat what I have said. The trouble is that the governance of academies is different; they have a different status and a different legal constitution. They are independently managed and sit outside the local authority arrangements and, therefore, do not fit into this Bill in the same way as other schools. However, we can make it clear in guidance that we would welcome local authorities going beyond the prescription in the Bill. We are trying to arrive at a position where we have not been too prescriptive and where we have left flexibility and discretion with local authorities to go beyond that, if they so wish and if they think that it is right for their area.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000085"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09012162000139"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> The last point was important and I thank the noble Baroness for dealing with it with great care. It is not clear in the Bill that what she says is true. The Bill states that the two lists involve connected authorities and she is right to say that it does not state that everything else is not connected. It is not clear at all that the local authorities have a duty to provide a comprehensive description of what happens and how people can get involved that includes these matters but also might include many other things as well. An amendment that we shall consider later tackles this  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC124"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>matter. I do not wish to pursue this argument at this stage, but I would be interested to hear the noble Baroness&#146;s justification for saying that it is clear to anyone reading the Bill that an overall general description is required, not just of those bodies included in the lists. Some local authorities will do the minimum and we do not want that.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000086"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, wanted to remove FE colleges from the list and I wanted to include academies. In many ways, both are in the same category: they are independent incorporated bodies that are substantially funded by the state and provide local education services as part of the general state system but are not controlled by the local authority. Apart from what the constitution of any particular institution might state, they have no general democratic arrangements. The local authorities and other local bodies are not represented in them. Any local democracy that there might be will refer to staff and students and no one else. In many ways FE colleges and academies are similar, although ideologically they are at different poles. To include one and not the other is not rational.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000087"></a>This comes back to the lists. We are saying that there should be no list, but there should be general descriptions of the duties. The Minister says that, if there were no list, we would be probing what might be included; she is absolutely right, but we might be making suggestions for illustration and understanding, not because we wanted a list. However, once there is a list, there is an issue of prescription. The Minister said that the Government are not being prescriptive, but that is not true; they are being extremely prescriptive. I have not counted how many are on the list, but it goes from (a) to (m)&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09012162000088"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09012162000140"></a>Lord Tope:</b> It is 14.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000089"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09012162000141"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Thank you. It is a long list&#151;there is no doubt about that. Yet some bodies are not included. Therefore, in my proposal on joint boards and joint committees I am trying to put in a description of an organisation that would be included and would fit local circumstances. The Minister is including specific organisations and missing some out. There is a difference of approach and ours is much better.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000090"></a>I did not understand at all what the Minister said about the Homes and Communities Agency, other than that the aim is to raise the profile of what the agency does. That could apply to regional development agencies, regional arts councils or any number of organisations&#151;it could apply to British Waterways. There are a huge number of organisations that are not going to be included, even though they have an important local impact in different ways. The reason for that, going back to what she said previously, is that they do not have arrangements for involvement locally&#151;they are not democratic local organisations and do not deliver local services. The Homes and Communities Agency does not deliver local services but does what English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation did previously: it funds and supports people who do so. There is a real difference. The idea that there are democratic arrangements within the HCA that people might be interested in is slightly extraordinary.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC125"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000091"></a>On the other hand, the Minister might be saying, &#147;Well, the HCA provides all this money to local housing associations and perhaps to local authorities, while its English Partnerships wing will provide money to regeneration projects, town centre projects and all the rest of it&#148;. Of course it does. But money never comes from the Government without some sort of handles on it, and they will therefore have an influence on what happens. They will say, &#147;We will fund this, but we won&#146;t fund that&#148;. The local authority might want to do the second instead of the first, but will do the first because that is what it will get the funding for. That is the real world, and no one is arguing about that. But if you put all that in, you are not producing a map of local organisations that have democratic involvement in how they do things; you are producing a map of the whole structure of government&#151;all the government departments in the north-west, in Yorkshire and Humberside or wherever. They are in exactly the same position as the Homes and Communities Agency. Are we going to include all those? Of course not.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09012162000092"></a>Frankly, I think that the Government are in a muddle. They need to think about this a bit more clearly. Our view is that this is much too prescriptive. The Government ought to look at giving the local authority a general duty to include everything relevant in their area and then have a description of what is relevant. That is a far better approach. We will return to this with a later amendment, but in the mean time I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000093"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09012162000142"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I was trying to rise before the noble Lord sat down, but he is quicker than I am. I want to raise the issue of how prescriptive we can be. I hope that the Minister will look not just at method but at the purpose of the Bill. My understanding has been that the purpose of the Bill is to provide a connection between people, authorities and organisations so that there is more democratic involvement. My concern is that taking away responsibility&#151;for example, colleges&#146; responsibility to promote themselves, or the fact that they may desire governors&#151;and placing it on local authorities actually creates a disconnect and is therefore likely to result in arrangements that are less democratic. This follows a pattern that the Government have adopted: they have tried to make organisations and individuals more responsible by taking responsibility away from them and giving it to those who have no control or authority.</p>

<p><a name="09012162000094"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09012162000143"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify this point if the noble Baroness is struggling with it. These duties will enable the local authority to provide a single point of reference for the range of governance organisations that cover the key services that are crucial to people&#146;s well-being. We know that many of those bodies have very good arrangements for informing their local constituencies and wider constituencies about their democratic arrangements and what they do. Nothing is going to take away that responsibility; in fact, we would like them to do more of it. This is just an additional, simple, accessible, single conversation for people to have in relation to that wide spectrum of services.</p>

I know a lot of them well&#151;again, I declare an interest, because for a long while I was the chairman of the Further Education Funding Council for the eastern region. Names change, so a prescriptive list is an issue. A few years ago, you had the Further Education Funding Council. What happens to the Bill when all the names have changed and a primary care trust, for example, becomes something else? However, that is not the point that I wanted to make. I back up my noble friend in that I know FE colleges very well. Some of them promote themselves very well and some of them do not. We want more governors of FE colleges; it is not for some local authority to have some representation. We are taking away from FE colleges some obligation to promote themselves. The Minister did not really answer that point, because there is a lot of variation. I wish that all FE colleges promoted themselves as well as some do.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000002"></a>The amendments relate to what could be called over-the-boundary problems. One of the difficulties of the legislation is that it assumes that people who receive services from local authorities or become involved with local authorities do so with the local authority, the health authority or other public authority in the  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC127"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>area in which they live&#151;in other words, with public authorities that are organised strictly geographically. Clearly that is not the case.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000003"></a>Amendment 34 says that the inclusion in the list of a school should not necessarily be to do with where the school is located. A school in which a significant number of students are educated may be over the boundary in someone else&#146;s authority. Nevertheless, the authority in which the students live should include it in their information about how people can become involved in the governing bodies of schools. This is common sense, but at the moment the Bill does not say that. The same thing is probably even more true of FE colleges, because they have bigger catchment areas, so Amendment 37 applies to FE colleges.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000004"></a>Amendments 38 and 39 apply the same principle to hospital services and other health services for people who go to a hospital that is over the border&#151;it is out of their PCT area and the health trust area and is in someone else&#146;s area. I am sure that we can all think of dozens, perhaps thousands, of examples. I put on record two or three, particularly in the Aire valley, which has a boundary between Bradford Metropolitan District Council and North Yorkshire County Council and is quite near the Lancashire boundary and the district council in North Yorkshire&#151;Craven District Council.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000005"></a>There is a school there called South Craven School. It is a very successful big comprehensive school, the sort of school that the Government should be praising as a model of good secondary education. It is in North Yorkshire. When it was built, it was in the West Riding of Yorkshire, which included the whole of the Aire valley right up from Shipley and Keighley to Skipton.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000006"></a>When local government reorganisation took place in 1973-74, Keighley and some of the surrounding villages were&#151;wrongly, in my view&#151;included in, or hijacked into, the city of Bradford. As a native Bradfordian, I must say that they are not in Bradford; that has caused lots of problems, which I shall not discuss here. The particular cross-boundary issue is that South Craven School, which was built for all those old textile villages that are now largely commuter villages for Bradford and Leeds, is in North Yorkshire. Now, about two-thirds of its pupils come from villages that are still in North Yorkshire, such as Cross Hills and Glusburn, where the school is, and about one-third of the pupils come from villages such as Steeton, Sutton and Silsden, which are now in Bradford. People who live in those areas and who have children at that school ought to be told how they can get involved in that school, even though it is in North Yorkshire and the council drawing up the information will be the City of Bradford.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000007"></a>There is another school&#151;I cannot remember its name&#151;in Bradford that serves a similar old textile, now commuter, village on the edge of Bradford called Oakenshaw. The school built for Oakenshaw is now over the border&#151;I suppose that it is in Cleckheaton, technically&#151;in the Kirklees Council area and I am informed that the vast majority of its pupils live in Bradford.</p>

<p><a name="09012179000008"></a>Let us think about big cities, such as Manchester. In the urban area of Manchester, which everyone who does not actually live in Manchester thinks is Manchester but which covers the cities of Manchester, Salford, Trafford and part of Tameside, there must be lots of cross-border movement to schools. London is a different matter altogether. No one in London chooses their school according to which borough runs it.</p>

Those are essentially the two factors that cause people to choose a school. There is a huge amount of cross-borough movement in London; we all know about that. That principle ought to be written into the Bill.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000011"></a>On the health service, I very briefly mention the example of Airedale hospital, which is actually in Keighley in Bradford, but which serves the whole of the Aire valley, which is in North Yorkshire, and quite a chunk of Lancashire, including the eastern fringe of Lancashire. I must be careful abut what I say; I am talking about the eastern fringe of those areas now administered by Lancashire, such as Barnoldswick and Earby, where a lot of people still think that they are Yorkshire born and bred and live in Yorkshire but, nevertheless, are in the east Lancashire health authority system and are covered by the health trusts of east Lancashire.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000012"></a>So there is a cross-border issue. That has been recognised. Airedale hospital, in its submission for foundation status, came to talk to people in Lancashire, in the Colne and Barnoldswick areas. The hospital said: &#147;Look, we know that you are an important part of our catchment area and, when we set up the foundation trust, we will want representation from your part of Lancashire on our foundation trust, even though you are across the border&#148;. Those issues are important and should be written into the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is in his place; I know that he will understand what I am going to say. My local government experience was fairly prescribed by the boundaries of the London boroughs of Enfield, Barnet and Haringey, which moved over that period. The illustration that I want to give is from Loughton, where there is a successful and popular college on which a lot of money has been spent so that it can expand. Whenever I go along the road past the college, I cannot get across the crossroads for pupils who are coming into the school by Underground into Loughton. They must come from a wide range of places. The college does a good job.</p>

<p><a name="09012179000014"></a>I do not know whether or not the Minister is able to say or do something in the Bill. I hesitate to think that responsible people in charge of education are so hidebound that they cannot use common sense. As I see it, the Government&#146;s intention here is to augment or add to the efforts that other people are making.

<p><a name="09012179000015"></a>The point that the noble Lord has raised may be answered by the wording in the Bill; the Minister may well be minded to accept the sense of the amendment, one way or another. We should not have a situation where demarcation is so precise that people are denied the best possible opportunities. I know from my experience as a councillor&#151;that was many years ago, but I am still in touch with the fine Latymer School in Edmonton, which has a good record&#151;that when it comes to the question of secondary education, most parents these days, in contrast to when I was a boy, take a great deal of interest in the quality of the school, its academic record and so on.</p>

<p><a name="09012179000016"></a>I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say and to seeing whether it is possible to take account of the sense of what has been said.

I hope that this debate over territory has nothing to do with the fact that he, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and I are all Yorkshire folk.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000019"></a>This group of amendments reinforces points that have already been made. The noble Lord has sought to widen the scope of the connection that local authorities have with those institutions that in reality are used by people who may not live in that same local authority area. Schools and authorities are used in the main by those who live closest to them. Such catchment areas range across local authority areas; we have heard examples of that. This crossover inevitably means that, if local authorities stick rigidly to the prescriptions in the Bill, large numbers of people could miss out on the information that the local authority is expected to promulgate simply because their children are educated in a different area, or they are treated at their nearest hospital but that hospital is in a different local authority area.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000020"></a>The noble Lord is right to raise this issue. Where does the duty start and where does it end? Where should the line be drawn? The Government have tried to draw the line, but the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has pointed out some of the loopholes, and I am sure that there will be many others.</p>

<p><a name="09012179000021"></a>However, I am concerned that the amendments could create unnecessary overlaps. How exactly will local authorities determine, where individuals reside outside their areas but use their facilities, what would merit the promotion of understanding functions and arrangements? What are the practical implications of them having to do so? Would the noble Lord&#146;s suggestion mean that two local authorities could end up promoting information about the same institution, or would they co-ordinate their approach?</p>

<a name="90121-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000022"></a>I do not wish to be too negative, but I am concerned about the practicalities of both the original proposals set out in the Bill and the provisions of the amendments. I hope that I have highlighted some of the difficulties, but I fear that they may well prove hard to resolve while the basic aim of the Bill is to put a duty on principal local authorities to promote understanding of the arrangements of bodies that they do not fully control.</p>

The problem is well illustrated by London&#151;I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Graham, will agree with me. It is still the case that most schools in London were built during the time of the Inner London Education Authority and the former county councils, which before 1965 were the LEAs. In my own borough, one of our two girls&#146; grammar schools, which we still have and which since 1965 have been part of the LEA and Sutton educational life in its different forms, is physically located in Surrey, 100 yards outside the borough boundary. We can all cite examples like that. However, the school is and always has been one of the two principal girls&#146; grammar schools in the area, and one that many parents strive to get their daughters into.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000024"></a>Any good authority would continue to promote understanding of such a school but, as I keep saying, this legislation is not for the good authorities; it is for the less good ones. I hope that this will never happen, but there may come a time when an authority declares, in accordance with the letter of the law as set out in what will by then be the Act, that it does not have to promote understanding as regards a school because that school is not located in its area. That is not likely to happen in my authority for many reasons, but there is a lot of concern in some London boroughs about the number of children who travel to other boroughs because of the perception, real or otherwise, of the schools in one borough as compared with those in another. A situation could well arise where one council, for its own reasons, does not want to promote a school in another borough that is attended by many of its pupils because it wants those pupils to attend its own schools. This is not just an academic point. If a local authority wants to comply with the letter of the law as distinct from its spirit, it will be able to do so under the current wording of the Bill. That is the issue that we are trying to grasp.</p>

<p><a name="09012179000026"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09012179000057"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> I am from Yorkshire so I will be fine. This has been a helpful debate in which important points have been raised. I take on board the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Tope: this is not an academic argument, but a real issue. I take the point sincerely. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has addressed the important issue of geographical boundaries in relation to the duties that we are placing on local authorities. I will not go into detail about the position in Yorkshire because of conflicts of interest. I live in Bradford, I worked in Keighley as a social worker and last year I opened a very good new mental health ward in Airedale hospital. I drive regularly through all the villages and towns that the noble Lord talked about, so I understand where he is coming from.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000027"></a>These amendments would require local authorities to provide information on the functions and governance arrangements of schools, FE colleges or health services which are not within the local authority area&#146;s boundaries but which are used by the council&#146;s residents. I will recap on what we are trying to do. In Clause 2, we seek to place a duty on local authorities to promote the functions and democratic arrangements of the public bodies&#151;that is, the connected authorities&#151;that are responsible for the provision of public services in the area. It is important to remind ourselves that this duty is about promoting understanding of the democratic arrangements for public bodies set up to be influenced by citizens either directly or indirectly or run by lay citizen representatives. It is not designed to cover all conceivable information about public services in general. In practice, democratic arrangements have boundaries. Although citizens may on occasion use the services of a neighbouring council, they cannot vote in the elections for that neighbouring council.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000028"></a>As the noble Lord clearly stated, a number of core services are provided from outside any given local authority area. This is true for schools and certainly for FE colleges, and it is also increasingly true for health services. But we do not believe that this is a reasonable or practical requirement to place on local authorities. I will begin by setting out what we intend to include and I will then address each amendment.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000029"></a>As my noble friend the Minister outlined earlier, we are clearly aware of, and do not take lightly, the burdens on local authorities when they have new duties placed on them. We place such duties on them only where we truly believe that it is necessary and, in this case, we believe that it is. If we are to embed promotion of democracy deep into the culture of local authorities, we want to ensure that local people are being made fully aware of how they can get involved in shaping local services.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000030"></a>Inevitably, there is a fine balance to be made in addressing the needs of the community and minimising the burden on local authorities. In doing this, we are also very mindful that we do not want to increase duplication of information where that is not necessary. We are asking all local authorities to promote democratic understanding in this way. We do not only mean providing information by way of newsletters or leaflets and on websites, although that is crucial. We want local authorities to embed the promotion of democracy within their work. We want local authorities to work with schools,  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC132"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>colleges and different communities in their areas to raise awareness and understanding of how they shape services. That may be through inviting schoolchildren to the town hall, shadowing schemes or working with people from a particularly underrepresented community to help to develop their skills and confidence to get involved in civic life. We are providing new money to cover this duty but this is based on working with local people.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000031"></a>The amendments would increase the responsibility on local authorities and duplicate information. Should we require Manchester to promote the democratic arrangements and health service in Salford, Bury, Trafford, Rochdale, Bolton and so on? The noble Lord provided the example of Airedale hospital. The increased responsibility would be a significant burden on local authorities.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000032"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tope, talked about the situation in London. In London, over one-fifth of children travel out of their home borough to attend school. When would a London borough stop in providing information on secondary schools? This is by no means unique to London, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said when he talked about the excellent South Craven secondary school. It would mean that many authorities would have to identify and promote the democratic arrangements of services that are located outside their area, even though the services would also be promoted where they are located as part of the duty.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000033"></a>Of course, people with an interest in these services, whether in or out of the authority in which they live, are entitled to information about their functions and democratic arrangements. This information would be available in the school, college or hospital itself. When you are in a foundation trust, you are actively going out of the borough to increase your membership and the membership of the governance board. Information would also be available from the council where the service is located. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will appreciate that defining &#147;significant&#148; is not straightforward.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000034"></a>To go back to our definition of local people, councils will be expected to promote this duty to people who study in their area anyway. We expect local authorities to take a sensible approach and to consider how imaginatively to promote democratic understanding, as we have set out in their duties, in a way that is relevant to their local communities. I take on board what the noble Lord said about the sense of what is meant here; that is crucial.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000035"></a>We will of course work with the LGA to ensure that we cover those issues and points in guidance. The debate today will help to develop that guidance, but the amendment would add nothing to the Bill.</p>

The amendment would add a great deal to the Bill. It would totally change the Bill. The Bill refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="09012179000045"></a>&#147;the managing or governing body of a maintained school in the principal local authority&#146;s area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012179000043"></a>That is pretty prescriptive. I am trying to turn it round to say: do not define it according to the bureaucratic boundaries and bureaucratic systems, which people  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC133"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may or may not understand; define it according to what people elect. Go to the people first to say, &#147;Which schools do you send your children to?&#148;, or go to the children and the students at the FE college to say, &#147;Which schools do you go to?&#148;. Ask people, &#147;Which hospital do you use?&#148;. If the legislation is really about empowering citizens&#151;to use some government language&#151;start from the basis of the citizens, not from the basis of the bureaucratic structures.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000037"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and the Minister both asked how councils would determine which things to include and how to define &#147;significant&#148;. I would not define &#147;significant&#148;. We do not have to define &#147;sustainable development&#148; whenever it appears in Bills; we are not allowed to. Let us not define it. Let us leave it to the common sense of the councils concerned. That is what the Government will not do. They will not let go. They will not say, &#147;Here, around the country, is a series of councils. If we treat them as sensible, intelligent people with common sense and trust them to do sensible things, by and large that is what they will do. If we try to tie them up in detailed prescriptive rules and regulations, they will behave less sensibly, because that is what people do&#148;.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000038"></a>The Minister referred to the ward that he opened at Airedale hospital. Sometimes I think that the debates that we have here are driving me mad. I hope that I will not have to take advantage of the excellent facilities that he was responsible for introducing. I do not know.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000039"></a>If anyone goes to Barnoldswick and tries to issue a document telling people how to get involved in the health service but it is all about Burnley and Blackburn and does not mention Airedale, there will be a riot on the streets of that town. So Lancashire County Council and Pendle Borough Council, when producing such documentation, will say that it is common sense that they must include Airedale because they are local people and they know where people go. They do not have to spend money doing opinion surveys on where people go. We all know. That is what the Government do not seem to understand: people on the ground know these things and will do sensible and common-sense things.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09012179000040"></a>Finally, given the way in which the Bill is written&#151;that the hospital has to be in the district&#151;some districts probably do not have a hospital any more, so they would be missed out altogether. Is that what the Government want? The Minister said that information will be available at the school, the hospital, the college and so on. I begin to think that that undermines the whole basis of this part of the Bill. I am not satisfied with the answer.</p>

<p><a name="09012179000041"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09012179000059"></a>Baroness Maddock:</b> Will the Government think about what happens when you are near the border, particularly with health authorities? My noble friend was talking about hospitals. If you live in Berwick-upon-Tweed, you might go to Edinburgh, Newcastle or the Borders General. In rural areas such as ours, border country, these things are very complicated. We are again looking at generalities rather than being too specific.</p>

These take us to the second list, which the Minister told us was the list of organisations, such as parish councils and national park authorities, which do not exist everywhere but exist only in some places. However, I see in the list,</p>
<ul><a name="09012193000161"></a>&#147;a police authority ... a chief officer of police ... a strategic health authority ... a Primary Care Trust&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09012193000147"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="09012193000162"></a>&#147;a local probation board or a probation trust&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012193000148"></a>That drives a coach and horses through the previous explanation, although that is not a major or substantive point, is it?</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000002"></a>Amendment 43 would add to the list &#147;a parish meeting&#148;. I have to say that I have not added this in the place that I had intended to, which was a line higher. I was probably drafting the amendment too late at night when I was in bed. Parish meetings were the first things that came to my mind when I thought of the previous amendment to change &#147;persons&#148; into &#147;bodies&#148;, because parish meetings are not persons. I may be wrong; it may be that the chairman of a parish meeting is a person and he can exercise at least some minimal functions on behalf of the parish meeting. Nevertheless, whatever the rights and wrongs of that, I am very clear that parish meetings should be included in the list. Parishes exist in many places and most parishes have a parish council, which, I was going to say, is like any other local authority, although many parishes are unlike other local authorities. None the less, they are still functioning, democratic local authorities. Parish meetings take place in parishes that are usually too small to have a functioning parish council. A parish meeting takes place once a year or whenever it is called according to the rules for calling such meetings. We set a limit in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act on the size of new parishes necessary for there to be a parish council. I think that the limit is 100, but I am not sure.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000003"></a>Some parishes have direct democracy in the form of an annual parish meeting and other special meetings, if required. Why should such meetings not be included in the description of the local system of democratic involvement? That is my first point, which is straightforward, and I hope that the Government will simply accept the amendment and put it in the right place.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000004"></a>Secondly, joint waste authorities set up under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act are included in the list. Amendment 44 is, for the moment, a probing amendment to find out what such authorities&#146; democratic features are. Given that the Minister is going to write to us to explain all these things, I will not pursue that further today. The same goes for waste disposal authorities under the Local Government Act 1985. They will come and we will be told what the democratic features are that require them to be in the list. That will be interesting.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000005"></a>Amendment 46 is a much more substantive amendment, which basically says that housing associations and ALMOs&#151;arm&#146;s-length management organisations for council housing stock&#151;should be included in the list. It may be that an ALMO is sufficiently close to a local authority for the Government to say that it will be included anyway, but given that they are deliberately at arm&#146;s length, that is not entirely clear to me. They are certainly unlike bodies that deal with council housing stock that has not been pushed out to arm&#146;s length.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000006"></a>The main local housing associations nowadays are often in places where large-scale stock transfers have taken place&#151;where the council has, in whole or part, divested itself of its council housing and transferred it to a housing association. Big authorities have in some cases done that in one area and not another, or perhaps they have two or three of these bodies. Housing associations are very much part of the provision of public services in an area. They get most of their money&#151;not necessarily all, as they can raise money in the markets&#151;from the Housing Corporation, or the Homes and Communities Agency. They are subject to a considerable degree of supervision and control through the provisions in the recent Housing and Regeneration Act.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000007"></a>These are quasi-public bodies, but there is no doubt that they are public bodies of some sort or other. Particularly where they perform the function of a local housing authority, in providing what used to be council housing and what is now public or social housing in an area, they are a public body, so it is not clear why they should not be in the list. They are certainly as much a public body as other bodies listed and in many cases they have very clear means of involving members of the public. Usually, those people are tenants, but there are sometimes residents on the estates who are not tenants. It is not clear to me why these should not be on the list. I should like to hear the Minister&#146;s justification for that.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000008"></a>While we are looking at this list, it may be worth asking the Minister why she thinks that the chief officer of police is a person with democratic involvement and functions. Perhaps in a sense this is anticipating discussions on later parts of the Bill, but it is interesting to ask why the Government think that the economic  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC136"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prosperity boards&#151;EPBs&#151;will have democratic functions, since they all seem to be fairly undemocratic bodies. I do not understand why combined authorities have to be in here on the basis of the provisions later in the Bill, because the combined authority presumably will be a local authority and will be covered anyway. Why does it need to be included separately? That is particularly confusing given that the Government are saying that joint committees and joint boards of all kinds of things on a voluntary basis do not have to be in, because they will be covered by the fact that they consist of local authorities. I do not at all understand why combined authorities are here.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000009"></a>We kept discovering these things after we tabled the amendments. As far as the PCT is concerned, there is a series of bodies&#151;the new LINk organisations&#151;which surely ought to be in here. Those organisations are being set up to replace the patients&#146; forums, which had a short period of life after the abolition of community health councils. Why are the LINk organisations not mentioned here, when they are specifically set up to involve members of the public in the local health services?</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000010"></a>Finally, on social services, there is a series of children&#146;s partnerships and similar things within social services. Why are they not here? A lot of places now have new Sure Start centres or children&#146;s facilities under the banner of Sure Start, which all have some kind of quasi-democratic local committee responsible for running them. Why are they not here?</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000011"></a>The problem with these prescriptive lists is that, the more you think about things in different areas, the more you think should be in the lists and the more you question why the ones that are in them are in them. If only the Government would trust local authorities to take a common-sense approach to it all within a general framework, we would do far better than by producing these lists. Since we have them, however, we are probing them. I beg to move.</p>

If there has to be a list, it must not exclude obvious bodies. The parish meeting is an obvious body, because small communities are often not big enough to have a parish council, so the parish meeting is their democratic body. It is rather an insult to small communities to exclude the parish meeting. It is the only thing that they have, and they use it very democratically. If there is a big issue for the village or community, it is dealt with democratically at the parish meeting. I particularly concentrate on this, because, as I said, it is an insult to exclude it.</p>

I was a chairman of a parish council in Warwickshire&#151;we were just about big enough to have a council, as distinct from a mere parish meeting&#151;and it did some quite useful work. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would no doubt prefer Amendment 43 to follow list A rather than list B, but I thought that a parish meeting was excluded&#151;I may be wrong; I am sure the Minister will respond if I am&#151;because it has no separate

It is not democratically elected. It is not direct democracy&#151;the phrase that the noble Lord used&#151;because it has no separate existence. That is probably why it is not there.</p>

We have had a discussion about the difficulties surrounding that. People need to understand fairly carefully how social housing is provided in their area, which body they go to if they want to be on the list, where the money comes from, how they can become involved if they think it is important to have more social housing in the area, and who is responsible for other housing issues.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000015"></a>In my area, there is the issue of second homes. As the Minister knows, Northumberland has been reorganised, and the arrangements for housing will be completely different from the previous arrangements when we had a district council and a county council. This is quite important. If we are going to be prescriptive and have a list, I am not quite sure why it does not have something about housing in it, although I recognise that this is quite difficult. The local authorities still deal with lists and homelessness, but social housing is also important, and there is quite a connection between the two, so I hope that the Minister will take that on board.</p>

That will make a nice change. Parish meetings are very important. In fact, it was our intention that parish councils, as identified in the Bill, would cover them. However, the noble Lord makes an important point. I will take it away and think about how we can accommodate it, so I hope that that will help.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000017"></a>As regards the other issues he raises, for example in relation to joint waste authorities&#151;when I write to noble Lords I shall certainly give as full an explanation as possible about the democratic arrangements as we see them&#151;he has already argued that joint boards and joint committees should be included. I know that this is a probing amendment. We are agreed that this area is of great interest to people. I know from personal experience that nothing is more likely to exercise a local community than a decision on where to place landfill or incinerators. However, joint waste authorities are bodies on which local councillors sit. We believe it is very important that people are made aware of this and of how decisions about waste are made. People should be aware of the waste hierarchy and who they can talk to if they have concerns and issues. We think that these democratic arrangements are relevant. That is why they are included in the list. People need a greater understanding of this issue, because waste is one of those things that is divided up in terms of function in the two-tier authorities and there is a lot of confusion as regards collection and disposal. Therefore, there is a good case for including that.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000018"></a>Complicated issues arise as regards social housing. I take the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, made. We tried to address that in part by including the HCA in the list. Although it is not often a direct provider, it directly funds certain projects and developments. Therefore, there is a strong relationship with local authorities. Amendment 46 seeks to add ALMOs and other providers of social housing under the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. By the latter group, I believe he means &#147;registered providers&#148;. This is the term in the 2008 Act which refers to bodies registered with the regulator of social housing&#151;whose trading name is the Tenant Services Authority&#151;and includes all current registered social landlords; that is, housing associations under another name.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000019"></a>We had very long debates during the passage of the 2008 Act and previous Acts on why it is not appropriate to treat housing associations as public bodies. Housing associations are non-profit, private bodies, often charitable, with a long history of independence. They are very anxious to keep that status and we are very anxious to ensure that they do. They are not connected with local authorities in any formal way and are not normally their agents or contractors. I invite the noble Lord to revisit the debates that we had on the Homes and Communities Agency during the passage of the Housing and Regeneration Bill, in which I went to great lengths to explain that principle. Indeed, noble Lords agreed with that principle on which that Bill was based. That is where we still stand. These bodies must retain their private status.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000020"></a>Having said that, because they are not public bodies, housing associations are not required to have democratic arrangements. However, during the passage of that Act, we also debated how housing associations could strengthen those arrangements to the benefit of their tenants. That was partly why we introduced the new regulatory functions. We are very clear that housing associations must have a responsive and responsible attitude to tenants, and involve them in the management of services. That Act was very much about promoting and supporting that. That was not the first time that we debated the status of those bodies. During the passage of the Local Government Act 2000, when we developed the duty to involve tenants, we had exactly the same debate on the same grounds about the importance of protecting the existing status of housing associations and the difficulty of including those non-statutory bodies in legislation.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000021"></a>ALMOs comprise a different configuration. They are wholly owned, monitored and controlled by local authorities. They manage and improve the local authority&#146;s housing stock but they are housing managers only. The local authorities retain their landlord status. ALMOs are required to have local authority members sit on their management board. They have a very close relationship with local authorities, but are not part of the local authority. They are separate entities. Local information should be provided about how many councillors sit on the management board, how it is managed and the relationship between the local authority and the ALMO. Bearing in mind stock transfers, that is very important.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000022"></a>Members of the Committee raised other questions about the chief officer of police, and so on, and the

In the interests of making progress, perhaps they will allow me to answer those questions in writing; that may be more satisfactory all round.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000023"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09012193000181"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I again raise an issue of principle&#151;it may well be that it is my understanding that is not clear. The noble Baroness appeared to suggest that the reason why housing associations were not included was because of recognition of their independence, whereas earlier, when I was trying to point out the independence of FE colleges, she made exactly the reverse argument.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000024"></a>Going back to the purpose of the Bill, my understanding is that it is to connect the people with local democracy, local decision-making and an understanding of how things work. One of the most talked about subjects in many local associations, organisations and pubs is housing: who gets what, when and why. When local housing associations sometimes determine who gets what, when and why, it is important that local people are aware of the democratic arrangements, if any, of those organisations, despite their independence. I therefore argue that the Minister, in talking about the independence of housing associations, defeats the purpose of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000025"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09012193000182"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> There is a very clear distinction between housing associations, which are private bodies, and FE colleges, which are public bodies. When the local authority explains its governance arrangements to enable people to understand them, it is at liberty to explain its responsibility for housing and how housing is funded. Most social housing funding comes through those in communities agencies. Local authorities bid for funds, and they determine where those funds will be spent; whether they are for housing the vulnerable, normal housing stock, family homes, or whatever. They can explain all that as part of their responsibilities and they can explain their governance arrangements. There is nothing to stop them doing that.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000026"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09012193000183"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> The interesting issue that has come out of this, where there is a sticking point, is the question of housing associations. We will probably have to come back to this. Again, I start with the people out there rather than the structures and institutions. If you ask people who live in an area where the big associations run what people still think of or still call council estates: &#147;Are those housing associations private bodies or public bodies?&#148;, they will say that they are public bodies. Many people do not distinguish between the housing association and the council.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000027"></a>I accept exactly what the Minister said about the legal status, but we are not talking about legal status here. They may be private bodies, but I described them as being quasi-public bodies. The reason I did that is precisely for the reason that the Minister said: most of their funding comes through the Homes and Communities Agency. The local authority still has the strategic housing responsibility for negotiating and discussing with the funding agencies, especially the HCA. The local authority has responsibility for discussing with the HCA the strategic needs of its area. The HCA will certainly negotiate directly with housing associations,

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000028"></a>In many cases where there have been stock transfers, there are close financial relationships between the transferred housing association and the local authority involving millions of pounds that go in both directions. In many cases where there has been a transfer from the local authority, a significant number of the members of the housing association board are appointed by the council. It is not true to suggest that housing associations are completely private and have nothing to do with and are not connected with local authorities. In terms of their functions, there is no doubt that housing associations are quasi-public bodies.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000029"></a>The Minister referred to traditional, small, charity-based housing associations, which I accept are quite different. However, to be included in the Minister&#146;s description of local governance and the local organisations, it is not a requirement, despite the fact she said that it was, to have democratic arrangements. Many of them do not have democratic arrangements, but they have to be included as part of the description of who does what and what happens, because if you do not include them, it does not make sense to people. They look at this and say, &#147;You have missed out all of the council estates&#148;, &#147;You have missed out this part of the health service&#148;, or whatever. The description of people providing services, even if they are not democratic or open to democratic processes and influences, is an important part of describing how local services are provided. If you do not do that, you are not providing a comprehensive document&#151;which was a point that we made on Monday.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000030"></a>We have to come back to the question of housing associations, particularly the big ones and where there have been stock transfers. I ask the Government to think carefully about how it might be possible to include them in a sensible way, if we decide that that is what we want the Bill to do.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000031"></a>My final point is to read out another list. The names of bodies that I am about to read are not all partnerships, but it is clear to me that if this plan is to work properly and not be too onerous a burden on local authorities, there will have to be a hierarchy of information. If this simply applies at a local, unitary or even a district council level, you will miss out a huge amount of the information that people who want to get involved ought to have in a community or a small town.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000032"></a>I have made a small list from the small town in which I live, Colne in Lancashire. I thought about this on Monday when my noble friend obtained information on more than 100 bodies in Calderdale. A noble Lord opposite said, &#147;We do not want all these local organisations&#148;. I thought, &#147;Of course you don&#146;t&#148;. If you live in Halifax, you do not want to know about what happens regarding the trusts and partnerships in Todmorden. If you live there, you do not want to know about what happens at the other end of the borough in, say, Sowerby Bridge. However, you need to know what happens in your patch. If the local authority in its offices, town hall or libraries has a sensible set of information, they will not be in the Government&#146;s lists.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000033"></a>I looked at the list in Colne. There is Colne in Bloom, which is a voluntary group that does very well. The community safety panel is the local panel from Pendle&#146;s crime and disorder partnership. Underneath that, there are monthly PACT meetings &#151;Police and Communities Together&#151;which take place in each ward, at which people turn up to talk about crime and disorder and antisocial behaviour. They are well attended.</p>

The noble Lord should go to his local PACT; I am sure that he has them in Essex. We have a neighbourhood management organisation, which meets every two months; it is called a NAG&#151;a neighbourhood action group, to which sometimes 30, 40 or 50 people turn up&#151;and which keeps the more deprived parts of the area in a decent condition.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000036"></a>We have a new town council that holds loads of meetings for the public. We have a town centre regeneration forum. We have an organisation called Colne Connected, a market town partnership with five or six different subgroups on all kinds of things, such as schools, parks and employment. We have Sure Start, which has its own committee. We have the Lancashire local committee, which I talked about yesterday. We have a market panel that looks after the council-owned market hall. The two local parks have friends groups, which are full of active people. We have two other nature reserves, which also have friends groups. And we have the customer panel, the tenants&#146; representational organisation within what is now Housing Pendle, the housing association from the large-scale voluntary transfer.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000037"></a>Those are just the ones I thought of while I was writing them down; there are probably lots of others I have forgotten about. There is nothing special about this; Pendle is a normal town with lots of thriving local organisations&#151;and many other organisations that are not thriving but do their best to keep going. This is the level at which people will get involved.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000038"></a>It is all very well talking about the primary care trust, the strategic health authority and the Homes and Communities Agency, but if you really want to get people involved it is these organisations that you have to promote. They are the first layer on the ladder. People come and get interested in what is happening in their area, and then some of them move on to these other organisations, but it takes time. I put Pendle forward as an example, but almost any town you look at in the north of England could provide a similar list of local organisations. Unless what the Government are doing includes all those, the thing will not work.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000039"></a>That was a bit of a diversion, but I thought that it was something the Committee ought to know about. Pendle is a nice town, and a lot of people get involved. Let us get more of them. I am supposed to be begging leave to withdraw Amendment 47.</p>

The Minister has promised that she will look at them and see whether she can come back with something that makes sense and that will appease at least some of our concerns. The amendment would include in the list a local strategic partnership and a crime and disorder reduction partnership established under the Crime and Disorder Act. We thrashed those out previously, so I will not pursue them further at this stage. Amendments 48 and 57 attempt to define a partnership, and are worth looking at briefly. Amendment 57 would define a local strategic partnership as,</p>
<ul><a name="09012193000163"></a>&#147;a non-statutory, multi-agency partnership which cover the areas of a principal local authority which is a member of that partnership&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012193000149"></a>Local strategic partnerships have become such important bodies that the Government have to grasp the nettle and start including them in legislation. If they do that, they will have to find a definition for them. Here I offer a first approximation of what might be a reasonable definition of an LSP.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000044"></a>As my noble friends said earlier, we all know that LSPs form an important part of the local political and governance landscape. For the Government to continue to pretend that they are just voluntary organisations set up at the local level, that people can have them or not and that they do not have to be considered in legislation, is no longer remotely tenable. One of the consequences of not including them is that some of the regulation they ought to be subject to cannot be put on a statutory footing. A further infuriating issue is that the rules and regulations covering declarations of interest that councillors have to make under the strict standards regime in place for elected councillors does not exist in relation to members of LSPs&#151;unless, of course, a member also happens to be a councillor. Councillors on LSPs are subject to quite different rules than everybody else, and that cannot be right. This is just one example of the consequences arising from the fact that LSPs are not defined in legislation in a satisfactory way.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000050"></a>Amendment 51 is an attempt to redress the top-down nature of the Government&#146;s scheme. Provisions in this part allow the Government to change the lists of connected authorities by removing them, adding them or doing what they like with them. For some of the reasons that I gave in our debate on the last but one group of amendments, a great deal of the decisions about which authorities should be connected authorities for the purpose of drawing up these schemes of public

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000051"></a>The amendment therefore says that the council can amend the local list of connected authorities, and it sets out three criteria that the council should use in deciding which organisations or persons should be on the list. In a sense, I offer these criteria to the Government as a way of simplifying this whole thing. We would be a lot happier if all we had was half a page that described a general duty and described in general terms what the outcome had to be and the kind of organisations that should be involved. We would not have all these detailed discussions and arguments, because fundamentally we agree&#151;certainly the Liberal Democrats agree&#151;that producing a description of local governance and how people become involved is a good thing.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000052"></a>The criteria that I have set out are that the organisations on the list should be organisations that are established in the area, that provide services or facilities to people who live in the area, or that provide services or facilities significantly through public funds and therefore not necessarily through their or another local authority. Those may or may not be the right criteria, but they are quite sensible.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000053"></a>Amendment 58 is a by-product of this and says simply that projects that are funded by the National Lottery should be included in this scheme. In every area now, a lot of projects get their funds from the National Lottery, and although the funding and governance of them may be open and transparent to the people involved in them and in the National Lottery, they may not be to the rest of us because they are not done publicly or transparently and there is little way in which local people can hold anyone to account for the way in which the money is spent. There is a real problem here, which Amendment 58 simply highlights.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000054"></a>The main purpose of Amendment 58 is therefore to transfer powers to local authorities from central government. That is what the Government keep telling us they want to do, but whenever we ask them why they do not do it, they say that they cannot because they cannot trust the local authorities. I invite them to trust them on this occasion. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000056"></a>The trouble with the amendment is that the worthwhile desire of the Government to ensure that the best of what goes on goes on throughout all local authorities as far as possible is damaged by the amendment.

<p><a name="09012193000150"></a>as it pleases. That could mean that up and down the country there could be a diversity of approaches to the obligations placed on local authorities by the early clauses, especially Clause 2.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000057"></a>You could have local authorities next door to one another, one of which followed all the best requirements and the best practice&#151;which I know that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, desires&#151;and another could restrict it. Of course, it gives local authorities greater opportunity to do what they want rather than what central government want, but the whole purpose of central government intervening here at all&#151;which I know the noble Lord is not very keen on&#151;is to ensure that best practice covers the whole of the country, not just part of it.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000059"></a>We recognise that the list may not be comprehensive for all time, but to keep it to those that we know for certain would be relevant for the duty, the Bill allows for additions to the list to be made by the Secretary of State where a clear case has been made for such an addition.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000060"></a>It is important to remind ourselves that this duty is about promoting understanding of the democratic arrangements for public bodies set up either to be influenced by citizens, directly or indirectly, or run by lay citizen representatives. It is not designed to cover all conceivable information about public services in general.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000061"></a>Before we look at Amendment 51, we should note that this has important links with Amendment 65, which we will debate later in another group. By giving principal authorities the power to add to the list in Clauses 2 and 3 for their respective areas, it could allow principal authorities to impose a duty and significant new burdens on any organisation that they select to provide them with the information they request.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000062"></a>As for the aim of Amendment 51 to allow principal authorities to seek and promote information relating to the democratic arrangements of any body operating in their area, as we have heard many times today, it is in their discretion to do this, and they can do so without the Amendment 51. The noble Lord will not be surprised to hear me say that. What Amendment 51 would do, however, is to give principal authorities the power to add to the list of connected authorities any public body, which is not defined, and so could include an organisation in the voluntary sector, as long as it receives public funding.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000063"></a>That means that the scope of the duty to promote democracy could go beyond what the Bill is intended to cover. Each principal authority could then claim that it has a statutory duty to ask any public service provider that it chooses to supply information on how citizens can participate democratically in their decision-making, even where they are not meant to be set up to facilitate such democratic input.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000064"></a>For example, organisations such as inspectorates provide a valuable public service, but to be independent in their assessment means that their decisions are not open to public influence. There will also be voluntary organisations which, although they are in receipt of public funding, are run by a group of volunteer trustees not necessarily elected from the local area.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000065"></a>The noble Lord is right to suggest that lottery funding contributes significantly to some bodies providing publicly funded services. However, in the context of the Bill, it is unclear why receiving public funding should mean that a body should then be susceptible to a local authority requiring it to provide information on its democratic arrangements.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90121-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000066"></a>The Bill&#146;s aim is to set out public bodies which have a clear remit in facilitating democratic participation in their decision-making and ensure that they share that information with the relevant local authority for it to promote to local people. It is not its aim, however, to include those without such a remit. Without a clear rationale for what bodies other than those listed in the Bill should also be included as connected authorities, there is a real risk that many public and voluntary bodies could end up being required to provide information on arrangements which are not part of their remit. Therefore, we cannot support the amendment.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said that our case is that lots of local authorities are doing this already. With regard to the reference in Chapter 1 to the duty to promote public understanding, we are not particularly making that case. Some authorities may do it very well and most will do it to some extent, but what is proposed in the Bill is quite new for most local authorities. That is why we are keen that it should be done as well as possible. It should not be overly onerous&#151;an issue we might have to raise another time&#151;and it should provide useful information to people, not useless information. That is the basis of what we are saying. We are in favour of the fundamental principle behind Chapter 1, but we are against these five pages of detailed prescription. We do not think local authorities are doing this already.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000069"></a>The noble Lord also talked about diversity of approach and best practice. He said that we have to ensure that best practice covers the whole country. The problem is that if central government ties down local authorities and councils to the degree they always want to, you never find out what best practice is because everyone is doing something the same way&#151;the way the Government think is best practice at the time they impose all this detailed regulation. The only way you can find out what is best practice is by allowing what the noble Lord described as a diversity of approach across the country. We are in favour of local democracy and the diversity of approach that it brings, along with the understanding that some councils will do things well and some less well. That is a matter of local democracy which cannot be avoided, but it also produces best practice in some areas. There might be different best practices, a best practice here and a best practice there, and both may be good&#151;the rest of the country could

The Government approach, however, is a top-down Stalinist system where everyone ends up with something that is probably fairly good but lacks vision and diversity, and never moves on. That is our view.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000070"></a>I accept that the amendment is at the slightly extreme end of the spectrum of what I am trying to say, but for goodness&#146; sake tell councils what you want them to do and let them get on with it. Stop trying to tie them down in detailed rules and regulations. And, yes, if an elected council believes that some local organisations should be put under the duties set out in the Bill, that should be their right; they know their situation and they know which local organisations need to be on the list. I do see what is wrong with that. Equally, they will look at this list and say, &#147;Some of these organisations do not apply here, and therefore we are not going to do it&#148;.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000071"></a>It may be that this argument can be pursued better under the scrutiny sections. I do not know; we will look at that. For the time being, I am disappointed in the Government&#146;s response, although not terribly surprised. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000073"></a>Reference has been made to the whims of councils. I sometimes talk about the whims of Secretaries of State whose decisions often seem to become erratic over time. That is not because they change their mind but because Secretaries of State change so often. Who knows, we may have a change of government before too long. I say &#147;may&#148; because personally I would not count on it. People ought to understand that Secretaries of State change. We say that if an organisation is valid and the list is valid, the organisation should not be removed, and that the Secretary of State should be able to remove organisations only if they cease to exist. If the Government want to remove an organisation, they should legislate for that. The Bill says that the Secretary of State can change functions. We argue that he should be able to do so only if the functions of the authority change, and in order to introduce more functions. This seems fairly straightforward. We are trying to give local authorities more power and the

I beg to move.</p>

I am anxious to support the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, as regards a change of government. This amendment is very similar to several that Conservative Members of the Committee moved right at the beginning of the Committee Stage. We feel that this legislation gives too many powers to the Secretary of State. We therefore endorse this amendment, which seeks to curtail those powers. I would still advocate limiting the powers of Secretaries of State in this regard even if a change of government occurred. I agree with the noble Lord that successive Secretaries of State within the same Government can adopt different attitudes. Local authorities should decide this matter rather than the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000075"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09012193000201"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> Amendments 54 and 55 clearly seek to limit the Secretary of State&#146;s&#151;or, in the case of Wales, Welsh Ministers&#146;&#151;order-making power in Clause 2, which allows government to amend the list of authorities that are considered connected authorities for the purposes of the duties to promote democracy.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000076"></a>The purpose of the list at Clause 2 is to ensure that councils are clear on the minimum list of connected authorities about which we want citizens to be provided with information. We want citizens to be informed about the key decision-making bodies in their area, how they can influence them and how they can get involved in helping to make important local decisions. The order-making power included in Clause 2 allows the Secretary of State to keep the list up to date and relevant. We believe that this is a balanced and sensible approach. Similar order-making powers can be found in other legislation and the power builds in an important flexibility in relation to the duties related to the promotion of democracy. The power gives the Secretary of State the flexibility to add new connected authorities or remove them where principal local authorities no longer think a connected authority is relevant to them.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000077"></a>To some extent I understand the noble Lord&#146;s concern that the Secretary of State should not be able to remove bodies from the list willy-nilly, perhaps as a result of one of the bodies lobbying the Government because it is not happy with the effort involved in providing information. I appreciate the concern, but that is exactly why we have built into Clause 2 a requirement that any change to the list is consulted on with the local government sector and other relevant bodies; councils&#146; views on the matter will be clearly sought and listened to and changes will not be made in the face of obvious opposition from local government. In addition, any proposed change to the list of connected authorities will also be subject to the negative procedure. It will be scrutinised by Parliament, and noble Lords will be able to raise objections and have them debated in the House. In any event, as a matter of law the Secretary of State must act reasonably, and so would have to have a reasonable justification for any change.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000078"></a>My main concern is that the amendment fails to recognise that there may be circumstances where removing a body would be perfectly legitimate. For example, local government itself might decide that a body is not relevant to the community and that it is actually burdensome on the council to have to continue collecting information that is no longer useful to local people. We also make the more technical point that if an authority ceases to exist in statute, references will be removed consequentially from the legislation, so the order-making process will not need to be used for this purpose.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000079"></a>Amendment 55 seeks to amend Clause 2(6)(c). Let me explain what this paragraph does. The background to the wording is that one of the activities we have included in the list of connected authorities, the National Offender Management Service, is a function that is carried out by an agency of the Secretary of State rather than by a separate connected authority. This is brought in by reference to the functions of the Secretary of State under the Offender Management Act 2007, as set out in Clause 2(2)(c). Clause 2(6)(c) simply gives the Secretary of State the same power to add or remove activities from the list as she has in relation to other connected authorities. In this case, however, instead of adding or removing persons, the Secretary of State is able to add or remove her own functions. The legislation enables changes in the functions of the Secretary of State or for local circumstances to be taken into account, ensuring that information remains relevant and up to date. The amendment seeks to limit this power so that it can be used only if the functions of the Secretary of State change, but it ought to include the functions carried out by the authority in the local area.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000080"></a>The aim here is the same as in the previous amendment&#151;to limit the occasions on which functions can be added or removed from the list. Again, we think that this amendment would limit the legislation unnecessarily. Clause 2(6)(c) is needed so that should changes in circumstances in the future make it desirable to add additional functions to the Secretary of State, it could be done. We may want to add functions that are not new and which were not previously considered relevant to this duty, or to remove functions that no longer seem to be relevant to it. The amendment would not allow us to do either. Our intention is to ensure that the information remains as relevant to the local community as possible and that any such change is also subject to the requirement of consultation and, as I said earlier, to the parliamentary process to be undergone before the change can be made. Of course, the legal requirement to act reasonably also applies. With those assurances, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I hope that he understood it when he read it out. I shall have to wait until it is in print and take it to bed with me and try to understand it. What a happy life I lead. As I listened to the explanation,

Otherwise I do not think that any of us would have realised the thinking behind these provisions. We hope to understand it all at some point.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000082"></a>On the main point, which relates to the first amendment in the group, I repeat the basic argument. The noble Lord said that there is no problem in setting up a huge, convoluted, bureaucratic, time-wasting, money-spending system for one connected authority or one local authority because it will be done only if local government decides that it is a good thing to do.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000083"></a>That was the implication of what he said. It will not be done because the organisations do not like it, or whatever. It will really be done only if local government wants those changes. If local governments want those changes, let us accept my amendment and let them do it. It will be done without all this convoluted bureaucratic system of consulting everyone in the world, going round in circles, producing a parliamentary order and everything that that involves&#151;all the people who you have to employ to do it and all the cost.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000084"></a>This is a wider question: the present system of government in this country is crackers. I blame computers, because they make it possible. The whole thing takes far too much time, far too much bureaucracy and far too much organisation, and far too many people are employed to do it. One hopes when the economy gets better that they can be doing useful jobs. I despair about the whole thing. In that sense of despair, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment 54.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000086"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09012193000203"></a>Lord Tope:</b> We have given notice that we feel that Clause 3 should not stand part of the Bill. We have spent much of today discussing what should or should not be on the list and what should or should not be included. We feel that independent monitoring boards, visiting committees and court boards are going too far from the roles and functions of local authorities and local governance and really have no part in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000087"></a>As with every part of the public sector, it would certainly be better if the public were better informed and had a better understanding of its role and function, to the extent that it is possible; and if they were more involved in what it is doing, to the extent that it is possible. That is not what local authorities should be there to do. In some ways, it is even misleading to

Local authorities are not usually in a position to be able to answer questions that will arise in relation to those bodies. For those reasons, this clause should not be part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000088"></a>I feel a little differently about youth offending teams, not least because in another life I am an executive councillor for community safety and I have political responsibility for a youth offending team in my local authority area. I simply do not understand why the work of the YOT would not be covered more than adequately by the earlier parts of the Bill and therefore why it needs to be in this clause. So for rather different reasons, I include that in our wish to remove the clause. Amendments 63 and 67 are consequential on Clause 3 not being part of the Bill. For as long as it remains part of the Bill, obviously they will not be moved.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000089"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09012193000204"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I support the noble Lord, Lord Tope, in his opposition to Clause 3 standing part of the Bill. I had not added my name to his on the Marshalled List, as I had hoped that my earlier amendment, which altered the duty on local authorities to promote understanding of the functions of these bodies, might have been seen as a kind of halfway house. However, I was denounced from the government Benches as being destructive. We on these Benches have never been opposed to the spread of information about services, but we do oppose the imposition of a duty on local authorities to promote such information.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000090"></a>That duty becomes even harder to justify when the services in question have only a tenuous link to the functions of the local authorities. I am interested in understanding today the similarities between the three bodies listed in the clause, other than the obvious one that they relate to criminal justice. What is the reason for including these bodies, and what is the link between them and the local authority? Is it a link of control, authority or finances? Why should local authorities promote these organisations or their democratic arrangements?</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000091"></a>The purpose of the Bill is to promote involvement. How far is public involvement allowed in each of these three bodies? How far can members of the local community get involved in them? Is the extent similar for all three bodies? Again, to return to the very basic point that I made earlier today, does the Minister accept that taking responsibility from individual organisations that rely on public involvement to demonstrate transparency and giving it to local authorities is disempowering local communities? The best way to empower local communities and get them involved is to ensure that there is a direct link between them and the organisation in which they seek to get involved, rather than having a third organisation, such as a local authority, on whom a statutory duty is imposed to promote that organisation&#146;s role.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000093"></a>I shall explain why the clauses are there as they are. I take the point about the amendments, too, and will address them in what I am going to say. In Clause 3, we seek to require local authorities to promote an understanding of what people in these roles do, how a person can be a member of these bodies or take part in them, and what is involved in doing so. The noble Lord said that he did not think that local authorities should do that in respect of these bodies, and he asked why the youth offending teams were not included. The three bodies identified in the clause all have lay civic roles, so there is a distinction between them and the youth offending teams. We can talk about those teams outside the Committee if he is concerned about that.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000094"></a>It is very important to distinguish between the two types of duties that we are discussing. The duties in Chapter 1 are aimed at citizens&#146; understanding of two things: first, the democratic arrangements of those public bodies&#151;the governance and decision-making arrangements&#151;which we discussed yesterday and which are covered in Clauses 1 and 2, and, secondly, the civic opportunities for citizens to play a role as a lay person on a range of public bodies, which are covered separately in Clauses 3 and 4. I want to be clear that we are looking not for information about democratic arrangements, but for participation.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000095"></a>Why have we included these bodies? Quite simply, they are important local bodies. What they do has an impact on the local community. We are dealing with independent monitoring boards, which help to monitor the day-to-day life in local prisons or removal centres and ensure that proper standards of care and decency are maintained; and with courts bodies, which make recommendations to improve the administrative services provided by the courts. We want the public to be aware that they can serve as magistrates or IMB members. There are an important number of lay roles that can be filled by people from the local community. There are quasi-judicial or inspectorate roles or roles that relate to the administration of justice.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000096"></a>It is the same challenge again: to ensure that a more diverse range of people put themselves forward for these significant posts. These are the people who ensure that prisons and immigration centres are properly run. The posts are created to give people from the local community an input to reflect local values. If we mean to do this, surely we should get people on to these bodies who reflect the full range of the local community: young and old, a wider range of ethnic and faith groups, disabled people and so on.</p>

In 2007, there was a clustered recruitment programme to assist recruitment to independent monitoring boards&#151;in particular, those that had experienced difficulties in attracting new, or a sufficiently diverse mix of, applicants. They have a network of IMB members who go out to talk to local communities, professional groups and local colleges, but the different bodies have been doing that separately. The reason for local authorities to get involved is to help those bodies, not to supplant them or reduce their presence. It is to broaden their opportunities to reach a wider group of people as well, in addition to what they do. It is supporting them. Local authorities are in the Bill because our discussions with the relevant bodies showed that that is what they want.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000100"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09012193000208"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> Will the Minister explain the ways in which the local authority could go further? Some of these cluster recruitments have involved people going out, speaking in the community, holding public meetings, putting out information and literature and running mentoring and pilot schemes. How would the local authority go further than that? If that has not worked, how will the local authority&#146;s arrangements work?</p>

<p><a name="09012193000101"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0006.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09012193000209"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> That is a good question. We are not imposing these requirements on the public bodies. In our dialogues, their representatives have invited the local authorities to assist them in this process. They welcome this approach as another way in which more people will know about what is possible, how they can be involved and how to take up these roles; it will promote more joint working and joint information. How the local authorities do that will be up to them, but a single point of information and contact could well alert people who are really interested in these sorts of bodies, and for whom an involvement in them would be a natural extension to what they are interested in&#151;those who are working with victim support, for example, or who are doing other things in the community&#151;to how they can be connected to local organisations. Is the noble Baroness saying that that is not worth doing, I wonder?</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000102"></a>Such is the narrow spectrum of the community from which these roles are normally drawn that anything we can do will be positive and helpful. The more effectively that we can promote opportunities, which we can do in different ways, the more likely we are to ensure that local people are informed and come forward. We can take a step forward and ensure that the roles represent the communities. Local authorities support our proposals to promote the possibility of taking part and becoming involved and to reach out to communities in different ways, particularly those that are currently underrepresented. Making the links between the different initiatives that aim to encourage people to take on civic roles is admirable and necessary.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000103"></a>With regard to the clauses, we have tried to move the barrier and act with a light touch, whereas the effect of Amendment 63, for example, would be that the council would be required to promote understanding of these bodies, whether or not the information supplied by the bodies had relevance to what we have just said. The suggestion is that councils should promote the  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC154"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relevant roles without needing to bother the bodies concerned. We think that the way to make sure that the information is as accurate, relevant and useful as possible is to ensure that they work together.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000104"></a>Amendment 67 would remove monitoring boards, courts boards and youth offending teams from being subject to the order-making power, but as I argued earlier, the provision is provided simply for the contingency&#151;we do not expect this to be the case&#151;that for some reason there is a lack of co-operation. Again, this is very much a power of last resort.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000105"></a>I hope that my explanation has reassured the noble Lord that we have not just invented yet more work for local authorities in the area of civil responsibility where it is not needed. These bodies have a particular role to play in the community and for their own reasons want to be more diverse in their representation. This is simply a way for local authorities to assist them.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000106"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09012193000210"></a>Lord Tope:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her explanation, although I do not think that we have yet covered my point about youth offending teams. My question is why they are included here, rather than being covered earlier. As someone responsible politically for youth offending teams, of course I have a deep interest in the intentions of the Bill. Perhaps the Minister would like to come back to me on that point.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000107"></a>I think I did make it clear that Amendments 63 and 67 were consequential on Clause 3 leaving the Bill. Obviously that is not going to happen today. I hope that nothing I have said suggests that the work of these boards is not important, because it is. There should be much greater public understanding, and to the extent that it is possible, public involvement in this work. I am all for that. If local authorities working in co-operative arrangements with these bodies can help with the promotion of those aims, of course that is a good thing and no one would stand in the way. Our concern is that the Bill does not just say that it is a good thing, it makes it a duty&#151;a requirement regardless of circumstances and the local situation. That is our worry about this clause and why we think it should not be in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000108"></a>Listening to the Minister has actually raised a personal concern. It occurs to me that I have two prisons closer to me than my own local civic offices.</p>

At the risk of reopening a debate we had a while ago, they are not in my local authority area and I have no idea, to be frank, what the independent monitoring board does. Indeed, my own local authority is not going to tell me, because although the prison is only half a mile up the road, it is over the county boundary, not just the local authority boundary, so I shall remain in ignorance. However, perhaps we should not reopen an earlier debate. It is a point that my noble friend Lord Greaves missed, but no doubt he will correct it at the Report stage.</p>

Let me put on the record, however, that we recognise that lay justices play an enormously valuable and important role and that they are very much part of a local community. They are drawn from the local community and for a very long time there has been a pressing need to make them much more representative of local communities than is normally the case. I certainly accept enthusiastically any activity that a local authority can undertake to help to promote these issues.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000112"></a>I have no problems with any of that, and I do not need to be told how important it is. Again, however, it should not be the duty of a local authority to do it. If the Government feel the need to legislate in this area, let them do so. Otherwise it is the duty of the magistrates&#146; authorities, not the local authorities, to promote these issues.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000113"></a>I do not want to exaggerate this, but I see some dangers in a local authority doing that, given the interrelationship between local magistrates and local authorities. A great deal of a local authority&#146;s work&#151;it is not often very much publicised, unless something goes very wrong&#151;is with and in relation to magistrates&#146; courts. There might be some cause for concern if a local authority has a duty to be promoting and trying to get people engaged as local magistrates at the same time as it has to use those magistrates&#146; courts for its proper business. I do not want to exaggerate that or suggest that it is a major problem, but it is a small issue.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000114"></a>Amendment 62, which clearly would not apply if I were successful in removing this clause, says that if the clause is to remain part of the Bill, the duty of the local authority in this respect should be limited to those functions of a public nature that are actually related to the work of the local authority. In other words, it is not the whole wide-ranging role of a magistrate in the criminal justice system, but that which particularly relates to the local authority. It is a limiting amendment on the powers of Clause 4, should it remain in the Bill. Amendment 64 is consequential on Clause 4 not remaining in the Bill and, as today the clause is likely to stand part, I shall not move Amendment 64 when we get to it.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000115"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09012193000215"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> I have some sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Tope, said. I recall that in the past there has been too much connection between magistrates&#146;  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC156"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>courts, the appointment of lay justices and party politics in local government. That was not just about the appointment of someone rather than another person because of his political label, but sometimes there was the rather more subtle point that because there are already too many Conservatives, we had better have some Labour people appointed as magistrates. It was often said that that kind of balance was necessary, whereas to my mind I am not sure why membership or activity in a political party should necessarily have anything to do with the qualities of someone who should be a magistrate.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000116"></a>Points which are relevant here were also mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, on the previous amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, takes the same view&#151;that there are a number of bodies, in particular the Ministry of Justice, seeking magistrates. It is their job and the job of local magistrates&#146; organisations, rather than that of local government. I do not really mind the addition of local government having this responsibility if it brings into the picture a number of people, especially from more diverse backgrounds, who might not otherwise be brought into the picture of lay magistrates.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000117"></a>If that is so, and if that is part of the Government&#146;s answer to this amendment, I have one question for the Ministers: if it is desirable that local authorities should have this Clause 4 duty in relation to lay justices, why do we omit administrative tribunals? Good heavens; there are employment tribunals and national insurance tribunals. Tribunals were reorganised by the Government only a couple of years ago in statute. There is a great need&#151;for diversity as well as for the quality and merits point&#151;to have people to serve on such bodies. No doubt the Ministry of Justice takes a major role in that. If you are going to say that one bit of the judiciary, lay magistrates, should be an obligation of principal local authorities to promote, what about tribunals?</p>

<p><a name="09012193000118"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09012193000216"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I add my support to the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Tope. Amendment 62, as I read it, has two elements. The first is that, if the clause is to remain in the Bill, there must be a limit to the extent of information made available. The second is that there must be some connection to the local authority. Although the amendment is especially pertinent to the clause, which deals with lay justices and therefore may touch on information of a sensitive nature, the caveats expressed in the wording could equally be applied to all the other bodies for which the local authority will assume a duty.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000119"></a>There must be no accidental publication of sensitive information as a result of the duty in this part that would otherwise not be available in the public realm. I hope that that goes without saying; but I do not yet accept the Government&#146;s idea that any local authority should have a duty to promote understanding of things not connected to it&#151;in this case, lay justices. Not only does that place a burden on the local authority, it creates a relationship that may not be appreciated by those who have been compelled to become involved. In this instance, I am thinking of magistrates&#146; organisations, such as Magistrates in the Community,

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000120"></a>As I said earlier, if the local authority is merely to publish that on a website, how does that go any further than the local magistrates&#146; association publishing it on its website? I am also concerned about whether the people who will be visiting the local authority website may be the people who already sit on many local authority organisations. I am concerned that we may end up with a local area with the usual suspects on everything.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000121"></a>Once again, I fear that the Bill creates the risk of overlap and duplication and the risk of sensitive information ending up where it should not. I hope that the Minister will be able to assuage those fears and provide justification for the inclusion of Clause 4.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000122"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09012193000217"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I shall try not to repeat anything that I said in our previous debate, although many of the same issues have arisen. I shall try to allay some of the fears that have been raised in relation to the magistracy.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000123"></a>In Clause 4, we are trying to require local authorities to promote understanding of what people in the role of lay justice do, how a person can become a lay justice or magistrate and what is involved in doing so. We are concerned only with promoting the civic governance roles listed in Clauses 3 and 4. I say to my noble friend Lord Borrie that it is very important that we make a distinction. Local authorities are not recruiting magistrates; they are simply promoting the role and opportunities for people to put themselves forward to become magistrates if they so choose. I leave to stand all the arguments that I deployed on the previous debate about how that was seen as useful by the bodies representing magistrates. I take the point raised by the noble Lord; I will read carefully what he said about some of those relationships.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000124"></a>Amendment 62 is about ensuring that the information provided about lay justices is appropriate for dissemination&#151;that it is relevant to the local area. The noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, took up the same point. Of course we want that to be the case. We will be setting out in guidance that we do not expect anything more than the general role of a lay justice&#151;what they do and how to become one&#151;to be disseminated. The clause does that. The amendment is intended to ensure that the functions of a lay justice are explained by a council only where the functions are of a public nature connected with the principal local authority. As the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, said, that is intended to address the concern that judicial case-specific functions, which would not be appropriate to be explained publicly, should not be included in the duty. We agree.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000125"></a>As I said, the clauses distinguish between public bodies that are meant to reach out to citizens and involve them and others, such as inspectorates or lay justices, who should make decisions independent of public preference. That is one reason why Clauses 3 and 4 differ from Clauses 1 and 2. That is why they focus on promoting information about specific civic roles.</p>

I have made that distinction now in several ways.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000128"></a>Lay magistrates are included in Clause 4, as I said. We are not interested in the democratic arrangements here; we are interested only in what the role entails and in how people can become a lay justice. The amendment could limit the information about what magistrates do to the point where the public could not gain the information that they need. We have consulted closely with the Ministry of Justice on this, and it is content that the clause does not require councils to go beyond what can be acceptably publicised.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000129"></a>My noble friend makes an important point about administrative tribunals, which I will take away and think about. My concern is that there is quite a variety of tribunal arrangements in the local community. We should bear in mind that the requirements must be proportionate. Incidentally, I was very pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, say that this role was new and to have his implied support. We must get the balance right between a reasonable expectation on local authorities and a change in the culture to make it more open.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000130"></a>Finally, Amendment 64 would do much the same as Amendment 63, so I will not discuss it because it is taken care of by the debate on Amendment 63.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000131"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09012193000220"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I may be confused by the terminology and do not understand the meaning of words as they are being used, which often happens to me in this place. Will the Minister explain the civic governance role of a magistrate?</p>

<p><a name="09012193000132"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09012193000221"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I may need to go back a step and reiterate what I said. In Clauses 1 and 2, we are concerned that people know about the governance arrangements of these bodies. In Clauses 3 and 4, we are concerned to ensure that people have information about how they can get involved and how they can become a magistrate. Therefore, the question of the civic governance role of the magistrate does not arise. I hope that I am making that distinction clear and that the noble Lord can see what we are trying to get at in these clauses.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000133"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09012193000222"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Now I am totally confused, but that might be my fault; it is getting late and my brain is getting fuddled. I distinctly heard the Minister in her reply to my noble friend refer positively several times to the civic governance role. All I can do is read <I>Hansard</I> and try to understand it there, and perhaps have some discussions about it.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000134"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09012193000223"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> To take that point further, my question moments earlier was what duty is being placed here&#151;the duty to give information or the duty  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC159"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to promote involvement? I will have to look at this in <I>Hansard</I>, but my distinct understanding was that the Minister said that it was not a duty to promote involvement, whereas her answer just now to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, was, I think, that it is. I would like clarification of the duty in the clause.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000135"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09012193000224"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> The noble Baroness is quite right to pick me up on that. My language was loose. I will say what I said in the previous debate and at the beginning of this debate. There are two specific duties. In Clauses 1 and 2, we propose that people need to understand the democratic arrangements of public bodies so that they know how things work, how decisions are taken, how they can influence what happens, and how they can stand for the council. Clauses 3 and 4 focus on civic opportunities in which citizens can play a role as lay people. Therefore, this is not about governance arrangements; it is about the way in which they can get involved. The noble Baroness is right to pick me up on that. I hope that that is clear, and that the record will show that.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000136"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09012193000225"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I thank the Minister for that clarification. In the light of it, I go back to the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. If there is a duty to promote involvement, surely that duty falls on magistrates and the Magistrates&#146; Association. If we take that duty away by placing it on local authorities, we take away a very important function that lay magistrates should, and do, perform in courts up and down the country.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000137"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="09012193000226"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I have sent a reply to this point about four times. We are not taking anything away from the constituent bodies that we are addressing in relation either to this clause or to the connected authorities. They have this responsibility. All we are saying is that Clause 3 offers a new opportunity for the local authority to help to,</p>
<ul><a name="09012193000166"></a>&#147;promote understanding of ... the functions of the bodies ... how a member of the public can become a member of, or take part in, the work of those bodies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012193000152"></a>Nothing is being taken away from the responsibility of further education colleges, magistrates&#146; bodies or any other body. This is an addition. It will support, and we hope incentivise, those bodies which do not perform this function very well.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000138"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="09012193000227"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I also thank the Minister for that reply. I understand that this measure is not taking away the duty; it is belt and braces. It is &#147;in addition to&#148;. But if that is the case, I return to my earlier question: what will the local authority do that is not being done, and how will it do it better? What is the practical outcome of this duty? If there is no practical outcome and it will be merely a line on the local authority&#146;s website, why are we placing this duty on it?</p>

<p><a name="09012193000139"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="09012193000228"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I can give the noble Baroness some general argument and a specific example of the sort of things we would like to see. When the local authority takes it upon itself to act as a single point of contact, it will be able to bring together information  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC160"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column GC160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about a wide variety of roles. That will bring people into contact not just with the thing that they are interested in or know about but with a large number of related opportunities that they may not know about. That is added value. Many people will go to a local authority website first rather than try to seek out individual organisations and their information points. It will be much easier for them to be rerouted via a local authority single point in relation to myriad opportunities that may be more or less obscured by other things.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000140"></a>Bristol has used such an opportunity in relation to its Operation Black Vote. This scheme involved people from the Bristol black and minority ethnic community shadowing local councillors. The aim was to encourage these people to stand as councillors. It became a very well regarded scheme. Some participants felt that they could take a role in local politics but others went on to take up other civic roles, such as school governors or magistrates. Because the information that was put in front of them in one place was brought together and opportunities were pointed out, they were signposted towards other opportunities. It was not a failure of the scheme that they did not stand as councillors; it was a bonus of the scheme that they wanted to serve in the community in a civic role that suited them. They might well not have found out how to do that had the scheme not been in place. That illustrates that people who want to get involved often find out about other things that suit them and other matters that interest them, which they might not have come across had the relevant information not been brought together at a central point. I hope the noble Baroness does not feel that she has to labour this point because the obverse is to say that there is no point in giving anyone information. As she well knows, we simply do not have enough young, diverse, representative people in these crucial roles, particularly as regards the criminal justice system. I hope that she welcomes what we are trying to do.</p>

<p><a name="09012193000141"></a><b><a name="90121-gc0007.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="09012193000229"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I am sorry if the Minister thinks that I am labouring this point. I am aware of the Operation Black Vote scheme in Bristol. It was an extremely successful programme, but, with all due respect, the people who then went on to get involved in other civic opportunities did so because they were involved in the scheme on a one-to-one basis, including a mentoring scheme that was detailed and organised over a period of time. It was not a simple signposting exercise by the local authority, which is what I think is being proposed in the Bill.</p>

I think I understand the purpose of the clause; what I do not understand is why we have it, and why this process is being made a duty. All the things we have talked about are good and desirable, and if a local authority, in co-operation with a magistrates&#146; authority, is able to help, that is all to the good. I took

I spent many hours with people of all ages, including one who attended the whole of one of my councillor&#146;s surgeries. Indeed, one or two of them went on to become school governors&#151;non-aligned, not as part of any political process. All that is good, and it happened without the direct involvement of the local authority.</p>

<a name="90121-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09012193000144"></a>I come back to this point: we wish the clause to be omitted from the Bill because the duty rests with the magistrates authorities. Of course the local authorities could and should assist where that is appropriate. I know the duty is not being taken away from the magistrates authorities&#151;I never thought it was&#151;but we need to be clear about that. I still do not know why this is included in the Bill as a duty on the local authority.</p>

We want to encourage people to be lay justices; we want them to serve on tribunals; I would like to see a lot more independent custody visitors; we are always short of appropriate adults&#151;I could go on.

<a name="09012170000004"></a><b><a name="90121-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09012170000250"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Darzi of Denham):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09012170000005"></a>Lord Darzi&#146;s review of the NHS, <I>High Quality Care for All</I>, concluded that there was a case for a constitution to enshrine the principles and values of the NHS in England. A draft constitution based on extensive evidence and research with public, patients and staff was published for consultation on 30 June 2008. The consultation process was led by strategic health authorities and overseen by a group of experts on the Constitutional Advisory Forum. Consultation events for patients, the public and staff were held in each primary care trust and the outcomes fed back to the strategic health authorities and then the Constitutional Advisory Forum. The department also received over 1,000 direct responses to the consultation, which closed on 17 October 2008.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09012170000006"></a>The NHS values, which form part of the constitution, were developed separately and were the subject of extensive engagement with staff, patients and the public.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09012170000007"></a>The Constitutional Advisory Forum published its report on 11 December, emphasising that the response to the consultation had been overwhelmingly positive, with a broad consensus in favour of an NHS Constitution. They made a series of recommendations on how to improve the document and on how to embed it in the NHS. The department has responded to these recommendations and to the responses to the consultation in the government response, published today and placed in the Library.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09012170000008"></a>The final NHS Constitution for England, which has been placed in the Library, is an enduring document that sets out the principles and values of the NHS and for the first time brings into one place NHS pledges and the rights and responsibilities of patients, the public and staff.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09012170000009"></a>As a result of the consultation, the NHS constitution contains a new right to receive the vaccinations  that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommends under an NHS-provided national immunisation programme. The new right to choice has also been extended to include a right to  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS168"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column WS168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>information to support that choice. This currently means that any person requiring an elective referral may choose any clinically appropriate secondary care provider for their first consultant-led outpatient appointment and has a right to information to support that choice.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09012170000010"></a>The new legal rights in the NHS constitution will be created through separate regulations and directions, which are due to come into force on 1 April. Regulations on the right to receive vaccinations have been laid today. Directions on the right to choice and draft directions underpinning the right to rational local decisions on drugs and other treatments have also been published today.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09012170000011"></a>The Health Bill, published on 16 January, provides for a legal duty on all NHS bodies and independent contractors providing NHS services to have regard to the NHS constitution in their decisions and actions. The Bill also requires the NHS constitution to be reviewed at least every 10 years following full consultation.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09012170000012"></a>Also published today are the handbook to the NHS Constitution and a statement of NHS Accountability, both of which have been placed in the Library. The handbook to the NHS Constitution is designed to give NHS staff and patients all the more detailed information they need. It explains what the rights, pledges and responsibilities mean, and explains what to do if rights are not met or pledges are not upheld. It also explains the legal basis of each right.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09012170000013"></a>The consultation on the NHS Constitution asked whether the Government should produce a statement of NHS accountability. The response was highly positive. The statement of NHS accountability is a public-facing document, which describes the system of responsibility and accountability for taking decisions in the NHS and provides a summary of the structure and functions of the NHS in England. The NHS Constitution commits the Government always to make available an up-to-date statement of accountability in the future.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09012170000014"></a>An impact assessment on the NHS Constitution has also been published today and a copy placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09012170000016"></a>In the town of Omagh on 15 August 1998, a criminal terrorist group known as the Real IRA (RIRA) detonated a 500lb bomb in a car, after issuing warnings which were clearly misleading and resulted in compounding the number of deaths.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09012170000017"></a>To date, despite the efforts of then Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and now the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the Garda Siochana, only one person has been convicted on a charge of

This conviction was overturned on appeal in the Dublin Court of Criminal Appeal.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09012170000018"></a>The Government understand that because no one has yet been brought to justice for this heinous crime, the pain and grief continues to compound for those who suffered so much.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09012170000019"></a>The events around 15 August 1998 have rightly been the subject of media coverage and understandably continue to generate interest.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09012170000020"></a>On 15 September 2008, the BBC broadcast an edition of the &#147;Panorama&#148; programme, written and presented by John Ware, entitled &#147;Omagh: what the police were never told&#148;.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09012170000021"></a>John Ware had also written an article published in the Sunday Telegraph on 14 September alleging, inter alia, that at the relevant time, vital intercept evidence had not been passed promptly enough to the police and thereby might have prevented the bombing or subsequently assist the investigating officers to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09012170000022"></a>In view of the seriousness of the issues raised, the Prime Minister on 17 September asked Sir Peter Gibson, the Intelligence Services Commissioner, to review any intercepted intelligence material available to the security and intelligence agencies in relation to the Omagh bombing and how this intelligence was shared. In his review, Sir Peter examined the role of GCHQ in gathering and handling intercept intelligence at the material time. He also investigated what intercept was shared with the RUC.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09012170000023"></a>In preparing his report, Sir Peter drew on a range of highly sensitive and highly classified material made available to him by those agencies involved in the production of intercept intelligence.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09012170000024"></a>Some of this material is inevitably subject to legal constraints. Its publication would disclose information about how our security and intelligence agencies currently function and thereby compromise current operations aimed at ensuring the protection of our national security.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09012170000025"></a>None the less, the Government believe it is right and appropriate to publish as much of the findings of the review as possible.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09012170000026"></a>I have therefore placed in the Library of the House a copy of a document setting out in considerable detail Sir Peter&#146;s conclusions. It is also my intention today to make the full, classified report available to members of the Intelligence and Security Committee for their scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09012170000027"></a>At the time of the Omagh bombing, the action taken by GCHQ on any interception was governed by procedures agreed between GCHQ and the RUC Special Branch. Those procedures were documented in written guidance for the relevant GCHQ team. Specifically, intercepts relating to phone numbers designated by Special Branch as being highest priority were monitored live. GCHQ carried out the tasks it was asked to carry out by Special Branch.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09012170000028"></a>Throughout 1998, including on 15 August, GCHQ ensured that intelligence from any interception which might have been relevant to those operations being conducted by Special Branch was made promptly available to it. This included near real-time provision

This was in accordance with the pre-agreed criteria.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09012170000029"></a>Any formal intelligence reports were issued within hours of interception in broad accordance with procedures agreed between GCHQ and Special Branch.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09012170000030"></a>Sir Peter concludes he is satisfied that in the days surrounding 15 August, and on the day itself, to the extent that any relevant intelligence derived from interception existed, this was shared with the RUC HQ and Special Branch promptly and fully; and done so with the latter by procedures agreed with Special Branch South.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09012170000031"></a>He also concludes that there was nothing to suggest either a bomb attack was going to take place on 15 August or the town of Omagh was the target of any such bomb attack.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09012170000032"></a>Sir Peter found no evidence to support the allegations of the &#147;Panorama&#148; programme that, in the run-up to 15 August, the Garda had warned the police of a likely attack.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09012170000033"></a>Crucially, any intelligence derived from interception as might have existed would not have prevented the bombing.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09012170000034"></a>The programme also suggested that the cars involved in the bombing could have been tracked and their journey monitored on a screen.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09012170000035"></a>Sir Peter is also satisfied that in 1998, on the basis of evidence from an independent expert witness from a mobile communications provider, it was neither possible to track mobile phones in real time nor visualise the location and movement of mobile phones in the way shown in the &#147;Panorama&#148; programme.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09012170000036"></a>Assertions in the programme that live monitoring on the day would have shown what was going to happen are incorrect and unsupported by any evidence.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09012170000037"></a>It was also implied in the &#147;Panorama&#148; programme that GCHQ did not pass on intercepted intelligence to the RUC CID to help the inquiry. This is not supported by the facts.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09012170000038"></a>Further to this, there were arrangements in place at that time which allowed for the RUC Special Branch to make requests in respect of further dissemination of any GCHQ material. The records confirm that no such request was made.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09012170000039"></a>The handling of intelligence material by the then Special Branch and its relationship to other investigative arms of the police has been the subject of a number of previous reviews and reports. As the chief constable has indicated in a letter sent to me yesterday, a copy of which I have also placed in the Library of the House, in line with the recommendations made by the Police Ombudsman in her December 2001 report on the bombing, and the subsequent Crompton Report, serious and organised crime investigation, including terrorist crime investigation and the intelligence branch were grouped together within one department, Crime Operations, under a single assistant chief constable.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="09012170000040"></a>Special Branch no longer exists, having been replaced by a branch with service-wide responsibility for all intelligence from volume crime to the most serious crime.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="09012170000041"></a>A dissemination policy today determines how intelligence is shared for the purposes of a criminal investigation; early investigative expertise is sought in cases of serious crime; and the Police Service of Northern Ireland resources these areas to operate at the highest national standards in respect of handling intelligence and the investigation of serious and organised crime.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09012170000042"></a>The Government share with the British and Irish public the deep regret that those responsible have neither faced justice nor been punished for their wicked crimes. And while it remains right that the police and other agencies charged with protecting the public from terrorism are accountable for their conduct and subject to scrutiny, we must never forget the bomb was the deliberate work of the RIRA and we all have a continuing duty to do all we can to bring these criminals to justice.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="09012170000240"></a><b><a name="90121-wms0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09012170000253"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_233"></a><a name="09012170000241"></a>The Government have long-standing concern with the promotion of peace in Sri Lanka, where the conflict has claimed at least 70,000 lives during the past 26 years. We are now at an important moment.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_234"></a><a name="09012170000242"></a>Since its abrogation in January 2008 of the 2002 ceasefire agreement, the Sri Lankan Government have embarked on a policy of militarily defeating the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). In recent months, the Government have made significant military gains, including the capture of Kilinochchi, the former administrative centre of the LTTE in the north, and the capture of remaining rebel territory in the Jaffna Peninsula. These gains make progress on a political solution even more urgent. The LTTE is a proscribed terrorist organisation with no democratic mandate to represent the Tamil people. It is responsible for a terrorist campaign that has targeted innocent civilians across all communities in Sri Lanka over the past three decades.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_235"></a><a name="09012170000243"></a>Thousands of lives have been lost since the renewal of open hostilities in 2006. We recognise the Government of Sri Lanka&#146;s need to root out terrorism. It also has a responsibility to safeguard the rights of all its citizens and adequately to address their political concerns. Our consistent position remains that for peace to be sustainable, an inclusive political process that takes fully into account the legitimate concerns of all Sri Lankan communities&#151;Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim&#151;is essential. As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has said, we must see an end to the conflict and new drive for a lasting political solution. We continue to engage with all political parties across all communities in Sri Lanka to support progress in this direction.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_236"></a><a name="09012170000244"></a>We are deeply concerned by the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka and the growing number of internally displaced persons (IDPs). My right honourable friend the Prime Minister spoke about this issue with President Rajapakse when they met last September and we continue to raise our concern at senior levels. The UN estimates that 200,000 to 300,000 IDPs remain in the conflict area. Although there have been convoys providing basic humanitarian assistance, there are credible reports  


<notus-date day="21" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS174"></a><b>21 Jan 2009 : Column WS174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that these supplies are inadequate. The military gains by the Sri Lankan armed forces have resulted in these IDPs being squeezed into an ever-decreasing space. Further deterioration in the situation would mean acute humanitarian need and distress.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_237"></a><a name="09012170000245"></a>Following on from a Department for International Development (DfID) mission in September 2008, we will be sending a DfID humanitarian expert in the coming weeks to try to assess the situation and to report on the distribution of &#163;2.5 million in humanitarian funding that we have committed to assist IDPs in northern Sri Lanka. In co-ordination with international organisations on the ground, we have urged all parties to abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law, in particular the need to ensure the safety of civilians, to allow their free movement and to enhance access for humanitarian agencies to facilitate the delivery of adequate supplies of humanitarian aid. Safe passage for civilians wanting to escape the hostilities should be guaranteed by all parties and safe humanitarian space provided for them. We believe that a full independent assessment of the IDPs&#146; humanitarian needs is essential. Such an assessment would be a powerful demonstration that everything that can be done is being done to support these vulnerable people. We will continue to press on these matters.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_238"></a><a name="09012170000246"></a>Recent weeks have seen a considerable number of high profile attacks on media freedom in Sri Lanka. We condemn such brazen attacks. Of particular concern was the murder on 8 January of the chief editor of the <I>Sunday Leader</I> newspaper, Lasantha Wickrematunge. The Sri Lankan authorities have a duty to take prompt action to ensure a thorough and independent investigation is carried out. Those responsible must be held to account. The lack of progress in securing convictions for such cases indicates that urgent action is needed.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_239"></a><a name="09012170000247"></a>There continue to be reports of abductions, disappearances and acts of violence and intimidation in Sri Lanka. Without strong mechanisms for independent human rights reporting, it is difficult to assess the true scope of the problem. We consistently call upon the Government of Sri Lanka to take decisive action to tackle human rights abuses, including by taking action against those responsible for violations. Creating an environment in which people from all communities in Sri Lanka live without fear is essential to creating the conditions for a sustainable end to the conflict. The recent commitments by militias on release of child soldiers and disarmament following our lobbying are welcome steps that need to be followed through.</p>

<a name="90121-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_240"></a><a name="09012170000248"></a>My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has written to President Rajapakse to express our concerns.</p>

This assistance has helped the IDLG develop its strategic work plan, a draft sub-national governance policy, and supported infrastructure and staffing improvements. The UK has allocated up to $590,000 this financial year to help implement the Afghan Social Outreach Programme (ASOP) in Helmand. By supporting both the IDLG's broad mandate on sub-national governance and ASOP directly, the UK's objective is to help develop an acceptable and accountable local governance structure.</p>

An alternative or additional charge would be for causing criminal damage, the maximum sentence for which is 10 years&#146; imprisonment.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a><a name="09012172000026"></a>The NHS Constitution also commits the NHS to two pledges relating to informed choice. In the explanation for these pledges, the accompanying handbook makes the following statement about research.</p>

<a name="90121w0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_9"></a><a name="09012172000027"></a>Research is a core part of the NHS. Research enables the NHS to improve the current and future health of the people it serves. The NHS will do all it can to ensure that patients, from every part of England, are made aware of research that is of particular relevance to them. The NHS is therefore putting in place procedures to ensure that. patients are notified of opportunities to join in relevant ethically approved research and will be free to choose whether they wish to do so.</p>

<a name="90121w0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a><a name="09012172000028"></a>The procedures under development will not allow the NHS to disclose a person's confidential records to researchers without consent and are intended to inform patients about research so that they can choose whether to take part. The procedures will ensure that, when the NHS supports preparations to notify patients of opportunities to join in relevant ethically approved research, staff who use care records to select those patients are bound by a duty of confidentiality and use confidential information no more than necessary for the purpose. Special permission under Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006 is required before health service bodies may disclose a person's confidential records without consent to researchers not engaged in that person's care.</p>

In addition, MHRA included the issue in its December edition of the Drug Safety Update, with a further article in the January 2009 edition.
